4
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,291
Save me.

5
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,000
I am here to save you.

6
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,000
You know what?

7
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,583
Our meeting was destined.

8
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,333
Are you alright?

9
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,875
Save me.

10
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,000
Anyang.

11
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,291
Anyang.

12
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,375
Anyang.

13
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,208
Anyang.

14
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,250
Don't go.

15
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,166
Do you know what you are saying?

16
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,833
Yeah, I do.

17
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,833
It was you who saved me.

18
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,291
I am yours.

19
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,875
I thought there was

20
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,625
a connection
between Manqing and Gu Qingqing.

21
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,291
And then?

22
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,958
I saw the sign of Gu Qingqing in her.

23
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,625
I was overthinking it.

24
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,958
Gu Qingqing?

25
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,000
You still can't get over Gu Qingqing.

26
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,750
Come on.

27
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,583
You know it.

28
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,916
You are the only one I love.

29
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,083
Who knows if you are deceiving me?

30
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,125
After I pass the Xixing Project contract
to Gu Qiyan,

31
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,458
you can buy whatever you want.

32
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,166
Ji Anyang has signed the contract.

33
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,125
He will take over the Xixing Project.

34
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:07,041
Yes.

35
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,375
I'm sure she's Manqing,
Mr. Pei's assistant.

36
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,208
She...

37
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,375
I'll try to get close to her.

38
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:23,708
Hello.

39
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,875
I'll do it.

40
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,375
Miss Liu.

41
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,125
What a coincidence, Manqing.

42
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,000
Do you also like to drink coffee here?

43
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,250
Yes.

44
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,208
The coffee here is delicious.

45
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,958
The cinnamon rolls are also good.

46
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,125
You try them.

47
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:39,875
Sure.

48
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,625
Please get me that too.

49
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,291
Okay.

50
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,458
Sorry.

51
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:52,833
It's okay.

52
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,958
I have to go.

53
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,125
Manqing.

54
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,541
I heard from Anyang

55
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,708
you helped him get the Xixing Project.

56
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,500
Don't mention it.

57
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,041
Miss Liu.

58
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,416
See you.

59
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:11,833
See you.

60
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:20,958
Take off your makeup.

61
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,708
I'm going to see Ji Anyang later.

62
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:23,833
I have work to do.

63
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,583
I don't remember arranging any work.

64
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,666
I told you to take off your makeup.

65
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,208
You're not allowed to disobey me.

66
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,083
It's done.

67
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,583
About Mr. Lin's contract,

68
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,750
is the payment due next week?

69
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,625
I know Mr. Pei can't wait
to get rid of me.

70
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,250
We'll be done next week.
