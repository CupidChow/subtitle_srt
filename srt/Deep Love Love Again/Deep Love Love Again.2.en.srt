00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,708
We'll set up a trap
for your ex-husband Ji Anyang.

2
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,666
Try to do it better.

3
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:01,833
Girls.

4
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:02,666
Let's play ball.

00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,791
=Deep Love Love Again=

6
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:06,666
Pass the ball to me.

00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:12,064
=Episode 2=
(Manqing's First Appearance)

8
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:13,888
Are you blind?

9
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,000
Stop it!

10
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,875
Do you know who she is?

11
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,583
She is Mr. Pei's assistant.

12
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,375
Mr. Lin, she just spilled red wine
all over me.

13
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,333
It's not a big deal.

14
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:30,666
Mr. Pei.

15
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,541
I'm really sorry.

16
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,083
She didn't mean it.

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,333
I'll scold her.

18
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:44,625
You apologize.

19
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,208
Why? I got hit.

20
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:46,916
Apologize.

21
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,000
Apologize.

22
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:49,541
Apologize.

23
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:50,166
Apologize.

24
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:50,875
Apologize.

25
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:51,208
Do it.

26
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:51,750
Apologize.

27
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,041
Do it.

28
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:52,625
Apologize.

29
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:53,333
Apologize.

30
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,000
Apologize.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,833
Apologize right now.

32
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,166
Apologize.

33
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:56,875
Apologize.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,083
Apologize right now.

35
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:58,916
You apologize.

36
00:01:58,916 --> 00:01:59,291
Do it.

37
00:01:59,333 --> 00:01:59,791
Apologize.

38
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:00,416
Apologize.

39
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:00,958
Apologize.

40
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:01,500
Apologize.

41
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,375
Apologize.

42
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,625
Are you okay?

43
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,541
Let's go.

44
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:54,291
Thank you.

45
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:55,833
You're welcome.

46
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,666
You are Mr. Pei's special assistant?

47
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,416
Did you get hurt just now?

48
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,625
No, I didn't.

49
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,750
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

50
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:04,916
You know me?

51
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:05,958
Of course.

52
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,333
I know you're the manager
of the Guquan Group.

53
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,166
You were just bullied like that.

54
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,875
Why did Mr. Pei not help you?

55
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,708
Forget about him.

56
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,166
Thanks for your help.

57
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,916
So if there's anything you need from me,

58
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,041
just let me know.

59
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,166
Coincidentally,

60
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,625
I just so happen to need your help.

61
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,291
I'm particularly interested
in one of Mr. Lin's projects.

62
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,833
Mr. Lin is on good terms with Mr. Pei.

63
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,250
So...

64
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,291
Mr. Ji.

65
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,375
What are you doing here?

66
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,791
What are you saying to Manqing?

67
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:42,458
Nothing.

68
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,375
Mr. Lin.

69
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,708
Glad to see you.

70
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:46,583
Mr. Lin.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,125
I'm really sorry.

72
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,333
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

73
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:52,583
Iced water.

74
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,458
Look what's been done to you.

75
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,083
I'm fine.

76
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,666
Your hands are so cold.

77
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,291
You haven't got out of your wet clothes?

78
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,041
I'm about to go and change.

79
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,833
Manqing, where do you live?

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,416
I'm currently staying at a hotel.

81
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,083
Let me give you a ride.

82
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,250
No.

83
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,291
I'll give her a ride.

84
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:18,791
Wait a second.

85
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:19,833
I'll go get the car keys.

86
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,916
Are you willing to help me?

87
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,750
They just made fun of me.

88
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,958
And you were the only one
helping me out.

89
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:34,708
Alright.

90
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,916
I will be honest with you.

91
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,916
I'm interested
in Mr. Lin's Xixing Project.

92
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,458
If you can secure that project for me,

93
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,625
I'll give you ten percent of the profit.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,625
Okay.

95
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,500
I'll do my best.

96
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,041
Manqing.

97
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:55,833
Let's go.

98
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:06,958
I gotta go.

99
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,541
Mr. Pei.

100
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:28,541
Careful.

101
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,208
You don't want your hands?

102
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,666
Can you waive Mr. Lin's interest?

103
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,583
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,958
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

105
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,458
We agreed to set Ji Anyang up together.

106
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,750
I can't even touch her hand?

107
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:07,958
Are you angry?

108
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,875
You did something wrong,

109
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,125
so you should be punished.

110
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,208
We have a contract.

111
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,375
Don't sully yourself.

112
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,541
Your face should carry dignity.

113
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,083
Are you suggesting
that I should stay clean?

114
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,916
At such a critical time?

115
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,250
I gave you this face.

116
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,541
Don't use it to do something shameful.

117
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,291
What are you afraid of, Pei Jinqing?

118
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,291
When it's all over,
I'll give this face back to you.

119
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,750
Return it?

120
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,250
You can't afford to.

121
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,041
I'm surprised.

122
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,375
She pretends to be innocent in public

123
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,666
but so flirty in private.

124
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,333
Guess what?

125
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,500
Manqing

126
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,458
is in debt.

127
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,666
I guess

128
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,125
she couldn't pay it back,

129
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,333
so she became Pei Jinqing's canary.

130
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,625
I really do like people with flaws.

131
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,125
It's what you wanted.

132
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,583
This is what Ji Anyang saw?

133
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,166
Deepfakes?

134
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,583
Looks quite realistical.

135
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,708
What?

136
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,666
You didn't participate personally.

137
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,333
So you feel regretful?

138
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,291
You know that's not me in these photos.

139
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,916
That's not what I meant.

140
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,875
No matter what,
don't humiliate yourself.

141
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,750
Don't waste too much time on Ji Anyang.

142
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,333
My patience is limited.

143
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,708
It doesn't matter.

144
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,625
It's okay to be a living ghost.

145
00:10:22,304 --> 00:10:24,032

146
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:31,392
(Mr. Ji)

147
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:35,291
Hello?

148
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,458
Hello? Manqing.

149
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,166
Which hotel are you in?

150
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,083
I'll come to you.

151
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:40,541
Okay, Mr. Ji.

152
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,583
I'll send you the address.

153
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,458
Mr. Pei, please send me back.

154
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,583
I'm gonna do the last step.
