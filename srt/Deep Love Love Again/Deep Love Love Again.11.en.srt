00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:08,583
Mr. Pei.

2
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:09,208
Mr. Pei.

3
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:10,333
Mr. Pei.

4
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:10,958
Mr. Pei.

5
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:13,375
Mr. Pei.

6
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:24,458
We've found Manqing's phone

7
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,250
in the parking lot

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,541
next to Dongxing Avenue.

9
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,333
According to cameras,

10
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,791
Liu Yanyan took away Manqing.

11
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:31,791
We're tracking her.

12
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,041
Search the entire city

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,875
to find Liu Yanyan.

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:43,916
Yes.

15
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:10,048

(Nowhere to Go)

17
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,458
Miss Liu.

18
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,250
We can talk.

19
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:26,625
Cut the crap.

20
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,000
You think I'm dumb,

21
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:28,916
believing in you?

22
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,708
I don't care
whether you're Gu Qingqing or Manqing.

23
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,166
You must die, anyway.

24
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:34,750
Since I'm going to die,

25
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:36,833
I want to ask you a question.

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,291
Go ahead.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,208
About Gu Qingqing's death,

28
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,708
what exactly happened?

29
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,458
What happened?

30
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,833
Probably she deserved it.

31
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:50,708
What?

32
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,083
You think I killed her?

33
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,291
It wasn't you?

34
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,375
I have many ways

35
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,500
to kill foolish rich girls

36
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,666
like Gu Qingqing.

37
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,875
But she's not worth it.

38
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:02,125
What?

39
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,166
Don't tell me such a fool's life

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,125
or death matters to me.

41
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,666
What exactly are you going to do?

42
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:56,541
I'll go first.

43
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,291
Gather men to Qinglong Highway.

44
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,291
Tell Dr. Pang to prepare at home.

45
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,541
Gu Qingqing considered you a friend.

46
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,541
This is how you treat her?

47
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,708
Don't you feel sorry for her?

48
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:18,750
Friend?

49
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,375
Has she ever considered me a friend?

50
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,875
I don't think she has.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
When my parents sold me to someone else,

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,458
did she ever think of rescuing me?

53
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,500
What did she do?

54
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,291
She didn't do anything.

55
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,583
She discarded me

56
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,750
just like I'm her clothes.

57
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:40,708
I thought

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,833
Gu Qingqing's death

59
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,583
brought me good luck.

60
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,125
I had everything
that belonged to Gu Qingqing.

61
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,250
When I thought

62
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,500
my life was getting better,

63
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,875
my parents showed up.

64
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,083
It was you, right?

65
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,083
You told them where I was.

66
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,375
It was you.

67
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:07,708
Look.

68
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,250
Look what you've done.

69
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,083
So what do you want?

70
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:20,208
What?

71
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,166
Being Pei Jinqing's plaything

72
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,250
makes you feel superior?

73
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:28,250
What do I want?

74
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,333
I want you to get out of the Gu's.

75
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,083
Keep silent?

76
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:03,875
Fine.

77
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,375
We'll see.

78
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:37,708
Manqing.

79
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:38,958
Stop right there!

80
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:40,916
Take one more step,

81
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,166
and I will burn her.

82
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:43,791
Pei Jinqing.

83
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,250
There's gasoline.

84
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,875
You get out of here. Hurry!

85
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:47,500
Shut up!

86
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:51,875
Mr. Pei.

87
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,083
Long time no see.

88
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,250
Are you here to save your assistant?

89
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,625
She is mine.

90
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,375
Whoever hurts her will die.

91
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,583
Look how arrogant you are.

92
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:05,875
Want to save her?

93
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,041
Beg me.

94
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,000
Kneel and beg me.

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,666
I'll let her go.

96
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:14,750
Kneel.

97
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,000
Manqing.

98
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,083
When we arrived at the scene,

99
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,541
Liu Yanyan was already gone.

100
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,583
I checked the cameras

101
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,500
but found no clues.

102
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,583
It's been several days.

103
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:38,791
Forget her.

104
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,458
How is Manqing doing?

105
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,125
Dr. Pang said she was fine.

106
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:43,541
She got scared

107
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,541
and had a fever.

108
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,291
You go back and rest.

109
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,625
You've saved me again.

110
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:18,500
Yes.

111
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,625
I've saved you once again.

112
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,500
If I don't save you, who will?

113
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,541
Is there anyone else?

114
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,666
You're really quite foolish.

115
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,666
You ran out and got caught.

116
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,416
Thank you for taking care of me.

117
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,500
You'd better not talk.

118
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,041
It's wearing.

119
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,375
Move closer.

120
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:50,250
Hurry.

121
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:10,875
Remember.

122
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,666
Without my permission,

123
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,333
you cannot take it off.

124
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:16,750
Did you understand?

125
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,333
I'm glad you're fine.
