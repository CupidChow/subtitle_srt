1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,833
Here you are.

2
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,208
Take a look.

3
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:38,708
What style do you like?

4
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,708
Style?

5
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,916
You've been tricked?

6
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,416
What do you mean?

7
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:56,291
Is the payment
for Mr. Lin's contract due next week?

8
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:00,208
I know you can't wait to get rid of me.

9
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,750
We'll be done next week.

10
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:02,875
What is this?

11
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,541
I've long felt
that Manqing is suspicious.

12
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,500
So I investigated her a bit.

13
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,916
They set a trap for me.

14
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,291
But Mr. Lin's project is a real deal.

15
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:17,208
No.

16
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,750
I'll consult with Gu Qiyan.

17
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:25,808
=Deep Love Love Again=

18
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:31,041
=Episode 5=
(The Abyss Without Bounds)

19
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,083
Kevin.

20
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,833
What's the matter, Miss Liu?

21
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,708
Ji Anyang won't come to work tomorrow.

22
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,375
Dispose of his belongings.

23
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:42,958
Okay.

24
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,625
Qiyan.

25
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:01,958
Qiyan.

26
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,875
Call me Mr. Gu at the office.

27
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:09,541
Mr. Gu.

28
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,125
Here's the thing.

29
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,833
The company wanted the land in Xixing.

30
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,250
Guess what?

31
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,500
It took me tremendous effort...

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,291
Mr. Ji.

33
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,458
The company has a financial problem.

34
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,583
There's no money for the Xixing Project.

35
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,000
You signed the contract
without authorization.

36
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,458
The board won't take it.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,041
How is that possible?

38
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,083
The company has paid the deposit.

39
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,750
When I was not at home,

40
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:33,791
all company decisions

41
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,500
had to be made by the board.

42
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,125
Without the board's approval,
you forged the seal

43
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,000
and arranged the payment.

44
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,250
The board has decided

45
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,541
to take legal action.

46
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,125
No.

47
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,458
G-Gu Qiyan.

48
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,625
I've worked for the company
for so many years.

49
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,791
Now you're discarding me like trash.

50
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,916
You must make the payment now.

51
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,833
Ji Anyang.

52
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:09,958
Have you forgotten

53
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,958
what you have done

54
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,125
to my family and company?

55
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:15,875
If I were you,

56
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,666
I would go to see Mr. Lin right now

57
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,583
to end the contract
and take back the money.

58
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,000
Otherwise, you pay out of pocket
to fill the gap.

59
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,166
In this way,

60
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,458
the board might forgive you.

61
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,583
Gu Qiyan.

62
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,375
Good for you.

63
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,541
You wait.

64
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:05,875
Mr. Ji.

65
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:06,750
Mr. Ji.

66
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,416
Out of my way.

67
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,166
Mr. Ji.

68
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:08,958
You can't go in.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Mr. Ji.

70
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,125
Liu Yanyan!

71
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:10,625
Mr. Ji.

72
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,250
Yanyan.

73
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,125
Yanyan.

74
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,125
Come out!

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,625
Yanyan.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,500
Why are my things all outside?

77
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:19,708
What's going on?

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,250
Isn't it obvious?

79
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,625
Mercury has changed hands.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,875
What do you mean?

81
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,625
You owe too much money out there.

82
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,291
You're no longer fit to run Mercury.

83
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,666
I created Mercury myself.

84
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,041
How could he drive me away?

85
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,750
Sometimes I really don't know
what you're thinking.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,750
Gu Qingqing is already dead.

87
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,166
Just be a loyal dog for the Gu family.

88
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,958
Why must you be independent?

89
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:43,916
Yanyan.

90
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,208
As you know,

91
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,666
Gu Qiyan forced me
to sign a prenuptial agreement.

92
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,333
I can't get a dime
if Gu Qingqing is dead.

93
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,791
What do we do
if I don't prepare in advance?

94
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,333
Ji Anyang, you're insatiable.

95
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,458
Stop using me as an excuse.

96
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,958
I'm insatiable?

97
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,625
I earn every penny for you.

98
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,333
Mr. Ji.

99
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,750
Mr. Gu sent you a legal letter.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,833
(Legal letter to Ji Anyang)
He asks you to take back the deposit.

101
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,250
Mercury is now mine.

102
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:16,916
Liu Yanyan.

103
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,250
What kind of person do you take me for?

104
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,416
Mr. Ji.

105
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,416
You've been fired.

106
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,916
I've also broken up with you.

107
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,291
Please leave.

108
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,375
You can't do this to me.

109
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:30,875
Mr. Ji.

110
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:31,583
You can't.

111
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,208
Yanyan.

112
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:32,833
Calm down.

113
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,291
Mr. Ji.

114
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,458
Stay away from me.

115
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,291
Let go.

116
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:41,958
Behave yourself.

117
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,000
Do you know who I am?

118
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,833
I want to see Mr. Lin.
Did you hear that?

119
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:45,916
I want to see Mr. Lin.

120
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,375
Don't move, or I'll call the police.

121
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,375
Mr. Pei.

122
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,416
Mr. Lin.

123
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:51,666
Let go.

124
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:52,833
Release him.

125
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,125
Mr. Lin, I give up the land in Xixing.

126
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,625
Could you return the deposit?

127
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,083
Mr. Ji.

128
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,958
Are you seeing real estate development
as a game?

129
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,541
How could you expect a refund
as you wish?

130
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,458
Mr. Pei.

131
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,208
You can give up,

132
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,458
but no refunds.

133
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,000
After all, you signed a contract.

134
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,083
Contract?

135
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:11,833
Mr. Pei.

136
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:12,750
What is he thinking

137
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,875
in their head?

138
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,208
Let's negotiate, Mr. Lin.

139
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,583
Let me go.

140
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,500
Get him out of here.

141
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,208
Yes, Miss Liu.

142
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,666
Mr. Ji.

143
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,416
You've drunk too much.

144
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,208
You should go back.

145
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:51,875
Pour wine.

146
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,250
Mr. Ji.

147
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,041
Don't make it difficult for me.

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,791
Kevin.

149
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,708
This is my own business.

150
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,291
Can't I have a drink here?

151
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,416
Ji Anyang hit me.

152
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,541
Someone!

153
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,000
Pour wine.

154
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,250
Pour wine!

155
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,250
Hurry up!

156
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:45,875
Yanyan.

157
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,375
Can we not separate, Yanyan?

158
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,208
Let's make up.

159
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,416
Ji Anyang, look at yourself now.

160
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,833
I don't know why Gu Qingqing liked you.

161
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,458
You are greedy,
lecherous, and incompetent.

162
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,416
In my eyes, you are not even a man.

163
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,791
Do you really think
you are worthy of me?

164
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,958
Let me tell you the truth.

165
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,333
Every single second I spend with you

166
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,833
makes me feel disgusted.

167
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,458
What's wrong?

168
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:13,708
Something on my face?

169
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,791
I heard your ex-husband borrowed money

170
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,500
from a loan shark to fill the gap.

171
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,333
That's why he avoided jail.

172
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:22,916
Just to be clear,

173
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,791
he was Gu Qingqing's ex-husband,

174
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,083
not mine.

175
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,791
You think yourself as Manqing?

176
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:34,750
Of course not.

177
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,416
After all, all I have is controlled

178
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,000
by you,

179
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:39,875
right?

180
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,291
I told you.

181
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,583
If you're sick of it,

182
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:06,833
you can stop it.

183
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,333
So many people watch you eat
every time. Don't you feel

184
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:17,583
uncomfortable?

185
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,875
Let's get down to business.

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,500
When will we make Ji Anyang pay?

187
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,500
Wait a bit longer.

188
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,375
The time is not right yet.

189
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,291
Mr. Pei.

190
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,416
Did you see my message?

191
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,375
Seems like you're
in a desperate situation.

192
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,375
What do you want?

193
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,750
Cut the crap.

194
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,583
Come to see me at this address.

195
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,166
Otherwise, this video will spread
all over the world.

196
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,458
You go back tonight.

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't go to Ji Anyang.

198
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:35,500
Why?

199
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,875
I just received news

200
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,750
that he has other things to do tonight

201
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:43,958
and won't see you.
