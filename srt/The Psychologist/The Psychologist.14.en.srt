that I won't put him out anymore. Don't worry. Don't worry.

161
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:59,039
Okay. Well, I'll go home to check in on you when I finish work.

162
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,180
- Okay, Okay.
- Okay, bye.

163
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,759
What's going on? Is Ye Jiahui really at Auntie's place?

164
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,010
Why is he so shameless?

165
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,779
Where are you going?

166
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,980
I have a counseling session at 2pm. I've got to go back to my counseling office.

167
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,209
Leave me a message if anything comes up.

168
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,350
It's okay. It's okay.

169
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,199
Sorry, Xiao Ye. I kind of… lost my cool just now.

170
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:32,030
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,610
It's okay. I can understand.

172
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,029
It's just that the treatment was interrupted. Now I need to apply the needles again.

173
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,760
No thanks. I'm really a bit out of sorts today.

174
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,440
Let's do it another day.

175
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,209
Auntie, is it because I said the wrong thing about Jun Jun just now?

176
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:51,440
No.

177
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,790
I'm sorry. I apologize to you.

178
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,520
No.

179
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,960
It has nothing to do with you.

180
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,549
No.

181
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:04,280
Auntie, I actually envy Jun Jun a lot.

182
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,740
My mother abandoned me when I was seven.

183
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,320
Now I can hardly remember what she looked like.

184
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,880
Ever since I was a child, my most fearful festival is Mother's Day.

185
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,859
When that day came, I even dared not go to school.

186
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,509
I was afraid of seeing my classmates talking about what presents to buy for their mothers.

187
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,209
I envied them. I was even a bit jealous.

188
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,810
I knew they had someone waiting for them at home.

189
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,710
When they got home, someone would say

190
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,420
"Dinner is ready, Son."

191
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:52,570
Auntie, hope you won't laugh at me for what I'll tell you.

192
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,840
No.

193
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,210
When I'm alone

194
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,200
at home,

195
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,760
I practice again and again.

196
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,810
If one day I could see my mother again,

197
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,590
in what kind of tone

198
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,370
would I call her "Mom".

199
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,350
To let her know how much I've been missing her

200
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,150
over these years.

201
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,750
Sorry, Jun Jun.

202
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,080
It was my fault.

203
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,670
I shouldn't have done it.

204
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,390
Auntie, what exactly happened to Jun Jun back then?

205
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,829
You can say it. You can tell me.

206
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,810
It was a…

207
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,690
a su-summer.

208
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,420
Jun Jun…

209
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,180
Auntie, it's me, Kaiyi.

210
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
Let me go get the door.

211
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
I'm co-coming.

212
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,150
Kaiyi.

213
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,910
Auntie, I'm here to check in on you.

214
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,439
Thank you, thank you.

215
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:09,449
Xiao Ye happens to be here as well. He's here to give me acupuncture therapy.

216
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:11,609
Here, come in and take a seat. I'll let you guys talk first.

217
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:14,540
- I'll go and wash some fruit for you.
- Okay.

218
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,250
You are here, too.

219
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,170
Ms. Zhang, come on in.

220
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,440
Take a seat.

221
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,739
What brings you here today?

222
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:46,039
Well, does this need to be signed? I'll sign.

223
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,910
[Visitor Signature: Zhang...]

224
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,550
No need. No need to sign.

225
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,340
I wanted to call you after the therapy session with Jiang Jing today,

226
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,200
to let you consider family therapy.

227
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,420
I didn't expect you'd come first.

228
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,740
You see, I almost forgot.

229
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,070
Actually, I came today to say thank you.

230
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:09,650
You see, oddly enough, Jing Jing has only been here twice and she's well again.

231
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,379
She's also stopped her bulimia.

232
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:13,600
Has she? That's very good.

233
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,340
She's stopped losing her temper with me, too.

234
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,259
Didn't she say she wanted to make an appointment with you today?

235
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:23,159
But today she's suddenly gone to her idol Piano Prince Wu Muye's concert.

236
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:26,799
So I thought I had to come and let you know about it.

237
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,880
- Thank you so much for your encouragement and enlightenment.
- That's what I should do.

238
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,470
I could have called to tell you, but I don't think we'll probably come again.

239
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,190
I just want to come and check out if there's any paperwork that's left unsigned.

240
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,810
We don't have any complicated paperwork to go through.

241
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,690
That's good, that's good.

242
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,900
Ms. Zhang, does Jiang Jing still remember her appointment with me today?

243
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,020
She does, she does.

244
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,579
But the child does things on a whim.

245
00:17:56,579 --> 00:18:00,110
She's gone to the concert and didn't come back.

246
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,640
Miss He, I'm really sorry.

247
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,270
It's okay.

248
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,039
Here. Oranges are good for this season to remove internal heat.

249
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,600
- You guys should eat more. Boys.
- Thank you, Auntie.

250
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,699
No problem. Here, take a seat, take a seat.

251
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:19,130
Okay.

252
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,580
Help yourselves.

253
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,050
Okay.

254
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,860
Let me taste it.

255
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,280
It's so sweet, Auntie.

256
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,140
Give me a tissue.

257
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,370
Thanks.

258
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,890
Auntie, look.

259
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,310
[Gingseng]

260
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,500
- What's this?
- Giant ginseng.

261
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,950
This-This costs an arm and a leg.

262
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,310
Ginseng is good, but don't buy such expensive stuff again.

263
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,399
Auntie, now you have to avoid certain food.

264
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:58,520
Something like ginseng is a no-no.

265
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,299
I really don't know about this. Tell me more.

266
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,000
Ginseng is a tonic medicine.

267
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,239
It's for replenishing your vitality. Since you have high blood pressure, an overdose of ginseng

268
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:12,169
will raise your blood pressure and give you headaches and insomnia.

269
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:15,700
Mr. Ye is right. My blood pressure is a bit high indeed.

270
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,800
It's okay, Auntie.

271
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,380
Look, we also have Chinese caterpillar fungus.

272
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,190
Auntie, it's very good to drink with water.

273
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,610
- I know, I know. It's great stuff. Next time don't…
- Yes.

274
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,790
Although Chinese caterpillar fungus is all the rage at the moment,

275
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,640
Auntie, you have a damp-heat constitution.

276
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,490
The most important part of physical conditioning is to get rid of dampness and heat.

277
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,880
The Chinese caterpillar fungus will only give you more dampness and heat.

278
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,890
It is not recommended for consumption either.

279
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,950
Elderly people tend to have dampness and heat anyway.

280
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,110
It's okay, it's okay.

281
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,779
Bird's nest. This is great stuff.

282
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:48,100
Great stuff, great stuff.

283
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,999
Bird's nest is good. It's lukewarm in nature.

284
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:51,550
But Auntie, don't you know?

285
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,810
Its main ingredient is protein.

286
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,349
In fact, it has more or less the same nutritional value as eggs.

287
00:19:57,349 --> 00:19:58,780
We'd better eat eggs.

288
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,170
Going by what you said, Ms. Zhao has an allergy to all these health care products.

289
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,420
It's okay, Auntie. Let's take a dietary supplement.

290
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,400
I've bought you a lot of processed food.

291
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,800
Look.

292
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,020
Good. This is good.

293
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,320
Auntie, we should be more alert to dietary supplements.

294
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,160
We must choose high-quality protein.

295
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,020
Such kind of…

296
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,900
You are tongue-tied, aren't you?

297
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,209
We must have balanced nutrition.

298
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:33,370
Too much fish and meat are not good for the recovery of your muscle tissue.

299
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,609
Dumplings. Dumplings are surely good for health.

300
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,980
Yearning Dumplings.

301
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,140
Auntie, I gave this to He Dun before.

302
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,579
And this is her favorite. Each dumpling has a big filling.

303
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,699
Auntie, we must alert Dun Dun to people with evil designs.

304
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:58,029
He could be giving dumplings or be giving his yearning.

305
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:00,030
Rest easy, Auntie.

306
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,459
The dumpling giver absolutely keeps to the straight and narrow,

307
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:08,530
unlike someone who has the devil design but not the courage and lets dumplings do the talking.

308
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,380
Bring the dumplings.

309
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,640
Auntie.

310
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,810
I'll cook the dumplings right away.

311
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,530
Thank you, Auntie.

312
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,759
Auntie, I'm waiting for your scrumptious dumplings.

313
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,350
He Dun!

314
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,780
Aren't you being too sensitive?

315
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,929
No. I called her three times but she didn't answer.

316
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:45,669
Maybe she's fallen asleep and didn't hear her phone ringing.

317
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:49,300
Lili, there are many other reasons I can't tell you. But I must pay a visit.

318
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,500
The principle of confidentiality, right?

319
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,000
He Dun, I know you have your own intuitions.

320
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,470
But do you remember what you often tell me?

321
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,649
- The psychological counselor usually keeps a boundary between her and a visitor.
- Lili—

322
00:21:58,649 --> 00:21:59,950
I just don't want you to cross that boundary.

323
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,170
This is not a question of crossing boundary.

324
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,899
Personal safety is an exception to the terms of confidentiality set out in a counseling agreement.

325
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:06,149
It's also one of the supreme principles of counseling ethics.

326
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:09,500
I can't leave her unattended. I must pay a visit.

327
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,799
I really don't know what to do with you. What are you going to do?

328
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,570
I have to get someone to go with me.

329
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,600
Am I not someone?

330
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,190
Why?

331
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,710
We each go our own home, don't we?

332
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,009
Don't give Auntie useless stuff later on.

333
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:39,019
Okay. When you come next time, bring something useful with you so that I can widen my horizon.

334
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:40,999
- It's okay with me.
- I'll wait and see.

335
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:43,240
Are you going to see He Dun in a while about something?

336
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,790
But it has nothing to do with you.

337
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:49,349
Yes indeed. You have to contact He Dun in advance to see her. While I can just go home.

338
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,830
Have you listened to it?

339
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,339
Hi, Yuan. I'm pissed off!

340
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:09,780
What happened again? I've just finished a workout session.

341
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,589
Well, Bro, let me ask you. Do you think a man can be a vixen as well?

342
00:23:17,153 --> 00:23:18,430
What did you say?

343
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,060
I think I've run into one.

344
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,380
He keeps going to He Dun's house for something or other to please her mother.

345
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,189
He gives her mother acupuncture therapy every day. I just don't get it.

346
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:30,099
You see, I bought some stuff for Auntie. Did I need him to comment on it one by one?

347
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:32,400
He threw it all aside and said it's useless.

348
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,919
And you know what, from what I can see in his eyes, I do think it's rather weird.

349
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,559
He always gives me the feeling of hiding a dagger in his smile, do you know?

350
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,160
And He Dun is laughing and joking with him every day. And even went on a date!

351
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,489
By the way, they live in the same courtyard.

352
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:49,180
All right, I know. Say no more.

353
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,240
You are taking Ye Jiahui as your love rival.

354
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,409
What love rival? I just can't bear the sight of such people.

355
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:00,310
Bro, do you know what you are like now?

356
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,020
You are like you've just married He Dun

357
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,289
and are complaining to me she's a scumbag who's never at home.

358
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:07,969
What has that to do with He Dun?

359
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:10,449
You keep on about He Dun. What do you say?

360
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,430
What level are you at?

361
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,669
Someone who can keep you on tenterhooks and make you distraught like this

362
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:19,369
could only be your rival at work or your love rival.

363
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:24,799
Apart from He Dun, do you have other common friends with Ye Jiahui?

364
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,400
Does He Dun's mother count as one?

365
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,999
Who do you particularly want to chat to and talk to recently and long to get a response from?

366
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:34,329
Use your brain.

367
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:37,810
Now you are thinking about nobody but He Dun.

368
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,100
If you see another man around her, you get extremely sensitive.

369
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,210
- I—
- When I told you the other day

370
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,700
she was the one who confessed her love to me at high school, do you remember what you did to me?

371
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,950
I must clarify this.

372
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,290
What happened at high school was really a misunderstanding.

373
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,190
As I see it, He Dun is your colleague.

374
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,240
There's no need to worry about her so much.

375
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,500
Or you can do this.

376
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,410
When she gets into a relationship with Ye Jiahui,

377
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,880
you won't have to worry about this, worry about that, right?

378
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,629
Hold on, hold on. With whom?

379
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,840
No way!

380
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,190
Ye Jiahui.

381
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,279
Why did he hang up on me while he's angry with others?

382
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,400
Piss off!

383
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,300
He Dun?

384
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:33,449
Well, Miss He, why don't you tell me what exactly has happened?

385
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,960
Tell me more. At least I can give you some advice.

386
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,930
One of my visitors sent me a suicide letter.

387
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,880
Where's my cellphone?

388
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,880
Where's my drum practice pad?

389
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,950
Where's my cellphone?

390
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,380
- What are you doing?
- These are your favorite pieces of jewelry, aren't they?

391
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,280
Does this make your heart ache? Does it!

392
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,209
Now this makes your heart ache, doesn't it?

393
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:24,579
What are you doing? What are you doing?

394
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,740
I tell you what, Mom, I just don't want to win first prizes at all.

395
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,550
- I just don't want to play the piano at all!
- You…

396
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,540
What's more, these is the clothes I want to wear!

397
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,270
How long does it still take for us to get there?

398
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,660
About 20 minutes.

399
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,830
I'll let you go mad.

400
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,699
Open the door! Why are you locking me in?

401
00:26:51,699 --> 00:26:54,259
- Open the door quickly!
- I'll let you go mad.

402
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:57,200
Are you out of your mind? You are locking me in!

403
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,260
Open the door quickly!

404
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,340
What's going on? Did she reply?

405
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,270
With no communication, I can't intervene at all.

406
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,970
I'll see if you…

407
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,630
Don't…

408
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,950
She's failed as a mother.

409
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,799
I hate you! I hate you…

410
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:57,680
Dear listeners, good evening.

411
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,170
Today I'd like to recommend a song

412
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:04,410
of the well-known British band Def Leppard,

413
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,410
Long Long Way to Go.

414
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,450
The drummer of Def Leppard lost an arm

415
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,679
in a car accident, but he didn't give up playing the drum.

416
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,399
Instead, he adjusted the position and combination of the drums in a way most comfortable to him.

417
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,520
Maybe because he has only one hand,

418
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,680
his every beat seems particularly powerful.

419
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,520
Every beat is like a strike to the heart.

420
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,430
Dear listeners, maybe

421
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,619
you are on a crowded subway train going to or getting off work,

422
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:39,119
or nibbling at a piece of bread in your rented room facing despair and agony.

423
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,400
But I truly hope that when you hear this song,

424
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,190
you can be healed by the music and the story

425
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,019
or be inspired by such tenacious drumbeats to have a renewed fighting spirit.

426
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,830
There is still a long way to go in life.

427
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:56,469
And there are many warm stories in this world that are worth our love.

428
00:28:56,469 --> 00:29:00,140
Let us embrace and love this world.

429
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,999
Maybe all the pain and suffering will be set aflame with hope

430
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:07,120
because of love and care.

431
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:21,999
All the misfortunes in the world stem from each other's care.

432
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,020
I'm 30 this year.

433
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,170
I don't want to

434
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,960
live to be the person you want me to be.

435
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,190
I don't want such a way of life.

436
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:44,100
Tell me why you want to trap me like this.

437
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,400
Why do you want to leave the mistake Dad made on you to me?

438
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,069
Actually, you are afraid of me growing up, afraid of me leaving you.

439
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:54,440
But will I?

440
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,610
I've already done what you want of me,

441
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,230
playing the piano, wearing a white one-piece,

442
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,400
with neat bangs and a high ponytail.

443
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,920
I know you love me,

444
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,629
but you are simply too afraid of making another wrong choice in your life.

445
00:30:09,629 --> 00:30:12,820
Wake up!

446
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,630
Ever since Dad left, the two of us have been trapped here.

447
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,580
Why?

448
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,430
I don't want to be trapped in a besieged city anymore!

449
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,780
Zhang Lizi,

450
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,310
over the 30 years,

451
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,230
my life

452
00:30:36,548 --> 00:30:39,698
is like this broken violin,

453
00:30:39,698 --> 00:30:42,150
shattered to pieces.

454
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,780
I didn't know what I wanted.

455
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,140
I didn't know what kind of life I wanted.

456
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,280
I don't have any goals.

457
00:30:50,197 --> 00:30:52,997
I had no dreams.

458
00:30:52,997 --> 00:30:56,957
I didn't know what I liked.

459
00:30:56,957 --> 00:31:00,230
I thought I liked perms and sun dresses.

460
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,500
Actually, I just wanted freedom.

461
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,810
I think I'm not just your daughter.

462
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,610
I'm also like your husband,

463
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,780
trapped in this house with you.

464
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:19,039
He's gone. He won't be back.

465
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,000
We both should…

466
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,980
start a new life.

467
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:34,120
Mom, I've always thought I'm very lucky

468
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:40,059
for being your daughter among billions of people.

469
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,840
I care about how you feel and what you think.

470
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,820
Such care is inexplicable.

471
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:52,449
Whether I'm growing up or being independent, that doesn't mean I will leave you.

472
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:55,330
Zhang Lizi, do you hear me?

473
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,760
I just want you to do well.

474
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,410
I want you to have good prospects in the future.

475
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,830
So that we won't have to count on anyone.

476
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,090
We can live a good life like anybody else.

477
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,680
You are still young now.

478
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,299
When you grow up…

479
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:20,130
When you grow up, you'll get to know Mom's intentions.

480
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,830
Mom,

481
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,520
no matter where I go

482
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,010
or what kind of life I'll be living in the future,

483
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,060
I will not forget you,

484
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,330
because I love you.

485
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:49,689
Much deeper than my love of anybody else in the world.

486
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:53,648
You are

487
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,050
the only woman I love deeply.

488
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,310
Mom,

489
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,800
thank you.

490
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,540
Thanks.

491
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,050
Is it here?

492
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,740
Are you all right?

493
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,370
Here you are.

494
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,100
There's no need to go.

495
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,969
- She's safe now.
- How did you know?

496
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:27,590
How long does it still take for us to get there?

497
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,040
About 20 minutes.

498
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,880
Don't be anxious. Let's listen to the radio for you to wind down.

499
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,630
Whether there are issues at work or at home, there are always solutions.

500
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,180
Qian Kaiyi, aren't you an radio host?

501
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,910
How about you help me record something for Jiang Jing?

502
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,810
Thank you, Miss He.

503
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:53,909
Thank you too to Mr.Qian's late-night radio for helping me find my courage again.

504
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,560
It is Mr. Qian who gave her courage.

505
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:36,559
For a man to be fearless when facing difficulties

506
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,700
while helping others at the same time, what he needs is strength and experience.

507
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,430
Of course, you don't have them now.

508
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,420
You'll have them later.

509
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,040
Apart from that, you'll need one thing that is the most important.

510
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,800
- And that is…
- That is…

511
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,830
Bravery.

512
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,710
Bravery is a person's character.

513
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,250
It can summon courage.

514
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,979
No matter how much experience you have, it can

515
00:36:01,979 --> 00:36:06,939
generate a force to dominate you and pump out a stream of hot blood.

516
00:36:06,939 --> 00:36:12,879
Without them, no amount of strength and experience is worth mentioning.

517
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,710
On the other hand, courage can make one

518
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:19,250
press ahead without hesitation.

519
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,460
If there is someone you want to protect in the future,

520
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,450
make sure you learn to be brave.

521
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,840
Be brave, do you know?

522
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,580
There's more?

523
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,669
It happens that I didn't have dinner this evening. I really have a foodie's luck.

524
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:12,520
When you called me, I thought it was about something big. Turns out it's about gourmet food.

525
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,800
Were you busy outside again?

526
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,490
Signs of danger loomed up one after another.

527
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,870
You've been doing suicide intervention for such a long time that

528
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,119
your tiny counseling office has almost become an emergency center.

529
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,899
Don't worry. The process was a bit tortuous, but the outcome was good.

530
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:32,250
I do pay attention to these principles.

531
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,809
I see you are so busy every day, but I don't

532
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:39,110
actually have the headspace to share your many burdens.

533
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:42,330
But I can still shell shrimp.

534
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,070
- It's for you. Eat.
- No.

535
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,580
You just eat.

536
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,200
I've taken in fumes of cooking oil. I'll ease off first.

537
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:55,150
Guess who I ran into on the flight back home yesterday?

538
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:58,479
I'm not a stripling. What's the point of keeping me in suspense?

539
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:01,570
Ye Niantang.

540
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,840
He starts to make waves as soon as he's back.

541
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,040
- I keep worrying if something is off.
- You are overthinking.

542
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,800
Lao Ke, why is your chicken running to my place?

543
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,140
[F File, 99-00]

544
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,630
Professor, what's up with you?

545
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,720
You look careworn.

546
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,420
Is something weighing on your mind?

547
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,059
What's your take on the medicalization of psychological counseling?

548
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:36,870
Wouldn't that be psychotherapy?

549
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:40,420
The health law stipulates that psychotherapy must be conducted in a medical institution.

550
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,450
And nowadays only psychiatrists have the right of prescription and diagnosis.

551
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,199
But nowadays psychiatric hospitals are still in the age of the biomedical model

552
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,220
without a thorough transformation.

553
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:55,029
The transformation you mentioned is about Engel's physiology, psychology

554
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:58,040
and social medicine model.

555
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm quite curious though.

556
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,050
About what?

557
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,810
About who made such a suggestion to you.

558
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,490
I've only heard such a phrase.

559
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:15,249
Bringing psychology into psychiatry is a downright dead end.

560
00:39:15,249 --> 00:39:19,120
I think what we need to do now is not carve out a new path or spin-off and reorganization.

561
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,749
Rather, we should let each develop its own strengths in its own field.

562
00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:24,710
Only in this way can we set up a sound system.

563
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,360
What do you think?

564
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,420
That is the truth.

565
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,549
Professor Liu Ping of Shanghai Mental Health Center is a case in point.

566
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:36,760
She used to be a very well-known psychoanalyst in our country.

567
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,369
But she led hospital staff to open a psychological counseling clinic and has been running it for over a decade.

568
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:43,240
So far, she's still at the forefront of this field in our country.

569
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,499
But the real worry is some people are copying her model by promising wine but selling vinegar.

570
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,380
Let me give you a suggestion.

571
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,310
Come to work at the Psychological Society.

572
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,970
Me?

573
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,170
I'm getting old.

574
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:04,839
The day will come when I shall step down from the president's position.

575
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:08,359
The Society's future development is going to get tougher and tougher.

576
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:12,250
Over time, it needs some level-headed,

577
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:18,390
resolute people with an altruistic mind to take up the responsibility.

578
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,620
Is that a praise of me?

579
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:27,609
Professor, I think the merits you mentioned need further verification.

580
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:31,580
But I think the counseling office I'm running now can help one or two people every day,

581
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,360
and that makes me very happy.

582
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,490
In this profession, I'm just a small potato.

583
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,860
That's all I can do.

584
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,360
But I'm quite content.

585
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,999
You said you want me to take up a post and learn about development.

586
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:44,380
That's not what I want to pursue.

587
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,250
What do you want to pursue then?

588
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,620
No matter how high a position we are in,

589
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:08,320
all we need to do is do the job at hand well.

590
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,929
I want to be a hero who can save others like daddy.

591
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:41,530
It's cool that way.

592
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:44,569
For a man to be fearless when facing difficulties

593
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:46,950
while helping others at the same time,

594
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,140
what he needs is strength and experience.

595
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,800
Of course you don't have them now.

596
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,970

597

That's Daddy's job.

599

Dad, you did a terrific job just now.

600
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,250
I want to learn, too.

601
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,890
You didn't get it? That means you are too young to learn now. You can do it when you grow up.

00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,250
You overshadowed us.

609

But let me tell you, now I can tie all kinds of knots.

610
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:51,060
Every way you taught me and didn't teach me, I can do it all.

611
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,730
Also, I don't know

612
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,120
if I've saved others today.

613
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:02,620

♫  of a beautiful love  ♫

648

♫  Holding your hand, I can feel your heart  ♫

649
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:44,210
