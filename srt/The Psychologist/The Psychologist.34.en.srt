who would come in groups and rip through my trash bin.

Trash was strewn across the ground. They're so unruly trying to get what they want.

he's a very nice guy.

100
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,940
And he's very hot.

101
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,609
Sometimes he's so annoying.

102
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:06,640
But sometimes he's so adorable.

103
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,740

My first boyfriend.

108
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,000
He was shy and introverted.

I mean the order of the stack of books. Make no mistake in arranging them.

112
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,539
The first book is the Classic of Mountains and Rivers.

113
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:11,959
The second book is the Investiture of the Gods.

114
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,809
The third book is Guangling Essays.

115
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:15,099
The fourth book is Journey to the West.

116
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:18,769
The fifth book is Darwin's the Origin of Species.

117
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:21,450
Please arrange them in order.

118
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,450
Why would the Origin of Species

119
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,750
be also classified in this subject?

120
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,369
Because the Origin of Species is not really a serious science book.

121
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,100
So it's no different than other fairy tales.

But I got to give it a try anyway.

That was how we met.

129
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,670
We fell in love at first sight.

130
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,419
Then what happened?

131
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:40,420
Did that shy guy woo you ardently?

132
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,710
No. He did nothing.

133
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,890
I was so angry that

134
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,620
I tried every way to woo him.

135
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,410
You wooed him?

136
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,449
That's a lot of books.

137
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,540
You don't want to?

138
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,450
I'll try my best.

139
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,810
Are you in a hurry to somewhere?

140
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,450
No.

141
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,940
He was shy and introverted indeed.

142
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,619
Oh, worse than that.

143
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:11,110
I also took the initiative to hold his hand for the first time.

144
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,760
Since he loved you, he should have showed his love boldly!

145
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,179
I know!

146

Go.

151
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,249
Why are you always pressing firm against me?

152
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:06,860
- The wave might wet your clothes.
- I came to feel the wave.

I guess she will be down for quite some days.

160

You should stay with her and chat with her more often.

She doesn't need my company anymore.

She has her boyfriend to keep her company.

163
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:42,700
Now since you have more time, you can keep me company.

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,870
But we have separated for a long time.

169
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,380
I need some time to think about it.

170
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,940
I understand.

171
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,960
Besides, I need to think about Dun Dun.

172
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,760
I know.

173
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,870
I guess I'm drunk.

174
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,990
Do you have your boyfriend's number?

175
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,520
I have a boyfriend.

176
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,810
My boyfriend is Qian Kaiyi.

177
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,870
Qian Kaiyi is my boyfriend!

178
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,940
Where are you?

179
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,570
Hello.

180
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,400
Hello.

181
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,650
Where are you? I'll go pick you up.

182
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,009
Your girlfriend is drunk.

183
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:39,789
I'm drunk.

184
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,450
Where are you guys?

185
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,750
Your boyfriend will come soon.

186
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,870
So I will leave you alone.

187
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,650
Bye-Bye.

188
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,180
Qian Kaiyi, why did you become a thin telegraph pole?

189
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,520
And why would you wear so many accessories?

190
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,589
They're ugly and vulgar.

191
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:57,780
You can get as much as you want?

192
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,960
You're bragging!

193
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,210
You ugly sh*t.

194
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,499
Idiot!

195
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:09,410
He Dun, are you okay?

196
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,900
Stop!

197
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,289
Where is the lady who called me?

198
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:14,950
That's not important.

199
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,830
You, sit down.

200
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,170
How much did you drink?

201
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,760
Sit down!

202
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,679
Now register on my visitor's list first.

203
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,721
Tell me your problem and what you want to achieve through the counseling.

204
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,569
I can help you solve your problem.

205
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:38,430
Register, right?

206
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,499
My girlfriend won't acknowledge me as her boyfriend. Can you solve my problem?

207
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,180
Then your girlfriend is the one to blame.

208
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,879
But it's okay.

209
00:17:54,879 --> 00:17:57,810
Bro, lad.

210
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,660
I can solve your problem.

211
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,790
How are you feeling now?

212
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,099
I feel better, just by a little bit.

213
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:17,379
Then I'll give you some assignment to do.

214
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:18,569
Go ahead.

215
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:21,120
You have to write down what I say! Understand?

216
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,980
Okay.

217
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,780
The first thing is...

218
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,900
First thing.

219
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,010
You are a kidney bean. Understand?

220
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,000
- A kidney bean.
- Yes, kidney bean.

221
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,620
Kidney bean is you. You are kidney bean.

222
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,380
- Write it down. Kidney bean.
- Okay, I'm kidney bean.

223
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,030
Kidney bean.

224
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,759
The second thing is...

225
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,380
The second thing.

226
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,260
Kidney bean.

227
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,589
That jar of origami stars was for you.

228
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:53,310
I didn't want to give it to Kang Ziyuan.

229
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,120
Okay. It was for me.

230
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,899
I put it, I put it under my desk.

231
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:04,150
Remember to get it.

232
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,680
I will definitely go get it.

233
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,720
And also

234
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,050
I really, really...

235
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:19,610
I really, really like you.

236
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,980
I know. I know.

237
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,810
- Don't cry.
- Don't laugh at me.

238
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,130
- I didn't. I...
- You're laughing at me now!

239
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,100

[Happy Talk Studio]

257
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,480
Why would I sleep here?

258
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,590
Do you remember how you came back here last night?

259
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:15,240
How?

260
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,200
It's fine. Never mind.

261
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,829
What does kidney bean mean?

262
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:23,149
Kidney bean?

263
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,259
A kind of vegetable.

264
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,999
What's wrong with that?

265
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,570
Never mind.

266
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,200
It was eye-opening for me.

267
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,960
When are you going to tell me?

268
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,391
Tell you what? Why are you looking at me with such an odd expression?

269
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:41,859
You guys already did this and did that.

270
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:43,860
You're still trying to hide it from me?

271
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,229
You mean Qian Kaiyi and I last night...

272
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:49,240
We did this? We also did that?

273
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,381
What else did I do? Did I say anything indecent that I shouldn't have?

274
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:55,269
Did I do anything that crossed the line?

275
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,450
I don't want to hear it! What were you thinking?

276
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,240
How much longer were you trying to hide it from me? Tell me the truth!

277
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,259
Don't be mad.

278
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:06,139
I didn't want to hide it from you.

279
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:09,900
I wanted to tell you after I handled what had happened these few days.

280
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,330
Since so, I'm officially breaking the news to my best friend now.

281
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:20,260
Miss Tang Lili, Qian Kaiyi and I are dating.

282
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,930
I'm not single anymore.

283
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,779
I have imagined many times how my BFF

284
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:28,900
would share her great news with me after she got a boyfriend.

285
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,910
I never thought that I had to force you to tell me.

286
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,409
Okay.

287
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:37,669
Although it's a bit late than I thought,

288
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,689
Qian Kaiyi finally let you put your guard down.

289
00:23:40,689 --> 00:23:42,930
What do you mean? You mean I had a guard in my heart?

290
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:46,100
Of course, and it was a thick and iron guard.

291
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,530
Did I?

292
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,759
But I'm really happy for you.

293
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,689
He Dun, you've finally grown up.

294
00:23:56,689 --> 00:23:59,510
I want you to be happy.

295
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,779
You are so sappy.

296
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:03,760
I'm just dating someone. You sound like I'm getting married.

297
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,259
Your sensational statement.

298
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:07,250
Stop it.

299
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,780
I also have something to tell you.

300
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,600
What's up?

301
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,810
I'm also dating someone.

302
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:19,050
Who is it? Mr. Jin?

303
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,730
That policeman who received us that night?

304
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,099
I knew it!

305
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,809
As your BFF, I'm also very happy for you.

306
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:27,949
Tang Lili has grown up, too.

307
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:31,240
I like that policeman.

308
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,619
He Dun, don't worry for me.

309
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:35,169
I have experienced so much in romantic relationships before.

310
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,349
I will keep my eyes open when it comes to men.

311
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:39,810
Thank you for always being there for me and supporting me.

312
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,139
I'm really happy to see your changes.

313
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:43,379
I want to thank you, too.

314
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:44,619
I have gone through a lot.

315
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:46,759
I wouldn't know how to vent my emotions

316
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,550
and how to deal with them without you.

317
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,911
So everything is just peachy except the little episode with Ye Jiahui.

318
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,859
Let's not talk about him.

319
00:24:57,859 --> 00:24:59,560
I've already let go.

320
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,100
I think in everyone's heart there is this sick child.

321
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,510
But they don't know how to live with this child in peace.

322
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,199
I could feel that

323
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:13,909
he had a lot of secrets in his heart.

324
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,140
- Jiahui.
- Actually psychiatry and psychological counseling have a lot in common.

325
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,029
But later I found that unconsciously I always dulled my suspicion on him.

326
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:23,960
I realize that you can get serious about everything.

327
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,109
Now that I look back,

328
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:30,540
maybe deep down in my heart I didn't want to explore his state of mind with my psychology expertise.

329
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,740
I wanted to help him as a friend.

330
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,820
But unfortunately,

So I can see why he would do that.

Dear audience. Good evening, this is Night Talk to Your Heart.

350
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,569
I'm Qian Kaiyi, your emotion listener.

351
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:15,430
Hello, everyone. I'm He Dun, your happiness communicator.

352
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:20,170
I believe that you've noticed the venue for our show today is different from the past.

353
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,169
We're broadcasting from Happy Talk Studio

354
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:25,600
which we will mention in every episode of our show.

355
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,789
I have been participating in

356
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,360
Night Talk to Your Heart as a guest host.

357
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,839
But as this show's influence has expanded,

358
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,570
gradually what I say would represent some people's stand.

359
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:45,000
It's an honor for me because it means that the distance between me and the audience is getting closer.

360
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,759
But at the same time it's also a pressure.

361
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,410
Actually, every one of us looks at the world from a different point of view with our own limitations.

362
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,789
So I just want to speak

363
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,380
and give opinions as an individual and to deliver a good show today.

364

Hello, this is Night Talk to Your Heart.

[Assistant Reminder: Question from the audience]

366
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,409
Someone is calling to ask what the specific

367
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:08,489
job description of a psychological counselor is.

368
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:12,690
Will you just need to chat casually like you do in the radio shows and that's it?

369
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,270
My standard counseling session is about fifty minutes.

370
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:20,880
But during this period of time, I won't just listen to what the visitors say.

371
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,029
I want to watch their every move face to face,

372
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,669
and even the state when they are talking

373
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,860
and their micro expressions at the same time.

374
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,550
So the work of a psychological counselor isn't as simple as we might imagine.

375
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,599
Miss He.

376
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,209
I also heard an interesting saying that

377
00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:39,759
as long as someone comes to the consulting room

378
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,449
and sits down on the couch,

379
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:45,500
they will start to tell the truth.

380
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,840
Actually, the purpose of the arrangement of the counselling room is to let the visitors

381
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,360
feel more comfortable to express themselves and for their self-cognition.

382
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,240
As for whether the visitors will tell what they really think

383
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,880
in their hearts when sitting on it, actually

384
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,000
whatever they say means something for us the counsellors.

385
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,209
Miss He, on the matter of Professor Ji Mingcong,

386
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:11,759
are all your statements true

387
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,910
without any personal bias?

388
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:22,030
Everybody knows that I'm a student of Professor Ji Mingcong.

389
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,359
I've been very confident that he's innocent

390
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,670
since the bustle of news of his sexually assault.

391
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:31,740
So I had been trying to find the answer holding a pre-set attitude.

392
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,960
So from the very beginning you didn't treat it with a neutral stand.

393
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,269
Can I understand it this way?

394
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,260
That's right. I trusted my mentor very much.

395
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:46,410
Precisely because of my trust that I had been trying my best to investigate and to seek truth.

396
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:50,019
And finally, I did find the answer I wanted.

397
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:54,960
Miss He, is this statement a response to the doubts on you online?

398
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,240
I accept that I'm called into question by everyone as an individual.

399
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,430
But I don't want to see people resent the profession of a psychological counselor.

400
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,530
I saw that everyone was discussing online

401
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,719
whether it was He Dun who did the wrong thing as an individual

402
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,430
or He Dun as a psychological counselor who did something wrong.

403
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:13,079
On this matter I'm just an ordinary person like everyone else.

404
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,370
What I said or did doesn't represent the position of the group of psychological counselors.

405
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,669
Interesting.

406
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,570
Next let's get someone with 0328 as the last four digits

407
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,170
of his or her number online.

408
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,741
Hello. Welcome and thank you for calling in.

409
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,620
You're with Night Talk to Your Heart. I'm your host Qian Kaiyi.

410
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,989
Mr. Qian, hello. I've been listening to what Miss He is saying.

411
00:30:32,989 --> 00:30:35,150
- Miss He, are you there? 
- Hello, yes, I'm here.

412
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,509
Miss He.

413
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,259
You are a student of Ji Mingcong.

414
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:42,389
But we the audience are not his relatives or acquittances. We don't know what he's like.

415
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,609
Excuse me,

416
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,670
- but I think you may have misunderstood…
- As a radio show's host,

417
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,840
you've been defending him before the truth comes out.

418
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,589
Isn't it a bit inappropriate?

419
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:54,940
You are capable as a counsellor, so just save a few more people instead of hurting people.

420
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,179
- With a sleazy professor like him, his student is also sleazy.
- How can she be so mean?

421
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:58,849
Okay, thank you, see you.

422
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:01,389
But still, we want to thank her for calling in.

423
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:05,029
Speaking of its truth, as bystanders, sometimes

424
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,729
we need to see and to understand an event

425
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:12,910
from a subjective point of view instead of following the herd.

426
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:17,150
Actually, I think what that lady just said has a point.

427
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:21,029
Indeed, as public figures what we say

428
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,719
can be magnified and attracts the society's attention.

429
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,180
But it also means that what we say will be more powerful and affect a lot of people.

430
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,659
But when the sympathy of the public is consumed,

431
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:34,069
they might start to have

432
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:36,300
hostile emotions towards the vulnerable.

433
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,929
When the real victim comes forward one day,

434
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:42,060
it's very likely that people won't believe them anymore.

435
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:46,280
So we need to take responsibility for our own words.

436
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,569
Evening News. Former President of Psychological Society of City H

437
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:52,479
Ji Mingcong just made a public apology in which

438
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,919
he claimed to have Psychologist Ji Mingcong under suspicion of sexually assaulting female graduate student

439
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,389
made a huge mistake in his professional field.

440
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:59,250
He violated the code of professional ethics to develop an improper relationship with one of his visitors.

441
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,290
As for more information, let's take a look at the report from the scene.

442
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:07,260
Professor Ji Mingcong, do you have anything to say on the apology statement you just posted?

443
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,170
There is no improper relationship

444
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,810
between me and Yao Kexin.

445
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,880
But the letter at the hearing was not fabricated either.

446
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,310
When things have come to this point, I can only say that I made a big mistake.

447
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:26,360
I seriously violated my professional ethics and ethics in general.

448
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,479
I apologize for

449
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,390
the negative impact my doings have on

450
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,580
other parties involved and the academic circle.

451
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,860
Careful. The tea is a bit hot.

452
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,740
Okay, thank you.

453
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,040
Smell it.

Have you met something that made you worried recently?

457

My ex-husband

458
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,430
suddenly came to me the other day.

459
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,630
Try the soup.

460
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,919
I will roll it up myself.

461
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,690
I got used to it.

462
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,979
Let me tell you,

463
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,330
the steamed chicken with chili sauce,

464
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,170
- it's... It's okay.
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

465
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,070
- I have a fair share of this dish.
- We would make this dish when we didn't have time to cook.

466
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,100
This is your favorite. Stir-fried asparagus lettuce.

467
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,020
Yes.

468
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,139
Let's have a bowl of soup after the meal.

469
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,690
I made it the way you like by adding pepper powder.

470
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,180
I haven't drink it for a long time.

471
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,530
Cheers.

472
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,019
I didn't know we would be drinking.

473
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,489
I want to thank you.

474
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,290
- Thank me?
- Yes.

475
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,680
After you left, I learnt to drink wine.

476
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,420
Sorry.

477
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,189
I don't want to hear it again.

478
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:23,811
You already said it once and that's enough.

479
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,700
Let's not talk about this over dinner.

480
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,390
Okay, let me serve you some food.

481
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,700
Let's go to bed after the soup.

482
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,600
Xiping,

483
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,960
what do you think about my proposal?

484
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,860
Your ex-husband is back because he wants to get back together with you.

485
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,769
And you don't know what decision to make.

486
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,730
For the past many years he never contacted me once And then he came to my door suddenly.

487
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,329
Sometimes I think maybe he came back

488
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,969
because he wants me to take care of him since he's getting older.

489
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,200
You resent him for leaving you for so many years.

490
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,899
You can't trust him anymore but you didn't reject him either. Right?

491
00:34:58,899 --> 00:35:00,939
I didn't.

492
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,459
He keeps calling me again and again.

493
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,700
I can't just turn him down. I also think he is very sincere.

494
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,569
I met him a few times.

495
00:35:08,569 --> 00:35:11,089
In the end City H is the best.

496
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:13,950
Now you realize it's the best?

497
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,809
I brought you a present.

498
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:22,320
Take a look. Do you like it?

499
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,910
How about it?

500
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,609
A red dress.

501
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:27,019
Do you like it?

502
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:28,659
Haven't you heard the saying?

503
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,050
Wearing bright colors is for ladies over sixty years old.

504
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,450
I'm not even close.

505
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:38,570
Old He, do you think I've become an old lady now?

506
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,860
You got me wrong. This is what I thought when I bought it.

507
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,979
I remember you were always in a red dress

508
00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:48,250
with cute braided hair when we were dating.

509
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,739
I'll carry it for you.

510
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:54,910
So the time you spent with him reminded you of many good memories of the past

511
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,000
which made you feel so sweet.

512
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,609
I couldn't call them sweet memories.

513
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:01,860
But I do remember the days when he was still quite caring.

514
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,569
He did change a lot.

515
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,879
I don't think he had a good life after he left.

516
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:10,950
For example, in the past he would have crumbs everywhere when he ate.

517
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,919
On the collar, clothes, and around his mouth.

518
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:16,300
I had to wipe and clean the whole place with napkins every time.

519
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,499
But not anymore.

520
00:36:18,499 --> 00:36:21,719
In the past when the two of us went out for a walk,

521
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:24,469
he would always go ahead of me without looking back.

522
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:27,500
He just looked around. I would even get angry sometimes. Not this time.

523
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,130
- He started to stop and wait for me to catch up this time.
- Come on.

524
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,429
But even though he has changed a lot,

525
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:38,470
I still resent him when I look at him.

526
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,289
He hurt me and my daughter greatly.

527
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:45,560
I don't think

528
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,420
my wounds can be healed easily.

529
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,620
Don't call me dad.

530

Let's leave this place where we broke our hearts and start all over again.

531
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,660
He Dun? Just send her to one of your relatives and let them raise her. Anyone. I don't care.

532
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,419
Jun Jun died because of me.

533
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:01,569
No.

534
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:05,219
Dun Dun is my child and she will stay with me.

535
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:08,500
So you are telling me your choice.

536
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,851
He just left us cold-bloodedly. He didn't care about us at all.

537
00:37:10,851 --> 00:37:12,659
Now he just showed up like nothing happened.

538
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:16,491
Does he have any idea how much he hurt me and hurt my daughter?

539
00:37:16,491 --> 00:37:19,150
Will Dun Dun even forgive him?

540
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,939
Auntie Zhao, I realized that your mood was calm

541
00:37:22,939 --> 00:37:25,019
when you were reminiscing about the past.

542
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:29,320
But once you mentioned your daughter's relationship with him you got very emotional.

543
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,899
I guess what you are really worried about

544
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:35,420
is not whether you can accept getting back together with him.

545
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,219
You're worried if your daughter can accept him

546
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:40,630
to be part of her life as her father again.

547
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:46,010
