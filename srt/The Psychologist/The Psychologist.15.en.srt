00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,410
Good morning, He Dun.

20
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,190
Good morning, Jiahui.

21
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,159
Today I cleaned my house and found some old books. So I'm here to ask if you need them.

22
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,610
What are those about?

23
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,730
All about psychiatry.

24
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,240
They look quite interesting.

25
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,160
Then I'll take them.

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,030
Are you studying bipolar disorder?

27
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,460
No, I'm helping my teacher translate a thesis recently.

28
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,160
Is it going well?

29
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,259
Just so-so. I'll get you a cup of coffee.

30
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,149
It's still controversial now if bipolar disorder or drug therapy

31
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:50,409
leads to cognitive function impairment.

32
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,080
Have you studied it?

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,490
Not really.

34
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:59,349
I read the experiment on bipolar disorder when I learned psychopharmacology.

35
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:03,130
The patients treated with lithium salt and sodium valproate

36
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,569
were measured respectively in cognitive function.

37
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,480
The result showed their physical performance and memory had been damaged.

38
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,729
Jiahui, do you know any medicine

39
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:15,189
that can reduce the side effect on cognitive function,

40
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:17,800
while relieving and treating clinical symptoms?

41
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,470
I don't think psychopharmacology is included in psychological counseling.

42
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,470
Recently, I'm translating the thesis.

43
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm suddenly interested in this aspect.

44
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,240
I think it may be the best solution to combine medicine

45
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,890
and non-medicine intervention.

46
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,120
- You mean…
- You're professional in the latter.

47
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,270
Bipolar disorder is called "disease of geniuses".

48
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,470
Many workers in the arts have higher rates.

49
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,709
Once they're in a maniac state, they'll become hyperactive and think they're quick-witted.

50
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:54,720
Meanwhile, they'll become hot-tempered.

51
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,220
Even if a trifle happens to them, they'll lose their temper and smash things,

52
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,730
which greatly harms social function.

53
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,680
When they're in a state of depression, it's even worse.

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,159
By the way, He Dun, have you ever met such a case?

55
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,679
No. My mentor knows something about it.

56
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:17,170
Your words have enlightened me.

57
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,280
Cognitive therapy,

58
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,640
cued recall training seems to be a good solution.

59
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,229
Those with mental disorders need to be intervened and treated with medicine.

60
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,099
But now, medicine brings many side effects.

61
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:36,949
So it'll also influence a counselor's judgment and therapy.

62
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:39,490
You might be confused.

63
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,410
Yeah. But fortunately, you inspired me.

64
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,899
Thanks, Jiahui.

65
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,110

66
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,040
Of course.

67

You gave me a breakthrough. My mentor will definitely become happy.

68

In fact, any program is the same for me.

79
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,980
You want to defeat Wang Zhuo with this program,

80
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,160
and I can also gain high viewings and attention.

81
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,920
We each get what we need.

82

So this time, I'm on your side.

Sister, I've changed my mind.

85
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:50,140
Dong said I didn't have a good idea of what the program was about.

86
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,000
I've reflected on it these two days.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,510
I finally know why our program is stuck in second place.

88
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,110
Our program puts too much emphasis on preaching.

89
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,969
We didn't sympathize with listeners wholeheartedly and interact with them.

90
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:03,359
Each episode focused on what we wanted to talk about.

91
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:07,369
And mostly, we told them how to solve it from the perspective of science.

92
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:12,519
We didn't go into their hearts and know if they learned anything from our program

93
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,480
or what else they needed.

94
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,280
Okay, I don't care about the details.

95

Why are you so serious?

I've given you no matter how much you want.

How dare you borrow money from a loan shark?

I think you just take a few of us as your tools for revenge.

162
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,319
Yes. I planned the Night Talk to Your Heart,

163
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:04,340
found He Dun, and did all other things just to get back the Time Interview.

164
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,080
Can't I?

165
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:13,961
Brother Qian.

166
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,419
Why don't you go out to eat with them?

167
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:21,309
Don't you want to see good comments? I haven't sorted them out.

168
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:22,280
I'm to blame.

169
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,690
It's fine. I've stored a lot of Hot and Sour Rice Noodles.

170
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,060
I'm happy with it.

171
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,110
Then I'm leaving now.

172
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,610
Xiao Li,

173
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,779
do you think what I said to Dong is too much?

174
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,960
It was indeed harsh,

175
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,200
but I think you were right.

176
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,859
A psychological counselor can study and share

177
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:48,440
the cases without visitors' information.

178
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,320
Look, Freud wrote books.

179
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,110
But we shouldn't ask Miss He to do this.

180
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,350
It's up to her whether to share them.

181
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,380
Do you think so?

182
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,340
So I feel you're stuck here because of this.

183
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:10,359
In your eyes, we can't force Miss He to sacrifice herself

184
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:12,310
with moral standards for our program's interests.

185
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,299
Yes. Here is another reason.

186
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:20,470
Counseling therapy may cost a few months and even a few years.

187
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,420
Even if Miss He is willing to share cases,

188
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,100
she can't keep up with our release rate of one episode every three weeks.

189
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,810
It isn't a long-lasting plan.

190
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,010
You're right.

191
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:34,759
Brother Qian, when I sorted out good comments I found a top comment.

192
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:38,369
A woman said her husband's sister moved to their house.

193
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:43,289
When her husband comes back every day, his sister will stick to him and even want kisses.

194
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:44,710
She's an adult now.

195
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:49,119
But she still wants to sleep with him, which is troubling her.

196
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:54,019
So she wants to ask us if there is any way to persuade his sister out of being so selfish.

197
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:56,280
A matter of love?

198
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,840
I don't think so.

199
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,739
The most popular comment on that seems to be given by a psychological counselor,

200
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:06,710
asking her to go to the hospital with her family

201
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,520
because she might contract severe postpartum depression

202
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,509
and saying that her husband's sister maybe his daughter.

203
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,190
[Real Cases]

204
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,850
Throw it aside.

205
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,539
- Tang Tang, did you have a good day today?
- Yes.

206
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,650
It's said a child with a mother will be treasured,

207
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,740
but I really think I'm even inferior to rubbish.

208
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,439
Even netizens know you're a mistress. How dare you still pester Director Cao?

209
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:26,380
Aren't you afraid of being scolded?

210
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,419
She's dressed so thinly. Looks like she's a mistress of a rich man.

211
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,570
B*tch!

212
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,340
- Hello, Professor Ji.
- Hello.

213
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,130
Sit down, please.

214
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,449
I didn't expect you to meet me here.

215
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:18,590
Is this place special?

216
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,509
One of my students has a part-time job here.

217
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:23,670
She's doing a radio program.

218
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,840
The Night Talk to Your Heart?

219
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,769
My chief editor often mentioned it and asked us to listen to it.

220
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,840
Miss He is young yet brilliant.

221
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,390
She's made some achievements both in the radio program and in psychological counseling.

222
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,609
I guess she must be one of your best students that you're proud of.

223
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:42,879
Not really, but she's indeed brilliant.

224
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,469
- Then Professor Ji, shall we begin now?
- Okay.

225
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,910
This interview is mainly about the plan for your new book.

226
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:54,769
You're a leading authority in psychology and the president of the Psychological Association in City H.

227
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:59,339
The news of your book coming out instantly attracted a lot of attention in the industry.

228
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,579
Miss Reporter, don't flatter me anymore.

229
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:07,300
Can you divulge some exclusive information to the readers

230
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,360
eagerly awaiting your new book?

231
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,840
This book is known to the public recently,

232
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,809
but I long ago started to prepare for it.

233
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:21,609
I think you must have put a lot of effort into this book.

234
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,539
Then, inspired by one of my friends, I wanted to write this book.

235
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:31,280
I realized educating the public about psychology

236
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,400
is an important matter

237
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,520
that concerns health and even life,

238
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,629
and it's also the responsibility that I should take.

239
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:44,640
Then is your friend male or female?

240
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,179
Does it matter?

241
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,339
Sorry, Professor Ji. Go ahead.

242
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,979
But it isn't easy to introduce a complicated subject to the public.

243
00:15:53,979 --> 00:15:57,550
My previous books are mainly for discussion among

244
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,410
workers in this industry.

245
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,470
But this book is designed to

246
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,230
explain some intricate expertise in a way

247
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,259
that makes it easier for the public to understand and analyze.

248
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,180
This book sounds highly recommendable.

249
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,739
But I want to know how you get time off

250
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:19,679
the work of the association to write this book?

251
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,590
Of course, it's toilsome,

252
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,960
but I let my student take part in my work.

253
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,339
I'm also looking forward to releasing it in half a year.

254
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:33,150
Is that student He Dun?

255
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,470
Yes.

256
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,899
She is not only my student, but also my right hand.

257
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:42,199
As the public says, your relationship is pretty good.

258
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:46,439
I've taught her for so long. So I take her as my biological daughter.

259
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:51,030
It's a kind of a salve for the regret

260
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,520
that you have no children, right?

261
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,150
How about your sweetheart?

262
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,400
Have you ever loved anyone?

263
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,880
No.

264
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,560
I've taught her for so long.

265
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,609
So I take her as my biological daughter.

266
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,880
Have you ever loved anyone?

267
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,360
No.

268
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,029
As the public says, your relationship is pretty good.

269
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,679
Never loved anyone?

270
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,160
Why did you say that?

271
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,769
Lili, did you touch the files in the cabinet?

272
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,570
No.

273
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,140
You asked me not to touch the cabinet with visitors' files inside.

274
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,230
Something happened?

275
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,280
No.

276
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,940
It's raining outside. Take care.

277
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,409

You've got a fever.

290
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,660
Careful.

291
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,059
Are you dizzy? Wait for me.

292
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,259
Here you are. Take this medicine.

293

Are you okay?

294
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,810
Thank you.

295
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,409
If you really want to thank me, please choose a place

296
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:42,130
where I can support you easily when you faint again, okay?

297
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,470
Take this medicine and go back to sleep.

298
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,439
Just now you were speaking in your dream.

Really?

300
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,419
What did I say?

301
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:59,930
You called out for your Mom.

302
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,280
Anything else?

303
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,680
No.

304
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,170
What happened to your mom?

305
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:18,200
You're a psychological counselor good at analyzing people's subconsciousness.

306
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,020
Can you tell me why I always feel I was dead

307
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,000
at the age of seven?

308
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,580
What happened then?

309
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:37,090
At that time, my mom abandoned me and left.

310
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,060
She's never appeared in front of me since then.

311

I'll leave this sad place with you and my mom and start our new life.

...and start our new life. Your choice?

318
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,680
You haven't answered

319
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,019
why I always feel I was dead at the age of seven?

320
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,609
Although I'm a counselor, I only analyze my visitors' problems.

321
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,710
I can't answer yours.

00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,349
Thanks. I'm going back now.

325
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:47,950
Wait.

326
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,209
This is my Telesphorus.
(T/N: A god of healing)

327
00:23:02,209 --> 00:23:04,730
It belongs to you now.

328
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:09,059
I remember when I was a child, I got sick once. My mom gave it to me.

329
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,040
Probably because of the psychological effect,

330
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,869
I recovered soon after sleeping with it in my arms.

331
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:16,350
Since then, it has become my patron saint.

332
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,000
I brought it with me, wherever I went.

333
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,140
Now, I give it to you.

334
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,029
It's so important to you. Why did you give it to me?

335
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:31,499
It's just a statue, a symbol.

336
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:34,160
I hope that you will recover soon.

337
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,780
Thanks.

338
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,700
I'll take it then.

339
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,770
Amend this.

340
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,880
Okay, there is no rush.

341
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,420
Have you found it?

342
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,830
I'm going downstairs.

343
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,440
Hello, everyone.

344
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,130
I've been here for a week.

345
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,070
Thanks for helping me during this period.

346
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,130
Tonight, I want to invite you to a meal.

347
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,170
Great!

348
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,900
I've sent the time and place into the group chat.

349
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,930
If you're free, please come.

350
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,160
No problem. Let's take it as a group activity.

351
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,040
- You can also bring your boyfriend.
- Okay.

352
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,830
People who can't drink agreed first.

353
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,229
- I'm really bad at drinking.
- Me, too.

354
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:38,670
- Don't toast me.
- I'm also bad at it.

355
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,230
Come on.

356
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,559
- What do you want to eat tonight?
- Something spicy.

357
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,110
The noodles in that restaurant are very delicious.

358
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:56,069
Brother Mo, at 8:30 tonight, you have to come.

359
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,500
Me?

360
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,250
Okay.

361
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,159
Welcome. Washing your hair?

362
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:16,310
Welcome!

363
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,060
- Sir, do you want your hair cut or washed?
- Cut.

364
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,520
Then I have to wash it first.

365
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,690
Which price do you want, ¥50 or ¥80?

366
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,920
- Either is fine.
- Then how about ¥100?

367
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,280
The imported hair conditioner…

368
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,020
There is no need. ¥50 is enough.

369
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,460
Okay.

370
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,520
Sir, your hair is good.

371
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,170
Why not have a hairstyle?

372
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,580
People at your age look quite fashionable with this hairstyle.

373
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,309
Okay, I'll have a look.

374
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:45,269
I think the Korean hairstyle suits you well, making you look younger.

375
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:47,310
Now, college students all have this hairstyle.

376
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,680
It's inexpensive and easy to fix.

377
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,069
When you wake up, dip your fingers in the water and run them through your hair.

378
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:53,560
It's suitable for workers.

379
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,819
How much?

380
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,810
A perm isn't expensive. Only ¥388.

381
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,310
Its price varies with colors.

382
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,429
The most important part of this hairstyle is color.

383
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:02,230
Any other price?

384
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,030
Yes. ¥588, ¥688, and ¥788.

385
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,761
I suggest you use a better potion.

386
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:09,869
Then your hair won't fade and this hairstyle can last longer.

387
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:12,110
Its color is quite bright.

388
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,140
Then I'll choose…

389
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,040
¥588.

390
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,610
It's ¥976 in total.

391
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,080
There is a promotion in our shop. Pay ¥1,000 and get ¥1,000 for free.

392
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,149
I suggest you buy a card with ¥1,000 rather than just pay the fee.

393
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:27,839
You'll get¥ 2,000 in the card. You can also enjoy this service if you come again.

394
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,110
I think it's too complicated.

395
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,880
I just want a haircut today.

396
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,560
But...

397
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,629
Sir, didn't you say you wanted a hairstyle?

398
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:36,609
I used an advanced shampoo product.

399
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:38,310
It's for doing your hair.

400
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,250
This product is included in the hairstyle package.

401
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,649
You don't need such an expensive product if you just want a haircut.

402
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:47,041
If my boss knows it, I'll be scolded. I'm also a worker like you.

403
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,070
Please do me this favor.

404
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,280
Fine.

405
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,230
There is another activity in our shop.

406
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,920
The advanced hair maintenance can also be free.

407
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,110
If you pay ¥5,000 and become an advanced member of our shop,

408
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,170
you'll have your hair washed for free when you come again and get this shampoo product.

409
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,710
No need. I'm not living nearby. I just passed by here.

410
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,760
This is a chain store.

411
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,019
You can use this card everywhere.

412
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:11,280
Besides, the price isn't high.

413
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,180
If you have money left in it, you can also give it to your friends. It's very cost-effective.

414
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,190
I have no friends.

415
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,750
What did you say, sir? You agree?

416
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,160
Then I'll help you register for a card.

417
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,100
In the future, come to me if you want your hair washed.

418
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,779
May I have your Wechat? Let's make friends. I'm Tony Two.

419
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:25,680
I'll be in charge of your hair in the future.

420
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,149
Tony Two?

421
00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:28,430
Quite special, right?

422
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,450
It means I equate to two barbers.

423
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,510
Indeed.

424
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,530
This way.

425
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,300
¥5,000.

426
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,100
It's your platinum membership card.

427
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,180
Your bag.

428
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,930
I'll help you put it on.

429
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,099
Take care, Sir. Come to me next time.

430
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,830
The food… The food is almost ready.

431
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,059
We're coming.

432
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,160
Finally.

433
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

434
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,569
- It doesn't matter. Just in time.
- It's okay.

435
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:10,510
If it isn't enough, we can order more.

436
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,809
- Thanks for your treatment.
- Thanks.

437
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:15,790
It's definitely enough.

438
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,780
You're finally here.

439
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,640
Welcome.

440
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,830
Everyone in our company is here, right?

441
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,010
Sorry, I'm late.

442
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,190
Wish our company a smooth growth.

443
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,680
Cheers!

444
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,910
This wine is good, right?

445
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,859
What a hearty breakfast! You've changed?

446
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,760
I think you're hiding something from me.

447
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,300
Am I?

448
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,350
I'm going for an interview today.

449
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,140
An interview?

450
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,599
Congratulations, you're finally out of seclusion.

451
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:58,979
I'm relieved to see your studio on the right track.

452
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:00,560
I'm going back to my business, too.

453
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,160
Wait a minute.

454
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,450
Seeing the happiness on your face, I smell the scent of love.

455
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,240
Really?

456
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,469
I think it's from you.

457
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:14,110
What's wrong with me?

458
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,529
Is it Qian Kaiyi's Aquamarine

459
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:22,129
or Ye Jiahui's Cedarwood?

460
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:25,189
Watch your mouth. I have a visitor to see later. I have no time to gossip with you.

461
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:27,330
Don't you have any visitors today?

462
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,100
I'm leaving now.

463
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,920
Clean the table.

464
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,039
Three cups of Three Brothers, two with less sugar and one with regular sugar…

465
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,490
Hello. What do you want, sir?

466
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,540
Hello. Three cups of Three Brothers, two with less sugar and one with regular sugar.

467
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,429
Two cups of original-taste tea with milk, both with quarter sugar, one of which is ice-free.

468
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:05,229
One cup of red bean milk tea, ice-free and with regular sugar.

469
00:32:05,229 --> 00:32:07,610
Okay. It'll be served soon. Please wait here for a moment.

470
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,990
Thanks.

471
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,310
I really drank too much yesterday.

472
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,000
It's a pity that Mo wasn't there.

473
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,479
Otherwise, he could help me.

474
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:23,460
Yeah, why was he absent?

475
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,830
Have a cup of milk tea.

476
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,850
- Thanks.
- Take care.

477
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,670
Thanks.

478
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,590
Hi.

479
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,430
I passed by a milk tea shop and bought you a cup.

480
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,810
Thanks.

481
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,259
Here you are. Do you drink the one with half sugar?

482
00:32:58,259 --> 00:32:59,880
Thanks, Brother Mo.

483
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,800
You, too?

484
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,479
Last night, you didn't tell him that it was me who asked you to change the room, did you?

485
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:08,219
Yes. I didn't even mention it.

486
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,800
- He didn't ask me, either.
- Thank you, Brother Mo.

487
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,419
Brother Mo, why did you get a perm?

488
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:17,359
I passed by a barber shop and got a hairstyle.

489
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,860
- It looks good.
- Yeah.

490
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,959
Brother Mo, thank you.

491
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,960
What a pity that you were absent yesterday!

492
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,400
It doesn't matter.

493
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,999
- Last night, something happened in my family. So I couldn't go…
- It's okay.

494
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:32,580
Let's go together next time.

495
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,410
Brother Mo, how much is it? I'll transfer it to you.

496
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,750
Sister Yu, there is no need. I-I just bought it on the way.

497
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,630
You must take the money next time.

498
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:46,190
Xiao Mo, I'll treat you with coffee tomorrow.

499
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,029
- Thanks, Brother Mo.
- Thanks, Brother Mo.

500
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:50,830
- Don't mention it.
- Thanks, Brother Mo.

501
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,930
Check your phone.

502
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,309
- Let's continue tonight.
- Okay.

503
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:12,899
I won't drink tonight. My stomach can't bear it.

504
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,190
Only singing, and no drinking today.

505
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,619
I think that's good, but here is a request.

506
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:20,620
- No one is allowed to choose "King of Love Songs".
- Okay.

507
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,619
You can sing whatever you want. It doesn't matter.

508
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:25,470
What time is it today?

509
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,690
- 8:30.
- 8:30?

510
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,710
How about you?

511
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:34,830
Hello, Grandma. I'll be back later tonight. Eat with Grandpa first.

512
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,359
No, it isn't because of working overtime, tonight.

513
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:40,710
My friends will perhaps ask me out.

514
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,169
Brother Mo, we're leaving now.

515
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:54,220
- Brother Mo.
Bye, Brother Mo. See you tomorrow.

516
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,240
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

517
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,450
- Bye, Sister Yu.
- Bye.

518
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,950
- Thanks for your hard work.
- See you tomorrow.

519
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,180
Let's go to the same place as yesterday?

520
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,040
Any food left at home?

521
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,610
Forget it.

522
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:17,950
Well, just now, we talked about family relationships,
[The Marvelous Snail]

523
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,549
how to communicate effectively between parents and children,

524
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:24,269
and whether to keep a proper distance among family responsibilities.

525
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:26,819
Brother Mo, are you still at the company?

526
00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:28,779
Boss suddenly asked me to send a proposal to him.

527
00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:31,859
I have the text on my computer. Can you help me with the slides?

528
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:34,430
Thanks a lot. I really can't go back.

529
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,529
We have a listener here who asked how to define

530
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:42,660
a proper distance among people.

531
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,849
I think besides in family,

532
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:48,320
in workplace, society, and even school,

533
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,760
we all need to…
[All right, I'll head back.]

534
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,159
I got a message from someone.

535
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:58,159
It's about one of his recent worries.

536
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,639
He said that in order to forge a good relationship with his colleagues,

537
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:04,100
he often prepared breakfast for them.

538
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,470
At first, they appreciated it.

539
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:09,559
But as time goes by, they're used to his kindness.

540
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:13,259
We don't have to be reasonable all the time to create harmony.

541
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:16,369
We need to have the guts to readily admit our weakness

542
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:20,150
in some aspects once in a while.

543
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,129
The key to maintaining interpersonal relationships is respecting yourselves, instead of catering to others.

544
00:36:33,129 --> 00:36:37,120
Everyone, if you need psychological counselling,

545
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,699
go to Miss He's Studio of Happy Talk and receive professional help.

546
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,370
- Miss He.
- Mr. Mo, hello.

547
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,790
Hello.

548
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,920
- Please come in.
-Thank you.

549
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,440
- Have some water.
- Thanks.

550
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,759
I… This is your seat, right?

551
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,430
It doesn't matter.

552
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,759
Mr. Mo, please take a look at this.

553
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,800
I'd like to introduce myself formally.

554
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,500
Hello, Mr. Mo. I'm He Dun. Nice to meet you.

555
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,719
Nice to meet you, too.

556
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,530
Have a seat.

557
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:41,029
Well, I've read the questionnaire you filled out before.

558
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:42,800
This is your first counseling.

559
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,879
So I'll perhaps ask many questions to set the goal of your future counseling.

560
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:49,659
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

561
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:53,220
May I ask you why you came here?

562
00:38:53,980 --> 00:39:00,300
Well, I'm the one who doesn't know how to say no to others as you said on the radio.

563
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,800
Well...

564
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,710
Sorry, I'm not eloquent.

565
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,670
It doesn't matter. Take your time.

566
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,049
When didn't you know how to say no to others?

567
00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:13,739
When my colleagues ask me for a favor, but I also had my work to do.

568
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:18,850
But every time, I eventually agree in confusion.

569
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,219
I need to take notes during the counseling. Sorry.

570
00:39:25,219 --> 00:39:27,830
It doesn't matter. Go ahead.

571
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,150
How many times does it happen a day?

572
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:34,010
About three to five times.

573
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:36,760
- Do you agree every time?
- Yes.

574
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,450
Can you give me an example?

575
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,030
Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you.

576
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,420
Xiao Mo, if you haven't arrived at the company, could you please bring me a cup of latte?

577
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,060
I want a cup of Cappuccino. A large cup of ice-free American coffee. I want a defatted one.

578
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,800
What were you thinking?

579
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,150
I needed to go right now.

580
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,049
It's your final decision.

581
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:13,740
Before making the decision, didn't you have any other thought?

582
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,430
In fact, I didn't want to go.

583
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,430
I see.

584
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:22,199
You actually felt in your heart it was a trouble for you.

585
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,679
Excuse me. Thanks.

586
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:27,169
It was raining heavily that day. I was drenched.

587
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:30,939
I finally arrived at the company. But they suddenly asked me to buy coffee.

588
00:40:30,939 --> 00:40:34,669
Xiao Mo, if you haven't arrived at the company, could you please bring me a cup of latte?

589
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:38,110
I want a cup of Cappuccino.
- A large cup of ice-free American coffee. I want a defatted one.

590
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,299
I'd actually like to take off or blow dry my clothes.

591
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:52,390
Your clothes were wet, so you didn't want to go.

592
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,929
But in the end, you still went. Is it right?

593
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,899
Mr. Mo, during the conversation with you, I found

594
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:05,670
you're used to placing others' needs over yours.

595
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,319
Miss He, I don't know the reason.

596
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:11,840
Sometimes I don't know how to refuse others.

597
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,090
What's more, I will even please others.

598
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,419
One day, a new colleague in the company invited everyone to dinner.

599
00:41:22,419 --> 00:41:25,119
But later they changed the address without telling me.

600
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,290
Sorry, I'm late.

601
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,190
That night,

602
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,080
I didn't sleep all night.

603
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,899
I kept thinking what I did wrong that they hated me so much.

604
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:43,499
But you know what? The next day. I still bought milk tea for the whole company.

605
00:41:43,499 --> 00:41:46,869
I didn't know why I did that. It was them who made a mistake.

606
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:49,589
- After buying milk tea?
- They said they wanted to have fun together.

607
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:51,759
But that night, they didn't invite me to the karaoke party.

608
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,520
One of them even asked me to help her with the slides.

609
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,190
Did you do it?

610
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,850
Yes.

611
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:06,019
If you had refused her request, what do you think would have been the worst outcome?

612
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,870
It's okay, Mr. Mo.

613
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:19,099
Let's play a simple game to relax. What do you think?

614
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:22,089
Okay. What do you want me to do?

615
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:23,280
Don't worry.

616
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,860
You just need to take me as your colleague who often asks you for help.

617
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,690
What is she like? Can you give me a rough description?

618
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,360
She's quite competent.

619
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,419
Our boss thinks highly of her. So she has a lot of tasks.

620
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,560
But many of them were done by me.

621
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,700
I see.

622
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,799
Please try your best to imagine me as her and talk to me, okay?

623
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:44,760
I'll do my best.

624
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,560
Xiao Mo.

625
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,810
Are you free now?

626
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,510
The psychological counseling cases in this TV series are artistically stylized for visual presentation purposes. Please seek help from professional psychological counseling institutions if you encounter similar cases or have other psychological distress.
