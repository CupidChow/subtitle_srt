I found you.

People are happy because of a secretion from the brain called dopamine.

For example, eating our favorite food, getting plenty of sleep,

caressing pets and being in a relationship.

00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,910
- Are you all right?
- Why does this man look like this?

160
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,450
Why does he look like this after a little drink?

161
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,899
- Lili, Call 120.
- Okay!

162
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:51,459
Break it up. Give us some room.

163
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,280
Guys, give us some room. Come on.

164
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,379
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. He Dun, how did he pass out just now?

165
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:59,260
Let me do it.

166
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,199
The patient drank a lot of alcohol after taking tranquilizers,

167
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:03,010
which caused a respiratory disturbance and caused him to be in shock now.

168
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,710
He's being given CPR right now. Please come quickly.

169
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,770
Let me do it, thanks.

170
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,699
- Isn't she the psychological counselor last time?
- Yes.

171
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:12,870
- The one on the trending topic list.
- It seems to be her.

172
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,019
- Film her quickly.
- Film quickly.

173
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,900
What are you guys doing? Go away, guys. Break it up.

174
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,930
What are you doing? A dense crowd is not good for first aid.

175
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,109
I tell you what, you'll be held liable for holding up first aid.

176
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,190
Come on, break up!

177
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,709
Remember, never drink if you've taken medicine next time.

178
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,890
Contact me if you need any help.

179
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,650
Thank you.

180
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,129
Mister, I suggest you go to the hospital.

181
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:07,799
For such a minor injury? I'm fine.

182
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,289
- All right, thanks.
- You are welcome.

183
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,760
The man who passed out just now had taken tranquilizers for treating sleep disorders.

184
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,869
That bro has nine lives.

185
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,540
If it hadn't been for you, he'd have lost his life for sure.

186
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,670
Babe, you are awesome.

187
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,929
Why do I feel my dopamine feast is saving people?

188
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:43,339
Even if I'm granted an Arab prince now, he wouldn't make me feel that way.

189
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:47,360
As I see it, if you are really granted an Arab prince, you might as well take him.

190
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,400
That wouldn't hold you up for saving people, right?

191
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,260
Wait for me here. Don't move. I'll go get the car.

192
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,769
How can you drive after drinking?

193
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:57,009
I've called a substitute driver. Don't move.

194
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,690
- Be safe.
- I got it.

195
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,220
Where is he?

196
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,719
What's wrong with you, kitty? You are stuck underneath, aren't you?

197
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:04,779
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid. Let me have a look.

198
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,450
It hurts. It hurts, doesn't it?

199
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,940
Careful.

200
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,570
Done.

201
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,110
You are free.

202
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,719
Hello, Miss Chen.

203
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,110
Hello.

204
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,550
He Dun! He Dun!

205
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,400
Where is she?

206
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,039
Hello, Miss He Dun.
[Xiangnan High School]

207
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,299
I think my current suicidal impulse is 100 points.

208
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,389
Mr. Qian, I just wanted to talk with You Na about Xiao Zhe.

209
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:41,549
But she suddenly had a mood swing.

210
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,109
She's at the school's indoor swimming pool now.

211
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,250
Please come quickly.

212
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,060
You Na!

213
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,770
He Dun?

214
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,700
So you are He Dun.

215
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,719
Exactly.

216
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,780
I'm sorry. I didn't look at my cellphone,

217
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,010
- so I didn't get to see your—
- Don't come over!

218
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,109
Okay, all right, fine. I'm not going over.

219
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,509
I'll stay still. I'll stay still.

220
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,670
I'll stand here. I'll stay still.

221
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,199
Can you calm down for now?

222
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,309
I'll stay with you here all the time.

223
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,210
Take a deep breath with me first, okay?

224
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:26,230
Miss He, are you not upset about what people said about you in the video?

225
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,660
I knew it's you as soon as I heard your voice.

226
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,420
But you are obviously not like that. You've saved me before.

227
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,590
Why do they say such things about you?

228
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,979
Thank you, You Na. You still care about me now.

229
00:17:36,979 --> 00:17:39,430
But there are times when I'm thoughtless.

230
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,610
No.

231
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,839
This is how the world is like.

232
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,979
No matter how well you do, people who don't believe you just won't believe you.

233
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:49,690
You Na!

234
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,390
You Na!

235
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,570
[Lockers]

236
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,660
You Na.

237
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,230
Up.

238
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,030
Miss He!

239
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,250
Miss He…

240
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,869
- Miss He!
- Miss He.

241
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,980
Miss He!

242
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,660
Miss He. Miss He!

243
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,370
Miss He!

244
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,330
Miss He.

245
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,339
Miss He! Miss He!

246
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,200
She's coming around.

247
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,250
Miss He!

248
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,920
Na Na!

249
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,949
Na Na, let me have a look. Did you get hurt?

250
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:11,309
No.

251
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,829
- You scared the hell out of me.
- Hello, is this 120?

252
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:15,760
- This… This is—
- Miss Chen.

253
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,759
She came around. Sorry, we no longer have such a need.

254
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,129
All right, okay, all right. Thanks.

255
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:23,629
Do you feel any better?

256
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,980
Aren't you…

257
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,009
I'm Qian Kaiyi. You Na's substitute teacher.

258
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:32,760
I answered your call the other day.

259
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,029
Sorry, Miss He. It's all my fault.

260
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,550
You Na's mother!

261
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,709
Please rest assured that the school will do its best to cooperate with the investigation.

262
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:51,999
Miss Chen, it's not that I'm intent on making trouble for you today.

263
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:54,393
Such a big thing happened, one after another.

264
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:57,339
This is a child who's about to take the college entrance exam. She can't stand such screwups.

265
00:21:57,339 --> 00:21:58,892
Yes, yes, yes.

266
00:21:58,893 --> 00:22:01,289
But at first, we arranged art classes

267
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:03,729
with the intention of balancing the children's grades in academic subjects.

268
00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:06,641
To save them from running between two places, we provide a free venue.

269
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:08,410
We didn't expect it'd cause so many accidents.

270
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,779
- It's indeed our inconsiderateness—
- Forget it.

271
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:12,829
You Na's mother, let's have a word in private.

272
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:15,200
It's all right. Just say it here if you've got anything to say.

273
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,059
Today, the school's counseling office did an assessment on You Na.

274
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:22,429
Their preliminary suggestion is to let You Na go through professional psychotherapy.

275
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:25,719
Is that necessary? I brought Na Na up since she was a baby.

276
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,339
If you really challenge her to jump to her death, she wouldn't dare.

277
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:31,410
- But today she has twice—
- You Na's mother,

278
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,529
if you have any need for psychological counseling later, you can contact me through the school's teacher.

279
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:39,190
Of course, I hope you won't need it.

280
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,660
Thank you.

281
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,989
Miss Chen. No matter what happens,

282
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:45,270
I hope you can give me an explanation as soon as possible and give Na Na an explanation as well.

283
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,180
Yes, yes, yes.

284
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,219
- Otherwise, I'll certainly talk to Director Wu of the Education Bureau—
- Na Na!

285
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,030
Dad.

286
00:22:59,737 --> 00:23:01,427
Are you all right?

287
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,120
Sorry, I'm late.

288
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:12,700
Well, s-sorry to bring you guys trouble with what happened to Na Na today.

289
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,829
By the way, I think it's quite normal for children to have a quarrel.

290
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:21,520
Don't be hard on the other child as well.

291
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,629
- After all, they are about to take the college entrance exam, and they—
- Na Na!

292
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:27,280
Na Na!

293
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,940
- You'd better care about your own daughter in the first place.
- Na Na!

294
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,440
You Na's mother, please wait a minute.

295
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,829
You Na's mother, can I have a word with you?

296
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,639
Look at this. This is a photo provided by Mr. Qian.

297
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:49,660
It's a photo of You Na taken by other students.

298
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,519
Actually, before you and the police arrived, I had persuaded her to come down.

299
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,279
But it doesn't mean the situation at that time was not dangerous,

300
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:00,119
nor does it mean she didn't want to jump or dared not jump.

301
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,140
That is totally different from what happened in the indoor swimming pool today in nature.

302
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,599
Besides, I've only solved her current crisis.

303
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,059
I can't guarantee she won't have such thoughts in the coming days.

304
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,639
So make sure to keep an eye on what she'll be doing when at home.

305
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,129
All right. I got it.

306
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,299
If it's convenient, could I also have a word with You Na?

307
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,060
Sure.

308
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,560
Thanks.

309
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,406
You Na.

310
00:24:31,376 --> 00:24:33,536
Can I ask you a question?

311
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,090
How did you know I am the operator who answered your call to the Suicide Intervention Center?

312
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,709
You have a nice voice. I'm studying broadcasting and hosting.

313
00:24:43,709 --> 00:24:47,119
I'm sensitive to voices and remember yours after listening to it once.

314
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,790
I see.

315
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,229
Go home early to change your clothes. In case you catch a cold.

316
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,289
Thank you for what you did today. We are going for now.

317
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,749
Miss He, thank you for coming to the school today.

318
00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:24,969
Had you not saved You Na in time, we'd have to take a bigger share of responsibility.

319
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:28,940
Don't mention it. I was just doing something as my capacity allows.

320
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,180
As your capacity allows? You almost lost your breath.

321
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,799
Yes, yes, yes. Also thank you to Mr. Kaiyi for showing up in time to save Miss He.

322
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,760
That's what I should do.

323
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,720
I'm going for now if there's nothing left for me.

324
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,459
Don't rush. It's so dark at night. Where are you going to find a car?

325
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,929
Let me give you a ride home on my motorbike.

326
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,259
No, thanks. My friend is waiting for me.

327
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,129
Go. This is not the only thing you owe me anyway.

328
00:25:57,129 --> 00:25:59,980
Mr. Qian, Miss He, you guys are wet.

329
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,899
If you ride a motorbike all the way home, you'll certainly catch a cold.

330
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:07,649
I have a couple of brand new school uniforms with me. Why don't you wear them for now?

331

♫  Listen to the melody of the wind  ♫

332
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:49,550
♫  Slowly blowing off leaves from the trees  ♫

333
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:54,829
♫  Look at the clear sunshine  ♫

334
00:26:54,829 --> 00:27:01,670
♫  Hurried brushing passed your figure  ♫

335
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:19,710
♫  That little secret deep in my heart  ♫

336
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:25,630
♫  That melancholic but beautiful rainy season  ♫

337
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,590
♫  That parting despite the attachment which has to be faced  ♫

00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:37,510
♫  Those bits and pieces, those memories  ♫

♫  That pen I borrowed from you but didn't return  ♫

00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:49,740
♫  Those questions whose answers I pretend to know  ♫

00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,070
♫  That sigh I saw inadvertently  ♫

342
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,400
Are you good at riding or not?

343
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,520
I asked whether you can do it or not.

344
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,829
You must be kidding. Have you heard of God of Motor Racing on Qiuming Mountain?

345
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:06,140
What mountain?

346
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,140
God of Motor Racing on Qiuming Mountain.

347
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,329
God of Motor Racing on Qiuming Mountain, pull off the road. Pull off the road.

348
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:16,910
Did you hear me? God of Motor Racing on Qiuming Mountain, please pull off the road.

[Profile of Anchorman Qian Kaiyi]

350
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,410
Is this you?

351
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:30,320
Sir, this is me indeed. My ID is soaked in water.

352
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,540
And she didn't even bring hers.

353
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,050
Yes, sir.

354
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,109
If you don't believe him, you can believe me.

355
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:37,450
What he said just now is all true.

356
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,080
You kids, don't do this with me.

357
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,280
Instead of sleeping at home at night, you sneaked out for a date

358
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,779
and don't focus your mind on schoolwork.

359
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:51,325
We've caught two high school students. Underage people driving a motor vehicle.

360
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:53,550
We are going to take them back now.

361
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,779
I've got you guys. God of Motor Racing on Qiuming Mountain.

362
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:59,070
- Take them away.
- All right.

363
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,020
Go with me, guys.

364
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,880
God of Motor Racing on Qiuming Mountain.

365
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,420
Go.

366
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,380
He Dun.

367
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,399
- Lili. You've come to get me out.
- What was going on?

368
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,000
Sister.

369
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,740
What are you guys doing?

370
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,999
- Who's their family member?
- Me.

371
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:16,279
Come in to sign your names.

372
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:18,449
Hello, sir. I'm his colleague.

373
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:22,299
This is Qian Kaiyi, announcer of Haifeng Radio International.

374
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,039
Sir, I'm her friend.

375
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,810
This is psychological counselor He Dun.

376
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,819
All right. Come in to sign your names.

377
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,400
Aren't you a teacher?

378
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,970
A part-time one.

379
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,729
Actually, before you and the police arrived, I had persuaded her to come down.

380
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:05,339
But it doesn't mean the situation at that time was not dangerous,

381
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:09,250
nor does it mean she didn't want to jump or dared not jump.

382
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,820
That is totally different from what happened in the indoor swimming pool today in nature.

383
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,279
Besides, I've only solved her current crisis.

384
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:18,159
I can't guarantee she won't have such thought in the coming days.

385
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,470
Good for you.

386
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,059
You left me in the middle of the night and went for cosplay with others.

387
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,809
I'll tell you about it later.

388
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,580
Hello, I'm Tang Lili.

389
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,180
I'm Xiong Qiao.

390
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,110
By the way, I forgot to introduce myself.

391
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,260
I'm Qian Kaiyi.

392
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,180
I'm an anchor of Haifeng Radio International.

393
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,520
You've introduced yourself just now.

394
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,329
Would you like me to give you a ride?

395
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,019
No, thanks. My friend drove her car here.

396
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,990
What about you?

397
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,109
No need, thanks.

398
00:31:57,109 --> 00:31:59,190
Don't forget about your proper business.

399
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,920
Thank you, Sister.

400
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,750
- Let's go too.
- All right.

401
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,279
Come to think of it, well,

402
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,259
my colleague asked me if you know any professional psychological counselors.

403
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:14,759
She'd like to have psychological counseling.

404
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:17,260
Miss He, can you do that?

405
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,400
A psychological counseling session needs to be done in a professional counseling office.

406
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,839
I've left Yunkai. I can't do it at the moment.

407
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:28,039
By the way, please leave your contact number.

408
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,899
Didn't you say I can contact you if You Na's mother needs any help?

409
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:35,160
We don't have each other's contact number.

410
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,070
Your cellphone.

411
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,000
Thanks.

412
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,800
We are going then.

413
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,630
Bye.

414
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,409
Careful. Put it over there.

415
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,160
Yes, put it over there.

416
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,190
Be careful, okay?

417
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,850
Yes, put it over there. Thanks.

418
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,290
- Lili.
- You've got up.

419
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,699
- Isn't this my dormitory painting?
- Yes.

420
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:33,310
These boxes and these clothes are all yours.

421
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,190
Why? Are you afraid I'm doing charity by taking you in?

422
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,770
Let's make an oral agreement first. We'll split the rent.

423
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,729
- Well…
- Don't worry. I won't drop anything.

424
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,689
I've even packed the trash in your trash can for you.

425
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:48,620
And there's also a mysterious guest.

426
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,590
How could you ask Qian Kaiyi to come over to help?

427
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:57,470
- How did you know?
- Of course, I know.

428
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,649
Miss Dior Cherie Blooming Bouquet. I love this perfume too.

429
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,830
Your express delivery is here.

430
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:12,719
Could this box of Gundam models be wrongly delivered by the home-moving company?

431
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,930
Hello, Miss Dior.

432
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,810
Mr. Qian.

433
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,900
I'm not the Miss Dior today.

434
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,050
I've smelt it.

435
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,710
Why did you ask him to come over to help?

436
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,180
He said he was coming to ask you for help.

437
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,249
I said although He Dun is kind-hearted, she can't help you for nothing.

438
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:38,010
- Even so you can't…
- All right, all right.

439
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,180
I've got your SIM card changed.

440
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,790
I've been busy all day, only to get not a word of thanks from someone.

441
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,549
Stop, stop. I was kidding you. We are besties.

442
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:52,970
I'm not thanking you. I'm worshipping you.

443
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:56,229
Sure enough, a top-level executive secretary is quite something.

444
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:59,260
Everything I can and can't think of, you've got it ready for me beforehand.

445
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,259
We will be cohabiting from now on.

446
00:35:02,259 --> 00:35:05,080
I'll certainly wait on you hand and foot in the coming days.

447
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,730
Yes. So will my good life begin?

448
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,719
Will it be over after this round of moving?

449
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,990
Just leave it. Thank you, Mr. Qian.

450
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,810
Didn't you say you have something to ask for He Dun's help?

451
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,989
To be exact, it's not me. It's You Na's mother.

452
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,910
Na Na…

453
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,139
Na Na…

454
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,419
Mom...

455
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,669
Na Na… It's all right. I'm here.

456
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:57,810
It's all right. It's all right.

457
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,320
It's all right.

458
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,259
Miss He. Why must it be done in a counseling office?

459
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:37,670
Can't we find a quiet cafe as a workaround?

460
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,689
Just now You Na's mother called me and she was distraught.

461
00:36:40,689 --> 00:36:42,999
I don't think she would mind such a problem.

462
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:45,929
Shall I give her a call and communicate in advance?

463
00:36:45,929 --> 00:36:49,879
You Na's mother prefers a face-to-face psychological counseling session.

464
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:52,669
And now You Na only accepts your help.

465
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,359
Or we can find a VIP booth.

466
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,319
Isn't it just as quiet and with no disturbance?

467
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:00,479
Generally speaking, that is not allowed by the setting principle of counseling.

468
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:05,609
The surroundings for counseling entail a fixed place, a fixed frequency, and a fixed time.

469
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:09,580
Once the place changes back and forth, there would be a lot of uncontrollable factors.

470
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,670
Visitors would also have to adapt frequently.

471
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,629
They would become anxious, uneasy, and have no sense of security,

472
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:17,590
which is not a good thing for counseling.

473
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,840
I've suddenly come to think of something.

474
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,190
Didn't you save a sum of money to open an individual practice office?

475
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,779
You even got the license, but Mr. Wang made you stay.

476
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:28,359
Isn't this a good opportunity?

477
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:29,869
I've just quit my job.

478
00:37:29,869 --> 00:37:31,709
I haven't found a new workplace yet.

479
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:33,420
It's too hasty.

480
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,089
I think we can just vacate the living room on the first floor.

481
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:40,519
Anyway, I'm at work during the day and not at home. You can run your business.

482
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:41,709
Just in time.

483
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:43,769
But I just don't know if the space is big enough.

484
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:44,999
The space is big enough for sure.

485
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:47,879
Generally speaking, a counseling office only needs 10 to 12 square meters.

486
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:50,209
If it's too big, it'll make people feel insecure.

487
00:37:50,209 --> 00:37:52,450
If it's too small, it'll make people feel oppressive.

488
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,069
But this is too hasty for me.

489
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:57,600
I haven't figured it out yet.

490
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,190
Well, what else do you need to prepare?

491
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,929
Do you think any room can be a counseling office?

492
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:10,119
In a professional counseling office, all the details, including the layout of items, must follow particular rules.

493
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:13,079
For example, wall clocks and paintings,

494
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,279
the position and direction of the sofa

495
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:18,209
as well as its softness, these all have particular rules to follow.

496
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:21,019
But sister, your first client has come to the door

497
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:22,770
and you are still hesitating about whether to open your business or not.

498
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,099
I really… Do you want to be out of a job all the time?

499
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:28,980
Let me correct you. It's not a client. It's called visitor.

500
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,649
But I think Lili has a point in what she said just now.

501
00:38:31,649 --> 00:38:36,139
Just like giving birth to a baby, how can there be so many well-prepared parents in the world?

502
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:39,380
It's the same with starting a business. Who's not crossing the river by feeling the stone?

503
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,949
You just do it while feeling your way.

504
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:44,109
Yes, let's do it. Go.

505
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:46,099
Waitress. Takeout, please.

506
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:47,709
Waitress, bill please.

507
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:48,970
Where are we going?

508
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,860
Going shopping.

509
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,079
He Dun, I tell you what, we must hurry up today.

510
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,759
You Na is coming the day after tomorrow. I can only take a day off today.

511
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:00,430
Qian Kaiyi.

512
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,080
I think there's something not right about you.

513
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,630
You take our business so seriously.

514
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,180
Do you have other intentions about me?

515
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:13,359
Well, Miss He, why are you always having so much hostility to me?

516
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,799
That's what I think too.

517
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:18,520
Isn't it good to have an extra pair of helping hands?

518
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,790
What exactly happened when you were at the indoor swimming pool that day?

519
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,389
Nothing happened.

520
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:23,709
I've got it at last.

521
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:26,549
- Could it be I've given you the kiss of life—
- What are you talking about?

522
00:39:26,549 --> 00:39:29,359
So you think I have other intentions about you?

523
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,389
You are nuts.

524
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:34,499
Wasn't I doing it to save you? Come on.

525
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,559
All right, I'll stop teasing you.

526
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:41,009
If You Na's problem is not solved, her mother will complain about us with the Education Bureau.

527
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:45,609
I'll have to be investigated and may lose my job with the radio station.

528
00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:47,749
So I have no other intentions about you. Don't worry.

529
00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:50,149
- Hope so.
- Get a move on.

530
00:39:50,149 --> 00:39:53,059
- Could it be it was your first kiss?
- Qian Kaiyi!

531
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:58,120
Don't follow us if you go on being so disrespectful.

532
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:02,019
If you have such a moment's leisure to spare, be quick to tell us what exactly is going on with You Na.

533
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:03,840
Yes, yes, yes.

534
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,549
It goes like this.

535
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,820
[Qian]

536
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,820
[Kaiyi]

537
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,950
My name is Qian Kaiyi.

538
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,159
I'm your substitute teacher. You can call me Mr. Qian.

539
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:25,443
Hello, Mr. Qian.

540
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:29,859
I know many of you want to study broadcasting

541
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:32,819
to make up for your scores in academic subjects. Am I right?

542
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:38,119
But if any of you want to be admitted to the top universities

543
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:41,329
you'll need to expand your reserve of cultural literacy.

544
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:45,459
I know taking only academic subject exams in the college entrance exam

545
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:48,669
is like walking with one leg only. You have to go all out.

546
00:40:48,669 --> 00:40:51,389
But if any of you think studying arts

547
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:54,840
can make you walk even easier,

548
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,470
then you are way off base.

549
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,189
Since these two legs are loaded with lead.

550
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,760
On my goodness.

551
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,599
That's to say, they are classmates of the same art class.

552
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,700
This… Isn't this quite nice?

553
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,379
This is too personalized.

554
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,079
Isn't it good to be personalized?

555
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:29,749
As to decorations on the table, if they have overly ostentatious styles

556
00:41:29,749 --> 00:41:32,079
or overly bright colors, they will leave the visitors

557
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,849
an impression of you as an unconventional thinker.

558
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:39,360
And all your upcoming analyses and elaborations will not convince them.

559
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,380
Let's go have a look over there.

560
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,670
When did it begin?

561
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:58,430
I mean, her supernatural hearing.

562
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:03,409
It's a God-given talent. She's like that ever since I knew her.

563
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:11,559
And then? What happened to the two kids?

564
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,339
That day, You Na…

565
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:25,470
High above the silvery ocean winds are gathering the storm clouds.

566
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:29,599
Between the clouds and ocean proudly wheels the Stormy Petrel,

567
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,980
like a streak of sable lightening.

568
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,979
Who arranged the two of them to be a pair for the recitation?

569
00:43:35,979 --> 00:43:37,529
Me.

570
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,699
Why did you arrange the two of them together?

571
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,279
Because they are the best students in their major subject in the class.

572
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:46,219
If any one of them does better, what does it mean?

573
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:48,869
That means among the multitude of students

574
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:50,999
lining up at the gate of a highly selective university,

575
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:54,119
she's the only one whom the examiners will remember

576
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:55,949
before she even enters the exam room.

577
00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:58,079
The gulls are darting over the ocean,

578
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,999
as if hiding their horror

579
00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:04,230
in the inky depth of the ocean

580
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,149
Along with the rumbling sound of thunder,

581
00:44:07,149 --> 00:44:10,329
waves are roaring in anger,

582
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:12,450
against the strong wind.

583
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,460
