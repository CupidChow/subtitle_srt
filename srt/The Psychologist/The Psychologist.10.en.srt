Xu Wei.

00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,860
He is my husband and my colleague.

He's also the co-founder of my psychological counseling agency.

Yes.

98
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:54,699
I assume my husband submitted a report to the relevant regulator.

99
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:02,099
It's his statement on me having an intimate relationship with one of my visitors.

100
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:05,769
Do you have something to defend yourself regarding this matter?

101
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,110
No.

102
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,840
Did she admit it herself?

103
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,030
Yes.

104
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:17,409
Originally I wanted to try my best to seize any opportunity so that she could defend herself.

105
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:22,390
But I didn't expect that she would admit all the allegations against her in the hearing.

106
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,230
She said that she had seen Xu Wei's report.

107
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,989
She even agreed with her husband to submit the report.

108

In exchange,

109
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,529
personal information about that visitor will be kept strictly confidential in the report.

110
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:38,559
Dr. Li, can you tell us something about

111
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,440
this visitor codenamed F in the statement?

112
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,900
He

is the smartest and

114
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
the purest person I have ever seen.

115
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,169
Do you know according to the ethics code of Chinese Psychological Society,

116
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:58,370
psychological counselors are not allowed to have an intimate relationship with their visitors

117
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,510
within three years as of the end of their counseling sessions?

118
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,269
I know.

119
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,090
Do you think your behavior is not professional?

120
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,960
Do you have anything to explain regarding this matter?

121
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,130
I don't regret what happened at all.

122
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,540
It's all my fault and I am willing to bear all the consequences.

123
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,180
Actually, it's normal to have positive transference and negative transference

124
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,330
between psychological counselors and their visitors.

125
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,769
How to handle the visitors' strong erotic transference without hurting their feelings

126
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:42,419
and even use it as an opportunity to treat them will reflect the expertise of a psychological counselor.

127
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:46,909
For example, a person who always tries to please everyone.

128
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:50,660
Only when he or she shows the same tendency towards the counselor,

129
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,139
can the counselor find his or her weakness in the visitor's interpersonal relationship?

130
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:01,680
On the opposite, if this counselor finds it boring when the visitor keeps talking,

131
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,799
the negative feelings will also remind them that this visitor might also bore people in his or her life.

132
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,520
That's right.

133
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:16,099
The visitors will unconsciously project their important emotions onto the counselor

134
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:18,570
which will help the counselor better understand this visitor.

135
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,470
The feelings the counselor has towards the visitor

136
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,030
can also help them understand the visitor's unspoken problems.

137
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,689
I don't think it's difficult

138
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:30,490
for Li Yun who is a professional to deal with negative transference well.

139
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,790
So how could this happen?

140
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,760
Li Yun was a very talented student of mine.

141
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,880
The mistake she made will ruin her career

142
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,450
which will bring a huge loss to our discipline.

144

I don't know the result yet. But I've done everything I can.

145
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,349
But I heard that she is going abroad next month. I think it's good for her.

146

Everyone will have the time to calm down when she's away.

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,960
About what?

149
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,650

151

She is very smart. There are no loopholes in her professional handling.

152
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,199
Geniuses are always like this.

153
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:21,670
They can be quite bold in their private lives.

154
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,249
But I thought she loved her family.

155
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:26,810
I often saw her post pictures of her with her husband and kid.

156
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,180
Because she knows what others want to see.

157
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,249
You mean Li Yun is making room for her academic studies?

Sometimes she is too clever for her own good.

159
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,079
So you mean she was very likely framed by someone?

160
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,670
The result of the hearing is very likely to be the appearance of a trap against her.

161
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,979
Is it possible that this visitor F investigated Li Yun's background before he became her visitor?

162
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,100
He wasn't necessarily coming prepared.

163
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:07,409
But whether this relationship was intentional or not, there is something suspicious about this F.

164
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,659
This person is highly functional.

165
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:17,059
His expertise in psychology probably surpasses Li Yun.

166
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:20,749
So during the sessions, the visitor subtly took the lead of

167
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:24,249
and broke through Li Yun's psychological defense mechanism.

168
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,660
Jing Jing?

169
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,980
Jing Jing?

170
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,200
Jing Jing?

171
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,610
Jing Jing.

172
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,590
Dinner time.

173
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,860
Dr. Zhao called and asked about your situation.

174
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,939
I told him that you are much better now. How are you feeling now?

175
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:49,000
Also, you almost run out of your medication, right?

176
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,180
Yes.

177
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,249
The medication prescribed by Dr. Zhao is working.

178
00:14:55,249 --> 00:15:00,459
Let's go see the doctor again some other time and ask him to give you some treatment.

179
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,649
Mom. I'm going to the movies with my friends tonight.

180
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:09,230
Sure. Go ahead.

181
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,300
This dress was the one I bought for you, right?

182
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,200
It's lovely.

183
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,670
Mom, actually…

184
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,250
Hello?

185
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,879
Hello? It's Le Le's mom.

186
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:31,439
How many times have I told you that even though they've reached a high level playing the instruments,

187
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:35,790
maybe they don't even know how they did it.

188
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,009
So of course they wouldn't know how to teach their children.

189
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:40,640
Am I right?

190
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,530
Give me a second.

191
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,939
How many times did I tell you? You just wouldn't listen.

192
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:51,570
Yes.

193
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,379
Yes. That's it.

194
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:00,310
All right, now go.

195
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,949
I am telling you, I found a very good music teacher for Jing Jing.

196
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,330
Over here!

197
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,219
- Come on. Sit down! Dinner is on you.
- You came the latest today.

198
00:16:54,219 --> 00:16:56,060
- Yeah, I would give you a lecture had you come a bit later.
- She's late.

199
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,910
Let me tell you. The female drummer of our competitor for the contest next week is really awesome.

200
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,340
- We need to watch out for her future.
- I know. I know that drummer.

201
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,449
The drummer plays with particularly accurate beats but the tempos she inserts are so great.

202
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:07,590
You know she is a good punk musician.

203
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,260
So you mean it's a bit difficult for us to win the contest?

204
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,590
What's wrong, Jing Jing?

205
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,329
What kind of weird workout is that?

206
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:49,979
The highest honor in this courtyard. I shall allow you to hold my right foot.

207
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,929
- What's going on?
- Jiahui taught me this.

208
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:56,709
Raise my foot when I'm not walking around so it won't hurt so much.

209
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:00,479
You are injured, too? Let me see. What is this plaster?

210
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,520
What do you mean "too"? Who else is injured?

211
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,310
My mom. She fell last night. So I stayed at our apartment last night and didn't come back here.

212
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,870
How's she? Is she okay?

213
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,079
She refused to go to the hospital. I don't know what to do. How did you get this sprain? Let me see.

214
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:16,870
It's nothing really. I sprained my ankle on my way to pick up my parcels.

215
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,379
Jiahui next door gave me acupuncture and it didn't hurt anymore.

216
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:22,350
I didn't know he is so good.

217
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,589
Speaking of which, isn't your mom also injured? You can ask him to give her some treatment, too.

218
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:28,299
I can't trouble him to do that. Come on.

219
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:31,429
No trouble at all. It's a piece of cake for him.

220
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:33,090
- Forget it.
- Let's go.

221
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,390
Why?

222
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,270
Just walk the walk. Let's pay him a visit now.

223
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,280
But your ankle is sprained.

224
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,849
I'm fine. You'll know how good he is when we see him.

225
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:45,519
You're social so you two got acquainted. But I barely know him.

226
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,270
Come on! We are neighbors. You guys will get acquainted with more contacts.

227
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,921
Are you sure you can walk with this ankle?

228
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:53,980
Sure. No problem.

229
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,620
Slowly.

230
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,880
Why do you have to trouble him?

231
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,190
This's a big surprise.

232
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,300
I'm sorry to come to visit you early in the morning.

233
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,170
This gentleman.

234
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,319
You don't want to invite your neighbors to come in and sit down?

235
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,230
Come on in.

236
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,920
Thank you.

237
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,459
Jiahui. He Dun has a favor to ask you.

238
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:36,839
Let me do the talking myself. So my mother fell and she doesn't feel so well.

239
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,940
Lili said you are a good acupuncturist. So I was wondering if you can…

240
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,280
Sure.

241
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,900
No hesitation at all.

242
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,660
You're really a good neighbor.

243
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,560
Don't worry. I will pay you, of course.

244
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,799
What do you take me for? We're friends. This is the least I can do.

245
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,329
Thank you.

246
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:58,150
The biggest problem is that my mom doesn't want to go to the hospital no matter how I try to persuade her.

247
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,640
I know what to do.

248
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,759
You will play the good cop and you just play the bad cop.

249
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,719
You two can put up an act together to tell your mom that she needs to see a doctor and do more exercise.

250
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:10,130
But you never played good cop bad cop with me to persuade her.

251
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,210
The key is she won't listen to me.

252
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,270
Besides, I'm not your boyfriend.

253
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,820
Have some water. Just have your water.

254
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,660
I feel like I am not needed here. I'll let you guys chat.

255
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,759
The door is over there.

256
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,459
I feel like the third wheel here.

257
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:33,779
Don't listen to her nonsense, she likes making jokes.

258
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:35,760
She's a jokester.

259
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,150
Don't be discouraged, Jiahui.

260
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,830
He Dun specializes in psychology.

261
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,739
And you specialize in bruises, wounds, and sprained ankles.

262
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:46,760
What do you special in then?

263
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,470
I am the soul of our courtyard.

264
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,839
The social glue that holds this little group together.

265
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,510
Without me maybe you two will never talk to or take a look at each other

266
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,500
even if you brush past each other every day.

267
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,040
That's not true.

268
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,960
I will take the initiative to talk to Miss He.

269
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,549
My mom may not be able to come here due to her physical inconvenience.

270
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:08,820
Is it okay for you to go to her place with me later today?

271
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,070
No problem.

272
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,560
Thanks.

273
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,510
No, thanks, the cup is still full. Thanks.

274
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,030
Enjoy the tea.

275
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,460
Jing Jing.

276
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,729
Have you gotten dressed yet?

277
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:29,850
We need to go out for dinner with a friend of mine.

278
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,470
Come on. Chop, chop.

279
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,250
Jing Jing?

280
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,970
Look at that.

281
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,340
It's so dark in the room, why didn't you open the curtains?

282
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,690
Jing Jing, are you okay?

283
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,029
Jing Jing! Jing Jing! Jing Jing!

284
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,419
Jing Jing! Jing Jing, what's going on?

285
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,110
I need to find help.

286
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,700
I need to find help.

287
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,060
She twisted her ankle and fell to the ground.

288
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,590
The muscle contusion caused some swelling.

289
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,239
I will use massage techniques to adjust her muscles.

290
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,030
Much better.

291
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,070
Auntie, what do you think?

292
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,830
Good. I feel better.

293
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,529
Xiao Ye, I didn't expect you to be so good, I love it.

294
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:42,529
Relax, then I will do an acupuncture

295
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:46,529
at the three acupoints of Jiexi, Kunlun, and Qiuxu.

296
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,080
- Okay.
- You know what he's saying?

297
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,950
Thank you.

298
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,140
Can you give us some space?

299
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,159
I am not used to being watched when I do acupuncture.

300
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,761
I was kidding! I was thinking of doing a moxa-moxibustion on her foot.

301
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:11,930
It will get better sooner.

302
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,099
There are some moxa in my trunk.
(T/N: a form of heat therapy in which dried plant materials called "moxa" are burned on or very near the surface of the skin)

303
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:15,740
Can you fetch some for me?

304
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,589
No problem, give me your car key.

305
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,429
I'm going downstairs.

306
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:23,180
Gentle.

307
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,020
Mom is not afraid. I'm brave.

308
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,010
Auntie, I just used it as an excuse to send her away.

309
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:41,630
You didn't sprain your ankle in an ordinary accident, right?

310
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,530
You feel dizzy often which caused the accident.

311
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,669
[Giving your mom acupuncture isn't the only purpose! Ask her how she feels about the potential future son-in-law!]

312
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,650
[Since you have no better things to do, why don't you go to our neighborhood committee to find a job?]

313
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,850
[Moxa]

314
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,370
[That's right! I can join the neighborhood committee and post a blind date ad for you in the group chat.]

315
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,010
[Tang Lili, don't do anything stupid!]

316
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,880
Auntie, these are not prescription drugs.

317
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,010
Your dizziness is not necessarily caused by a high blood pressure.

318
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,120
I think you should go to the hospital.

319
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,680
You mean my problem is getting serious now?

320
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,760
I thought my blood pressure may be a little high since I can't sleep well at night.

321
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,060
The dizziness may be caused by high blood pressure.

322
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,529
But it could also be an insufficient blood supply

323
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:48,700
because your spine has been compressing your nerves.

324
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,139
So you better go to the hospital to get an X-ray.

325
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:53,100
This way you will feel more relieved.

326
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,070
My grandma is like you.

327
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,780
She has weak legs but she always refuses to go to the hospital.

328
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,430
She is afraid that the body check would find a bunch of diseases.

329
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,100
I learned acupuncture mostly for her.

330
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:12,750
I see, she is blessed to have a good grandson like you.

331
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,979
Auntie, I think you should tell He Dun about your dizziness.

332
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,470
You don't know much about her.

333
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:27,790
Dun Dun has too many things on her shoulders.

334
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,880
She is quite depressed deep down.

335
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,800
I don't want her to worry about my health, too.

336
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Don't tell her.

337
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,629
I will go to the hospital for an examination, I will.

338
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,780
I am back.

339
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,260
Why did you two stop talking the moment I came back?

340
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,830
You were talking about me behind my back?

341
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,470
I wouldn't dare.

342
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,350
I was asking your mom what I could do to impress you.

343
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,110
Dun Dun, Xaio Ye is really a good young man.

344
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,360
But mom will not intervene in young people's romantic relationships.

345
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,429
Jiahui just likes to joke.

346
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:12,710
I'll go rinse some fruit for you.

347
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,560
Thank you.

348
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,020
I know you have your own reasons to do or not to do something.

349
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,830
But sickness is not a trivial matter.

350
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,280
You can't take it lightly.

351
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,810
If you have any other questions, you can call me anytime.

352
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,570
Okay.

353
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:34,379
But I shouldn't trouble you or my daughter since you're busy at work all the time.

354
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:37,169
You don't know how He Dun and I met, right?

355
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:38,780
No.

356
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,280
She saved my life.

357
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,200
Really?

358
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,470
So you once had mental problems, too?

359
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,960
It is said that it is difficult for a healer to heal himself.

360
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,430
I just acted on impulse.

361
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,230
You will be fine.

362
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,069
I guess you two can help and support each other.

363
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:08,880
You are both very decent young people.

364
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,560
And you both have this psychological shadow in your hearts which is haunting you.

365
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,539
This is how interpersonal relationship works.

366
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:16,829
People will support each other and move on.

367
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:19,940
Dun Dun is a big girl now.

368
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,430
But she is always alone.

369
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:28,350
I hope she can be happy so that I can rest assured. You know what I mean?

370
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,400
Auntie.

371
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,610
Did something happen to He Dun before?

372
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,730
No, no.

373
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,530
It's all history.

374
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,550
Let's not mention it.

375
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,000
Dun Dun!

376
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,800
Dun Dun!

377
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,749
Dun Dun!

378
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,570
Jiahui.

379
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,849
Thanks a lot.

380
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:14,370
How is she?

381
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,379
She is asleep, have a seat.

382
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,520
Can I offer you something to drink?

383
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,430
Coke then.

384
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,710
We don't have coke.

385
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,339
No one likes to drink that in my family, I'll go downstairs and buy you some.

386
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,130
Forget it then. It's too much trouble, water is fine.

387
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,560
Your mom can wake up at any time.

388
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,210
I'm really sorry. I will remember it next time.

389
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,750
Hold on.

390
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,800
You must be a good amateur singer before.

391
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,050
That was when I was a kid.

392
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,259
- I haven't sung for a long time.
- Thanks.

393
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:51,480
You're welcome.

394
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,409
By the way, your mom's sickness should be caused by overthinking plus over-fatigue.

395
00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:59,680
I'll give her a few more acupunctures. That should do the trick.

396
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,099
Sorry to trouble you.

397
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:04,409
No trouble at all. You saved my life.

398
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,780
Actually, we should understand why senior people are always afraid of going to the hospital.

399
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,379
They are just afraid that the result will show a lot of physical problems.

400
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,309
My grandma is like this, too.

401
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:19,549
Over time seeing a doctor will really become a taboo for them.

402
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,920
Jiahui.

403
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,070
I actually want to apologize to you

404
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,900
because I've been suspicious of you.

405
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,299
The way you showed up in front of me was too dramatic.

406
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:41,450
And I always think you are a person with a lot of secrets.

407
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,060
Many people still have little knowledge of mental health.

408
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:55,229
Some might refuse to talk or look at it, so many people will ignore their psychological problems.

409
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:58,679
Over time the psychological problems will become physiological.

410
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,630
Only when they realize something goes wrong with their bodies

411
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,160
will they go to the doctor to check and verify.

412
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,589
And many patients can't get...

413
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:10,690
the physical disease cured from ordinary medical treatment. This…

414
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,929
Actually our psychological counseling office received a lot of intractable…

415
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,500
In fact, they are caused by…

416
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:40,410
[What are you doing now?]

417
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,080
I knew I can find you in Director Fei's office.

418
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,879
Why couldn't you knock when you came in, Sister?

419
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:18,140
What? I need to ask for approval to chat with you in Director Fei's office.

420
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,579
You know I've been busy recently.

421
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:21,679
The show's audience rate has improved a bit recently.

422
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,080
We've got to steady it.

423
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,909
Good for you, you've grown up.

424
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:27,870
Then I will give you some reward.

425
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,729
What reward?

426
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:32,730
- The poster's budget has been approved.
- Really?

427
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,680
The shooting is the day after tomorrow.

428
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,900
Sister, you are like a real sister to me!

429
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,379
My little fairy. My living bodhisattva!

430
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:50,760
Tell Director Pan for me that I will fulfill this task perfectly.

It's okay. Just take it, It might be something important.

He has nothing important to discuss with me.

Hello, the subscriber you are calling is busy now…

438

Hello, the subscriber you are calling is busy now…

Oh my god.

440
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,940
- Kaiyi, there's an emergency.
- What's wrong, Sister?

441
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,900
Our photographer stood us up, He is going to a fashion week.

442
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,249
- His schedule is available this afternoon only.
- This afternoon?

443
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:34,950
Yes. It took me a lot of effort to book him for you this afternoon.

444
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,210
This is so sudden! I haven't prepared anything.

445
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,470
But if you want to wait, it'll be in another two weeks.

446
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,730
if that's the case, I don't know the publicity period

447
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,879
Director Pan arranged for us will…

448
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,990
This afternoon it is!

449
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,230
I'll contact He Dun now.

450
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,729
Anyway, there is a show at night, so she has to come here anyway.

451
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:54,230
So you haven't even contacted her yet?

452
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,069
I've been trying to contact her.

453
00:32:56,069 --> 00:32:58,579
I kindly remind you that the photographer has a bad temper.

454
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:00,069
And he's charged by the hour.

455
00:33:00,069 --> 00:33:03,929
So if anything goes wrong, the loss is from our own pocket.

456
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,250
- I'll get prepared, Sister.
- Secure He Dun's presence!

457
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,900
Consider it done!

458
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,580
All right, I'll believe you can do it.

459
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:16,029
I will have the time to play the Marvelous Snail.

460
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,770
You just said you think I have a lot of secrets.

461
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,950
Well, I stand corrected.

462
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,330
I think everyone has many secrets.

463
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:30,520
But I can't doubt you or deny you because of the secrets you have.

464
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,960
And we have spent some time getting to know each other.

465
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,779
I don't think you are really that indifferent like you might look.

466
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:37,470
You guys haven't had dinner yet, right?

467
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,469
- I will cook for you.
- You can cook?

468
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:42,140
I'm curious how you two met each other.

469
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,199
I learned it when I was in school in northern China.

470
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:48,430
I learned this to give my grandma treatment.

471
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,459
- This is for me?
- It's called transcranial magnetic stimulator.

Wear this helmet once a week for your physical therapy.

00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:56,399
Your hands will definitely get better.

474
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,130
You seem to wrap and protect

475
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:02,310
the softest part of your heart in a very hard shell.

476
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,660
I mean, to some extent

477
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,900
the two of us are alike.

478
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,480
[Qian Kaiyi]

479
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,159
Mr. Qian, The studio is all set.

480
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,869
We are ready when you are.

481
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:35,319
- Let's get the shooting done ASAP.
- Sure.

482
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:37,419
Give me another minute. No need to hurry.

483
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:38,980
Help me explain, please?

484
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,510
Okay.

485
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,880
[Sorry, I accidentally annoyed you yesterday. I can try to explain to you if there's some misunderstanding. Are you available this afternoon?]

486
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,520
I'm sorry, We may not be able to shoot today.

487
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,520
Our other host can't make it here on time.

488
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,150
But don't worry, we will pay as we agreed.

489
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,910
This is our own mistake.

490
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,710
- Can you explain to everyone for me?
- Sure.

491
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,960
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

492
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:58,560
Lady, I'd need you to fill in this form.

493
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,980
I don't need to fill the form.

494
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,430
I just need to talk to Miss He.

495
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,650
Here's the thing, Filling out the form will help visitor's to leave their information.

496
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,660
So we can keep a record of our subsequent counseling sessions.

497
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,699
I'm not the one doing psychological counseling.

498
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:12,310
Lili, I'll take it from here.

499
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,329
Hello, Miss, I'm He Dun.

500
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:19,380
Here's the thing, The visitor must be present in person.

501
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,869
My daughter is not available.

502
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:22,610
- How should I address you?
- My last name is Zhang.

503
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,020
Ms. Zhang, I need to explain to you that

504
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,049
the reason why the visitor must be here in person is I need to see his or her status in person.

505
00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:31,910
Otherwise, the counseling will not have any effect.

506
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,759
It doesn't matter.

507
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,630
What do you want to know? I can tell you.

508
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,770
Or how about you take your daughter to our office together next time?

509
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,140
My daughter is not available!

510
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,680
It's simple, really, you'll know what's going on as long as you let me tell you.

511
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,050
My daughter always vomits, sometimes there's even blood in the vomit.

512
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,000
The hospital says she induces vomiting frequently

513
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,600
which causes esophageal reflux and rupture of the gastric mucosa—

514
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,129
Ms. Zhang, I am sorry.

515
00:36:56,129 --> 00:36:59,599
But I can't carry on my counseling if you continue to act like this.

516
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,560
You should let your daughter come here in person.

517
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,130
What's the matter with you?

518
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,099
Even if my daughter is here, she'll be saying the same thing.

519
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:11,739
It makes no difference for me to tell you!

520
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:15,979
Although it's the same thing, the way you narrate the
matter and the cognition

521
00:37:15,979 --> 00:37:18,900
will be totally different from your daughter.

522
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,630
Forget it!

523
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,470
Good-bye!

524
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,360
Good-bye.

525
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,000
I was wondering why I've been so grumpy.

526
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,469
[Meiyou just sent a reminder.]

527
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:47,570
Will our live broadcast be in time?

528
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,120
Why did you cancel the poster shooting?

529
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,279
Do you know how much paperwork I went through for its execution? You just canceled it.

530
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:56,900
What will people in the station think of you and what will they think of me?

531
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,020
Sister, But his schedule is indeed a bit hasty.

532
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,809
He Dun has her own full-time job.

533
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:04,659
She can't clear her schedule at last-minute notice, you should understand.

534
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:05,949
I can't understand! Just forget other things.

535
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:08,670
There are only ten minutes away from the show.

536
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,699
- Can Master He Dun make it?
- Yes.

537
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:14,459
I trust her sense of responsibility for the show. I can guarantee.

538
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,329
I don't trust it.

539
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:18,530
Miss He.

540
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,129
Welcome back. This is "Night Talk to Your Heart" of Haifeng Radio International.

541
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:40,899
[Night Talk to Your Heart]
I am your old friend Qian Kaiyi.

542
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:42,470
Hello everyone, I am He Dun.

543
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:46,849
Miss He, I just received a call from a listener nicknamed Hugging Bear.

544
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:48,529
She said that she's 27 years old.

545
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:51,179
Her career is in a rising period.

546
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:54,269
She was thinking that she can work harder this year to bring her career to the next level.

547
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:57,520
But recently her family and relatives began to urge her to get married soon.

548
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,039
They even arranged blind dates for her which made her very distressed.

549
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:06,199
Actually, I have also experienced the same distress as Hugging Bear.

550
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:09,139
I believe many single young women of this age

551
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:11,600
have experienced this problem.

552
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:15,719
Then Miss He, how did you deal with it when it happened to you?

553
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:19,290
Essentially, our family pays attention to our marriage status

554
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,649
or romantic relationships because they are worried about our life in the future.

555
00:39:22,649 --> 00:39:26,330
I have no right to get old as long as my daughter is not married.

556
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,700
I'm truly happy to meet you today.

557
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,000
Because Dun Dun has never brought her boyfriend home.

558
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,849
Let me put it this way, you think your mom is getting old since I accidentally fell?

559
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:38,659
Mom actually… Let me put it this way,

560
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:42,229
the square dance team asked me to join them but I said no!

561
00:39:42,229 --> 00:39:45,349
If I were to go, I would become the top dancer.

562
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,969
If we act negatively when they urge us to

563
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:51,229
get married soon, they will be more worried.

564
00:39:51,229 --> 00:39:53,869
So my suggestion is that you can try to do better in your career.

565
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:56,840
Show a positive side in terms of personal life.

566
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,470
Let them know that you can live a happy life even if you're single.

567
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,940
So that they can rest assured.

568
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,050
But there are many listeners who said that

569
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,129
on an important matter such as marriage,

570
00:40:05,129 --> 00:40:07,949
The experiences from the seniors sometimes

571
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:09,459
are not entirely just nonsense because they care about you too much.

572
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:13,019
They can analyze the situation and our possible life partners with their past experiences.

573
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:15,810
This is the plus side.

574
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:18,810
Any intimate relationship requires an emotional foundation.

575
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:23,630
Maybe the so-called analysis already caused trouble to the concerned party.

576
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:28,420
Miss He, so you mean sometimes when others try to help you,

577
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,240
their help will turn out to be harmful to you? Right?

578
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,769
Maybe some people just want to

579
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:37,790
get what they want in the name of "help".

580
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:41,819
He Dun, I happened to take this to the dry cleaner for a friend of mine.

581
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:44,870
You can change into it if you don't mind.

582
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,180
A dress?

583
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,050
Which dry cleaner did such a wonderful job?

584
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,559
I don't agree with that, Miss He.

585
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:59,370
Miss He. A boy might think that a dress can highlight the female figure.

586
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,999
It's totally okay for her to wear it in the right occasion.

587
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:04,729
This should be considered a friendly suggestion, right?

588
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:08,099
Is it a friendly suggestion or mental trouble to the girl

589
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,760
depends on the girl's perception.

590
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:15,599
Hugging Bear, my suggestion for your trouble is to think about

591
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,080
what you want to do most in your life right now.

592
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,219
in my opinion, a career and a romantic relationship can exist at the same time.

593
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:24,229
You can balance between the two.

594
00:41:24,229 --> 00:41:26,950
It's not an either-or question.

595
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:30,710
That's right, Hugging Bear, stick to the choice that feels right for you.

596
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:35,150
Because no matter what others say or do, it'll just be a short episode in our life.

597
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,460
You're the one to take control of your own destiny.

598
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,090
And I believe that since you work so hard in your career,

599
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,260
you will meet someone wonderful one day.

600
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,629
That's right. Whether it's career success or love,

601
00:41:47,629 --> 00:41:50,900
what you need to do is to look forward to what's going to happen and just enjoy.

602
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,180
Sooner or later you will find it.

603
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:57,309
Miss He, there seems to be hidden meaning between the lines.

604
00:41:57,309 --> 00:41:59,560
Did you experience something nice recently

605
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,719
so you started to yearn for a life where there's something to keep you company?

606
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,350
You want to fall in love crazily now?

607
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,360
Regarding the matter of dating,

608
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,940
how and with whom is also a discipline worth studying.

609
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,880
Especially those girls who would accompany you to class in the heavy rain,

610
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,469
stay up late working overtime with you,

611
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:24,150
and confess her love to you at someone else's wedding affectionately,

612
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,390
you need to cherish such girls.

614
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,169
He Dun, are you still mad at me?

615
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,200
I shouldn't have brought up the dating crap, right?

616
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,190
But I did it for the show to work.

617

Besides, you strike back.

618

You even used the wedding to roast me.
