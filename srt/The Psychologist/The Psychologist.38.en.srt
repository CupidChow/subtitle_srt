It's not that I don't want you to have a companion.

As I told you, I hope there can be someone other than me staying by your side

It's been a while.

42

You were busy and I didn't get a chance to tell you.

He's seen you only a few times since he was back.

How can you know whether he's true to you or not?

If he is, why did he just leave back then?

00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,520
He didn't show up for over ten years and now he's just back when he wants to?

47
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,269
I admit I've been busy these days.

48

I didn't have time to come home to take care of you.

49
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:19,540
It's my fault and I'll come home often later, all right?

50
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,370
Dun Dun, I've never blamed you for not coming home due to work…

51
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,160
But I'm blaming myself!

52
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,309
Back then, in order to pay my tuition fees, you ate only instant noodles for three meals

53
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:36,220
and had only a few hours of sleep every day.

54
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,560
You used to work at a public school.

55
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,750
In order to earn money, you switched to a private school.

56
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,780
If you were still with the public school now, you'd have been a special-class teacher since five years ago.

57
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,050
I think I blame myself.

58
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,489
But apart from blaming myself, I also hate him!

59
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,460
I hate him for having been nowhere to be found all these years.

60
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,150
Does he know how much suffering you've gone through?

61

I can give you a good life.

I want you to be happy every day.

65

I don't want you to suffer anymore.

66
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,840
I don't want to hear this from you.

Let me tell you, Dun Dun.

68
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,880
Remember, all the sufferings I went through for you before,

69
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,470
I did that willingly.

70
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,340
I've never regretted it.

71
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,529
I even felt very happy, do you know?

72
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:28,240
All this has nothing to do with He Zhaocheng, do you know?

73
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,349
I know He Zhaocheng has hurt you before and you refuse to forgive him.

74
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:39,560
But what you don't know is now he wants to patch things up with us, to make up with you and me.

He is Jun Jun's father.

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,440
Why can't you forgive him?

00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,440
No!

79
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,180
I don't hate him for having hurt me.

80
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,350
I hate him for having hurt you!

81
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,010

85
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,340
Hello.

86
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,690
My name is Qian Kaiyi. I'm He Dun's boyfriend.

87
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,660
Hello.

88
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,400
He Dun has told me what happened when she was a child.

89
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,290
I intended to hold out on her for as long as I can.

90
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,890
Will you…

91
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,210
Will you guys blame me?

92
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,050
I'm not in a position to blame you.

93
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,070
But I hope He Dun can get over it one day.

94
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,600
So the crux still lies with you.

95
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,420
It was my fault.

96
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,879
After all is said and done, it is me who let her and her mother down.

97
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,359
So No matter how much He Dun hates me, I won't blame her.

98
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,039
He Dun has been a child of few words.

99
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,809
When something comes up, she just bottles it up without getting it off her chest.

100
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:43,520
The fact that she can tell you such a secret of hers shows she trusts you a lot.

101
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,040
After all these years of absence until both my parents died,

102
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,980
I've come to understand that if I were Xiping back then,

103
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,490
I wouldn't be able to make a choice either.

104
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,820
I've lost Jun Jun.

105
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,910
I can't lose Xiping and He Dun anymore.

106
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,560
I'll try hard.

107
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,790
Uncle, I know you want to make up for their loss in the past,

108
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,070
but there are things that can't be changed

109
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,399
overnight once they happen.

110
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,360
So you have to get over the hurdle first.

111
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,739
What He Dun wants is a future where you don't choose to escape

112
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:32,160
when others don't understand you.

113
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,780

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,190

Hello, Weizi. I've read your resume.

What is your most satisfying part of the resume?

Could you share it with me?

141
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:12,600
Of course. During my sophomore year of college, I wrote articles for the college radio station.

142
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,409
I organized my writings and sent them to the Rainforest magazine.

143
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:17,550
Actually, I enjoy reading magazines a lot since I was a child.

144
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,470
So I didn't expect one of my articles would really be chosen for publication.

145
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,410
Its content was about a social survey.

146
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,470
Back then, in order to interview more practitioners,

147
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,740
I visited more than a dozen factories in the neighboring city.

148
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,670
Well done.

149
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,210
Actually, this job has a very high demand for your ability to work under pressure.

Do you usually listen to the Night Talk to Your Heart show?

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,099
Well, Sister, are you the operator of the Weibo account?

164
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:20,250
Yes, I've been operating it these days.

165
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,469
Really, Sister?

166
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:22,910
You are my idol.

167
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,680
The letter-mailing column is really full of thoughts and feelings.

168
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,639
"Carriages and horses were slower in the past.

169
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,049
Letters were sent far away.

170
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:31,050
You need your lifetime to love the right person."

171
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,889
I'm sure you can dig stories of lasting appeal out of pen and paper.

172
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:35,940
You've followed our recent selected topic?

173
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,069
Yes, I think it's great.

174
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:41,049
Do you have any ideas on the model of letter mailing?

175
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:43,350
Feel free to share with me. Anything is fine.

176
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,569
All right.

177
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,209
It is very convenient to have a projector in the meeting room.

178
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:49,420
Shall we get one for our garden house?

179
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,419
Forget it.

180
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,770
At this extraordinary time, we'd better save money for Brother Qian.

181
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,159
Whether it's convenient or not, let's just put up with it.

182
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,000
Hello.

183
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,300
Qian, where are you?

184
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,980
I'm at my mother-in-law's place. I'm staying by the bedside.

185
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,929
What happened?

186
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:35,730
He Dun is a bit unwell.

187
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,979
Is Sister-in-law all right?

188
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:38,880
She's fine for the time being.

189
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,929
How are you getting on with the interviews? Are they going well?

190
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,290
They are done.

191
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,500
One candidate is quite good. I'll ask Xiao Li to send you the record later.

192
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,500
If you think the candidate is good, just keep them first.

193
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,170
Well, did Wang Zhuo give you a hard time?

194
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,820
We are doing our job.

195
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,830
How dare he say no?

196
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,050
Don't worry. Should anything happen, I'll be there to see to it.

197
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,999
All right, I'll see you at the garden house later.

198
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,740
Okay.

199
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,960
Has Dun woke up?

200
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,730
I suppose so.

201
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,409
Dun Dun, do you want to eat something?

202
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:14,420
No. I've got things to do at my counseling office.

203
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,270
Take me there.

204
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,959
Auntie, I'll escort her back then.

205
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,299
All right. Give this to her.

206
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:29,980
- Jujube and lotus seed soup. Let her have some on the way.
- Okay.

207
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,660
Make sure to be slow. Drive safely.

208
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,440
- I'll let you know we are safe when we get home. Okay.
- Okay.

209
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,850
I'm off.

210
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,770
Dad.

211
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
You are back.

212
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,300
I heard from the housemaid that you've caught a cold.

213
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,020
I'm back to check in on you.

214
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,530
I made you a glass of medicine.

215
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,060
When did you get to know your father?

216
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,420
A line from the book, a line from the book.

217
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,560
It's getting late. Go to bed early.

218
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,720
By the way, I'm not coming back for dinner tomorrow evening.

219
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,450
If there's anything you like to eat, ask the housemaid to cook it for you.

220
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,970
Dad.

221
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,579
Are you still keeping the letter my mother wrote?

222
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,550
Yes.

223
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,020
Give it to me.

224
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,930
Has Dun Dun left?

225
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,740
I didn't expect the child would have such a strong reaction.

226
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,220
It's me to blame, me to blame.

227
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,060
I should have been more careful.

228
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,210
We…

229
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,680
What's wrong?

230
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,860
We'd better separate.

231
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,810
- Separate…
- It might be…

232
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,340
Be better for Dun Dun.

233
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,440
Well, I haven't packed up yet.

234
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,710
I've packed up for you.

235
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,710
Give it to me.

236
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,570
Xiping,

237
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,370
- in the coming days we…
- There are no coming days.

238
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,180
Let's stop here.

239
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,010
All right.

240
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,810
Take care.

241
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,380
Go back.

242
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,580
Go back. Close the door.

243
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,980
Please have a look at this form.

244
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,049
If everything is okay, you can sign your names on there.

245
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,720
Everything is okay. It's your call.

246
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,520
Watch out.

247
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,060
I'm sorry.

248
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,729
I'm a bit nervous since it's my first counseling session.

249
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:44,850
It doesn't matter.

250
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,550
Take your time.

251
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,660
Hello, guys.

252
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,069
I know you are here this time to smooth out your spousal relationship.

253
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,899
I entrusted Chang Maomao with a questionnaire for both of you before.

254
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:06,820
I wonder if you've brought it here today.

255
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,330
Yes.

256
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,589
Maomao sent it on WeChat.

257
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,710
I had it printed out for me.

258
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,420
I think our marriage is on the rock.

259
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,940
[Strongly Disagree | Disagree | Agree | Strongly Agree]

260
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,330
What's your problem again?

261
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,469
What's my problem?

262
00:19:41,469 --> 00:19:44,200
Let me ask you. Do you want a divorce?

263
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,330
I want to divorce you indeed.

264
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,100
So what?

265
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,660
Drop, drop, drop. Strike, strike.

266
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,061
Strike, strike. Drop the glass, drop the glass.

267
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,780
Ms. Wu.

268
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,029
The counseling office is not a place for altercations.

269
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:02,110
Could you please calm down?

270
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,880
Here, give me the glass.

271
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,009
Both of you can calm yourselves down first.

272
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,580
It doesn't matter. We can take our time.

273
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,990
May I call you Ms. Wu?

274
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,040
You can call me Dafang.

275
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,810
Well, how should I address you?

276
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,240
- Song.
- Song, hello.

277
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,830
I know you guys came to this counseling office today at your son's request.

278
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,439
But since you've decided to come, you must have your own ideas.

279
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,799
Now please put both your hands on your knees.

280
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,009
Well done.

281
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:56,030
Next, let's talk about why you want to come here.

282
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,400
Okay, all right.

283
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
I'll do what you say.

284
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,840
No problem.

285
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,270
All right, okay.

286
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,970
Yes, okay, okay.

287
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,680
Who were you talking to on the phone?

288
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,380
China Mobile called.

289
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,560
Marketing.

290
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,260
Does a call from China Mobile have to take that long?

291
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,390
It says it's going to rain tonight.

292
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,330
They've changed the venue.

293
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,770
Who informed you?

294
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,700
The one who occasionally rides in my car going the same way.

295
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,060
I knew.

296
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,460
What do you know again?

297
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,470
I knew you two must have an affair.

298
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,679
Otherwise, why didn't you edit the contact with her name instead of 10086?

299
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,060
No wonder I couldn't catch her.

300
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,230
You must have tipped her off.

301
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,589
Do you even have the nerve to say so?

302
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,559
You went there and made a scene, and hit the wrong person.

303
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,921
She should count herself lucky.

304
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:16,050
If I get to catch her, I'm going to break her legs

305
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,460
so that she can only dance in her dreams for the rest of her life.

306
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,210
Just wait. I'm going to call her now.

307
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,770
When a couple becomes increasingly familiar with each other,

308
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,979
they tend to simplify their expressions and explanations of their behaviors to each other.

309
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,860
This helps them to understand each other quickly,

310
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,229
but meanwhile also limits the possibility of finding out more truths.

311
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,390
Give my cellphone to me.

312
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,760
I'm going dancing.

313
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,010
Why?

314
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,160
Are you going to see that young widow again?

315
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,999
Why do you say such awful things?

316
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:46,320
I say awful things?

317
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,130
Not as awful as the things you did.

318
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,539
Wu Shufang, do you have to talk like this?

319
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:52,979
Nothing happened between me and her, a clean sheet.

320
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:55,279
A lot of friends who were dancing there were watching.

321
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,580
If you don't believe me, go with me to have a look.

322
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,060
I'm not going.

323
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,219
Dafang, you have a lot of complaints about many of Song's lifestyles, right?

324
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:06,190
I have too many complaints.

325
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,559
I don't even know how I manage to live through all these years.

326
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:15,400
I keep telling myself it doesn't matter if a man has some peccadilloes, as long as he is faithful enough to you.

327
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,270
But he doesn't know you are doing everything you can to be good to him

328
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:23,279
and takes others' small favors as painstaking efforts.

329
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,640
Why did you think of buying a tablecloth?

330
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,130
It looks nice.

331
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,889
A member of the dancing team picked up something from others for me.

332
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:37,750
I picked a gift to return her favor and thought the tablecloth was nice, so I bought one for our home.

333
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,130
That young widow again?

334
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,900
She then went there to hit people.

335
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,099
Miss He, don't you think this is outrageous?

336
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:47,979
Just tell me, was that outfit a gift from her?

337
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:53,410
Miss He, over all these years, he only bought one or two sets of new clothes for the Spring Festival.

338
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:58,119
But ever since he got to know that young widow, he's been buying clothes so frequently.

339
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,580
Some of them are a gift from others.

340
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,180
It's a kind of reciprocity.

341
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,399
I cook for you, do the laundry and wait on you every day.

342
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:05,230
Why didn't you think of reciprocating me?

343
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,300
Then you shouldn't have gone so far as to hit people indiscriminately because of my fault.

344
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,209
You admit it's your fault?

345
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:12,540
I tell you what, don't let me catch her, or I'll break her legs!

346
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,280
Miss He, please judge who's right and who's wrong.

347
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,230
Dafang, Song, we've just simulated the process of your daily interactions.

348
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,819
But this is not a court and I'm not a judge.

349
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:25,389
I can't judge who's right and who's wrong.

350
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:30,030
But during the process of your altercations just now, I've found a pattern of your interactions.

351
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,039
A pattern?

352
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,440
What pattern?

353
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,360
A pursuit-evasion pattern.

354
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,450
[Presence of divorce intention | Pattern of Interaction | Pursue-evasion Pattern]

355
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,859
Actually, such a pattern is quite commonplace among couples.

356
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:45,079
One side pursues desperately while the other side tries desperately to avoid and evade.

357
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,229
Song, just now I found there were actually quite a few times when you wanted to

358
00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:53,810
leave your house and leave Dafang for a short period of time.

359
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:57,059
When you face conflicts, the first thing that comes to your mind

360
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,409
is to stay away from her to avoid the conflicts between you.

361
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:02,500
Who were you talking to on the phone?

362
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,510
China Mobile called.

363
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,480
I just want to

364
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,490
give myself

365
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,880
some time to cool down

366
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,400
and not to fuss about it.

367
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,970
I see.

368
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:24,799
Maybe your way of coping works in the short term by enabling you to avoid the conflicts.

369
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,989
But in the long term, it can't improve any of your problems.

370
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:33,019
You are just putting off current problems to the future to be solved.

371
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,190
You mean

372
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,980
the past problems are not solved

373
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,970
and put off until now, leading to an outburst?

374
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,309
Yes.

375
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,929
Your evasion is one part of the problem,

376
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:53,850
and the other part is your pursuit.

377
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:59,099
Do you mean I can't just go and ask him once a problem occurs, right?

378
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,109
Actually, in the pursuit-evasion pattern,

379
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:07,109
the pursuit side wants the other side to give you a very strong response.

380
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:10,920
And such a response is what you need and what you expect.

381
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,079
Once the response you get from the other side goes against your expectations,

382
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,130
your negative emotions will be very strong

383
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,529
and your pursuing mentality will be even stronger.

384
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:23,419
In the pattern of evasion-pursuit and pursuit-evasion,

385
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:26,139
neither of you is happy with your relationship.

386
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:30,819
But over time, this has become a fixed pattern.

387
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:36,210
If you want to change this pattern, one side may need to show restraint.

388
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,009
Maybe to you guys, this is a kind of risk.

389
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:42,649
But what you'll get in return is restraint on the part of the other side.

390
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:46,419
As long as you pursue one step less, the other side will evade one step less.

391
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:50,149
When you evade one step less, the other side will pursue one step less.

392
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:55,430
As to the evading side, you need to understand that the pursuing side uses every means

393
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:59,229
to get a response from you because she cares a lot about you.

394
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,360
As to the pursuing side, all you have to do is show restraint.

395
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,430
Do you mean

396
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:11,689
our relationship can be salvaged, right?

397
00:27:11,689 --> 00:27:13,410
Sure.

398
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,939
In the following two consultations, I'll counsel with both of you separately.

399
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:22,229
I'll collect your information and give feedback to both of you to solve the problems we are going to solve next.

400
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:26,030
In fact, I've got a preliminary understanding of your relationship.

401
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:30,959
I hope both of you will calm down and think about what your objectives are

402
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:35,530
after the counseling and tell me about it, all right?

403
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,740
I hope she can understand I will not cheat on her.

404
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:46,629
Surely in the following counseling, you will trust each other more and get to know each other more.

405
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:48,810
Please believe me.

406
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,510
I was thinking if I could turn the clock back,

407
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,970
I wouldn't marry him hastily just because his honesty and docility struck my fancy.

408
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,579
Don't you think it is because I was so easy to get that he holds me cheap?

409
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:04,210
I've gone through so many hard years with him.

410
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,599
Now at this age, he's even had a mistress behind my back!

411
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,010
I agree. I hold you cheap.

412
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,090
I do have a mistress if you say so.

413
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,060
You are right. Everything you say is right.

414
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,930
Now you are happy?

415
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,120
Sorry, Miss He. I have nothing to say. I'm off for now.

416
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,279
You…

417
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,280
I'm sorry, Song.

418
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,850
I don't have the right to stop you.

419
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:31,349
But what I'd like to say is what you are doing now is also a kind of evasion.

420
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,049
Did you see that? He's just like that. He's always doing that.

421
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,460
It's really intolerable.

422
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,930
You've come.

423
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,940
How did you know I was coming?

424
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,120
Because I'm waiting for you to come every day.

425
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,350
This is a bouquet of flowers for you.

426
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,889
- Thanks.
- Do you like it?

427
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,860
It smells so good.

428
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,509
Our sanatorium gives out snacks every day.

429
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:42,879
I haven't eaten any since your last visit and have been keeping them for you.

430
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:44,450
Try some.

431
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,090
Let me help you.

432
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,561
Thanks.

433
00:29:49,561 --> 00:29:52,640
It's very nice, sweet and sour.

434
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,470
Nice.

435
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:09,930
I'm here today to ask you about something.

436
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,700
Have a look at this first.

437
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,120
[Letter from Jicheng]

438
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,250
I'd like to know how you feel

439
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,290
when you read this letter.

440
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,750
"You have once

441
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,710
played many roles in my life.

442
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:01,659
My older brother, my friend and my husband."

443
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:07,660
"In these relationships, I've been on the receiving end."

444
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,420
"I dropped everything and left.

445
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,389
This is a mistake I have to bear for the rest of my life."

446
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:16,690
"I left the child to you

447
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,110
because you had always loved him

448
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,510
and I hope you could go on protecting him

449
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,050
and give him a stable life.

450
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,590
I'll come to terms with my illness in my own way.

451
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,820
Promise me not to look for me.

452
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,290
For the sake of me,

453
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,600
also for the sake of yourself."

454
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,400
"If you love me, please give me freedom.

455
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,929
Promise me not to put a query to irrelevant people.

456
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,720
He knows nothing.

457
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,080
The child's surname is Ye.

458
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,680
He's your son forever."

459
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,069
This is impossible.

460
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:13,420
How could there be a mother who doesn't love her child?

461
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,020
A family letter is worth ten thousand in gold.

462
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,000
Why is that?

463
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,300
Just because

464
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,060
it contains love, longing

465
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,810
and solicitude.

466
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,780
That's the value of a family letter.

467
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,990
But what is this?

468
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,940
Worthless.

469
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,730
But… But you…

470
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,000
What is your question?

471
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,710
My question is...

472
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,840
If you were the writer of the letter,

473
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,860
how would you write it?

474
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,960
I would say

475
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,040
"My dear child,

476
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,330
I love you so much.

477
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:39,810
If I were granted a wish,

478
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:45,470
I hope I could hold you in my arms every day.

479
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,350
But much to my regret,

480
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,810
I can only be an underdog

481
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,560
in face of the illness."

482
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,600
I would say

483
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,630
"My dear child,

484
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,230
be a healthy man.

485
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,660
Have a job you like.

486
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,660
Be an ordinary happy man."

487
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,280
Is the wind coming outside?

488
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,559
I really want to go out. They don't let me go out.

489
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,120
How nice it is outside!

490
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,770
How nice!

491
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,000
There are seas,

492
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,090
mountains, and a lot of people outside.

493
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,530
But I can only stay here.

494
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,150
Can you take me out?

495
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,180
Yes.

496
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,220
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

497
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,260
It's too windy.

498
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,280
If you keep the window open, you'll get a headache after a while.

499
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,450
To enjoy the current moment, it's all right to get a headache.

500
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,879
Are you thirsty? I've got some beverages with me.

501
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:08,450
Okay.

502
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,200
You haven't told me where you are going.

503
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,560
I can't keep on driving like this.

504
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,669
Let's go for a spin first.

505
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,090
I haven't figured out where to go yet.

506
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,160
What's wrong?

507
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,040
Why do you keep looking at me?

508
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,840
I've figured out where to go.

509
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,310
Where?

510
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,660
I want…

511
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,960
I want to cook a meal for you.

512
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,359
All right.

513
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,659
Let's go to my place then.

514
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:49,379
You've finally managed to come out, and you just want to cook a meal before you go back?

515
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:51,940
I'm not just cooking a meal.

516
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,920
Food is the first necessity of people.

517
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,290
I'm providing a necessity.

518
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,170
Okay.

519
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,850
It's not far from my place anyway.

520
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:06,200
If you are sleepy, take a nap first and we'll be there soon.

521
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,830
No rush.

522
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,229
It's good to keep on driving like this.

523
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,550
Here we are.

524
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,780
We're here.

525
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,470
Have we?

526
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,260
Right here.

527
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,460
This is…

528
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,869
I saw you were asleep just now, so I went to the market to do some grocery shopping.

529
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:10,120
I didn't know what you like to eat, so I bought a little bit of everything.

530
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,230
They are all my favorite.

531
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,170
Come on in.

532
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,279
Take a seat first.

533
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,420
I haven't been back for a long time.

534
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,420
It's a bit dusty.

535
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,999
Can I take a look around first?

536
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,500
Sure.

537
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,840
Personality Psychology.

538
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,940
Prescription Medicine.

539
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,560
Do you like medicine a lot?

540
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,709
I majored in clinical medicine at college.

541
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,939
I later went abroad to study psychiatry.

542
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,360
You have a steady personality which is fit for studying medicine.

543
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,030
I don't study for academic research.

544
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,560
I study to protect

545
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,380
the person I want to protect.

546
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,999
The person under your protection must be very happy.

547
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,040
From now on, I'll be your private doctor.

548
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,019
I can't afford the medical expenses.

549
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:44,900
No need to pay medical expenses.

550
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,610
Just cook a meal for me.

551
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,110
Okay.

552
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,480
Lili.

553
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,090
What are you doing here?

554
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:10,639
I'd like to use your kitchen to cook a meal.

555
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,230
Edible oil and condiments are all here.

556
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:21,970
There are also some fresh vegetables in the fridge which you can use in case you need some.

557
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,830
Remember to turn off the gas valve when you are done.

558
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,270
Lili.

559
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,660
You haven't eaten, have you?

560
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,900
Would you like to join us?

561
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,909
Yes.

562
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,969
Two people are too few. It's not easy to cook for two.

563
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,740
Let's eat together.

564
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,469
Thank you, Auntie.

565
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,359
But I've got some work to do.

566
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,160
Please be my guest.

567
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,410
Give me a shout if you need anything and I'll come down.

568
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,630
Thanks.

569
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,380
Anything I can help you with?

570
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,620
No need.

571
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,710
Didn't you say you'd do the laundry yesterday?

572
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,049
Why did you leave out this shirt of mine?

573
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:18,770
I remember I specially put it in the washing machine.

574
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,940
I didn't leave it out.

575
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,720
I took it out on purpose.

576
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,860
It's gaudy and of poor quality.

577
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,240
What if it loses color and dyes my good clothes?

578
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,350
If you didn't wash it, you should at least tell me.

579
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:34,310
I intended to wear it today.

580
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,230
Why?

581
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,480
It delays your dancing, right?

582
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,430
Wash it yourself if you need it urgently.

583
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,589
You are not doing any housework while being so ready to find fault.

584
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:47,130
I didn't say I was going dancing.

585
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,970
Why do you insist on wearing this shirt?

586
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:53,869
If you are not going dancing, are you going on a date with that young widow?

587
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:55,559
Why do you drag her into it again?

588
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,220
It's fine you didn't wash it.

589
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,720
Don't go.

590
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,860
Let me ask you.

591
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,410
Did she buy this shirt for you?

592
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,569
The quality is so poor and the taste so vulgar.

593
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,470
She had the nerve to give and you also had the nerve to take?

594
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:16,669
Chang Song, whatever you are doing outside, it's okay if I can't see it.

595
00:42:16,669 --> 00:42:19,949
Now you've even brought these rags back home!

596
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,980
It's just a shirt.

597
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,400
Why does it become so filthy when it comes out of your mouth?

598
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,230
Today you brought this, what about tomorrow?

599
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,990
Are you going bring your mistress back home tomorrow?

600
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,741
Are we going to keep this family running or not?

601
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:40,579
Wu Shufang, is it you who doesn't want to keep it running or me?

602
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:43,459
It's okay you show me no respect at home day by day.

603
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:45,720
You've been doing it in front of outsiders as well!

604
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,859
In front of the counselor the other day, you blamed me in every way you could.

605
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:52,630
Is it because I was so easy to get that he holds me cheap?

606
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,250
I've gone through so many hard years with him.

607
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,759
Now at this age, he's even had a mistress behind my back!

608
00:42:56,759 --> 00:42:59,139
Do you think you are super awesome riding your high horse?

609
00:42:59,139 --> 00:43:03,839
From beginning to end, I've been a cow dung to set off the beauty of a flower like you!

610
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,979
But when you take me as a cow dung, it doesn't mean everybody thinks I'm really a lump of cow dung.

611
00:43:07,979 --> 00:43:12,919
I tell you what, while you don't think highly of me, there are plenty of people who do!

612
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,839
You've finally said the words from your heart, haven't you?

613
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,849
You've long since taken me as an eyesore, haven't you?

614
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:21,300
Yes!

615
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,800
I have a long list of complaints!

616
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,070
Anyway, since we are talking turkey, I have nothing to fear.

617
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:30,049
You see, you only do a bit of housework every day and you can keep nagging me the whole day.

618
00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:31,770
Do you know what she says to me?

619
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:36,530
She says she's willing to be my housemaid.

620
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,330
Housemaid?

621
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,500
I've been with you for so many long, hard years. What do you take me for?

622
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,469
All right!

623
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,899
Try to live with her.

624
00:43:46,899 --> 00:43:49,120
See how long she can put up with you!

625
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,129
It's simply impossible to reason with you!

626
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,399
- Where are you going?
- Going to hell!

627
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:54,659
Go to hell!

628
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:57,580
Don't come back again if you've got any spunk in you!

629
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,470
