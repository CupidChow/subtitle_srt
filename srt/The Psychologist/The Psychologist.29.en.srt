Welcome back. This is Night Talk to Your Heart.

19
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:51,210
Recently, an online post about the imperfect victims has aroused public concern nationwide.

20
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,700
Nothing in this world is perfect.

21
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,900
We need to learn to embrace our own and other people's imperfections.

22
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:01,160
When faced with unexpected danger, everyone would feel overwhelmed.

23
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,060
- Dong, what's happening here?
- I've no idea.

24
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,510
- Why is there a power outage?
- This can't be.

25
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,900
Dong, ask the supervisor to play music.

26
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,930
Qian, the music is on. It seems we had a power outage.

27
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,910
- The technicians are working on it.
- Good.

He Dun, are you all right?

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,960
I'm sorry, I... I...

30
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,500
- I...
- Don't worry, it's okay.

00:02:33,663 --> 00:02:35,660
- Thanks.
- Hold it.

33

Dong, send the sound footage to the supervisor, ask him to play it.

Check if we got any candles or flashlights.

Qian Kaiyi, I...

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,780
I... I don't think I can continue with the show later.

37
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,270
It's okay. I'm here.

38
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,131
- Don't be afraid.
- Switch back to the garden house.

39
00:02:59,131 --> 00:03:01,590
There is no light here.

40
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,370
Dear listeners, don't worry.

41
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,190
We just had an electrical fault.

42
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,260
The team is working on it, the show still goes on.

43
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,341
To be honest, the moment the power went off, though

44
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:17,980
we were in a public, open space, I could sense

45
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,280
that someone felt scared.

46
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,230
It reminds me of those people whom we believed to be imperfect victims.

47
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,250
Perhaps, it has become a part of their life to be at a dark place.

48
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,350
When we are in the dark, we can't see things clearly.

49
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,430
As a result, we automatically switch to our hearing.

50
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,730
Perhaps, those sounds which we have ignored could give us strength.

51
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,921
Today, I'd like to take this chance to share some beautiful moments that I've captured and collected.

52
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:50,800
I hope these sounds can help soothe some listeners

53

55
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,930
In the first year I joined Haifeng Radio International,

56
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,420
I went to a northern town with the team.

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,050
I was away from urban growling machines.

58
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,780
The birds were flapping their wings while singing in a low voice.

59
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,470
Everything around me seemed clear and fresh.

60
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,870
The train was whistling past me.

61
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,340
It seemed everything around me was moving backwards

62
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,150
and I was the only one who moved forward steadily.

63
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,940
The ripe wheat in the distant cornfield

64
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,760
was bending over in the mouth of the wind, making a crashing sound.

65
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,190
And the sweet hum of cicadas in the afternoon was getting louder and louder.

66
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,840
This kind of vigor

67
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,200
left an indelible impression on me about that summer.

68
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,300
Tonight is a special night.

69
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,280
I hope these beautiful sounds could bring some comfort to our listeners.

70

00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,920
owe anyone any explanation.

75
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,100
In fact, for your own story, you can choose your own listener.

76
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,040
As your listener, I want to say,

this place is hardly open to the public.

Every time I did a show, I'd spend some time here.

Qian Kaiyi,

99
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,690
you said there was going to be some fun sounds.

100
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,410
Is it because of the power outage that we haven't heard it yet?

You'll hear it soon.

- It's late at night.
- I'm doing my voice.

No way.

106
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,753
Come on, don't think of it as a silly act.

107
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:12,340
Back in my college days, we'd do our voices every morning.

108
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,030
What a scene!

109
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,410
Just imagine a bunch of people standing in front of a wall,

110
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,420
all doing their vocal exercises by making exhalation sounds and talking to themselves.

111
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,680
One winter morning, when the day was still dark,

112
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,720
a middle-aged woman came to the other side of the wall

113
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,370
where she heard people making exhalation sounds and talking to themselves.

114
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,380
She thought someone was pulling a prank.

115
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,690
Guess what?

116
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,440
The woman was frightened and began to call names all that morning

117
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,820
with her hands resting on her hips.

118
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,841
Later, through my vocal exercises, I came to realize

119
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:43,960
it really helps by shouting out when you feel upset.

120
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,720
Do you want to give it a try?

121
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,360
Qian Kaiyi, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.

122
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,310
How can you keep yourself happy all the time?

123
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,910
Do I?

124
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:02,470
I thought I showed my vulnerability to you when Miao left me.

125
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,840
Yes, you did.

126
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,780
Sometimes you felt sad.

127
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,280
But such sadness seemed to be ephemeral.

128
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,650
Like what happened just now, you looked jovial again right after shouting out.

129
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,580
I can never do that.

130
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,143
For example, just now?

131
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,930
Just now, I can tell

132
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,000
you went out of your way to make me happy.

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,620
However, I just can't.

134
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,670
Were you thinking of your younger brother back then?

135
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,810
During a six-month period after his death, I couldn't see anything.

136
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,700
I was living in the dark.

137
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,740
The darkness back in the studio made me feel familiar.

138
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,790
It frightened me.

139
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,140
Back then,

140
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,860
I couldn't see anything. I relied on my hearing.

141
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,630
I used my ears to listen to this world.

142
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,360
Thanks to those sounds, I pulled myself out of that mire.

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,280
No wonder your hearing is so good.

144
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,320
That's why I really envy you.

145
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,370
Qian Kaiyi, tell me about it.

146
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,600
How do you keep yourself happy?

147
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,740
On the show, I always listen to people's stories.

148
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,540
I deal with people's negative feelings.

149
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,030
However, I need to find a way to vent my feelings.

150
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,230
I've been doing some boxing.

151
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,540
For me, exercise is a way to vent my negative feelings.

152
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,120
It's an option.

153
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,570
That's kind of similar to psychotherapy.

154
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,950
Also, after the show, I'd come here to sit for a while.

155
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,050
Actually, being happy is not a result.

156
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,540
It's an option.

157
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:09,710
When you feel upset, you'd want to get rid of the frustration and negative feelings.

158
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,100
Perhaps I just don't know how to get rid of them.

159
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,450
Not really.

160
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,340
It's just that you don't want to give it a try.

161
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,230
You'd rather bottle your feelings up than opening your heart

162
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,640
to throw your negative feelings away and set a place

163
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,480
for pleasant feelings.

164
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,420
Sometimes, making a choice can be harder than getting a result.

165
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,720
Maybe you can give it a try.

166
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,460
You know I was trying to make you happy.

167
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,360
But you just wouldn't try my method and shout out.

168
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,911
Give it a try. No one knows.

169
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,543
He Dun!

170
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,933
He Dun!

171
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:04,830
Can you hear me?

172
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,680
Qian Kaiyi!

173
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,590
I can hear you!

174
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,070
He Dun!

175
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,440
Whenever you feel unhappy, you can shout it out!

176
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,080
I want to be happy!

177
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,030
He Dun!

178
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,440
What?

179
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,190
You can be happy.

180
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,730
I will be happy.

181
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,420
You will be happy.

182
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,440
Ms. Wen, I'm afraid

183
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,090
I'm going to quit our counselling process.

184
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,840
Why did you make that decision?

185
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,183
I'm sorry, Ms. Wen.

186
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,500
I'm here to make an apology to you.

187
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,740
You know, I was lying to you.

188
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,200
Jun Jun was not my younger brother.

189
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,860
He was my son.

190
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,453
Mom.

191
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:43,560
So, you've been talking about your daughter's situation?

192
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,093
Yes.

193
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:48,880
I described her symptoms to you

194
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,250
based on my observations.

195
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,570
If you think your daughter has mental illness,

196
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,000
why didn't you bring her here?

197
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,490
My daughter is really stubborn.

198
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,180
She won't agree.

199
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,250
Most importantly,

200
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,540
I don't want to hurt her feelings.

201
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,470
To tell you the truth, I came to you in a rush because I thought

202
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,980
I got some serious disease and that I would be dead soon.

203
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,120
That's why I came to you.

204
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,153
Anyway, Ms. Wen, I apologize to you sincerely.

205
00:14:25,153 --> 00:14:28,100
I'm so sorry for lying to you.

206
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,670
Hope I didn't hurt your feelings.

207
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,510
Her pulse is stable and strong.

208
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,150
She is telling the truth.

209
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,540
You didn't hurt my feelings.

210
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,220
It's okay.

211
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:50,663
Auntie Zhao, you were eager to know the treatment for PTSD.

212
00:14:50,663 --> 00:14:53,110
I gathered that's for your daughter.

213
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,740
If my mom could do this for me, I'd be touched.

214
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,470
That makes you a good daughter.

215
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,610
But my daughter...

216
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,180
She is a good girl. But...

217
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,960
It seems fate is unkind to her.

218
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,370
I don't know what prevented your daughter from coming here.

219
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,520
But I suggest you take her to a psychiatrist.

220
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,010
It's okay if she doesn't choose me.

221
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,560
I can refer her to someone else.

222
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,393
Auntie Zhao,

223
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:33,520
did you realize

224
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,680
that you've gone

225
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,330
some mental changes after your son's death?

226
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,813
Yes.

227
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:44,780
During that period,

228
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,390
I felt everything was a mess.

229
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,150
I didn't have time to look after myself.

230
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:56,270
Let's leave this sad place and start a new life.

231
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,103
I'm not leaving

232
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,300
without He Dun.

233
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,100
She can live with your relatives, no matter who.

234
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,023
No way.

235
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,500
She is my child.

236
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,960
She is living with me.

237
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,680
You said you suffered from a serious disease and were going to die soon.

238
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,910
What happened back then?

239
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,870
Mental conditions can affect our physical conditions.

240
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,953
In your daughter's case, she got PTSD and blindness.

241
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:30,800
In your case...

242
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,980
I fainted.

243
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,580
When was the first time that you fainted?

244
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,940
What happened then?

245
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,440
Sister Qing, your face is of a waxy yellow color. What happened?

246
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,410
I worked overtime last night. I stayed up late.

247
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,070
Do you have whitening masks that Lili gave us?

248
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,843
Just a minute.

249
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,230
Wow, you got plenty of them.

250
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,350
UNIFON is gonna save my face tortured by working overtime and staying up late.

251
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,250
UNIFON uses upmarket whitening ingredients.

252
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,673
Women...

253
00:17:13,673 --> 00:17:14,880
You know nothing.

254
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,813
Come on.

255
00:17:16,813 --> 00:17:18,800
Why did you work overtime and stay up late last night?

256
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,390
The post of that imperfect victims got updated.

257
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,700
What's new?

258
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,110
It's said that the man involved is Qi Ming from Tianqi Group.

259
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,130
This morning, a relevant recording tape was released.

260
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,990
Though less than a minute, the tape was a bomb.

261
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,823
Let me hear it.

262
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,930
He called himself a hardened criminal.

263
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,490
I've conquered many women.

264
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,520
Some of them didn't agree at first.

265
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,200
However, they all turned submissive to me.

266
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,803
I got this.

267
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:54,730
Hello. This is Haifeng Radio International.

268
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,060
- May I...
- Hello, I have something important

269
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,760
to tell the Night Talk to Your Heart team.

270
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,680
I'm sorry.

271
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,161
If you want to share your story, you're welcome to

272
00:18:04,161 --> 00:18:06,750
dial the exclusive hotline during the show.

273
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,560
I'm the writer of the post of the imperfect victims.

274
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,090
I want to expose what Qi Ming did on the show.

275
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,660
What are you looking at?

276
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,930
He Dun, come over here.

277
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,183
Wait a minute.

278
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,213
Qian Kaiyi.

279
00:18:39,213 --> 00:18:42,000
He Dun, I got some good news for you.

280
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,720
Do you remember that post about imperfect victims?

281
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,800
Yeah.

282
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,230
Qi Ming, the man involved, was caught on a tape which is now circulating on the Internet.

283
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,490
I applied for an emergency show.

284
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,360
Are you free today?

285
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,520
Yes.

286
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,740
See you at the garden house later. Okay, bye.

287
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,173
Bye.

288
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,933
Got it?

289
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,070
- It's me.
- You should have called. Come on in.

290
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,980
I heard you caught a cold.

291
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,000
I bought some health products for you.

292
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,350
Don't take your illness slightly.

293
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,020
It can get really serious.

294
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,800
Come on, don't exaggerate.

295
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,370
I'm just getting old.

296
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,360
But He Dun was so worried about me.

297
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,000
Always put the 999 cold medicine in your drawer.

298
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,581
This is really good. It's really good.

299
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,220
Come.

300
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,580
Drink some water.

301
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,370
Drink some water. You look tired.

302
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,843
Xiping,

303
00:20:05,843 --> 00:20:11,303
do you think I got the chance to meet Dun Dun?

304
00:20:11,303 --> 00:20:13,320
I didn't mean anything.

305
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,960
I just want to say sorry to her.

306
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,850
I owe her an apology.

307
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,000
Please give me a chance to make it up to her.

308
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,210
Regardless of your absence all these years, she has grown up.

309
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,580
You've no idea how amazing she is right now.

310
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,840
She has a successful career.

311
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,620
She is accompanied by a group of friends who shared the same ideas and interests with her.

312
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,953
Wait a moment.

313
00:20:36,953 --> 00:20:38,480
What kind of friends?

314
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,990
Handsome boys. Beautiful girls.

315
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,660
There is this boy who knows how to practice acupuncture.

316
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,680
My legs were not feeling well. He performed acupuncture on me twice.

317
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,300
He is really nice.

318
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,490
There is another boy who is really smart and brilliant.

319
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,660
He'd accompany me to the hospital, racing up and down stairs for me.

320
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,160
He is the son I never had.

321
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,230
There is this girl named Lili.

322
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,900
She and Dun Dun live together.

323
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,210
She's been helping Dun Dun a lot.

324
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:07,090
I've been thinking of a way to thank these kids.

325
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,780
Well, you should.

326
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,030
Invite them over for a nice dinner.

327
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,040
I'm going to need a good reason.

328
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,180
You don't need a reason to express your gratitude.

329
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,850
Let's buy some meat and vegetables today.

330
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,780
After all that nonsense, now you're saying the right thing.

331
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,640
Hello? Reading?

332
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,460
What's up? Bringing me things?

333
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,690
They're not for you. But we can share.

334
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,643
Tea cakes.

335
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,590
Where did you get it?

336
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,440
By ordering on the client side.

337
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,340
Do you like it? Let me show you.

338
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,830
I'm going to buy whatever I want.

339
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,191
Go ahead. He Dun will be paying for this.

340
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,110
I don't think Qi Ming can get away this time.

341
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,210
That's right.

342
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,650
It seems we're good at it.

343
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,741
How about we two make a chivalrous group?

344
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:13,330
He Dun helps heal people's spirits.

345
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,310
We two can help the weak.

346
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,310
Perfect.

347
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,950
I think that sounds like a great idea.

348
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,380
I mean it. I'm not kidding.

349
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:27,353
Since you're so awesome, take a guess

350
00:22:27,353 --> 00:22:29,333
who is calling.

351
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:32,360
You don't think it's from Fang Zhongyi, do you?

352
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,840
I've blocked him long ago.

353
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,360
It can't be him.

354
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,793
All righ.

355
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,900
- Hello?
- Hello, is that Lili?

356
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,880
- Oh, Auntie.
- Yes, it's me.

357
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,660
I just went to the wet market and bought some fresh fish and shrimps.

358
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,920
Are you free tonight?

359
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,880
Dun Dun told me that you like sweet and sour pork ribs.

360
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,430
I bought some pork ribs.

361
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,070
How about having dinner at my place?

362
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,210
I'd love to, Auntie.

363
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,830
It's He Dun's mom.

364
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,951
- Slowly.
- Okay.

365
00:23:00,951 --> 00:23:03,070
Are you with someone?

366
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,450
I'm with Ye Jiahui. We're having tea together.

367
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,040
Oh, I see.

368
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,520
Then bring Jiahui and Xiao Qian together.

369
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,710
No problem.

370
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,150
I'll make sure they come tonight.

371
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,560
- Ask Dun Dun to come.
- All right.

372
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,210
Ask Dun Dun to come.

373
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,280
I called Dun Dun but she didn't pick up the phone.

374
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,530
She rushed out for some business.

375
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,260
Please tell her to come for the dinner.

376
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,060
I'll let her know when she is back.

377
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,593
Okay.

378
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:33,620
Goodbye, Auntie.

379
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,103
- Come to the dinner with me.
- Okay.

380
00:23:36,103 --> 00:23:37,940
What are you drinking?

381
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,780
I've been staying up late these days. I need the Pearlosophy collagen peptide drink.

382
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,010
Do you want to have one?

383
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,900
If it's for free.

384
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,370
Hey, why did He Dun go out?

385
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,000
It seems to be another secret that she is not allowed to tell.

386
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,950
I don't even bother to ask her.

387
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,170
Give it a thought.

388
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,320
The chivalrous group.

389
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,570
I'll get the bill.

390
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,990
It tastes right this time.

391
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,623
Come on.

392
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:54,193
Have a taste.

393
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,093
Smell it.

394
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,440
The same old smell. It's tasty.

395
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,093
Hold it for me.

396
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,540
Oh, crap. Old He, come over here.

397
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,800
Lili sent me a message half an hour ago, saying they're on the way here.

398
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,780
They'll be here soon. What should I do?

399
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,400
Don't worry.

400
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,920
You mean it's time for me to leave.

401
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,680
Okay, okay. I'm leaving.

402
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,750
Give it to me.

403
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,340
I'm leaving.

404
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,820
The apron, the apron.

405
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,253
All right.

406
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,273
Come on.

407
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,293
Be well.

408
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:44,903
I'm out of here.

409
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,113
- Watch out on the road.
- Okay.

410
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:52,310
Don't drink too much at dinner.

411
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,883
I know.

412
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,800
Director Wang, I'm at the hotel now.

413
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,970
Did you say Crystal Palace?

414
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,700
That's right. Give the document to Lingling.

415
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,710
She has to close the deal tonight.

416
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:15,020
You mean they're in there?

417
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,110
Have a drink, Ms. Li.

418
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,673
Xiao Wei, it's my fault.

419
00:26:41,673 --> 00:26:43,190
I didn't make it clear to Director Wang.

420
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,190
He didn't think much about it before he sent you here.

421
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,760
Please forgive me.

422
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,810
It's okay.

423
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,263
I'm out of here.

424
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:56,600
Okay. Call a tax. It's on the company.

425
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,590
Xiaoxiao, you're young and sexy.

426
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,670
- Director Qi, I want to go home.
- Director Qi.

427
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,160
- Be a good girl.
- It's so late.

428
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,110
Where are you taking this girl?

429
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:21,260
She said she wanted to go home. I'm going to take her home.

430
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,833
I promise I'll bring her back in one piece tomorrow.

431
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:28,490
- Come on, go with me.
- Director Qi!

432
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,433
She is so drunk.

433
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:33,300
She'll be a buzzkill for you.

434
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,060
Now you're the buzzkill.

435
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,790
So, you don't want to close the deal?

436
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,360
Option one: let her go home with me.

437
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,360
Option two: drop the deal.

438
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,020
The garden coffee house, please.

439
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,353
Hurry up.

440
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,420
- Boss.
- Catch up with her. Hurry up.

441
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,253
Let's go.

442
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,293
Hey.

443
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,440
Stop that. Hurry up. The show will start soon.

444
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,940
Don't worry. I won't mess it up.

445
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,000
Hey, I used to have frizzy hair.

446
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,670
Don't you think the hair-care products of Mageline make my hair look much better?

447
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,850
That's true.

448
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,283
Can I have one?

449
00:28:47,283 --> 00:28:48,963
Buy it yourself.

450
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:53,330
This part. It's better not to ask the victim about her experience.

451
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,850
We need to protect her privacy.

452
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,160
We are expected to listen to her story.

453
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,070
And ask questions based on her narration.

454
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,970
So I think we can spare this part.

455
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,570
Okay, I'll just jot that down.

456
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,160
- Any other problems?
- No.

457
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,800
The show will be on air in half an hour.

458
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,710
I'll get a cup of coffee. You can take a rest.

459
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,993
Okay.

460
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,750
[Tang Lili]

461
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,250
[He Dun, your mom invited us to dinner at her place. Remember to bring Qian Kaiyi with you.]

462
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,460
Oh my god.

463
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,231
Qian Kaiyi, what are you doing? Peeking at my phone?

464
00:29:36,231 --> 00:29:37,700
I saw my name on the screen.

465
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,200
Where is it? I was wrong.

466
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,760
You gave me a fright.

467
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,030
I was just about to say that.

468
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,700
Miss He, when was your appointment with the guest?

469
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,980
I think she is on the way here. Let me give her a call and confirm it.

470
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,280
Hello, Miss He.

471
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,680
Li Wei, where are you now?

472
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,231
I called a taxi. I got off at the wrong place.

473
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:09,350
I'm walking now.

474
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,683
It seems...

475
00:30:12,683 --> 00:30:15,493
Li Wei? Li Wei?

476
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,313
What's wrong?

477
00:30:18,313 --> 00:30:19,370
She hung up on me.

478
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,170
Let me call her again.

479
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,190
Did she regret?

480
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,900
Don't worry. What was she saying?

481
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,990
I called a taxi. I got off at the wrong place.

482
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,780
I'm walking now. It seems...

483
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,850
[He Dun]

484
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,610
Something happened to her.

485
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,040
- I need to find her.
- I'm coming with you.

486
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,061
No. What about the show?

487
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:54,760
What if Li Wei runs into a danger? It's more important to save her life.

488
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,280
Dong, keep the show running as usual.

489
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,160
- If we can't make it, put on the pre-recorded tape.
- Okay.

490
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,170
Dong, if, I mean if, anything happens, call the police.

491
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,980
[The subscriber you've dial is on a call.]

492
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,590
Come on, still no answer.

493
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:10,830
- Maybe we should split up. That will be faster.
- Okay.

494
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,283
Be careful.

495
00:31:14,283 --> 00:31:16,530
- Don't worry.
- Keep in contact.

496
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,710
I just did some screening.

497
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,213
Hello, He Dun.

498
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,230
Want to run?

499
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,950
What on earth do you want?

500
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,480
Are you trying to run again or not?

501
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,010
You don't have to cooperate.

502
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,210
I'll hide you at a place where no one can find you.

503
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,743
Stop!

504
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,330
Go your way.

505
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,490
Mind your own business.

506
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,400
Who the hell are you?

507
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,870
Guys, easy. Easy, easy.

508
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,300
Let's talk about this.

509
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,680
What are you doing?

510
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,993
Come on.

511
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,400
I'm not a rubbernecker.

512
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,580
I'm here to offer your ideas.

513
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,250
To help you deal with this.

514
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,780
Who the hell are you?

515
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,880
How can you help us?

516
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,273
Well, you tied her up because of that show, right?

517
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,820
I happen to be the host of that show.

518
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,541
I got all the evidence. Audios, videos and photos.

519
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:39,460
I got everything.

520
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,070
See, it's useless to tie her up.

521
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:46,630
With her tied up, I'm still going to do the show.

522
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,863
I got an idea.

523
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:52,020
You guys tie me up.

524
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:52,950
Okay?

525
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,300
You guys tie me up.

526
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,660
That will prevent me from doing the show.

527
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,930
Right? Don't you think so?

528
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:01,330
What show are you talking about? You're full of bullshit.

529
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,660
Tie him up. Tie him up.

530
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,590
No, no, no, no.

531
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:10,920
I mean, let her go and tie me up.

532
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,940
Full of bullshit. Beat his ass! Full of bullshit.

533
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,503
You hit me?

534
00:34:17,503 --> 00:34:18,753
Come on.

535
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,673
Come on.

536
00:34:26,673 --> 00:34:28,373
Stop.

537
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,373
I'm sorry.

538
00:34:32,373 --> 00:34:34,270
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

539
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,570
It hurts. It hurts.

540
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,703
Behave yourself. Move.

541
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,561
All right, fine.

542
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,920
Get on your knees.

543
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,670
It hurts. It hurts.

544
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,630
- Get on your knees.
- Get on your knees.

545
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,020
Buy one get one free. It's a bargain.

546
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,560
Try to play the hero?

547
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,360
Run, run, run!

548
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,310
Run, run, run! Hurry up!

549
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,460
Just run!

550
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,520
Stop!

551
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,230
Run! Run!

552
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,653
Hurry up!

553
00:35:29,653 --> 00:35:30,820
- This way.
- Stop!

554
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,090
This way.

555
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,000
- Li Wei.
- Run!

556
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,953
Stop! Stop! Stop!

557
00:35:37,953 --> 00:35:39,643
Stop!

558
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,020
Stop!

559
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,783
Stop!

560
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,080
Stop! Stop!

561
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,320
The police is here. Run!

562
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,053
Let's go.

563
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:37,100
♫  Listen to the melody of the wind  ♫

564
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:43,920
♫  Slowly blowing off leaves from the trees  ♫

565
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,040
♫  Look at the clear sunshine  ♫

566
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:56,940
♫  Hurried brushing passed your figure  ♫

567
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,520
♫  That little secret deep in my heart  ♫

568
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:13,880
♫  That melancholic but beautiful rainy season  ♫

569
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,780
♫  That parting despite the attachment which has to be faced  ♫

570
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:26,380
♫  Those bits and pieces, those memories  ♫

571
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:54,450
♫  That pen I borrowed from you but didn't return  ♫

572
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:00,490
♫  Those questions whose answers I pretend to know  ♫

573
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:05,330
♫  That sigh I saw inadvertently  ♫

574
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,610
♫  That sigh I saw inadvertently  ♫

575
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:29,030
♫  Those bits and pieces, those memories  ♫

576
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:40,200
♫  Are all about you  ♫

577
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:45,330
♫  It's all you  ♫

578
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,181
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

579
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,320
I guess they're on the way here.

580
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,980
You two make a very attractive couple.

581
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,300
Auntie,

582
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,770
he and He Dun...

583
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,660
What He?

584
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,710
My ex-husband's surname is He.

585
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:11,660
- Auntie,
- she means He Dun.

586
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,293
With you?

587
00:39:13,293 --> 00:39:15,290
Come on, Auntie.

588
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:18,240
Your daughter is taken by someone else.

589
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,500
By who?

590
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,370
Qian Kaiyi.

591
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,210
What are you doing?

592
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,710
Does it still hurt?

593
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,243
Not at all.

594
00:39:33,243 --> 00:39:35,711
Do I look like a wreck?

595
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:37,290
Your injury looks conspicuous.

596
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,923
Does it hurt?

597
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:42,210
It's okay. You can tell your mom that I fell off my motorcycle.

598
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,180
Don't make her worry about you.

599
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,460
Hey.

600
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,093
What's wrong?

601
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,030
- What are you doing?
- I got a bit nervous.

602
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,841
Come on, it's not a big deal.

603
00:39:57,841 --> 00:39:59,991
What are you nervous about?

604
00:39:59,991 --> 00:40:02,773
How will you introduce me to your mom?

605
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,750
What are you talking about?

606
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,800
Come on, He Dun. Don't play dumb with me.

607
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
We already did that thing.

608
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,020
What thing?

609
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,810
Do I need to refresh your memory?

610
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,740
No need. My mom is in there.

611
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,840
Ms. Zhao Xiping,

612
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,460
Ms. Tang Lili and Mr. Ye Jiahui,

613
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,793
we three now swear brothers and sisters.

614
00:40:34,793 --> 00:40:36,503
- Okay.
- Mom.

615
00:40:36,503 --> 00:40:38,910
To He Dun...

616
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,960
Qian Kaiyi...

617
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,090
What's going on here?

618
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,990
Dun Dun. This is Dun Dun.

619
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,060
My niece.

620
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,180
Qian Kaiyi.

621
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,800
Second Brother, what is going on here?

622
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,633
Come over here.

623
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:52,900
How much did you drink?

624
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,850
Sit down.

625
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,500
What happened to your face?

626
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,470
It's okay, Auntie. I fell off my motorcycle.

627
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,800
Where did he fall off?

628
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,130
His motorcycle.

629
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,290
Are you all right?

630
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,770
I'm all right. I'm fine.

631
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,431
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

632
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:09,100
He Dun, come on.

633
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,100
- Let me introduce... This is...
- Have a drink.

634
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,080
My big brother.

635
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,483
This is my second brother.

636
00:41:18,483 --> 00:41:20,720
- We are now sworn brothers and sisters.
- That's right.

637
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,390
I'm your Uncle.

638
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,760
- That's right.
- He is your Uncle.

639
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,750
He is also my Uncle.

640
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,940
Let's drink, come on.

641
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,210
- Let's celebrate our becoming brothers and sisters.
- Cheers!

642
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:34,660
We are now He Dun's rock.

643
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:39,120
- It's bottom up. Thanks, Mom. Thanks.
- - Fried pork in scoop, the dish is for you.

644
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,430
- Dun Dun likes it.
- Fill that up, fill that up.

645
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,330
Shredded potatoes, Dun Dun likes it.

646
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,291
And the wine. Drink it.

647
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:47,150
Dun Dun, have it, come on.

648
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,883
Big brother, come over here.

649
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:51,320
You two enjoy the dish.

650
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,420
You two enjoy it together.

651
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,160
Hey, out of the way.

652
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,523
That's right.

653
00:41:57,523 --> 00:41:58,990
Here is a toast to everyone.

654
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,900
You're gathered here today.

655
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,130
- Not this bottle.
- Come on.

656
