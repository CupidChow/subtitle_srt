[The Psychologist]

16
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,840
This TV series is produced with a special fund for guiding and supporting TV series in 2020 from the National Radio and Television Administration and is a key TV series project supported by the Hainan Free Trade Port.

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,680
[Episode 17]

18
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,500
Are you studying bipolar disorder?

19
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,899
This F is the visitor who came to my senior sister apprentice before?

20
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,939
My teacher knows something about it.

21
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,699
Bipolar disorder is called "disease of genii".

22
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:59,429
Non-medicine recognition intervention is probably the best solution.

23
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:04,029
Cognitive therapy. Cued recall training.

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,819
Professor, does the patient have close contact with others,

25
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:10,219
such as love, relatives, and friends,

26
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:14,569
or anyone who shares a cherished memory with him?

27
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,979
Just like this jigsaw.

28
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:26,030
Help the patient get the lost memories

29
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,830
through some objective clues given by others.

30
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,409
This process not only helps them regain their memories,

31
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:36,060
but also trains the patient in cued recall,

32
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,899
which is able to help them fix the function of free memory.

33
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:42,130
There is such a possibility.

34
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,730
But among them, there might be someone who has hurt the patient.

35
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,520
Under the stimulation, the patient will perhaps sink into danger again.

36
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,650
Then it's more than memory loss.

37
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,290
His life will also be in danger.

38
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,650
Keep your chin up.

39
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,310
Continue your study in this direction.

40
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,340
You're waiting for your assumption to be confirmed.

41
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,679
So are others. Take your time.

42
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,670
Well, go back to sleep.

43
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,430
Staying up late harms the skin of girls like you.

44
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,440
After drinking your tea, how could I be sleepy?

45
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,190
So you're blaming me?

46
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,410
No. I'm energetic now.

47
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,169
I have to go back to prepare for tonight's radio program.

48
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:37,699
Okay, go.

49
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:39,320
Bye.

50
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,560
Remember,

51
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,770
don't lap up information without digesting it.

52
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,450
Got it.

53
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,459
Xiao Zhang, prepare the information about the supply meeting.

54
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:08,640
- It'll be needed on Tuesday.
- Okay.

55
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,829
Director Li of the supply meeting can't eat cold food because of a weak stomach.

56
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:13,430
- So all the food need to be heated. Got it?
- Yes.

57
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,229
Kevin, there are some errors in the discount calculation in the annual report.

58
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:18,940
Do it over and give it to me before going off duty.

59
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,640
Sorry, Miss Tang. I'll do it right now.

60
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,149
Cindy, confirm the notes with the host of the entrepreneur exchange meeting to be held next week.

61
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:26,520
Okay.

62
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,099
- Did you write that request?
- Yes.

63
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:33,709
Because President Fang immediately wanted it, I wrote it in a hurry. Is there anything wrong with it?

64
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,329
The content is coherent, but there are some mistakes in punctuation.

65
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:41,389
For example, a wavy line is usually used to mark the range of values, instead of a straight line.

66
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,899
And as for the number of over 4 digits, it usually uses the internationally accepted three-digit division method.

67
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:52,919
The number is divided into sections of three digits from the decimal point onwards. Amend it.

68
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,009
Director Tang, if the content is correct, do punctuation errors matter?

69
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:59,830
Yes. In the request of other files

70
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,639
that concern government agencies, any punctuation error has a great impact.

71
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,159
But it doesn't matter this time. After all, it's urgent. So you're not to blame.

72
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:14,560
I'll help you rectify it. Pay attention to it next time.

73
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,080
Xiao Qian, can you send this as an E-copy to me?

74
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,210
DirectorTang, how did you know my name?

75
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,139
Judging from your previous contact with Tang Lili, what do you think of her?

76
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,680
Yeah, what do you think?

77
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,040
She's nice and obliging.

78
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,169
- Do you know her past?
- Yeah.

79
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:41,959
I know, but hasn't it been clarified? She was framed.

80
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:45,919
We don't know if it's true. Besides, she betrayed her former employer as soon as she left.

81
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,760
A person like her looks good,

82
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,619
but may be more sinister than any other secretly.

83
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,140
This pose is pretty good.

84
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,590
All right.

85
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,050
Qian, I find you have the potential to be an actor.

86
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,980
Pretty good, Qian.

87
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,950
[Fresh Snacks coming to Lyfen]

88
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,169
Xiao Li, I'm placing an order on LYFEN. What do you want?

89
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,880
- Can you handle this, Dong?
- He Dun.

90
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,570
Gosh!

91
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,700
Were you really serious when making those poses?

92
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,270
I can easily handle those fashionable poses.

93
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,920
That's amazing.

94
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,879
Why didn't you call me when you left this morning?

95
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,749
You were sleeping. Jiahui has got up.

96
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,149
Where did you go? To eat breakfast?

97
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,479
No.

98
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,390
I went to visit my mentor with something in his car. What's wrong?

99
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,489
In his car?

100
00:07:09,489 --> 00:07:11,929
Where did you sit? In the passenger seat?

101
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:14,980
Where do you think I can sit in my friend's car?

102
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,959
Miss He, hello. Miss He.

103
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,409
Miss He.

104
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,170
Dong's in charge of taking photos today.

105
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,830
Our station doesn't give us the budget for the post. We can only do it ourselves. Don't mind it.

106
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,349
Of course, I won't. I'll be less nervous if my acquaintance takes photos of me.

107
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,230
Nervous?

108
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,250
I can't believe you'll be nervous.

109
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,260
Then go change your clothes and start.

110
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,920
- Okay.
- Start.

111
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,820
Adjust the light.

112
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,609
- Is this pose handsome?
- A bit disgusting.

Miss He.

117

Miss He, I think you're too nervous. Relax.

118
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,759
Yeah. Qian, put your hand here.

119
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,070
Don't move it around.

120
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,530
Be closer to each other. That's right.

121
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,870
Okay, let's take a few more photos.

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,160
Good, smile.

Closer.

124
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,540
Smile. You look embarrassed.

125
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,690
Still embarrassed.

126
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,840
Dong, adjust their poses again.

127
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,439
Don't look like strangers. You're partners!

128

Closer. Closer. Head.

- Yes. Wonderful!

Your hand.

00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,040
Hand.

132
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,470
Sorry. I'm sorry.

He put my hand…

Once again. Continue.

135

Put it here. Keep this pose, all right?

136
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,549
Pretty good. Start.

137

Hold on. Wonderful!

00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:25,659
Hey, isn't it too much? It's just a photo for promotion.

- I think it's proper.
- I think so.

140
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:29,350
Very proper.

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,010
Please have a look.

163
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,350
You're fast.

164
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,479
It's been a short time since the statement was provided.

165
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:04,470
All this will be checked by you first.

166
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,130
Yes, President Fang.

167
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,829
How's your work? Are you getting used to it?

168
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:12,470
Are you doubting my competence?

169
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,400
I mean,

170
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,199
if you have any problems, you have to let me know.

171
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:26,230
You don't have to worry about anything here.

172
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,910
President Fang,

173
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,760
you aren't allowed to flirt when working.

174
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,299
- It's this smell.
- How is it?

175
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:44,719
You still have as good a nose as when you were a kid.

176
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:46,020
- I'm eating now.
- Hurry up.

177
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,440
Just eat.

178
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,839
- It's delicious.
- Then eat more.

179
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,910
Do you just eat buns at dinner?

180
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,960
I just want it.

181
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,790
Drink under your wife's nose?

182
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,859
You're much bolder.

183
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:11,750
It's fine to drink with you.

184
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,710
She can't help it.

185
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,539
I have rarely drunk since I became a designated driver.

186
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,640
I'm on vacation these two days, so it's fine to drink a bit.

187
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,130
Then it's a wise decision to do this job.

188
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,230
You should try your best to give up alcohol.

189
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,860
Be obedient.

190
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,539
You're in your prime time now.

191
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:48,099
So it's time for you to take your marriage into consideration.

192
00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:51,330
If you can get married by the end of this year,

193
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,540
you'll have two babies in the next year,

194
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,009
- the Year of the Tiger.
- My gosh!

195
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:01,520
You even helped me make the schedule.

196
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,740
Then I've got to try my best.

197
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,810
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

198
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,349
I just have a crush on a girl, but she doesn't like me.

199
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,690
To my surprise, you've met obstacles.

200
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:21,909
You've been stubborn and persistent since your childhood.

201
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:25,779
Are you going to surrender in this thing?

202
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:30,989
No. It's just that I offended her when I was a child.

203
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:33,100
Have a drink.

204
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,100
Dad.

205
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,320
This is my son.

206
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,289
Hello, Uncles. It's been a long time.

207
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,010
I'm late because of a traffic jam.

208
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,230
Director Ye,

209
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,740
I didn't expect that you had such an old son.

210
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,030
Look, they don't like father and son.

211
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,060
Director Ye, you did something great

212
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,570
when you were young.

213
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,649
Jiahui, since you're here, I have a question for you.

214
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:43,030
If you see any landscape with a broader horizon, what does it mean?

215
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,729
Don't complain so as to avoid harming health and see any landscape with a broader horizon.

216
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:48,080
It's a poem by a great man,

217
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,649
which suggested to his friend that the way to longevity should be stopping complaining.

218
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,810
Eat right now.

219
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,309
With my son here, I'll toast you as an exception.

220
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:01,760
- Cheers.
- I'll drive, so I'll toast you with tea.

221
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,950
Okay.

222
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,960
How is it going with your side?

223
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,760
I have my plan.

224
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,570
Your plan?

225
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,330
It's quite obscure.

226
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,690
The ideas that aren't put in place

227
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,620
make no difference.

228
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,099
Now that I've made an exception today,

229
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:43,620
you have to follow my rhythm

230
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,150
as for how to drink in the future.

231
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,330
I'll toast you.

232
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,460
- Okay.
- Cheers.

233
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,890
[F's client file]

234
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,690
[F's client file]

235
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,280
Such a big fish.

236
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,139
Mrs. He has told it to me. You have to apologize to her sincerely.

237
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:29,560
I know.

238
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,949
It's rare for you to come back. I can't just let you eat buns.

239
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:34,620
I cooked the steamed fish that is your favorite dish.

240
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,970
- Then I'll have some more.
- Eat the fish. Okay. Have more.

241
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,710
- You… Don't you know you have high blood sugar?
- I know.

242
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,159
I've hidden the alcohol. You found it again.

243
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,880
- I didn't drink.
- Give it to me.

244
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,890
- Kaiyi wants it.
- Give it to me.

245
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,799
Forget it. Look at him.

246
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,970
Eat swan.

247
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,109
What are you talking about? He's hopeless.

248
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,620
Kai Kai.

249
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,829
Be good. Don't drink.

250
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,860
Isn't it good to give it up?

251
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,690
Kai Kai, today, I'm going to teach you

252
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:26,020
how to win the heart of the girl you like.

253
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,190
With your poor skills?

254
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,520
Don't give Kai Kai any lousy idea.

255
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,819
Do you have any problem with that?

256
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:34,520
Thanks to my poor skills, I married you.

257
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,830
Yeah.

258
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,780
It's because I don't bother to choose anymore.

259
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,070
- Just one sip.
- No.

260
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:51,649
Well, why do you think the peacock in the zoo shows its tail?

261
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,710
To attract the peacock of the opposite sex.

262
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:01,680
So you have to show your ability.

263
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,430
If you fail, try again.

264
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:09,310
Repeat it until you succeed.

265
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,350
But the girl I like is different from others.

266
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,439
- Is she still single?
- Yes.

267
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:19,510
- Are you single?
- Of course.

268
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,629
Then why do you hesitate? You're a heaven-made match.

269
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:25,430
So make a move in a hurry.

270
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:30,299
If you were in the past, you would be married soon.

271
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,230
So soon?

272
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,450
- Someone's going to get married.
- Don't mess around.

273
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,660
Who's going to get married?

274
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,099
Kai Kai, be confident. You can do it!

275
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,319
Hello.

276
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,950
You even brought some dishes.

277
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,230
You finally came back.

278
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,460
- We miss you so much.
- Thanks.

279
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,560
- Kai Kai.
- Kai Kai.

280
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,859
Men should show women their strength at the right time.

281
00:20:54,859 --> 00:21:05,830
We can do it!

282
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,720
Wealth.

283
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,920
Sister Qun, you've chowed three tiles of mine.

284
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,410
You really show us no mercy.

285
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,830
Sorry.

286
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,040
I'm blessed by God.

287
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,550
I can't help it.

288
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,350
Hello, Lili.

289
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,930
Hello, Aunties.

290
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,049
Lili, are you here to give your mom living expenses?

291
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:35,400
I don't need to borrow such a small amount of money from others.

292
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,090
Let's continue.

293
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,510
Nine of Characters.

294
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,400
What's this?

295
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,860
Have a look.

296
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,700
What do you mean?

297
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,279
I've bought a shop for you so that you have things to do

298
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:58,840
and earn yourself some pocket money.

299
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,070
The Contract for the Sale of the Shop.

300
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,450
It's signed in your name.

301
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,919
Why did you do this?

302
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,680
Don't you want to break off your relationship with me?

303
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,400
Mom, there is no hatred in the argument between mom and daughter.

304
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,719
I think the money I gave you before isn't enough for you,

305
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,539
so I bought you a shop so that you can earn some money.

306
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:28,230
It's at the south gate of the neighborhood.

307
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,000
A good location.

308
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,160
Every day many people pass the south gate on their way to work.

309
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,180
52.5 square meters! It's large.

310
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,939
You can open a snack bar.

311
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:43,930
Young people nowadays like fried chicken and milk tea.

312
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,539
Lili, you must have spent a lot.

313
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,860
You're so kind to your mom.

314
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,350
Did you find a new job?

315
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,020
Well, I have a new plan.

316
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,110
Did you…

317
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,160
Fine, I'm not asking you.

318
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,410
It's your business, you take care of it.

319
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:07,320
But remember, you can't suffer grievances outside. Got it?

320
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,560
In this world, only my mom can let me suffer grievances.

321
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,430
I'm so jealous, positively.

322
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,920
Well, there isn't such a filial daughter like her in this world.

323
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,150
- Yeah.
- It's better to have a girl.

324
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,209
It's no use being blessed by the God of wealth.

325
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:27,829
It's more important to have a competent girl.

326
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:31,110
- You're smug now.
- Come on. Let's play mahjong.

327
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,590
In the future, I can play mahjong

328
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,800
while collecting rent.

329
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,760
What are you doing?

330
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,190
I haven't told my condition yet.

331
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,350
You have to promise me that you'll play less mahjong and run this shop.

332
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,380
I know.

333
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,190
You're the boss.

334
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,280
Let's continue.

335
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,310
I know you're avoiding making a decision.

336
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,640
If you don't run this shop well, I won't give you living expenses.

337
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,160
What? You ungrateful!

338
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,970
You give me a carrot first and then a stick.

339
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,640
Where did you learn this trick from?

340
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,150
I'll tear it if you don't agree.

341
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,010
No. I agree.

342
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,190
Whatever you say, I always agree.

343
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,160
Let's continue.

344
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,819
You'll have business to do.

345
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,040
Will you have time to play mahjong with us?

346
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,450
I'll make time then.

347
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,090
This is the Haifeng Radio International, FM 99.7.

348
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:07,250
We'll listen to the Night Talk to Your Heart held by Qian Kaiyi.

349
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,369
Dear listeners, good evening.

350
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:13,540
This is FM 99.7, the Night Talk to Your Heart of the Haifeng Radio International.

351
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,129
I'm your host, Qian Kaiyi.

352
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:18,000
Hello, I'm He Dun.

353
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,900
In the last episode, we launched an activity called Saying No.

354
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,300
It mainly encourages you to refuse the proposal that makes you uncomfortable in your life.

355
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,959
If any one of you has a story to share with us,

356
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:36,090
please go to the main page of our program on Weibo and comment.

357
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,579
Well, Miss He, let's share the first message.

358
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,200
It was left by the account called "Dream Has Its Sky".

359
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,560
She said, "I'm preparing for the post-graduate entrance examination, but my friend often asks me to join parties.

360
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,540
I don't dare to refuse her, because I'm afraid our friendship will be harmed.

361
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,419
So after each party, I'll study all night.

362
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,490
But recently, I've figured it out. I refused my friend.

363
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,250
I believe true friends will understand me and respect my decision.

364
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,939
Okay, we have another listener called "Big Tiger".

365
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:09,460
He said, "I finally refused my parents' proposal that they want me to attend a blind date."

366
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,900
I'm divorced. And I'm in charge of bringing up the child.

367
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,520
My parents have been anxious, and want to find a mom for the child.

368
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,210
But I believe I can give my child a good life even on my own.

369
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,809
And I can give him enough love."

370
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:23,130
I agree with you, Big Tiger.

371
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:27,210
I think if you just want to find a shelter for your child,

372
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,450
and ignore your family,

373
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,610
it'll perhaps deliver a bad result, even if it's for the sake of love.

374
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,819
You have to believe a loving child doesn't

375
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:39,599
only exist in the family with both parents.

376
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,090
As long as you give your child enough love, caring and companionship,

377
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,310
he will still grow up healthily and happily.

378
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,660
Hello.

379
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,630
Dong, help me pick up the phone.

380
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:56,320
After reading so many messages, I'm really happy for you.

381
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,130
Just as Miss He said, if you can really feel your thoughts at the bottom of your heart

382
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:04,570
and try to speak them out through communication,

383
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,409
maybe the result will be better than you think.

384
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:12,620
Well, listeners, thanks for sharing your experience of saying no.

385
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:18,170
I also hope all the listeners are able to benefit from these examples.

386
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:22,789
Yeah, we can tell from their experiences that refusal won't necessarily

387
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:27,269
deliver a terrible result or embarrass others.

388
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:31,099
In interpersonal relationships, I think each of us should pay more attention

389
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:35,490
to our own feelings, which really represents self-love.

390
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,420
Broadcast the advertisement.

391
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,270
Lili.

392
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,599
Jiahui.

393
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:02,110
Are you going out so late?

394
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,520
Yes.

395
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,819
Isn't He Dun at home?

396
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:09,170
She's doing a program.

397
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,599
Fine, it's just casually asking.

398
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,749
Take care.

399
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:14,360
Jiahui,

400
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,500
can you not tell He Dun about what happened today?

401
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,170
What's it?

402
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,260
I know you saw it.

403
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,509
Are you so afraid of letting her know it?

404
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:34,320
I'm not. I just don't want to make it a big deal.

405
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,046
Rest assured.

406
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:38,562
Thanks.

407
00:28:38,562 --> 00:28:39,548
Take care.

408
00:28:39,548 --> 00:28:41,069
I know.

409
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,419
Well, at the end of this episode,

410
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,909
we have a listener called, "Sound of the Wind".

411
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:01,330
He said, "Because of my family, I've developed a personality of not saying no since my childhood.

412
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:05,610
But I don't want my ten-year childhood to influence the rest of my life.

413
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,320
I want to learn how to refuse."

414
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,999
Miss He, I have a question.

415
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:13,130
What can those people influenced by their family of origin do to make

416
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,229
any change and breakthrough?

417
00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:20,800
In psychology, family of origin is a very important concept.

418
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,720
In recent years, it has received a lot of attention.

419
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,060
Family of origin indeed has a profound impact on each individual.

420
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,089
But it isn't decisive.

421
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:32,799
Do you mean even a joke among children

422
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,899
will perhaps greatly affect others?

423
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,729
Is that right, Miss He?

424
00:29:37,729 --> 00:29:40,700
Because among us…

425
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,570
[Just for You]

426
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,410
Yes, you're right.

427
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,870
Because in the cognitive behavioral school

428
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:15,920
it is generally accepted that children's cognitive interpretations of the external world

429
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,050
may influence their core beliefs about self-worth.

430
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,560
That's right.

431
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,080
Let me see what sh*t there is inside.

432
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,860
No one's life has no regrets.

433
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,899
But it can also be considered brave and strong

434
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:44,170
to make it perfect.

435
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,900
This is a precious character of this listener.

436
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,160
Then, everyone, that's all for today's program.

437
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,140
See you in the next episode.

438
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,580
Bye.

439
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,389

457
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:29,700
My Lili has changed into a housewife?

458
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,470
Can't I do this for you?

459
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,579
You've been so busy recently.

460
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:55,310
Not really.

461
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,900
I find you always go out.

462
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,920
I'm indeed a little busy at the beginning of my new job.

463
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,960
I went to visit my mom.

464
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,740
How is it going with your new job?

465
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,510
When I was in the Yunjin Group, I was very busy every day.

466
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,189
I've experienced a lot.

467
00:34:14,189 --> 00:34:16,050
This new job is child's play for me.

468
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,530
I know what you want to ask.

469
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,430
What do I want to ask?

470
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,870
Whether I'm in a relationship, right?

471
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Lili, if you're in a relationship, I'll be very happy for you.

472
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,150
I'm just worried…

473
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,129
My dearest, I'm an adult.

474
00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:57,000
I have my own judgment.

475
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,360
I've just found a new job.

476
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,120
Aren't you used to the life without me?

477
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,530
I'm going to work now.

478
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,430
Smile.

479
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,120
Bye.

480
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:01,180
Kaiyi, will Miss He arrive on time?

481
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,119
Yes.

482
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,389
Okay, I'm going to eat now.

483
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,220
Continue gazing.

484
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,080
He Dun, I like you.

485
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,370
He Dun,

486
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,020
hello.

487
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,180
He Dun, I like you.

488
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,040
Who were you talking to?

489
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,940
No one. I was preparing my script.

490
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,260
You're so diligent. Don't you want to eat?

491
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:11,610
How do you think I should confess my love, Sister?

492
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,600
To whom?

493
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,500
A girl.

494
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,000
She helped me a lot with work.

495
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,190
She's beautiful and kind.

496
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:29,620
What's most important, she always cares about and helps me.

497
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,500
Secretly and silently.

498
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,250
I think you can directly tell her.

499
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,140
Maybe she has the same thought as you do.

500
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,219
I knew it.

501
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:46,840
Thanks.

502
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,610
Who the h*ll are you going to confess to?

503
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,420
I thought you knew.

504
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,190
I can't tell you now.

505
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:02,600
Qian Kaiyi, finish your script immediately.

506
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,680
- Hello.
- Let's check the script.

507
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,019
No hurry.

508
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:26,769
Are you thirsty? I'll get you some water.

509
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:28,360
Thanks.

510
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,710
Kai Kai, men should show women their strength at the right time.

511
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,630
Where is my water?

512
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,130
Thanks. Let's begin then.

513
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,940
I wrote a poem recently.

514
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,760
How about I read it to you?

515
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,989
Okay.

516
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:31,250
When appropriate, you also need to show your talents.

517
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,630
"On a day when the whole family is happy, I suddenly feel carefree.

518
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,499
I stand at the top of a high building alone.

519
00:39:40,499 --> 00:39:42,899
The sunset sheds light on my face.

520
00:39:42,899 --> 00:39:46,190
My illusion will pass one day."

521
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,530
You…

522
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,420
You…

523
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,230
Have you prepared your script?

524
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,610
Do you understand the poem?

525
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,150
Yes.

526
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:16,710
It's a good original poem, which creates an enchanting image.

527
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,570
You didn't understand my poem.

528
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:22,870
I got it. Let's start.

529
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,000
You need to show your weakness sometimes

530
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,100
to let her know you need her.

531
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,939
I have a stomachache.

532
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:37,180
Stomachache? Then drink some water.

533
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,970
It's really hurting.

534
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:46,190
Qian Kaiyi, you're so strong.

535
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,710
Hold on.

536
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,730
Let's check the script.

537
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,520
Did you see the script I sent to you?

538
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,710
Shortly after you sent it, I rectified it.

539
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,390
I've collected the comments.

540
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:01,050
You can't imagine the warm-up of our program of yesterday has become a hit.

541
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,259
There are thousands of comments on Weibo.

542
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:06,419
I've sifted out over 30 good examples.

543
00:41:06,419 --> 00:41:08,280
I'm diligent, right?

544
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,530
By the way, that night, you told me you received a horrible call.

545
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:12,809
Do you now know who the caller was?

546
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:14,280
Of course not.

547
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,180
If I had known it, I wouldn't have been scared.

548
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,369
You're tall and strong, yet so timid.

549
00:41:18,369 --> 00:41:22,040
It's because you weren't here then. I was alone in the pitch dark.

550
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,920
The light was sparkling. And on the phone…

551
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,910
A child's laugh and a woman's wailing.

552
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,850
There was also the terrifying chirping of cuckoos.

553
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,040
He, why are you looking at me like this?

554
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,330
Don't you believe me? Do you dare to make a bet?

555
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,600
- What's it?
- I'll call back.

556
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,529
If it's not true, I'll eat the poem.

557
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:44,910
But if is, you'll collect the poem.

558
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,599
I prefer to see you eat the paper.

559
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,820
I can't wait to see it. Do it.

560
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,970
It's connected. Come here.

561
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,740
Come closer to me.

562
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,150
Use the speakerphone.

563
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,810
- Hello.
- Hello.

564
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:23,730
This is the hotline of the Night Talk to Your Heart of the Haifeng Radio International.

565
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,600
You called us one night.

566
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,000
Did you have anything to tell us?

567
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,580
A radio station? Did you call the wrong person?

568
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,000
I haven't called you.

569
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,219
It's impossible.

570
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:35,610
- I have a record here.
- I'm sorry.

571
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,600
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm sorry, Madam.

572
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,360
My colleague might be fatheaded, so he made a mistake.

573
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,410
- Sorry to have disturbed you. Bye.
- No way.

574
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,080
She really called.

575
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,390
Eat the paper.

576
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,569
She really called.

577
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,270
Please.

578
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,190
I'm eating it.

579
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,330
Xiao Mo, do you want to attend the party? We're waiting for you.

580
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,460
I'll be there soon.

581
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:25,460
Have another drink and be satisfied.

582
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,360
He's out of his mind.

583
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,020
Surprise!

584
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,940
- Jiahui.
- Are you going to throw out the rubbish? I'll help you.

585
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,360
There is no need. I can do it.

586
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,950
- What's wrong?
- Where's Lili?

587
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,910
I haven't seen her for a few days.

588
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,710
She found a job in a new company.

589
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:02,230
So she is busy recently. She hasn't been back for a few days.

590
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,150
Do you have anything to tell her?

591
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:08,060
She should be with her new boyfriend.

592
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,840
Didn't she tell you?

593
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,419
When I went out the other day,

594
00:44:13,419 --> 00:44:16,760
I saw her coming from the studio and getting into a black car.

595
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,800
My guess is wrong since she didn't tell you.

596
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,320
I just found they were intimate.

597
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,360
I thought it was her boyfriend.

598
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,050
I forgot it. She told it to me before.

599
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,560
I'm going to throw out the rubbish.

600
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,020
Okay.

601
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,480
