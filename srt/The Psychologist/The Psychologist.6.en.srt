18
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,270
Mom, I am back.

19
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,050
Dun Dun,

20
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,549
you are back.

21
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,360
Don't try to hide the wine. I've seen it.

22
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
I will dump the whole bottle in a while.

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,480
Why do you want to dump it? You can't do that.

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,760
Look at you, you spent money buying so many things again.
What are you doing?

25
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,349
You can't eat the overnight food, It's bad for your body.

26
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:16,799
Dun Dun, it's wasting your money. Do you know?

27
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:18,439
There are still a lot in the freezer.

28
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,699
You must stop spending unnecessary money, got it?

29
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:24,159
Mom, as for the wine, we have agreed that

30
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,599
you can only drink a limited amount at the specified time. Don't you remember?

31
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:29,959
Yes, I do. However,

32
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,290
I am an old woman not having much to do.

33
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,659
I stay at home every day with a lot of worries on my mind.

34
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:40,059
If I don't drink some wine, how can I cope?

35
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,079
What's there for you to worry about?

36
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,769
I, your daughter is in good health, fair-faced and well-fed.

37
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:46,369
You only need to live in ease and comfort.

38
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:48,059
How come you have so many worries every day?

39
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:50,560
Look into my eyes.

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,470
What?

41
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,470
You resigned?

42
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,719
Nonsense! Who told you that?

43
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,999
Last month, my workplace even distributed bonuses to me.

44
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,319
It is hidden here. I'll pour all the wine out.

45
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,980
You mustn't drink it. Put the bottle down. Put it down.

46
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,260
- You mustn't drink the wine.
- I won't drink it. I'll put it away for you.

47
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,390
Put it down. Put it down.

48
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,570
Stay out of my business.

49
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,830
Just mind your own affairs.

50
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,420
Your professor has told me all.

51
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,139
Mom, it has been many years since I graduated from university.

52
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,520
Why are you still bothering my professor with my affairs?

53
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,960
Give me one to eat.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,459
Dun Dun, you have been thoughtful since you were young.

55
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:45,080
Whenever there was something delicious, you let me have a bite first.

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,230
I was so happy in those days.

57
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,739
Dun Dun, you really did make a mistake this time.

58
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:53,840
You want to run a psychological counseling office alone.

59
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,550
but, how could it be so easy?

60
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,329
You didn't give it much thought before you resigned.

61
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:02,629
Your present job is like an iron rice bowl that can feed you all the time.

62
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:05,809
If you live like this all your life, that will be great.

63
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:09,930
Mom, nowadays there is not the iron-rice-bowl thing,

64
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,600
In your time, there was, but now there is not.

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,830
I have met a friend recently, he worked at the radio station.

66
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,579
In your time, the radio station was such a trendy thing, but do you know how it is now?

67
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,259
The radio station, TV station and newspaper as well as shopping malls and brick and mortar stores

68
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:27,229
have been affected and impacted by the Internet economy.

69
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:31,130
Therefore, if we still hold onto the try-your-luck mentality, we will be eliminated.

70
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,239
Why did you say "be eliminated" looking at me? It made me feel I would be eliminated.

71
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:36,370
Don't say that looking at me.

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,660
I just don't understand, Dun Dun.

73
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,959
When I was your age, I was not as bold as you.

74
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,480
It is an important matter.

75
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,350
But, you just left your job without any hesitation.

76
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,970
- Who do you take after?
- Of course, it is you.

77
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,209
I am your biological daughter, if it's not you, who else could it be?

78
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:59,049
This is so unlike actions. You are unlike me.

79
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,100
But, you are also like me, I also did things...

80
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,480
Oh my.

81
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,320
without thinking over carefully.

82
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,489
You have so much strength of the hand, of course, I am like you.

83
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:12,839
- Your...
- You think it's too big? Well, I will give you another pat.

84
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,060
Enough. Enough. Enough.

85
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,940
Dun Dun, remember this.

86
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,250
Since you have resigned, no matter what difficulty you get into,

87
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,150
you can come back home and let me know when you need me.

88
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,250
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes, I did.

89
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,100
- You really heard it?
- Yes, I really did.

90
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,759
Then check your cellphone to see whether you got any new messages.

91
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,570
My cellphone?

92
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,220
You sent me the red envelope?

93
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,820
- Isn't it awesome?
- Give me a like.

94
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,079
Well, I can't give this a like, I can only give likes on WeChat Moments.

95
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,950
I can't give the red envelope a thumbs-up.

96
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,850
Then you collect it. Last night, you know, I worked on this till midnight, without consulting anyone.

97
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,689
I finally sent the red envelope successfully, Accept the money.

98
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,070
I won't, I am no longer a child.

99
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,720
I am a grown-up, I can make money by myself.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,479
What is it?

101
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,670
I feel I am very pathetic.

102
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,350
You visualize it.

103
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,880
Late at night,

104
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,340
I sent a bunch of red envelopes,

105
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,790
but my daughter refused to accept them.

106
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,420
- Mom.
- I really feel like crying, give me the tissue.

107
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,739
- I will cry.
- Stop playacting, all right?

108
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:22,269
You keep the money and take care of yourself.

109
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:24,499
This will be the greatest support for me, got it?

110
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:26,269
All right!

111
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:28,520
Let me tell you,

112
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,899
I will drink up the wine in this bottle today.

113
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,729
I am so pathetic. You refused to accept my money.

114
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:35,679
I am so pitiful. If you still don't accept my money,

115
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:38,329
tell you what, Dun Dun, I will drink the last drop of the wine in this bottle.

116
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:39,950
I will accept the money, all right?

117
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,430
I will accept it, all right? Look!

118
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,100
[You've received a red envelope for ¥8,000: Accept. ]

119
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,850
- Money has been accepted.
- It is so simple.

120
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,070
Great! Great!

121
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,749
- I will still take a drink.
- Why will you still drink the wine?

122
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:55,120
This is an important matter, we must celebrate.

123
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,449
Because I sent the red envelopes successfully and you accepted them successfully.

124
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:01,070
Just one sip, you can only drink a sip.

125
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,510
Enough. That's enough.

126
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,629
On any account, thank you, Mom.

127
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,980
Auntie.

128
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,539
He Dun.

129
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,550
Why are you here? Lili is out, she won't be back for a while.

130
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,620
- How about you wait for her inside?
- It's all right.

131
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,160
I will wait for her sitting here.

132
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,170
You just go do your things. Don't mind me.

133
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,280
- Shall I get you a cup of water
- No, you don't have to.

134
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,139
He Dun, I must admit that your studio looks decent and professional.

135
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:57,320
Thank you, it's all due to Lili's help.

136
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,380
You are really capable.

137
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,270
Unlike you, my daughter Lili just messed up all her previous jobs.

138
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,670
This time, she did a worse thing.

139
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,250
Can you see what a disgrace it is to me?

140
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,880
Don't think like that, Auntie. She has fallen into the trap set by others.

141
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,550
Now everything about that matter has been explained, right?

142
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,950
I know.

143
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,360
But, you see, she has such an unrestrained personality.

144
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,059
In the coming days, will there be any company that dares to hire her?

145
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:27,540
Auntie, in fact, Lili... she is going through the most difficult time now.

146
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,139
As her friend, I will surely keep her company.

147
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:36,460
However, I think what she needs more might be your company and support.

148
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,740
Lili.

149
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,740
Mom. Why didn't you inform me before you came?

150
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,200
What's wrong with this?

151
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,129
Why do I need to notify my daughter in advance before I pay her a visit?

152
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:55,659
It is not like that. Then tell me, what did you come for?

153
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,600
Well...

154
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,809
Well, i-it is that matter.

155
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,220
- It's...
- All right. I got it.

156
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,350

Come on, Bro.

- Thank you for your hard work today.
- Don't mention it.

169

- Tomorrow we can wrap it up after finishing the remaining work.
- Thank you!

170

- Thank you, guys!
- Take care.

174

- Quick, have some rest. Take a rest.
- You must be tired, Brother Qian?

175

- Rest your body.
- You must all be tired, right?

176

I have prepared water for you.

- No problem.

181

It is unexpected that the greenhouse could be turned into

182
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:27,400
such a nice place.

183
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,729
This time, we will move the livestream room to the greenhouse.

184
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,340
Many eyes are on us.

185
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,900
People are waiting to see the outcome.

186
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,259
We are under pressure, but the pressure motivates us. Got it?

187
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:40,180
Well, what's wrong with the greenhouse?

188
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,949
All programs of our station are done in the livestream rooms.

189
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:45,200
We will make full use of the greenhouse.

190
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,249
Let me tell you, "Night Talk to Your Heart" is unique.

191
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:49,890
- Yes.
- Exactly.

192
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,870
Brother Qian, I think the proposal you put forward last time is especially good.

193
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,050
I think by then, we can listen to the radio program as we drink coffee.

194
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,600
We can even integrate the greenhouse with coffee for marketing.

195
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,050
We can also make some derivative products.

196
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,149
Maybe we can create a complete brand chain.

197
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,889
Good idea, Han Qing! You have a great talent for business.

198
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:09,149
Besides, we haven't given play to our biggest advantage.

199
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:12,169
We have been doing two programs together while adapting ourselves to one another.

200
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:15,739
We can cooperate far better than the other teams.

201
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:17,100
- Yes. We are better.
- We are much better.

202
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,030
Xiao Li is so right.

203
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,400
We should take this chance to show others

204
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,530
that we are not doormats that people can treat badly.

205
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,150
That's not all.

206
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,420
Under my leadership, "Night Talk to Your Heart"

207
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,780
will surely surpass the "Time Interview".

208
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,900
Thank you.

209
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,139
He Dun, do you think a person can really shake off

210
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:54,440
the harness of his or her family of origin?

211
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,950
Have you heard the saying?

212
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,319
A lucky person will spend their life healing from childhood

213
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,529
while an unlucky person spends a whole life healing their childhood.

214
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,939
Could you stop giving me the clichés?

215
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:10,150
You think they are clichés?

216
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,659
All right. Though I don't want to admit it,

217
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:20,080
I must say I didn't have a happy childhood.

218
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,110
In fact, your mother cares about you a lot. It is true.

219
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,350
Really?

220
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,280
She cares more about whether I can give her money.

221
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,069
- Take the tile.
- Come on.

222
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:35,679
It is such a good job. How could you ruin it?

223
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,590
You really did the wrong thing.

224
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,130
Do you know, He Dun?

225
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,830
Sometimes I think my whole life will be like this.

226
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,149
As a child, I never asked my mom for anything,

227
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:56,529
because I knew whatever difficulties and needs I had,

228
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:58,980
she would always say the same thing,

229
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,269
"Our family is poor and we don't have the money."

230
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,029
After I grew up, I could finally depend on myself

231
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:11,500
and make money for myself.

232
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,989
Nevertheless, every night, as long as I lie down,

233
00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:17,109
I would think if I lose my job tomorrow,

234
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:19,620
what should I do?

235
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,100
If I don't have a job, I won't be able to pay the house rent. What should I do then?

236
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,589
This sense of insecurity is engraved on my bones.

237
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,420
I can't get rid of it.

238
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,259
A person like me who grew up in the slums

239
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,449
are used to climbing up the social ladder continuously,

240
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,080
B*tch!

241
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,070
Mr. Zhou, Mr. Yu, I haven't seen you for a long time.

242
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,570
because if I don't make efforts, there will be no way out for me.

243
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:59,780
Only in this way, can I know that I am still breathing and I can still live on.

244
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,540
Do you know that in our psychological counseling work,

245
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,379
if there are clients who are very self-deprecating,

246
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:08,020
we have a way to cure them?

247
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,249
The way is to enable each client to have a person who loves them a lot

248
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:17,400
and helps them build up self-confidence gradually.

249
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,119
Then they will gradually form their stable perceptions of self-worth.

250
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:26,069
When the time comes. the client won't be hurt by anybody.

251
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:30,299
Of course, besides being the client's psychological counselor,

252
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,980
I can also be their friend.

253
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,379
No matter what, you can cure me.

317
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:14,530
Yes. Is it beautiful?

318
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,899
Yes. It's beautiful.

319
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,790
You are so capable.

320
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,350
I am happy for you.

321
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,490
I am happy.

322
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,910
What are you doing early in the morning?

323
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,849
Can you finish all these fruits you bought?

324
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:41,929
Well, these are for Jiahui.

325
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:45,269
We ate his food yesterday. Therefore, we should pay him back today.

326
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:48,200
Now I know why I am your only friend.

327
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,590
Why?

328
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,110
Because you are rigidly polite.

329
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,929
As long as others show you some kindness, you will want to repay the favor immediately.

330
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:55,310
It is good to be polite.

331
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,580
At least, I won't owe others a favor.

332
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,669
Enough. Stop eating. Bring these to him for me.

333
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:03,879
Me? I'm not going.

334
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,310
We both ate his food.

335
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,490
I washed them, so you will deliver them. Isn't this fair?

336
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,160
No, it is not.

337
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,560
I ate, but I don't think I owe him a favor.

338
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,430
You should deliver them since you want to pay him back.

339
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,379
Grandma. I especially chose this place for you.

340
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:25,040
Look! The environment is so good.

341
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,110
You can enjoy the sunlight and breeze here.

342
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,880
It is also quiet here.

343
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,450
It is the most suitable place for you. However, you...

344
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,439
I know that you are a filial grandson.

345
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:41,390
But, I am used to living in the nursing home.

346
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,059
You see, every day, I sing songs, play cards

347
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:49,169
eat sunflower seeds and chat with a group of elderly men and women.

348
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:51,730
It is so enjoyable.

349
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,430
All right. As you wish.

350
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,629
Anyway, I work in the nursing home as a medical counselor now.

351
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,580
I can keep you company there.

352
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,130
Jiahui.

353
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,700
- Grandma, I will go downstairs to open the door.
- Okay.

354
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,839
I bought some fruits. I brought them to you.

355
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:25,349
So much? Thank you!

356
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:27,430
Well, let me cook supper for you.

357
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,769
You need not. I will work till it is very late.

358
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:36,139
Is that used in the Department of Psychiatry?

359
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:39,559
It is used at home. I bought it to give my grandma physiotherapy.

360
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,110
Your grandma is the person upstairs?

361
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,070
Yes.

362
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,679
Jiahui, your friend is here?

363
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:46,250
Grandma.

364
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,530
How do you do, Grandma?

365
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,710
She is my neighbor, He Dun.

366
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,160
She is such a beautiful girl.

367
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,070
Where are your manners?

368
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,140
How could you let the girl stand outside?

369
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,710
Come in. Come in.

370
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,940
No need, Grandma.

371
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,860
- Come in to take a seat.
- Come in. Come in.

372
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,679
Jiahui. Jiahui!

373
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,110
You are neighbors.

374
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,091
- In the days to come, you should care for Xiao He more.
- Okay.

375
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:30,819
You should do the hard and strenuous work for her initiatively. Did you hear me?

376
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:32,979
All right. I got it.

377
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,860
Xiao He,

378
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,749
though Jiahui studied abroad,

379
00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:44,090
he was brought up by me.

380
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,380
Therefore, he doesn't have the bad habits of foreigners.

381
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,949
Well, you are both young.

382
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:54,340
You should spend more time together in the days to come.

383
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,230
Thank you.

384
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,720
Grandma, I have a roommate.

385
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,330
The three of us will help one another.

386
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,549
Grandma, if you say more, she will be scared.

387
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,520
Jiahui, I saw things about acupuncture over there. Do you know acupuncture?

388
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,170
You have learned acupuncture abroad?

389
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,370
I learned it when I attended school in the north in the past.

390
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,020
It is popular abroad now.

391
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,290
I learned it to treat my grandma.

392
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,029
- To treat me?
- Yes.

393
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,350
Grandma, look at this.

394
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,020
You may think it looks strange.

395
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,190
It is called a transcranial magnetic stimulation device.

396
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,469
If you wear this helmet once every week to get physiotherapy,

397
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:45,530
your hand will surely get better.

398
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:49,010
Well...

399
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,479
- I-it needs to be plugged in?
- Yes.

400
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:55,289
Will I get an electric shock? I am afraid of pain.

401
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:58,109
Don't worry. If there is any chance that it might hurt you,

402
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:00,060
I won't let you use it.

403
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,899
Jiahui, so, the boxes I saw in your house on that day

404
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:06,770
were all used to hold these medical treatment instruments.

405
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,310
I can see grandma likes you a lot.

406
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,520
Whenever you are free, pay a visit to my house, please.

407
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,960
All right.

408
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,550
Were you a doctor?

409
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,540
Hasn't Lili told you?

410
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,089
I studied clinical medicine as an undergraduate and a graduate.

411
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:27,159
Later, I went abroad to study psychiatry.

412
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:30,329
Then you used to be a psychiatrist?

413
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,860
But, I am no longer a psychiatrist now.

414
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,619
I returned to China this time to take care of my grandma.

415
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:36,940
Her health is not great.

416
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,069
Now I work as a medical counselor in her nursing home so that it'll be easier for me to take care of her.

417
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:42,530
I understand.

418
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:47,200
Actually, psychiatry and psychological counseling have a lot in common and a lot of differences.

419
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,149
The mental problems of most people are caused by the abnormal secretion of antibodies in the brain.

420
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:53,140
They need to be cured with medicine.

421
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,269
On the other side, psychology deals with the abnormal mentalities of normal people.

422
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:58,820
Medicine is not necessarily used in treatment.

423
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:09,699
Excuse me. May I ask whether you know any interior decorating team?

424
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:11,560
I just moved into the house next door.

425
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,060
Aren't... on that day, aren't you...

426
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,400
I wasn't wearing my glasses just now.

427
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,540
It is too dark in the evening. I didn't recognize you.

428
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,430
It's all right.

429
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,070
I actually have been taking medicine for a while.

430
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,210
My mental conditions are under good control.

431
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,590
It's nothing.

432
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:31,499
Are you thinking why I took medicine after drinking wine as a medical student?

433
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,910
Just like what you think, I studied psychiatry to heal myself. But...

434
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,690
Sorry.

435
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,540
- Qing Qing, send me a list of today's hotline calls.
- Okay.

436
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,760
- The exclusive publicity article about He Dun is still not ready?
- Brother Qian, I am revising it.

437
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,590
Why are you in such a hurry? You can't only think about your dear expert.

438
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,080
If you are free, go take hotline calls.

439
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,070
Hurry up!

440
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,870
- What?
- I'd better do it. When you take calls, the complaint rate...

441
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,450
We got 100 reposts and comments within five minutes!

442
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,340
Let me have a look.

443
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,250
Scroll down.

444
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,830
Good job, man!

445
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,130
Be gentle. If my shoulder is injured, it will be a work-related injury.

446
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,330
You are so cocky.

447
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,050
How is the affair of Tang Lili?

448
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,920
It is a small matter.

449
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,460
You can trust me.

450
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,260
- Thank you.
- Take it.

451
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,420
Besides, let me tell you something else.

452
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,499
The affair of Cao Wanli taken a sudden and shocking twist,

453
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,930
I just knew it. Tang Lili has been wronged from the start.

454
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:38,709
Kaiyi, is your doing "Love me, love my dog"?

455
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,159
Well... Hit your worker's shoulder.

456
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,420
- It hurts a lot.
- What nonsense you said!

457
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,480
I was just joking.

458
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,280
The meeting room, the planning meeting.

459
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,749
- Let's go!
- Come on, let's go.

460
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,399
The "Night Talk to Your Heart" will be aired this weekend.

461
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,050
It has a big secret.

462
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,189
The person sitting beside me is our trump card and biggest treasure.

463
00:29:03,189 --> 00:29:06,219
It is the famous counselor Miss He Dun.

464
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:08,400
Miss He, greet the audience, please.

465
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,000
Hello, everybody! I am He Dun.

466
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,850
For the next, we have received a letter from an old listener.

467
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,499
who gave us best wishes when our program is about to restart.

468
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:17,960
Now let's open the letter to see what is in it.

469
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,739
Yunjin Group incident took a great twist.

470
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,770
In the name of spilling the tea, cyber violence has been performed.

471
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,040
A number of media have made public apologies.

472
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,789
For women, the workplace is not friendly.

473
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:43,400
It is filled with sexism,

474
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,959
the prejudice against married women and the misunderstanding of their occupations.

475
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:50,349
As for my reputation, I have gathered relevant evidence and hired a lawyer

476
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:53,049
to file suits against the rumor fabricators and mongers.

477
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:55,780
The network and public opinion are also governed by laws.

478
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,459
Without verifying the facts, whoever causes serious damage to

479
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:01,230
the individual's reputation and huge loses to a company going public

480
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:05,209
by spreading rumors shall be held accountable by laws.

481
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:08,789
You resigned in such an unyielding manner. Now you can only binge-watch TV series.

482
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:10,630
How about my making you my general manager?

483
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,350
What do you think of it?

484
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,410
I will just be a receptionist, right?

485
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,450
You need not pay me. You only need to pay the house rent next month.

486
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,299
No, that is not good. I will take advantage of you again.

487
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:23,259
Well, how many clients do you have?

488
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:24,560
How about this?

489
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,700
After I became the brand ambassador of your office,

490
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,559
you should not only raise my pay but also give me shares.

491
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,229
Hello! Are you Miss Tang Lili?

492
00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:39,660
I am with the headhunting firm.

493
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,700
Who is the guy?

494
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,230
It's none of your business.

495
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,210
Hello!

496
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,439
Miss Tang Lili, you refused our offer.

497
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:51,000
Is it because you are not satisfied with our offer?

498
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,959
Actually, your offer was very generous.

499
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:57,739
However, I contemplated on it.

500
00:30:57,739 --> 00:31:00,300
I want to have a 15-day vacation.

501
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,099
After things calm down, I will look for a job by virtue of my abilities.

502
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:05,900
I hope you can understand.

503
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,850
Oh, all right.

504
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,390
Thank you.

505
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,490
Colleagues, these books are for you.

506
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,480
What is this?

507
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,950
Oh, my god!

508
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,940
To improve the scientific literacy of our crew and to do the program better,

509
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,960
you must finish reading all these books within a week.

510
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,010
Can you do that?

511
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,180
Hell, no, Brother Qian.

512
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,060
You want us to finish reading so many books within a week.

513
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,840
Have a heart, Brother Qian!

514
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,520
I have only read so many books when preparing for the college entrance exam.

515
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,280
No. I will play games for a while to get relaxed.

516
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,159
Put your cellphone down. Don't play games. Can't you play games later?

517
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,500
These books give me a headache.

518
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,320
I will play the game "The Strongest Snail" to relax.

519
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,540
You look like a snail.

520
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,580
Colleagues, listen to me.

521
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,959
Though we do this show in cooperation with the psychological counselor.

522
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:49,970
But as for the core contents,

523
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,149
we have to communicate with one another to do a good job. Right?

524
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:57,939
This is knowing each other and the cooperation between giants.

525
00:31:57,939 --> 00:32:00,239
Moreover, to make our show attractive,

526
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:05,039
we have to be able to rival the psychological counselor.

527
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,800
[Basic Broadcasting Guide]

528
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,010
- He Dun. 
- Qian Kaiyi. What is the matter? Say it.

529
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,610
I just held a planning meeting at our station.

530
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,799
The theme of our first edition has been decided on.

531
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,520
I just wanted to let you know.

532
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,870
Then tell me.

533
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:30,909
Our station wants us to brief the audience on what is psychological counseling,

534
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:33,859
and what people need psychological counseling.

535
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:36,639
Revolving around this topic, we should have a round of talks first.

536
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:39,679
We will spend three hours on science popularization?

537
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,799
Don't belittle my capability of a host, all right?

538
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,889
Let's state our purpose from the start to let the audience know

539
00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:48,209
what we are going to do and what is the nature of the thing.

540
00:32:48,209 --> 00:32:50,210
This is very important.

541
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,820
What you said seems to make sense.

542
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,800
The station wants us to think of an opening remark related to psychological counseling.

543
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:00,289
It should be powerful and sensational.

544
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:02,709
You want me... want me to fabricate it.

545
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:04,110
I am not good at doing this,

546
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,100
I know. I can help you think about it.

547
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,760
But, you are a professional, right?

548
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,460
Give it a shot.

549
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,250
"Night Talk to Your Heart" is

550
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,210
the medicine that heals your heart.

551
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:24,449
N-night Talk to Your Heart brings you close to psychological counseling

552
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:28,060
and helps you open the door of the heart.

553
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,409
- Did you hear?
- Sorry. Sorry.

554
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:31,540
I didn't mean it.

555
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,490
But, your ideas are really cliché.

556
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,800
Then why did you ask me to think of them?

557
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,049
I told you I am not good at this. How could you laugh at me?

558
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:42,250
All right. I will think of it for you.

559
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,699
We will start the live stream on time tonight. You'd better prepare yourself for the topic.

560
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:46,230
I got it.

561
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,260
A mental illness needs a mental cure.

562
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,469
- You are back.
- They are back. They are back.

563
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:12,220
Xiao Ye and Sister Yun are back.

564
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,940
Sister Yun is back.

565
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,470
I am happy.

566
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,460
You are happy.

567
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,629
Grandmas, come over. I brought you something to eat.

568
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:23,560
All right. What is it?

569
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,809
Grandma Dong, I bought you your favorite sweetheart cakes.

570
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:29,530
Grandma Dong, look!

571
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,810
If you are thirsty, drink this.

572
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,470
It is the "Yakult" yogurt. It is tasty and healthy.

573
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,930
It is good. It is good. Taste it, all of you.

574
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,560
Grandma. Xu, what is wrong with you?

575
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,180
I don't know what has been wrong with me lately.

576
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:42,269
The back of my neck has been aching.

577
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:44,190
All right. I will examine you.

578
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,980
Me too, Xiao Ye.

579
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,419
My temples have been swelling recently.

580
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,280
Have I had a relapse of hypertension?

581
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,150
I also feel unwell. I can't lift my shoulder.

582
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,560
Me too. Me too.

583
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,919
All right, okay. I will examine you one by one.

584
00:34:57,919 --> 00:34:59,520
Grandma Xu, I will examine you first.

585
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,870
All right.

586
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,260
- Here. Be seated.
- Come. Take a seat.

587
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,310
Come on. Grandma Xu, lower your head. Is there any pain?

588
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,710
No.

589
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,940
Okay. Raise your head.

590
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,430
It hurts. It hurts here.

591
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,150
- The pain is here, right?
- It hurts here.

592
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,749
You must have spent a lot of time playing on your cell phone for many days

593
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:19,300
and watching videos on it every day, right?

594
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,840
Yes.

595
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,570
That is right.

596
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,909
You must stop doing that from now on. I will give you a massage,

597
00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:27,819
Xiao Ye, which university did you graduate from?

598
00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:29,760
How come you know everything?

599
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,649
I graduated from Jingbei University. I majored in clinical medicine.

600
00:35:32,649 --> 00:35:34,760
I also studied pediatrics, internal medicine and surgery.

601
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,700
Therefore, I am proficient in all of them.

602
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,230
You graduated from Jingbei University?

603
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,040
It is a university for geniuses.

604
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,900
Exactly.

605
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,619
My grandson Jiahui was a good doctor in the foreign country.

606
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:48,139
To take care of me, he returned to our country.

607
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:50,660
Right.

608
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,809
Xiao Ye, you are not getting any younger.

609
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:58,099
Do you have someone keeping you company and taking care of you?

610
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,820
The psychological counselor He Dun is a home wrecker and misleads the public.

611
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,850
Somebody should do something. Nobody cares.

612
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:22,040
What is going on?

613
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,110
- He Dun is here.
- He Dun is here! He Dun is here!

614
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,159
Stop recording! What are you doing?

615
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,500
Get in first.

616
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,180
Get out of the way! Stop filming!

617
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,050
Stop filming!

618
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:38,910
She is a home wrecker.

619
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,070
You are so wicked!

620
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,860
What is going on?

621
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,400
What is going on? Our show is about to start airing right now.

622
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,400
- Who is causing trouble here?
- I don't know.

623
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,180
Virtuous and filial.

624
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,029
Grandma Dong, you are not really having a headache.

625
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:19,940
You want to arrange a blind date for me, right?

626
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,439
Yes. Yes. Yes. Xiao Ye, I have a granddaughter.

627
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:26,070
She graduated from a prestigious university.

628
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,189
- She is also filial—
- How could you do this?

629
00:37:28,189 --> 00:37:29,610
We agreed that I would do it.

630
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,759
Xiao Ye, have a look.

631
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:33,730
All of them are not good. Look at the girl I recommend.

632
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,520
She is filial and pretty.

633
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,610
Listen to me, all of you.

634
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:43,229
My grandson Jiahui has made a friend recently.

635
00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:45,460
She is a girl and a psychologist.

636
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,189
