You're up, Lili is still asleep.

20
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,570
What about the two young men?

21
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,370
They left a long time ago.

22
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,740
Mom, why did you drink so much alcohol yesterday?

23
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,580
I couldn't even stop you.

24
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,670
I also wanted to stop myself, but I failed.

25
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,730
I mean it, I think your friends are all good people.

26
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,830
- Especially... What's his name again?
- Qian Kaiyi.

27
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,520
He's a nice lad.

28
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,900
A very outgoing boy but always knows what he should say.

29
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,650
I think you and he complement each other.

30
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,850
You are very introverted and quiet.

How nice if you can...

- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

33
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,450
How old are you? You'd think you're still a teenager who would get shy talking about boys?

- Let me see.

00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,253
Wei,

41
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,880
about what happened last night, thank you.

42
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,280
And sorry, for what I said and did earlier.

I have an important announcement to make.

46
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,800
I called the police about Qi Ming.

47
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,740
Of course it'll be a good thing if he gets his punishment.

48
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,700
But I hardly need to say that this also means we will lose

49
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,120
an important client who we can cooperate with in the long term.

50
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,990
If we can't fulfill this quarter's KPI

51
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,790
and cause losses to the company,

52
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,420
the company might face bankruptcy.

if someone must take the responsibility,

56
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,830
it'll be me.

57
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:30,420
Wei, I didn't handle what happened before properly.

58
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,370
I won't accept your resignation now.

59
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,120
This problem can't be solved by anyone resigning anyway.

60
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,100
I should bear much of the responsibility on this matter.

61
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,240
Let me think about how I should explain to the chairman.

62
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,920
Ling,

63
00:05:46,673 --> 00:05:51,240
if we can get investment to make up for the 15 million, will the chairman agree to let it go?

64
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,590
That's right.

65
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,420
Since we could get this project of 15 million with Qi Ming,

66
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,390
we can get the same amount of money with other investors, too.

67
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,740
Here goes nothing. I claim two million.

68
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,240
Now that the company and my colleague are in trouble, I want to do my bit.

69
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,030
Three million.

70
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,940
- Two million.
- I claim one million.

71
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,440
- I claim three million.
- I claim one million.

72
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,700
I claim half a million.

73
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,920
I claim 800 thousand.

74
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,770
I claim 300 thousand.

75
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,600
Nobody can deny the pain you experienced before.

76
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,383
Also,

77
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,960
no one can deny you for it.

78
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,940
I will support you.

79
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,020
You didn't make any mistakes.

80
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,570
It wasn't your fault, at all.

81
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,200
Li Wei, what do you want most?

82
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,740
They are willing to support you.

83
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,230
They want to help you.

84
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,240
They can relate to you.

85
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,210
I claim 300,000.

86
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,540
Have you heard?

87
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,950
Qi Ming was arrested!

88
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,000
The police went to his office to take him into custody.

89
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,020
Reported by Li Di Qi Ming: Recently, a video by someone from City Hall went viral on the internet.

90
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,750
It exposes the president of a well-known group as a suspect of multiple sexual assaults.

91
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:23,310
In the video, Qi Ming, President of Tianqi Group, admitted that he had sexually assaulted multiple women.

92
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,870
Tianqi has issued a statement saying that they would not tolerate the so-called unspoken rules in workplace.

93
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,440
They will severely punish other personnel involved, such as a woman surnamed Ling,

94
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,820
and will provide psychological counseling support for the victims.

95
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,700
After this incident many companies have also made statements

96
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,550
to call an end to the unhealthy, "wine table culture",

97
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,840
and support safeguard measures such as an employee rights protection hotline.

98
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,240
With this momentum, many other women posted more evidence on Weibo that would go against Qi Ming.

99
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,270
As reported by Li Di: Qi Ming, the president of a well-known group, is suspected of sexually assaulting multiple women.

100
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,350
Qi Ming has been detained by the police for further investigation.

101
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,500
- Look at the comments on this post.
- Guys.

102
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,740
- Want some?
- Want some?

103
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,480
Want some?

104
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,210
I bought some snacks for you guys as a thank-you gift for the cleanup.

105
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,520
But next time when you have a group activity, please tell me so that I can get involved, too.

106
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,130
Brother Qian, what's with the bruises on your face?

107
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,210
Did you have a fight with someone and now you are dumb because you have a concussion?

108
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,970
- Bullshit.
- Don't tell me it was Miao.

109
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,330
What are you talking about?

110
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,090
They're medals of honor.

111
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,790
You guys won't understand.

112
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,690
What are you looking at?

113
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:27,700
Just last night another woman screen named "Unknown Fact" left a comment on the post about "imperfect victims".

114
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,210
She said that she believed she was sexually assaulted by the same person mentioned in the post.

115
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,650
And there was someone who helped her call the police last night.

116
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,340
It should be Qi Ming.

117
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,550
News said that he was taken away by the police.

118
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,320
Wait a minute. I'll check it online.

119
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,890
As Reported by Li Di: A famous investor and entrepreneur in our city,

120
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,860
Qi Ming, the President of Tianqi Group, is suspected of sexual assault and

121
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,820
was taken into custody for further investigation by the police this morning.

122
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,960
According to an informed source, the arrest is related to the sexual assault which caused an Internet buzz recently.

123
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,373
Freeze!

124
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:57,250
We didn't catch the woman. The two guys who showed up to stop us also ran away.

125
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,573
How should we explain to Director Qi?

126
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,640
Have you guys come up with the proposal for the next episode?

127
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,280
- Ms. Xiong Qiao asked me to deliver something to her.
- I have to go.

128
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,950
Brother Qian, I'm already halfway through. I'll submit it right away!

129
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,250
These two young men even cleaned and tidied the room before they left.

130
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:03,150
Dun Dun, I had a major discovery recently.

131
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,413
Which is?

132
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:09,190
You've become more talkative, and you smile a lot more,

133
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,840
not to mention these are all big smiles.

134
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,571
Oh, come on. You sound as if I never gave you a big smile before.

135
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:18,320
Maybe other people don't understand you, but I'm your mother.

136
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,220
You're always unhappy.

137
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,010
That's not true.

138
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,350
But I need to tell you something even if you don't want to hear it.

139
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,080
No matter how close you are with your friends, in the end

140
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,470
they can only accompany you in a stage of your life.

141
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,440
In the end, you have to rely on yourself.

142
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,970
So you have to be strong mentally.

143
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,030
In this case, it's easy for you to move on when something happens. You know what I mean?

144
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,350
Mom, don't worry, I will always stay by your side.

145
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,200
That's not what I mean or what I want.

146
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,760
I am worried for you.

147
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,030
You forgot what I do for a living?

148
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,080
I'm a psychological counselor, I am great at adjusting mental states.

149
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,230
A healer can't heal herself.

150
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,630
The Buddha can enlighten others but not himself.

151
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,991
I can't tell you what I've done because of the counsellor-visitor confidentiality.

152
00:11:02,991 --> 00:11:05,871
So you won't even know how good your daughter is.

153
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,180
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

154
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,980
Hello. How are you today?

155
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,280
Feel better?

156
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,840
Do your wounds still hurt?

157
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,573
I'm fine.

158
00:11:24,573 --> 00:11:28,960
Anyway, an influential official account specifically asked to interview you.

159
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,570
Is there an outline?

160
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,030
Sure. I'll send it to you in a while.

161
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,550
I'll take it as a yes.

162
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,180
When will the interview be?

163
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,080
Can I come in?

164
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,530
My last name is Ye.

165
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,760
It's quite late.

166
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,693
Can I help you?

167
00:11:51,693 --> 00:11:54,250
Miss Wen, I heard that you're renowned in psychology circles.

168
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,000
So I'd like to receive your counseling.

169
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,020
I often feel that I lack a sense of boundary so some of my behaviors seem to cross the line.

170
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,640
I can see that.

171
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,960
This is the psychological counselor who I am supposed to supervise.

172
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,420
This is her mother.

173
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,340
Under the premise of me knowing their relationship,

174
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,470
I still accepted her mother's visit.

175
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,920
You didn't cross the line as long as there isn't a dual relationship.

176
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,630
What if I did it on purpose?

177
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,741
I subtly guided her to walk into my counseling room.

178
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:45,980
Maybe the so-called "on purpose" wasn't really your desire before the counseling began.

179
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,540
But just your assumption of your psychological motivation after everything has happened.

180
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,130
Such assumption is often the least objective.

181
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,430
Even if it wasn't intentional,

182
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:00,180
then why didn't I stop her from coming back to my counseling room after I found out about their relationship?

183
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,390
Miss Wen, can you answer this question?

184
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,300
What is your standing to ask me this question?

185
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,870
As a visitor, naturally.

186
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
I can't answer you.

187
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,300
But I know someone who is more suitable for answering your question.

188
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,200
Maybe deep down you also have someone you know who can answer your question better.

189
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,980
I can make this call for you if you can't call this person for some reason.

190
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,790
Are you satisfied with this answer, Mr. Ye Jiahui?

191
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,640
[Ye Niantang]

192
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,450
I thought a good sense of boundary

193
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,610
is a necessary trait for a qualified psychological counselor.

194
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,710
It also depends on who the visitor is.

195
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,703
Since you can't answer my question, I shall leave you alone.

196
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,913
Nice tea.

197
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,790
By the way, Miss Wen,

198
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,470
do you think I will use this psychological counselor's mother to hurt her?

199
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,500
You can taste the essence of tea only when you have inner peace.

200
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,910
Remember to make an appointment next time you come for tea.

201
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,890
I hope this hand won't reach out to where it shouldn't.

202
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,821
What was the relationship between you and Ji Mingcong in the beginning?

203
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,870
It was a normal teacher-student relationship.

204
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,730
I took his class.

205
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:42,320
When I was about to graduate, a teacher informed me that Professor Ji had said

206
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,060
my graduation thesis, which I applied to be published on a core journal, had huge problems.

207
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,550
So you were the one to ask Ji Mingcong for a meeting?

208
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,953
Yes.

209
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,800
Because that thesis would have a lot to do with whether I could get my master's degree.

210
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,030
So I wanted to know why he wouldn't give my thesis a pass.

211
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,100
What did he say to you?

212
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,843
He…

213
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,020
He asked me to go to meet him at his house.

214
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,640
It seems very private to meet someone at his house.

215
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,820
I heard that Professor Ji would give students extra tutoring at home.

216
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,940
I thought he wanted to talk to me about my thesis.

217
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,440
I didn't expect…

218
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,250
He took me to the study.

219
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,680
There he did something to you, right?

220
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,720
I broke free.

221
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,980
You are a woman.

222
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,980
Can you break free from a grown-up man's grip?

223
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,470
What do you mean?

224
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,830
Are you saying that I'm lying?

225
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,140
Please calm down.

226
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,740
I understand that maybe the high adrenaline can cause a sudden burst of strength.

227
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,920
I just want to ask questions we all want to know.

228
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,120
What happened later?

229
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,670
What did he do to you afterwards?

230
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:17,281
He threatened me. He said I couldn't tell a soul or I wouldn't be able to graduate with my degree.

231
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:20,210
He would also ruin me.

232
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:24,460
Do you remember the specific time when it happened?

233
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,840
Two months ago.

234
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,000
Which day exactly?

235
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,740
I just remember it was happening at night.

236
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,160
You just remember it was night. But you don't remember which day it was.

237
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,130
Am I supposed to count the days with my fingers for such a thing?

238
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,510
Am I also supposed to celebrate its two-month anniversary?

239
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,760
I don't know!

240
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,590
I don't know why you would keep asking these weird questions, either!

241
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,690
What do you want to know?

242
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,890
What exactly do you want to me to say by your leading questions?

243
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,470
I have an obligation to ask as many details as possible

244
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,140
so as to provide the audience with a point of view.

245
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,961
For example, if you are the victim here,

246
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:14,490
why would you choose to stand out now, two months after the incident?

247
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:27,050
So this is the objective point of view you said you would take?

248
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:31,090
Didn't I tell you that he threatened me with my graduation and degree?

249
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:36,740
Yes, you said it. But you still chose to stand up a long time after the incident.

250
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,533
Okay.

251
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,310
I will tell you what the objective is.

252
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:49,230
The objective is when I finally took up the courage to go back to school,

253
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:55,480
all I could hear from my classmates was Professor Ji was a good teacher.

254
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,230
He was upright and funny in class.

255
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,500
How could he?

256
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:08,260
How could he be showered with honor in the public when I had to face all the pain alone?

257
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,300
So you are getting back at him, aren't you?

258
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,340
I remember it happened at night

259
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,710
because I remember how sick it made me feel at that moment.

260
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,510
I remember how long the way back to school seemed coming out of his house.

261
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,540
I know that someone will question me

262
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,400
and doubt my integrity

263
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,770
after I stand up to speak out today.

264
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,500
But I think this is meaningful.

265
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,680
The meaning of my choice

266
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,101
is to encourage people who have the same experience as me.

267
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,260
Maybe someone will judge us.

268
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,000
They would think we did it on purpose

269
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,160
or that we were stupid to fall victim.

270
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,960
There are countless female victims who are threatened by the perpetrators.

271
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,880
They silence us while they are invisible,

272
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,990
continuing to do shady things behind their honors.

273
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,190
And yes, this is an act of revenge.

274
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,430
I won't remain silent!

275
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,310
I won't let them get what they want!

276
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,790
I will definitely win this battle!

277
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,920
If I meet him again now, I will definitely say to his face,

278
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,153
"Ji Mingcong, I am waiting for you.

279
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:36,720
Karma will come back to you one day!"

280
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,240
[Li Wei He Dun, that bastard was arrested.]

281
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,950
- Fourteen o'clock sharp. Miss He, let's begin our interview.
- Sure.

282
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,461
Miss He, were you studying psychological counseling or a related major in university?

283
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:04,780
Yes. I studied clinical and counseling psychology back in university.

284
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,710
I had been doing work about psychological crisis intervention after I graduated.

285
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,950
I am a psychological counselor now.

286
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,711
So Miss He, why would you want to study psychology?

287
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,970
Did you get into it since you were a kid?

288
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,800
Or was there something that triggered your interest?

289
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,160
Because of a class.

290
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,950
This painting was painted in May 2008.

291
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,660
Can you use a word to describe this painting?

292
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,030
- Confusion.
[City H Experimental Middle School's 2010 Graduate Presentation]

293
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,363
Depression.

294
00:20:28,363 --> 00:20:29,470
Pain.

295
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,103
Loneliness.

296
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,370
It was painted by an eight-year-old child.

297
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:38,040
Children find it hard to use complicated words to express themselves.

298
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,170
But paintings can reflect their emotions directly.

299
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,470
Let's take a look at the next few paintings.

300
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,320
Mom!

301
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,850
Mom.

302
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,070
Mom, where are you?

303
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,160
Mom, help me!

304
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,460
Painting therapy is Also a way of expressing the patient's emotions

305
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,800
in psychological crisis intervention after an accident.

306
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,670
In a way, we all have our own traumas.

307
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,330
To prevent this trauma from becoming stress

308
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,030
is also one of the important goals

309
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,950
in psychological crisis intervention.

310
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,010
Miss He, there's a saying that many people study psychology

311
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,110
trying to solve their own psychological problems.

312
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:30,131
In other words, most people in the field of psychology have various psychological problems.

313
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:31,833
Is that true?

314
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,403
I think it's true for some people in this group.

315
00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:38,210
How about you?

316
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,980
For example, do you have a trauma?

317
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,100
I think everyone has a certain trauma.

318
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,540
It depends on how you look at it.

319
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,330
It is a trauma if you think it is.

320
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,630
And actually, psychological problems are very common.

321
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,980
There is no need to discriminate people on grounds of their psychological problems.

322
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,190
This is not the right thing to do.

323
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,510
What about sexual harassment?

324
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,400
What do you think about sexual harassment?

325
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,161
Especially can you talk about it from your personal experience?

326
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,530
You see, you are a beautiful, talented and successful woman.

327
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,471
- Will women like you also encounter a lot of these troubles in their careers?
- No.

328
00:22:13,471 --> 00:22:16,510
Men around me are all gentlemen and have great respect for my profession.

329
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,190
Miss He, the Professor Ji you just mentioned is Professor Ji Mingcong who was your teacher, right?

330
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,070
Excuse me. Lady, please don't ask any question that's not in the interview outline.

331
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,240
That's it for the interview today.

332
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,811
- Miss He, you haven't answered my question yet!
- I'd like to ask all of you to leave.

333
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:28,920
You can't do this. This is not how we agreed!

334
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,310
Miss He, you haven't answered my question yet!

335
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,860
What are you doing?

336
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,343
And yes, this is an act of revenge.

337
00:22:47,343 --> 00:22:51,660
Isn't this in line with the topic of sexual harassment of our show?

338
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,250
This girl is so brave!

339
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,770
She has the guts to stand up and speak out under the general context nowadays.

340
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,270
But I have a feeling that something doesn't seem right with the attitude of this self-media blogger.

341
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,540
But it only makes the audience feel sorry for this girl more!

342
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,580
Let's continue.

343
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,240
This is trending.

344
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,230
Let's add this case into our show proposal to submit to the management.

345
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,930
If the topic keeps trending, this news will definitely flood the hot search topics.

346
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,050
You need to tell Qian in advance if you want to ride the wave of this topic.

347
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,630
But I saw that Miao also reposted this Weibo post in the morning.

348
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,170
If we are late in applying to do a show about it, Time Interview will beat us to it.

349
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:31,010
- Okay. I'll sort it out A.S.A.P.
- Come on, guys.

350
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,861
Let's work hard on it and try to get this girl on the phone with us during the show.

351
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:37,020
Then we'll be as good as getting No. 1 in ratings again!

352
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,750
- Yes!
- The honor will be the greatest encouragement for Qian!

353
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,210
- Exactly!
- Can we do it?

354
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,240
- Yes! Yes!
- Let's do it!

355
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,763
Yes!

357
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,260
- Hello, Director Fei.
- What are you up to?

358
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,200
You haven't answered your phone the whole day.

359
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,660
I was on air just now.

360
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,240
Of course, I needed to mute my phone.

361
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,620
What's up?

362
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,310
I am on duty today and I listened to your show.

363
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,420
Your show is keeping up with the most-talked-about topic and yet there is also depth. So good for you.

364
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,150
I can't take all the credit.

365
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,170
This is the joint effort of the team.

366
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,810
Since you've done a great show this time.

367
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,480
You need to follow up a victory with more momentum. Finish strong!

368
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,000
I read the show proposal submitted by Dong.

369
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,260
There is this case where a professor of psychology sexually harassed a female student named Yao Kexin.

370
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,060
Let me take a look.

371
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:27,510
Kaiyi, about Yao Kexin's case, you need to do fact checking and it has to be supported with evidence.

372
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,820
Don't try to piggyback on the hot topic online with groundless assumptions.

373
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,901
The management of the station said that if your show makes unfair and

374
00:24:33,901 --> 00:24:37,920
unobjective comments, you'll hurt both parties in this case.

375
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,730
But we can still make a special show on the topic of campus sexual assault.

376
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,180
- I can't do it.
- Why not?

377
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,130
Director Fei, the reason for me to do the previous episodes on this topic is that I want to explore

378
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,570
the confusion and plight on this matter.

379
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,631
I don't want to get a hot topic into the show because I'll be fettered by it.

380
00:24:51,631 --> 00:24:56,060
Silly boy, you will only be striking home in your exploration of this social problem.

381
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,470
All right, Director Fei, thank you for your advice.

382
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,610
But her video of accusation has gone viral on the Internet at the moment.

383
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:04,760
The more we want to ride the wave, the more likely we will make a mistake.

384
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,160
Anyway, I won't consider it for now.

385
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,760
I have to go. Bye.

386
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,060
The topic of sexual harassment has always received much attention.

387
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,890
Recently, a sexual harassment scandal in the academic circle has been made known to the general public.

388
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,930
A female graduate student surnamed Yao at the Department of Psychology at a certain University

389
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,960
posted a video on her personal social platform in which she accused Professor Ji of sexually harassing her.

390
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,720
In the video, crying, she accused Ji emotionally of causing her great emotional injury.

391
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,070
Her accusation has not been confirmed yet.

392
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,370
Okay, moving on to our next news…

[Yao Kexin]

395
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,103
Not bad.

396
00:26:30,103 --> 00:26:31,960
Although

397
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,730
you came to the conclusion a bit hastily,

398
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,400
the overall argument seems to be much clearer than last time.

399
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,720
Ye Jiahui helped you a lot on the paper, right?

400
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,190
I'm just glad that it can be of help to you.

401
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:48,090
You said last time that if one uses clued recall as a breakthrough

402
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,160
to treat the patient, there will be a certain risk.

403
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,020
I thought you would change the treatment plans.

404
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,900
Professor, if we can minimize the risk of clued recall,

405
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,290
can we still try this treatment?

406
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,790
Is there even a low-risk therapy?

407
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:07,260
I think the first thing we need to do is to tailor-make a set of

408
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,320
psychological intervention methods based on this particular patient's personal characteristic.

409
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,690
As for how to use the clued recall, I think

410
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,780
we can practice and innovate based on CEI.

411
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,390
That's just a guess of mine though.

412
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,650
I see. Thank you for what you've done.

413
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,760
Actually, you could have brought the paper to me tomorrow morning.

414
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,210
You don't need to come here at night.

415
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:42,490
Professor, actually today I came because I wanted to talk to you about...

416
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,020
I am almost done.

417
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,710
I'm going to make some pickle garlic.

418
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,280
I will sprinkle salt in a while and leave them for the night.

419
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,640
I will put other spices tomorrow and pickle them for about five days.

420

How can you still look so calm at such a critical moment?

Seeing you like this, I really don't know whether I should feel rest assured or not!

424

You just used to discussing your paper as a cover.

I asked a friend to check her school report. Wasn't really a straight-A student.

472
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,690
But she always stayed in an upper-middle position among her classmates.

473
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,293
What does it have to do with Professor Ji?

474
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,660
Okay, don't try to persuade me.

475
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,000
It's not like I don't have my own agenda at all.

476
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,620
It's just not the time yet.

477
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,670
When is the time then?

478
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,290
It's urgent!

479
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,010
Have you contacted that student?

480
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,790
I don't believe she would do such a thing just because you denied her thesis.

481
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,020
Come and look at this.

482
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,040
The girl's academic performance was not so good.

483
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,530
But she worked very hard.

484
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,550
She worked all day for her research topics every day.

485
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,050
And she has been very interested in books on psychology.

486
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:43,280
Every day her life is all about the school, cafeteria, and her dorm.

487
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:49,651
I could tell from a glance at this thesis that she couldn't have written it by herself.

488
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:52,010
She got someone to write it for her?

489
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,640
Isn't this the daily life of any ordinary college student nowadays?

490
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,920
What's so special about her life?

491
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,040
This is the point!

492
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,290
The most special part about her is that she is so ordinary.

493
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:07,990
You mean her ordinariness makes the public more likely to believe everything she said?

494
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,700
In this era everyone craves for some scandals.

495
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,750
As long as you somehow are on the trending searches, you'll watch your life become ruined.

496
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,520
I'm just a scholar.

497
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,740
I am not a super star.

498
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,550
Why would people care?

499
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,760
Don't say that so soon.

500
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,760
The school asked you to take a leave and told you that you don't need to teach for now, right?

501
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,470
This has stated their attitude.

502
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,560
There are also movements under the water at the Society.

503
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,950
We don't know what their attitude might be.

504
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,850
You can't just sit and wait for your doom.

505
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,970
It's not that simple as it might look.

506
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,800
So her fight against Professor Ji comes with a tragic hint like David in the face of the giant Goliath

507
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,140
because of the disparity in position and status of the two people.

508
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,710
Yes, that's what I mean.

509
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,453
But we can't be so arbitrary.

510
00:32:51,453 --> 00:32:54,881
Qian Kaiyi, let me ask you, if you put aside the relationship between the two of us,

511
00:32:54,881 --> 00:32:58,411
and just see this matter as it stands, will you believe what Yao Kexin said?

512
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:00,360
What's the relationship between you two then?

513
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,533
Go away!

514
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,370
Me believing her or not aside, I was surprised that

515
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:14,420
only a few hours have passed since her interview was posted online, but the reposts have exceeded 100 thousand.

516
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:19,350
As someone who's also working in the field of mass media, I think this scandal went viral too fast.

517
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,190
You mean someone is behind contributing to this trend.

518
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,460
I am not sure yet. But I think it's very possible.

519
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,450
The situation is complicated.

520
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,830
I haven't figured out what or who is behind this.

521
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,563
Why would Ye…

522
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,180
I mean Ye Niantang. So many things happened after he came back, why?

523
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,450
Another thing is the timing.

524
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,361
Night Talk to Your Heart just finished two episodes to discuss about related topics.

525
00:33:43,361 --> 00:33:47,090
With our previous episodes' discussion and publicity, the public begins to have

526
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,290
a psychological repellence towards this kind of matter.

527
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,460
I'm afraid this mental state was taken advantage of by someone to get what they want.

528
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,570
So you mean the scandal is exposed now because they figured out now is the perfect timing?

529
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,470
That sounds like a well-organized planning.

530
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,480
There must be a lot of hatred and resentment for someone to set up such a trap for Professor Ji.

531
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,420
So it's impossible that she did it alone.

532
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,010
But right now we have no evidence and it's just a wild guess.

533
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,420
Then keep digging.

534
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,220
I'm telling you guys, I might be blind when it comes to men, but not to women.

535
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,770
If she's really up to no good, her tricks won't escape my keen eye.

536
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,980
I understand.

537
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,100
You mean someone is trying to blacken your name.

538
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,890
He hasn't changed a bit after all these years.

539
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:39,420
I found that Yao Kexin loved reading this psychology journal.

540
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,470
I remember she would buy every issue of it?

541
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,720
Psychology journal?

542
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,710
Professor Ji is one of the reviewers of this journal.

543
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,530
It's one of the best psychology journals.

544
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:53,050
If she can publish a thesis on it as the first author

545
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:58,850
during graduate studies, it'll mean she is as good as earning her PhD by any university she wants.

546
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,120
Look.

547
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,160
Do you still remember what Yao Kexin said in her interview?

548
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,270
My graduation thesis which I applied to be published on a core journal had huge problems.

549
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,290
So you were the one to ask Ji Mingcong for a meeting?

550
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,300
Because that thesis would have a lot to do with whether I could get my master's degree.

551
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,830
So I wanted to know why he wouldn't give my thesis a pass.

552
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:26,960
If what Yao Kexin said was true, the point of dispute between her and Professor Ji is that thesis of hers.

553
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,810
Then we can try to figure out what happened from the thesis.

554
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,040
It might be a better way.

555
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,080
It's a breakthrough.

556
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:39,163
- He Dun, can I venture to ask you a question?
- Go ahead.

557
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:43,030
What will you do if, I mean if,

558
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,000
Professor Ji's really the one to be blamed?

559
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,030
If Professor Ji really did something wrong,

560
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,020
I will take the side of the victim.

561
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,643
But...

562
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,263
there is no if!

563
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,783
Come in.

564
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,630
Director Ye, Miss Wen is here.

565
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,200
You've been busy.

566
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,350
I haven't seen you for ages.

567
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,010
Please take a seat. I was occupied by some trifles earlier.

568
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,830
I've neglected what you asked me to do.

569
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,900
Don't say that.

570
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,390
I'm the one who are asking you a favor.

571
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,400
- Tea.
- Yes, Sir.

572
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,730
I don't know that you are a fan of Chinese traditional opera.

573
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,793
Oh, no.

574
00:36:47,793 --> 00:36:49,220
I am not really a fan.

575
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,970
I just listen to it to kill time.

576
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,401
We were in a cooperative relationship.

577
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,280
But I failed to do what I promised you.

578
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,630
I couldn't ask for too much of you.

579
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,720
I was worried too much.

580
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,460
Professor Ji has lost his power and influence now.

581
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,600
Leave us alone. Yes.

582
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,150
You really did what you said.

583
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,000
Xiao Jia

584
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,910
hasn't improved at all in his tea making skills.

585
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,460
How many times have I told him?

586
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,710
But as a driver,

587
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,990
his driving skills are top-notch and he never got into even the slightest accident.

588
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,290
You need to give the right job to the right person.

589
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,380
For example,

590
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:51,920
your specialty is psychological counseling, isn't it?

591
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,430
Director Ye, thank you for flattering me.

592
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,160
He's sleeping soundly.

593
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,290
He is handsome indeed.

594
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,430
Did you want to kiss me?

595
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,470
I... I-I just wanted to see if you were still asleep!

596
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,220
Then take a look again.

597
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,120
I am so sleepy.

598
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,660
Carry on.

599
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,520
Qian Kaiyi!

600
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,970
He Dun.

601
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,430
I made breakfast. Go have some.

602
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,820
I'm not hungry yet, I will pass.

603
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,190
Take a break. I'll study it for you.

604
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,890
Go have some breakfast.

605
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,740
Okay, go ahead.

606
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,180
Tell me what you can see from it.

607
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,930
- I don't understand a word.
- Give it to me.

608
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,040
I'm just afraid you might be sleepy and hungry.

609
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,130
I am hyper now!

610
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,330
I mean it.

611
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:04,630
What's wrong? You found a problem in the thesis?

612
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,570
The opposite. This thesis is so good.

613
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,450
Whether it's the arguments or the data, all impeccable.

614
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,980
And my train of thoughts will always follow the logic of this thesis.

615
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,913
He Dun.

616
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,403
Jiahui?

617
00:40:17,403 --> 00:40:19,910
Qian Kaiyi, why are you here, too?

618
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:22,330
Why are you everywhere?

619
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,330
I heard about Professor Ji's news

620
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,911
so I thought I could come over to see if there is anything I do for you.

621
00:40:27,911 --> 00:40:29,670
We are studying it.

622
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,700
- This is Yao Kexin's thesis?
- Yes.

623
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,330
Your expertise lies in psychologic medicine.

624
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,150
You think you know things about psychology, too?

625
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,180
If you don't know what you're talking about, keep silent.

626
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,940
Otherwise, you would sound very uneducated.

627
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:48,500
Besides, where were you when I stayed up all night with He Dun the day before yesterday?

628
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,510
I also stayed up all night with her yesterday to study this thesis!

629
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,870
- What did you find out?
- What did I find out?

630
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,671
Anyway, we're building our bond!

631
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,860
So is there any progress with your relationship?

632
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,943
Progress?

633
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,530
Isn't it obvious?

634
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,950
Qian Kaiyi, stop it!

635
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,810
Jiahui, I read this thesis.

636
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:23,470
I find it weird that the data collected was from a mocking experiment object.

637
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:28,230
But the visitor mentioned in it seems to be a real existing person.

638
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:32,180
Indeed. It contains a very well-established case of bipolar disorder.

639
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,350
And the experimental data in it has high credibility.

640
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,990
From my perspective,

641
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:41,750
Yao Kexin with was at odds with Professor Ji over this thesis.

642
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,120
Professor Ji believed that there was something wrong with this thesis.

643
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,710
But no matter from us or from the perspective of other experts,

644
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,230
there is not enough evidence to prove that there's something wrong.

645
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:52,380
So one of the two people didn't tell the truth.

646
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,230
I suddenly realize something.

647
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,530
If there was really something wrong with this thesis, Professor Ji

648
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:02,830
would find it from the very beginning.

649
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:07,560
That means it was very likely that Professor Ji knew the real source and the problem with this thesis.

650
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,740
In other words, for some unknown reason he can't make it public.

651
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,920
If this is the case, I won't worry anymore!

652
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,970
Since Professor Ji knew the truth, why didn't he say it?

653
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,220
What stopped him?

654
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,710
It takes time to solve this matter.

655
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,770
Let's have breakfast first. Didn't you cook?

656
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,740
- Yes, in the kitchen.
- Let's go.

657
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,260
Would you like to join us, Jiahui?

658
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,180
Let's go, Qian Kaiyi.

659
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,463
Come on.

660
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:50,000
