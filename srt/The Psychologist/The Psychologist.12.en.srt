My grandma has been in poor health these two years. Take it slowly.

This is the nursing home where she lives, only 700 meters away from here.

I moved to the place closest to her to take care of her.

In fact, I have no kinship with Grandma Yun.

Grandma, why don't you put some food in my bowl?

You're so strong, don't be jealous.

Are your hands better?

33

Yeah, they're better.

Jiahui's therapy seems to have worked.

35
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,260
But I'm infirm at such an old age.

Don't say that, you're still healthy.

37
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,530
Xiao He, do you know how naughty Jiahui was when he was a child?

38
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,699
At that time, I ran a wholesale shop.

39
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:01,979
I was too busy to go out, at mealtimes, I had to call his name loudly.

40
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:06,259
Everyone in the street could hear it, except him.

41
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,549
But being naughty can do something helpful.

42
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:12,509
When new toys were purchased, he was the first one to play with.

43
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:16,859
When new snacks came into my store, he was also the first one to eat.

44
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:19,319
Surprisingly, seeing his response,

45
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,750
I knew whether other children would like them.

46
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,410
Do you mean I'm your trial target?

47
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,570
Nonsense!

48
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,240
I didn't mean that.

49
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,850
Don't be shy, just admit it.

Yeah, we actually did nothing, it was because of your touching words.

Seven? It's been a long time.

She opened a shop downstairs my home.

84
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,700
Every day, when I came back from school, she gave me a handful

of lollipops, cookies and jelly.

My mom for money to buy snacks, I was jittery.

89
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,689
Me too. So I wasn't willing to go back,

90
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:10,750
but to stay in Grandma Yun's house.

91
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,700
How about your parents?

92
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,350
They were busy.

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,560
- Your hair is in a mess.
- I'll fix it myself.

95
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,949
I think the couple who was riding wildly must be in an ambiguous relationship.

96
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:50,419
But they also might be two un-moral daredevils who ignored traffic safety.

97
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:53,449
How do you know they aren't head over heels in love??

98
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:58,169
Have you ever heard of an interesting psychological experiment, Drawbridge Effect?

99
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:00,750
According to it, one's heart will beat faster despite itself

100
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,130
when he crosses a suspension bridge in fear.

101
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,440
If he happens to meet a girl, he will take it

102
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,770
as a symbol of falling in love with her.

103
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,379
So, what does it mean?

104
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:18,269
It shows outer stimuli can quickly send two people into an emotional state.

105
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:21,949
Dopamine will emerge in their bodies, making them in love.

106
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:25,960
So, people in an ambiguous relationship will tend to choose some exciting activities

107
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,889
when dating, such as watching horror movies,

108
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:31,489
bungee jumping, and riding wildly like that.

109
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:35,650
According to what you said, the essence of love is just a chemical reaction?

110
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,479
Dopamine delivers a sense of falling in love;

111
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,299
Phenylethylamine a sense of sweetness; Oxytocin a sense of dependence;

112
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:44,850
noradrenaline a sense of being infatuated.

113
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,790
Don't you think so?

114
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,790
I have no conclusion.

115
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,610
We're just exchanging ideas.

116
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,000
On love?

117
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,910
If so, let's go deeper into this theme.

118
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,190
How about doing an experiment?

119
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,040
- What?
- Drawbridge Effect.

120
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,220
Let's see if we can fall in love with each other in a short time under outer stimuli.

121
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,779
- How about watching a horror movie?
- Now?

122
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:14,969
You major in psychology, and I major in psychiatry.

123
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:18,990
We're perfectly suited to discuss this subject!

124
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,110
- But…
- Let's watch this.

125
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,670
What do you think?

126
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,339
- Brother Dong, shall we order Mandheling in the next season?
- Here for you.

127
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:30,000
I ordered YirgaCheffe yesterday.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,549
I'm a stranger to this business, I just drink instant coffee.

129
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:36,100
So I can't tell which tastes better. Why not call Sister Qiao and ask her?

130
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,350
Is Mandheling made in Sumatra?

131
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,640
Yes.

132
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,980
Then order YirgaCheffe.

133
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,449
But there are always some guests who want Mandheling I think

134
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:47,029
if their prices are almost the same,

135
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,869
we can make Mandheling our recommended product to please them.

136
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:52,840
Mandheling's price will go higher in the next season.

137
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,779
But you can store some to meet the need of guests.

138
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:58,149
If you make it your recommended product, I guess Sister Qiao will

139
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:00,599
tear her hair out when seeing its import price of the next season.

140
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:05,209
All right, we'll import YirgaCheffe, we only buy the right, instead of the expensive.

141
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:06,670
Aren't you afraid it's my nonsense?

142
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,779
I believe you have grounds for that recommendation.

143
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,000
I think so.

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,199
It's rumored that there are some conflicts in the Xianghai Group.

145
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:16,010
Xianghai Group?

146
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,110
A coffee seller?

147
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,200
It's a leading company in transportation, mainly engaged in the maritime transport business

148
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,900
of China and southeast Asian countries.

149
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,320
Early last year, they bought two large freighters.

150
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,689
Later, the capital chain broke, and the group suffered a great loss.

151
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:29,099
The CEO was removed from office.

152
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:32,480
I saw the new CEO, he isn't reliable.

153
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,370
Is the group a coffee importer?

154
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,400
I'm more and more confused.

155
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,389
I found it. The largest domestic Mandheling distributor uses

156
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,450
the Xianghai Group's freighters.

157
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,059
If coffee beans are transported slowly or even can't be imported,

158
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:47,110

Don't say that, Mr. Fang.

You've said you give me a chance.

What are you doing here so late?

340

I'm here to see if you come back safely or get kidnapped by someone with bad intentions.

I think you're the only one with bad intentions now.

Why do you always smile at him, while pulling a fierce face when facing me?

It's my freedom.

- Getting wife back.

00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,760
We're neighbors from now on.

481
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,760
[Ji Mingcong, a well-known professor of psychology]

482
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,249
All the misfortune in the world comes from caring for each other,

483
00:33:57,249 --> 00:33:59,400
be it good or bad.

484
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,630
I read it in a book.

485
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,070
I can feel your conflicts in your heart.

486
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:07,900
I haven't told it to anyone, including my mom.

487
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,020
I know my disease.

488
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,560
I secretly asked a doctor.

489
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,390
Bulimia nervosa, right?

490
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,910
I've been to the hospital a few times.

491
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:32,099
Every time I tried to explain my feelings and changes in my behaviors to doctors,

492
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,600
they were all impatient.

493
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,839
They just wanted to give me a few pills and move on to the next patient.

494
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,250
It makes you very uncomfortable.

495
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,439
Maybe you want to solve something that can't be solved with medicine.

496
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,670
The same pack of cards as before.

497
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,870
But I think

498
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:59,130
you've had your solution, right?

499
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,410
You want to improve your relationship with your mother.

500
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,320
No.

501
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,180
I want to bid farewell to her.

502
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,899
Hugging is a warm touch.

503
00:35:13,899 --> 00:35:17,879
Even if you want to say goodbye to her, you don't want her to be sad, right?

504
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,660
Yes.

505
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,460
But I don't know

506
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,260
how to do it.

507
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,900
Overeating, vomiting, and other situations you can't control

508
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,950
are called high-risk situations.

509
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,279
I'll focus on your feelings and thoughts when you're in high-risk situations

510
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:40,970
and connect your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in a meaningful way.

511
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:41,809
What does it mean?

512
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:46,060
It can tell us why your overeating persists now

513
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,300
and solve some problems that can't be solved with medicine.

514
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,660
When did you overeat last time?

515
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,560
That day, I was at a dinner party with my friends.

516
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,180
We were all having a good time.

517
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:05,920
And then, they seemed to whisper in my ear.

518
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,120
I suddenly felt sick to my stomach.

519
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,870
I couldn't control myself,

520
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,430
so I ran to the road and threw up.

521
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:20,419
Do you think what they said to you is part of the reason why you overeat?

522
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,940
I remember

523
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,800
they said Piano Concerto No. 3.

524
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,110
Let's add Piano Concerto No. 3 to the solo.

525
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,490
- I found the music.
- I've bookmarked it.

526
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,970
Draw one.

527
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,800
Come on.

528
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
Play Piano Concerto No. 3 again before eating.

529
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,330
Start.

530
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,290
Repeat.

531
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,290
Repeat.

532
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,910
Again!

533
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,040
Stop.

534
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,300
Who are you making a face at?

535
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,509
You're braver now. Do you want to fight against me?

536
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,870
Who did you learn it from?

537
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,280
She isn't an eligible mom.

538
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,770
Stop nagging.

539
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,190
It's anger and humiliation.

540
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,630
It's all right.

541
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,950
Let's eat first.

542
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,709
Later on, when we calm down,

543
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:36,040
you replay with concentration Piano Concerto No. 3, all right?

544
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:44,660
Come on, my sweetheart is obedient.

545
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,850
Eat it.

546
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,930
I'm sorry, Mom.

547
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:08,049
Don't say that. Don't say that.

548
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:09,530
Don't say that.

549
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:16,840
I did this for your own good.

550
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:21,379
To make sure you have a bright future when you grow up.

551
00:39:21,379 --> 00:39:24,010
So I'm hard on you.

552
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,490
Remember,

553
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,460
I'm not so ruthless.

554
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,330
I just hope

555
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,900
you have a bright future.

556
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,799
Without the help of others, we can still live a good life.

557
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,600
You're still young.

558
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,210
When you grow up…

559
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:01,669
When you grow up, you will understand my good intentions.

560
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,710
I see.

561
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:21,620
When you feel angry, anxious, and sad, you'll overeat.

562
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:28,560
Your self-monitoring log shows at 10 am, you ate three pizzas

563
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,859
and five pairs of chicken wings on your way to the competition.

564
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:36,829
I remember last time you told me that you overate after the competition.

565
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:38,970
What happened then?

566
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,210
She thought I was a loser.

567
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:08,710
But you just didn't continue.

568
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,600
My mom is a perfectionist.

569
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,300
Then do you think you're a loser?

570
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,180
Maybe.

571
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,990
She's the boss, anyway.

572
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:24,219
It's terrible for you to consider yourself a loser and be totally rejected.

573
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:28,080
In cognitive behavior therapy, it's called a biased way of thinking.

574
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,020
Each of us has our own way of thinking and ideas.

575
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:35,290
It controls how we look at this world and ourselves.

576
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,990
But some ideas and ways of thinking work automatically.

577
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:42,090
We are unaware of them and can't feel them.

578
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,370
But they're indeed affecting us.

579
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,529
So now, what we're trying to do is identify those

580
00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:51,289
automatic thoughts that result in your overeating.

581
00:42:51,289 --> 00:42:54,670
They're called dysfunctional thoughts.

582
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,870
I still can't believe it.

583
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,570
If I'm unaware of it, how can I find it?

584
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:04,299
Are you thirsty? Take a drink of water.

585
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,080
It's ice water?

586
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,819
Yes. This is the effect of your automatic thoughts.

587
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:20,930
You think the water from the teakettle is hot, but in fact, it's cold.

588
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,599
Just like in your inertial thinking,

589
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,940
you feel you're resisting your mom's way of teaching,

590
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,049
but at the same, you want to get her high appraisal and approval,

591
00:43:29,049 --> 00:43:33,729
although her appraisal isn't objective or precise.

592
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,760
