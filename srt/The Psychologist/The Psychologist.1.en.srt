According to data from Suicide Worldwide in 2019

19
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:13,909
published on the official website of the World Health Organization,

20
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:17,649
over 700,000 people worldwide die from suicide every year,

21
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:21,280
and there is one suicidal death every 40 seconds.

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,261
Even to this day, suicide

23
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:27,359
is still one of the primary causes of human death.

24
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,379
Suicide rates in China over the past two decades and more

25
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:35,700
have shown a marked downward trend.

26
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,619
There is an extremely complex web of causes for suicide.

27
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,420
According to Freud's psychodynamic theory,

28
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,550
suicide is a behavior caused by inner conflicts

29
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,989
triggered by strong psychological stimuli an individual has experienced.

30
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,749
On the other hand, research data show that

31
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:03,699
the causes of suicide are mainly family relations,

32
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:07,699
marital disputes, disagreeable interpersonal relations,

33
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:10,910
mental disorder and other problems.

34
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,010
Most suicides show a conflicted state of mind before they take their own lives.

35
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,069
On the one hand, they long to get rid of their pains and sufferings in life.

36
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:30,249
But on the other hand, they retain a desire to survive.

37
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,090
When suicides show such hesitancy, in fact,

38
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:43,039
they are sending a distress signal to people around them.

39
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,040
Such distress signals provide

40
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,130
unlimited possibilities for the prevention of suicide crises.

41
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,959
But once a suicide's signal is overlooked,

42
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,299
it's very likely to lead to irreversible consequences.

Director Ding, this is due to the advantage of our AI analysis technology.

106
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:46,349
We used our algorithms to conduct an analysis of the caller's voice for any sentiment,

it allows us to make a quick judgment on which problem is the most appropriate to start with.

Yes, that's right. It's like this.

It was only normal for her to refuse to answer why the first time,

110
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,920
since the caller might have anticipated we'd ask such a question before she called

111
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,720
and started the psychological defense mechanism.

As to the second question, why she'd choose to do it today.

But the counselor added a layer of inquiry logic.

When the caller was engaged in logical thinking, she became less emotional

117
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:15,319

Shall we do this?

163
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,429
Let's play a game.

164
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,599
Let's give a score to your suicidal impulse.

165
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,869
Zero-point means no impulse at all.

166
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,739
100 points mean completely out of your control.

167
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:38,329
What score would you give to your suicidal impulse on the rooftop just now?

168
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,109
95 points.

169
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,869
That was a very strong impulse.

170

Even so, you still didn't completely give up your desire to survive.

If you pardon me for saying so,

we in the business of project management highly value quantitative strategies.

We are cautious about those things we can't either see or touch.

240

Yes. Our AI project actually quantifies sophisticated,

we'll be able to solve the problem of over-reliance on individual ability.

244
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,719
In this way, we can have all-around marketization of psychological counseling services.

245
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,470
Mr. Wang, so far as I know,

246
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:52,319
the center has quite a high turnover rate nowadays. Is that true?

247
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,140
People is what the consulting industry are short of.

248
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,370
Psychological counselors are the core value.

249
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,090
The high turnover rate is the result of an existence of a funding gap.

250
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:05,180
Miss He, my question is, an intervention center

251
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,429
is staffed with a dozen people and it takes over 40 minutes of waiting time for a call to be picked up.

252
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:11,679
Isn't it serving only a limited number of people?

253
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,399
What's more, computers are based on algorithm science,

254
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:16,330
while human beings tend to have subjective assumptions.

255
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,210
How can you be so confident that human beings are more science-oriented

256
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,410
and more accurate than computers?

257
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,561
Mr. Yang, I can't deny the fact that

258
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:27,139
AI-enabled strategic analysis has the advantage of data support.

259
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:30,409
But what we are facing is a living human being whose life is hanging by a thread.

260
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:36,170
How can you be so confident to pass their last call for help to a lifeless robot for consulting strategies?

261
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,200
- As to this—
- All right.

262
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,230
Don't be so tense.

263
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,509
Miss He, I'm a bit curious.

264
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:48,449
As to the last thing you mentioned, number counting, does it really work that well?

265
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,679
Cognitive neuroscience. The prefrontal cortex in our right brain

266
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,999
is responsible for triggering desires and impulses, while the prefrontal cortex in our left brain

267
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:59,929
acts the opposite way by controlling emotions and desires.

268
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,519
When we use number counting to increase inquiry logic

269
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:09,529
and mathematical methods such as giving a score at a specific time,

270
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:12,359
the activity of our left prefrontal cortex is increased,

271
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:16,179
therefore arousing our own self-control and rational thinking.

272
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,440
What about school?

273
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,540
How did you know the caller was at school?

274
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,750
- I heard it.
- You heard it?

275
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,029
- Play it back for me.
- All right.

276
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,459
Nothing. Where is it?

277
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:40,280
Mr. Yang, not every problem can be solved by algorithms.

278
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,720
Then why did you choose to do it on a special day like today?

279
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,089
Mr. Yang, psychology is a subject that combines the attributes of natural science and social science.

280
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:04,819
I hope your AI can be like us, which is not only a master of theories

Look, the man next to her is her supervisor Professor Ji.

288

Professor Ji Mingcong is the chairman of our Psychological Society,

289
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:30,039
also an authoritative figure in the academics of psychology.

290

The first step, self-awareness.

She says when people are losing control of their emotions,

296
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,589
becoming aware of the mood shift is the first step of self-control.

He asks me to stand in for him because he's busy with his wedding.

How's it going? Did the student's parents give you a hard time?

I was just about to bring this up.

Although You Na has calmed down so far,

317
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,879
the doctor said she's in a very bad condition and needs psychological intervention.

318
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:10,040
And her parents said they'd file a complaint about the school with the education bureau.

319
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,790
File a complaint?

320
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:15,079
But you've only covered me for three days. It has nothing to do with you.

321
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:19,999
The school says you can take two days off. You don't have to go in my place.

322
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:21,190
What are you going to do then?

323
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,879
I need to write a report and brief the leaders about the incident.

No need to tie it up, Auntie. I can just hold it like this.

You are a professional homewrecker instead!

It is she… It is she who asks mom to leave us!

Auntie, don't let my mom leave me.

Auntie, please. Please.

Yes.

It is me who made the suggestion.

Why did you…

486
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,250
Why did you break up our family?

487
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,019
Do you know how much harm you've brought me and my brother?

488
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,949
Move aside, move aside. Stop filming.

He Dun, let's go.

490

He Dun! You'll be punished for what you've done!

Have you really thought it through?

I've thought it through.

493
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,190
I have lung cancer, fourth stage.

Mr. Wang,

503
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:32,699
I went to have private contact with the help seeker while exposing the counseling relationship.

504
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:36,839
I violated the rule of confidentiality, so I shouldn't stay here anymore.

505
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,070
He Dun.

506
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,950
Make sure to guard your boundaries.

507
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,910
Are you all right?

508
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,270
I'm fine.

509
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,340
That girl did such terrible harm to you,

510
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,709
yet you are still here to pray for her mother.

511
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:52,389
If she got to know the truth, would she have a mental breakdown and regret it?

512
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:56,969
She wouldn't have done this if she really knew the truth.

513
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,090
Indeed.

514
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:05,229
But did you really quit your job? It was not your fault anyway.

515
00:40:05,229 --> 00:40:09,099
What's more, Professor Ji has stood up for you. Things will be all right.

516
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,999
I've made up my mind. When I made a mistake, I must stand still to get beaten.

517
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:18,079
But didn't Mr. Wang also say he'd be glad to give you a chance to start over again?

518
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,919
This incident impacts so many people.

519
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,910
I don't want to drag Professor Ji into it.

520
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,240
All right.

You have my support no matter what you do as long as you like it.

At the worst, you can start all over again and make a comeback.

My dear, you are a little dejected now, do you know?

527
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:45,879
Let me give you a tip which I'm sure will change what you are like now.

528
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:47,550
What tip?

529
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,020
Start with a dopamine feast.

530
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,090
It will put a smile on your face when you finish it.

531
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,640
What dopamine feast?

532

Today the Tipsy House sent me a message saying it offers 90% off for ladies.

533

90% off?

534
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,910
- That's like eating and drinking for free.
- We might as well take up the offer.

535

- What are we waiting for? Let's go.
- Let's go!
