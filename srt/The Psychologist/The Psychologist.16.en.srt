[Psychologist]

16
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,740
This TV series is produced with a special fund for guiding and supporting TV series in 2020 from the National Radio and Television Administration and is a key TV series project supported by the Hainan Free Trade Port.

17
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,700
[Episode 16]

18
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,520
According to the backend data from the social networking platforms,

19
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,090
our program is gaining growing popularity.

20
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,190
- Dong.
- Yeah?

21
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,440
I know you're still thinking about case sharing.

22
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,460
I have to admit that those cases from people's real lives

23
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,850
are definitely more interesting than the scripts we invented here in our office.

24
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:09,100
I was thinking it'd be more convenient for us to draw on real-life stories, don't you think?

25
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,539
You're right. But Dong, has it occurred to you

26
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:15,999
that offline channels are not the only approach to these real-life stories?

27
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:20,199
We're here to discuss and figure out a better solution.

28
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:23,470
We did share many of our views with our audience

29
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,849
in the first few episodes so as to work out the tone of our program,

30
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:27,660
but I hope we can have more interaction with our audience

31
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,519
in the subsequent episodes so that they can engage more fully.

32
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,689
Xiao Li, why don't you hand out the material to everyone?

33
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,910
Check out these reviews.

34
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,340
They're the most popular comments

35
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,129
about our program Xiao Li collected from every official account.

36
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,110
So I hope we can canvas opinions about our subsequent episodes regularly,

37
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,800
and then select from these comments

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,530
some topics that could resonate with the public and explore these topics in our program.

39
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,910
What do you guys think?

40
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,910
Good idea.

41
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,740
If people know that their ideas could become the topics of our program,

42
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,340
they'll leave comments with greater enthusiasm.

43
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,700
It'll be a virtuous circle.

44
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,370
I wouldn't have made that silly suggestion if you'd shared this idea with us earlier.

45
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,099
You'd have saved us the trouble of laboring over a good topic.

46
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:08,139
- But you can't loaf on the job anyway.
- Okay.

47
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:10,480
Let's find out if there are any suitable topics.

48
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,349
I was impressed by this one when I was sorting out the comments.

49
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,030
He said he was a freshman who found himself in an unfamiliar environment.

50
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,600
They were all loners at first,

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,809
but soon his classmates all found companions, which made him appear unsocial.

52
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:25,770
He wondered if he should continue to keep to himself

53
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,439
or if he should try harder to fit in so that he'd look less like an oddball.

54
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,870
This one is about the workplace.

55
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,190
His ID is Flower on the Cliff.

56
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,800
He says his superior is irritable and impatient.

57
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,129
Sometimes he makes mistakes after getting scolded by his superior, who then gets even more impatient.

58
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:44,060
This work style has filled him with anxiety.

59
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,110
Why are you guys staring at me? Do I look prettier than usual today?

60
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,610
Don't do me wrong, Sister. We didn't say anything.

61
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,110
What were you guys thinking about?

62
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,400
I wouldn't have let you off the hook if I weren't so lenient.

63
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,899
To get back to the point, I do think the workplace is a topic that resonates with the public.

64
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:03,030
Check if there are any better comments.

65
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,970
All right.

66
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,179
Try to picture me as him in your mind and have a conversation with him, okay?

67
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:09,910
I'll do my best.

68
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,139
Xiao Mo, have you got a minute?

69
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:15,619
Xiao Mo, I may need your help with something now.

70
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:18,020
This document is really important.

71
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,951
Okay, Brother Lin.

72
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:20,970
I know I can count on you, Xiao Mo.

73
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,600
What were you thinking at the moment?

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,200
I've got my own work to do.

75
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,500
I won't be able to finish my work if I help him.

76
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,659
What do you think would happen if you refused his request?

77
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,940
He'd be mad.

78
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,270
What if he got mad?

79
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,039
He'd isolate and exclude me.

80
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:43,680
I'm not sure.

81
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,709
I helped you so many times, but now you won't lift a finger to help me.

82
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:53,980
Do you take me as your colleague or not?

83
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,279
Isolating you and excluding you seems a very serious matter to you.

84
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,110
I mean...

85
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,790
he may consider me a terrible person.

86
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,809
And if he told my other colleagues, they'd find me rather disagreeable,

87
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:17,890
and see me as a selfish man who cares about nobody else's feelings.

88
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,400
They'd think I'm a... terrible person.

89
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,619
Take it easy, Mr. Mo. Have some water.

90
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:28,110
No, thanks. I'm not thirsty. You go ahead.

91
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,610
Mr. Mo, I got this water for you.

92
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,180
About workplace, I have here a comment from an ID called Mo's Words.

93
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,069
According to him, many of his colleagues would turn to him for help, and he thought

94
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:50,670
they regarded him as a friend and thus would oblige them.

95
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,960
But recently he found that his colleagues didn't like him despite what he'd done for them.

96
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,830
To his dismay, they'd even shun him at parties.

97
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,499
They treated him as a pushover, not as a friend.

98
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:05,220
For those who don't know how to say no to others, it's really difficult to survive in the workplace.

99
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,219
Come on. Why couldn't he say no to others?

100
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:09,049
He could have told them that he was busy and otherwise engaged.

101
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:10,000
- But…
- Right?

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,379
Xiao Li, what do you think of this topic?

103
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:14,759
I… I don't know.

104
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,600
- This issue could be really disturbing.
- What's so disturbing about it?

105
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,500
And there couldn't be many people like him

106
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,720
in a company, so how would our program resonate with the public if we feature this issue?

107
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,000
If we approach a topic from the standpoint

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,569
of the minority, the majority would be unimpressed, right?

109
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:30,070
What do you mean by the standpoint of the majority?

110
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,820
You don't understand it or resonate with it, and that's because you're not the party who gets hurt.

111
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,640
But how do you know for sure that you've never hurt anyone?

112
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,039
Xiao Li, I think you have a point. There's no absolute standard for it.

113
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:41,340
People's standpoint changes sometimes.

114
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,720
That's the dialectical significance of this topic.

115
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,360
What we become depends on how we get along with others.

116
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,790
What others become depends on how we treat them.

117
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,110
Every time we make our voice heard,

118
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,629
we'll be able to help different people find an answer to their own question.

119
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,600
I got it.

120
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,929
The topic of the next episode will be, "How to Say No to Others."

121
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:03,919
Say no to others? Yeah.

122
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,050
Whether you're a student or an office worker, you sometimes get caught in a situation

123
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,100
where you can hardly say no to others even if you want to.

124
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,000
And most people find it difficult to say no.

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,480
So our target audience could be very large.

126
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,619
Then I'm going to post

127
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:17,920
a new topic and share some examples about people who find it hard to say no to others.

128
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,470
I think it'll be better if you encourage people to share cases in which they successfully said no to others.

129
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,040
Make this sharing a themed event. It'll give our audience courage.

130
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,420
What do you guys think?

131
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,570
- I think it's brilliant.
- Yes. Yes.

132
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,009
It's a wonderful idea.

133
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:34,210
If you all agree with this idea, then the topic for our next episode is settled.

134
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,779
I've already worked out the title for it:

135
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:38,330
"Say No."

136
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,660
Mr. Mo, during my communication with you just now, I found that

137
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,109
you paid particular attention to my feelings.

138
00:07:45,109 --> 00:07:49,859
I found that you had a way of making everyone in your company very comfortable.

139
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,830
But there was also a problem.

140
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,430
I noticed that you were afraid of upsetting others.

141
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,019
The reason is that you want to avoid any conflicts.

142
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,200
Sorry, I'm late.

143
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,510
What a shame that you were absent yesterday.

144
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,069
Last night I had some urgent business at home, so I couldn't make it.

145
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,699
It's all right. We'll do it next time.

146
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,179
Unfortunately, Mo isn't here. I wonder if he could come and knock back the wine on our behalf.

147
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:17,299
So you tried your best to pander to others to avoid possible conflicts.

148
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:19,920
As time went by, making others like you

149
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,499
instinctively became the principal purpose of your life.

150
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:25,230
Am I right?

151
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,930
Miss He, I think you're right.

152
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,870
It's like I'd habitually agree to do something I'd had no intention of doing.

153
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,220
But I'd regret it soon after.

154
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,250
Okay.

155
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,669
I knew you'd say yes. Thanks, Bro.

156
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:46,680
I'll buy you coffee next time.

157
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,840
I hope I didn't inconvenience you.

158
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,300
Frankly, I didn't want to do it.

159
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,010
Now I'm wondering why on earth I didn't say no.

160
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,350
I think it was because... of fear.

161
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,620
I was afraid of saying no because if I did,

162
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,870
it could lead to... serious conflicts.

163
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,240
I think there's another possibility to everything.

164
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,570
Has it occurred to you that if you did say no,

165
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,710
your colleagues may understand you

166
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,810
even if they might feel sorry about it?

167
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,549
They would? I doubt it.

168
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:28,919
According to a hypothesis in cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a branch of psychology,

169
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:31,149
when we're faced with a stimulus,

170
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:35,449
we'll rapidly form an automatic thought about this scenario.

171
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:39,039
And this thought may influence our emotions as well as our behavior.

172
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,249
So every time you wanted to say no to your colleagues,

173
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,739
this automatic thought would pop up,

174
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:47,969
telling you that conflicts would arise if you should say no.

175
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:53,540
To avoid possible conflicts, you'd pander to them and ignore what your heart told you.

176
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,350
Am I right?

177
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,760
Yes.

178
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,540
Yes.

179
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,320
Excuse me, Mr. Mo.

180
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,350
I'd like to know if you've ever tried to say no to anyone in your life?

181
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,960
I've rarely done that.

182
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,150
This thought of yours has prevented you

183
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,790
from considering other possibilities.

184
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,119
Well, let's do a behavioral experiment to test our theory.

185
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,910
What behavioral experiment?

186
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,999
I've prepared a form for you that you can take home.

187
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,929
Next time you want to turn down a request from your colleague, you can keep a record.

188
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,350
Try to refuse their requests and note down their responses

189
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,150
to test if they're the same as your hypothesis.

190
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,470
Okay.

191
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,509
Mr. Mo, do you find that very inconvenient?

192
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,280
No. No.

193
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,610
Okay.

194
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,749
Mr. Mo, I've been enjoying your company because you're very considerate of my feelings.

195
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:56,620
Meanwhile, I'm worried that you might make yourself unhappy.

196
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,549
As a therapist, I prefer it if my client could express their feelings,

197
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:04,219
be they positive ones or negative ones.

198
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:06,760
This will benefit our therapy.

199
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,960
Okay, Miss He.

200
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,350
I think you're quite right in saying that, but I

201
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,810
do find it impossible to reject others.

202
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,569
I'm very glad that you poured out your feelings.

203
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:26,340
So now let's talk about how to say no to others.

204
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,399
What do you think is the best way to say no to someone?

205
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,710
The best way is to avoid hurting others…

206
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,100
Or making them feel uncomfortable, am I right?

207
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,840
Yes.

208
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,479
We should try a gentle approach, and make them feel comfortable.

209
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,309
Do you think the word "sincerity" could summarize it?

210
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:50,470
Yes. And I hope that people could understand me.

211
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,479
Excellent. Let's take that karaoke incident, for instance.

212
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,129
Brother Mo. Brother Mo. Are you still at the office?

213
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:01,299
Our boss just asked me to send him our proposal.

214
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:04,859
I've got the text on my computer, so could you help me with the PowerPoint?

215
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:08,170
Thank you so much. I'm really busy right now.

216
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:14,809
Make use of the approach we discussed just now to say no to this colleague.

217
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,760
I'm sorry,

218
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,379
but I'm not at the office now. I'm on my way home.

219
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,180
I'll help you with your PowerPoint next time, all right?

220
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,649
Helping her with the PowerPoint next time is indeed a good alternative.

221
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,330
But do you think that's the result you want?

222
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,910
No.

223
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,389
If you really can't comply or if you want to be polite,

224
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:58,089
you could tell her that you can't help her this time, but

225
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:01,040
you can help her with other things.

226
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,489
Don't be afraid.

227
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:06,619
You only need to express yourself clearly and with finesse.

228
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,520
Hi Xiao Lu,

229
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,599
I'm not at the office now. I'm on my way home.

230
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,980
[Send]

231
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,979
Speak out bravely and confidently. Don't panic.

232
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,939
I'll give you a hand if you run into any problem

233
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:39,540
when you're preparing your PowerPoint tonight.

234
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,189
Marvelous. That's a great start.

235
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,130
Sir, I'm going home.

236
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,910
No problem.

237
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,110
That was an interesting game.

238
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,099
This behavioral experiment will be your homework.

239
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:06,600
We're not doing it to prove how wrong your earlier thoughts were.

240
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,840
This experiment might be tough or even impossible for you,

241
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,260
but I hope you can bring all your problems here to this consulting room

242
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,639
so that we can discuss it together.

243
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,979
Just remember that however tough things may be,

244
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:21,060
I'm confident that we're going to ride over them.

245
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,189
Thank you, Miss He. Thank you so much.

246
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:26,500
You're welcome. I was just doing my job.

247
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,040
Frankly speaking, Miss He, I'm grateful to you from the bottom of my heart,

248
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,780
because I haven't been talked to like this for a long time.

249
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,520
So I was wondering if I could

250
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,760
make friends with you.

251
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,690
I feel honored to hear that you'd like to make friends with me,

252
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,490
but I'm going to discuss this question with you in our next session. Is that okay with you?

253
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:54,709
Ethically speaking, a therapist isn't supposed to make friends with their clients,

254
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:58,180
but I'll take time to discuss it with you.

255
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,200
Ethically…

256
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,520
It's a matter of professionalism.

257
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,569
Because a dual relationship or a multiple relationships

258
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:07,109
would affect a therapist's professional performance.

259
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:09,169
I'm such a layman. Sorry.

260
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:11,399
You don't have to say sorry. It's okay.

261
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,440
Mr. Mo, I look forward to our next session,

262
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,180
when you're going to tell me about your expectation to make friends with me.

263
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,710
I think it'll be very important to you.

264
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,840
That's all for our session today. See you next week.

265
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,960
Okay.

266
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,790
Don't forget to finish your homework.

267
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,420
I won't forget it.

268
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,650
Goodbye, then.

269
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,380
Take care.

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,540
Thank you.

271
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,850
[Qian Kaiyi]

272
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,010
Hello.

273
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,640
He Dun, we've worked out our topic today,

274
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,180
How to say no to others.

275
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,400
Okay, I'll make some preparations.

276
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,809
Wait a second. Well… You're already

277
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:01,689
very good at saying no, so you don't have to

278
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:04,440
study the topic overly thoroughly.

279
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,009
It could invite trouble, all right?

280
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,840
I see you're good at making an issue of things.

281
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,220
I'm hanging up if you have nothing important to tell me.

282
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,710
It's a bit too much.

283
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,910
Move it to the left.

284
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,940
To the right. It's a bit too much.

285
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,440
- Just a little.
- Move it to the left a little bit.

286
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,040
For heaven's sake, are you near-sighted or are you making fun of me?

287
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,540
We're near-sighted?

288
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,700
Qian. Qian, come and help me.

289
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,110
It's aslant.

290
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,590
Yeah.

291
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,400
Oh, no.

292
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,960
All this stress at work has made him dumb.

293
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,380
Do you think we should ask Miss He Dun to talk with him?

294
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,399
It's not slanted. Brilliant.

295
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,010
Good.

296
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,919
What type of man do you think is less likely to be rejected by women?

297
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:55,330
Less likely to be rejected?

298
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,230
Just tell me what kind of man a woman likes.

299
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,520
That depends.

300
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,740
For example, Ms. He's taste is a mystery to me.

301
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,639
That being said, women always prefer brave men.

302
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:14,039
That's right. Girls easily fall for confident and resolute men.

303
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,810
Lili, do you think I'm confident and resolute?

304
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:25,000
Bro, you're being narcissistic.

305
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,400
Tell you what, an analysis I read the other day

306
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,180
says that if a man often shows up in front of a woman…

307
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,470
Are you going to talk to He Dun about something?

308
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,000
It's none of your business.

309
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,539
You're right. You need to contact her beforehand, but I only need to go home.

310
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,410
Take care of her.

311
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,430
Give her family thoughtful attention.

312
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,379
The person who brought dumplings must be a real gentleman, unlike some

313
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:57,489
pathetic coward who wouldn't stop talking about the dumplings.

314
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:02,999
A romantic gift will significantly decrease the odds of him getting rejected.

315
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,950
Yes, that's right.

316
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:14,049
An irresolute man is very unlikely to succeed.

317
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:17,259
- Very unlikely.
- Very unlikely.

318
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,709
So if something urgent comes up, don't disclose it today.

319
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:25,310
Right. Don't do it today.

320
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,400
Why not?

321
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,850
There's ill omen over there.

[Night Talk to Your Heart, a clear spring that moisturizes]

323
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,760
your dried-up heart, begins now.

324
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,590
Some audience members may be overly introspective.

325
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,830
If they fail to meet another person's expectation…

326
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,470
This is the form I'm working on. I haven't started with the PowerPoint yet.

327
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,070
I haven't started with the PowerPoint yet. What am I going to do?

328
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,510
What are you going to do? Deal with it already.

329
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,390
We'll have to drink as a forfeit if we're late.

330
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,519
What shall I do, then? I won't be able to make it in time.

331
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:02,130
- Listen. You go ahead. I'll join you later.
- That won't be necessary.

332
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,009
How can we get rid of this habitual thinking?

333
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:10,029
Your worth lies beyond how you meet other people's expectations. You should live for yourself.

334
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:12,310
Brother Mo, you're still here?

335
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,330
Well, Lu and I are going to dine with our client.

336
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,660
It's about time we set out.

337
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,099
So could you help me with the PowerPoint the director asked me to submit today?

338
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,810
It won't take you a long time.

339
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,150
Is it a long presentation?

340
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,579
No. It contains no more than 5,000 characters.

341
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:30,040
- It'll take you only two hours to finish it.
- Yes. It's just a piece of cake.

342
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,480
We're going to hold an activity whose theme is "Say No".

343
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,449
We look forward to hearing about your experience.

344
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:40,290
In our next themed episode, we're going to select ten stories

345
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:44,859
provided by the audience to discuss how to turn down people's request

346
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:47,980
which makes us feel uncomfortable.

347
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,329
Sorry, but I'm done with my work and I'm going home.

348
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,269
Brother Mo. Mo! Mo!

349
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:10,990
What's the matter with him?

350
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,430
Does he… Does he despise me?

351
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,950
Kaiyi, so you're going to continue to speed up the work.

352
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,969
Are you tired?

353
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:26,489
I'm okay.

354
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:28,640
I've got a client to meet. Bye for now.

355
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,530
Good luck.

356
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,359
Kids, go for it. I must be off.

357

- Bye, Sister Qiao.
- Bye, Sister Qiao.

Bye-bye.

Didn't I ask you guys to go home a few hours ago? What are you doing here?

360
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,179
Our new topic has gone viral on the Internet, so we're screening the comments.

Go home and have a rest.

366
00:20:57,009 --> 00:21:01,739
Brother Qian, there are too many comments for you to deal with on your own. We're not tired yet.

367
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:05,419
That's right. Don't overwork yourself. It'll be more efficient if we work on it together.

368
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:06,710
You've worked three days and three nights.

369
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,149
Replacements will be hard to come by if you pass out. Then my program will be doomed.

370
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,380
Go home. Hurry. Go home.

371
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,970
If you don't leave, you'll lose your bonus for this month.

372
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,329
Why am I not surprised?

373
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:33,359
I knew he wouldn't be so kind as to work overtime on our behalf.

374
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,110
Right, Qian?

375
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,939
I've sent you all the data we've collected.

- It's so cheap.

How much does a mackerel weigh?

388
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,230
Have you got a smaller one?

389
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,180
No. We've only got two left.

390
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,580
I'll have one. I'll have the smaller one.

391
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,110
I can't possibly finish the bigger one on my own.

392
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,729
- You can preserve it in salt, then.
- It's very fresh.

393
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:51,679
I'll think about it. Let me think about it.

394

Thank you, Night Talk to Your Heart.

395
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,239
After listening to your program for a while, I've become much happier than before,

396
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:20,250
and my husband got scolded less often as well.

397
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,539
I'd given up radio stations for a long time,

398
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:25,359
and you know what, I bought a radio just to listen to your program.

399
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,459
The last time I refused a request was when I said no to my grandpa,

who wanted to take a stroll with my radio in hand.

401

Recently I rejected a blind date because I had to think very hard

402
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:39,939
for a topic when chatting with him.

After all, humorous men

404

are most irresistible to women.

when I was sorting the data, I drew a conclusion from the large amount of feedback I read through.

409
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,560
What conclusion?

410
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,680
Our audience has such discerning ears.

411
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,969
The netizens enthusiastically responded to our theme: say no.

412
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:16,319
Among the many comments, one came from a smart member of the audience

413
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,459
who noticed a blind spot about our program.

414
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:19,661
What blind spot?

415
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:24,549
The blind spot is that our male host is really handsome.

May I come over to your place now?

- I'm a little…
- What?

I'm really scared. I've got a cramp.

- Where?
- In my heart.

Get a grip on yourself. I'll hang up if you can't do that.

Don't hang up. I'm not lying to you.

If you don't come and pick me up, I'll have to call Xiao Yuan for help.

Then…

438
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,379
Qian, listen to me. Everyone is afraid of something.

00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:35,059
- It's not embarrassing.
- No, no, no.

He just told you he's got a cramp in his heart. Of course we should comply.

445

From his tone, I can tell

446
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:02,949
he wasn't feigning fear. He was really afraid.

447

Then dear Miss He should take him in.

448

Why don't we play a card game together?

What nonsense. I'm not, okay?

454

Come on. I know what's going on.

Since when did you learn card games?

456

I met a couple of new colleagues and learned a few from them.

Okay.

You've never played this game before?

00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,459
He Dun, I saw "When Nietzsche Wept" on your bookshelf the other day.

471
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:18,819
Are you a fan of Irvin Yalom, too?

472
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:22,639
Yes. He's one of my favorite master psychotherapists.

473
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:24,659
I just bought three novels he wrote.

474
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,329
You did? Could you lend me the other two?

475
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:29,479
- No problem.
- Thank you.

476
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:32,560
- Play a hand.
- Are you in or not?

477
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,540
Qian Kaiyi draws two cards.

478
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,480
Two.

479
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,710
No.

480
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,509
- Only a yellow card will do.
- Yeah.

481
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:56,830
I'll pass.

482
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:07,089
I've got one card left. I won.

483
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,680
Shuffle the cards.

484
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:22,889
I've been too busy to play games lately. I may be a little rusty.

485
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:27,669
And there are some weird guys who are seen everywhere, know every game,

486
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:29,920
and are still up in the middle of the night.

487
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,940
We haven't turned in yet in the middle of the night because of some silly guy.

488
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,820
Will you two stop bickering and focus on shuffling the cards?

489
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,750
Do you want to play or not?

490
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,260
- Deal the cards.
- You do it.

491
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,750
- You do it. - You do it.
- You do it. - You do it.

492
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,070
All right. I'll do it.

493
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,662
- I'll play a hand first.
- Okay.

494
00:31:55,662 --> 00:31:57,990
- Green six.
- Two.

495
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
What color?

496
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,380
Red.

497
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,900
I've got none.

498
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,740
Qian Kaiyi gets two more cards.

499
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,400
You get two more cards.

500
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,549
- You get two more cards.
- You get two more cards, too.

501
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:26,479
- You, too.
- You get four more cards.

502
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:29,550
- Reverse.
- Reverse. Let me teach you a lesson.

503
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,160
We're playing the game, too.

504
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,820
Stop.

505
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,700
You haven't finished yet?

506
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,110
I've only one card left.

507
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,660
I won.

508
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,050
Jiahui, did you just let me win?

509
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,710
No.

510
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,970
I've got a phone call.

511
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,660
Hello, Professor.

512
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,290
Okay. No problem. I'll send it to you tomorrow morning.

513
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:13,470
Okay. Rest early, Professor.

514
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,090
See you tomorrow.

515
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,450
Let's continue.

516
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:22,140
He Dun, I see the books on pathology on your bookshelves but find no cases about it.

517
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,990
They're all about theory.

518
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,579
I don't have many cases here.

519
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:29,479
But my professor has got many brilliant cases approved by the clients.

520
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:32,249
- Your professor is…
- Don't be such a bore.

521
00:33:32,249 --> 00:33:34,179
Stop pestering He Dun.

522
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,220
Are you playing the game or not?

523
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,020
Come on.

524
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,600
I was too muddle-headed earlier, but I know how to play this game now. Dare you play one more game?

525
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,579
I've never seen anyone who fails to play the Uno after two games.

526
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:46,390
We'll play until daybreak, then.

527
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,000
Bring it on.

528
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,760
[F's client file]

529
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,760
[F's client file]

530
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,460
You're awake? Are you thirsty? Would you like something to drink?

531
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,929
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

532
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,940
Why did you throw a party last night?

533
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,359
That's an infuriating question.

534
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,750
I shouldn't have got to know that silly man in the first place.

535
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:40,159
Qian Kaiyi called us last night, saying that he'd run into a ghost.

536
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,690
He was hysterical, insisting on coming to meet us.

537
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,380
We three spent the whole night playing the Uno with him,

538
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,119
and what's worse, he kept saying that he'd gone unpunished.

539
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,090
We should have asked him to be our chauffeur.

540
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,590
Did something urgent happen so that you need to send the file so early?

541
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,619
No. It's just that my professor takes this case very serious.

542
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:03,970
Is it a special case?

543
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,840
I've never read it.

544
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,770
And you're not curious?

545
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,290
I've read some books by Professor Ji.

546
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,979
But lately I watched one of his interviews,

547
00:35:18,979 --> 00:35:21,810
and found him somewhat different from what I thought.

548
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,189
What did you think he was like?

549
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,760
I thought he was an old academic.

550
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,580
Then you're really mistaken about him.

551
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,630
Can you tell me what he's really like?

552
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,600
Well, he's a serious and conscientious man.

553
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,470
Sometimes he's just like a playful child,

554
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,330
but sometimes he's very mature, just like a father to me.

555
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,430
Do you trust him so much?

556
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,429
Of course. He's always supported me

557
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:51,299
unconditionally both in my work and in my studies.

558
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:54,919
What if you discover one day that he's not the man you've expected him to be?

559
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,670
Why do you ask this question?

560
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,950
It's nothing but some casual talk.

561
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,950
I just think that you might get hurt

562
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:06,710
if you trust the people around you too easily.

563
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:13,189
I'm not someone who trusts others easily.

564
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:17,639
But since my professor has always trusted and supported me unconditionally,

565
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:21,300
I feel obliged to live up to his faith in me.

566
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,250
It works both ways.

567
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,710
I hope so.

568
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,050
I hope he'll be worthy of your trust.

569
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,699
Where's He Dun?

570
00:36:49,699 --> 00:36:52,150
She's gone out with Ye Jiahui.

571
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,520
With whom?

572
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,080
Ye Jiahui.

573
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,940
What for?

574
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:06,339
It's a sunny morning, a perfect time to take a walk, have a nice chat

575
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:08,179
and eat brunch with a friend.

576
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:09,659
Why didn't you join them?

577
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:12,729
Why would I do that? Why would I want to be a third wheel?

578
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,899
Thank you, Jiahui, for driving me here.

579
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:28,609
I don't know how long I'll be staying here,

580
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:31,420
so you don't have to waste your time waiting for me.

581
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,800
But you can come in and say hi to Professor Ji.

582
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,469
He's a very nice man, and his field overlaps with yours. You could communicate with each other later.

583
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,280
What's the matter, Jiahui?

584
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,110
I haven't stayed up for a long time.

585
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,670
I'll ask Qian Kaiyi to treat us to a big dinner as compensation.

586
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,869
Jiahui, I don't think you're fit to drive home today.

587
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:00,629
Get a designated driver instead. Fatigue driving can be very dangerous.

588
00:38:00,629 --> 00:38:03,429
Okay. I've got some business to deal with this afternoon.

589
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:05,899
Then you should go back on your own. Send me a message when you're home.

590
00:38:05,899 --> 00:38:08,370
Don't worry. I'm a grown-up.

591
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,680
The truth is, I'm more worried about you, as you don't look so well today.

592
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,130
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

593
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,220
What did you just say?

594
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,210
I was saying you could go in with me and say hello to Professor Ji.

595
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,880
Professor. Professor.

596
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,520
Coming!

597
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,900
Professor, I've brought you the file.

598
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,869
Is this old friend of yours a man or a woman?

599
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,030
Does it really matter?

600
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,200
Have you ever loved anyone?

601
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,430
No.

602
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,370
Jiahui.

603
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,969
Jiahui. Come here, Jiahui.

604
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,280
Professor, this is my friend, Jiahui. This is Professor Ji.

605
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,180
Hello, Professor. My name is Ye Jiahui.

606
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,190
Hello.

607
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,430
Come on in, He Dun.

608
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,240
Sorry. Normally he isn't like that.

609
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,519
Perhaps he's got something urgent to deal with today. I'll go in and check it out.

610
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,430
Take care.

611
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,939
Dad.

612
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:31,600
Meet me this afternoon.

613
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,030
Okay.

614
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,770
Professor, do you really distrust me so much,

615
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,300
taking back the file you gave me a little while ago?

616
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,320
I'd say you didn't sleep well last night.

617
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,130
You can tell that, Professor? Awesome.

618
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:00,250
Young people should alternate work with rest.

619
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:07,510
The boy who drove you here seemed a fine young man.

620
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,329
Professor, you're as gossipy as my mother.

621
00:40:10,329 --> 00:40:14,430
He's just a neighbor. I asked him to give me a lift and that's all.

622
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:18,409
A relationship takes shape in the midst of mutual help.

623
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:23,669
Your mother already told me about it, saying that both are fine young men she likes.

624
00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:26,289
My mother tells you everything. And two of them…

625
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:29,719
This is a big decision in my life, and you guys should stay out of it.

626
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,589
This big decision in life should be made by yourself.

627
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:34,939
I was just presuming on my old age.

628
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:40,159
We must keep our eyes wide open when looking for our better half.

629
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,869
I'll keep my eyes wide open. I'll do that, okay?

630
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:48,129
I gave you some documents to translate last time, so how is it going?

631
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:51,309
I've sorted out the experimental data and key arguments.

632
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:52,700
Here.

633
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,570
Try this refreshing Longjing tea Lao Zhang gave me.

634
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,530
Have you got anything?

635
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,670
This cross attack of bipolar affective disorder

636
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,710
is far more complicated than I imagined.

637
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,459
So far not a single experiment

638
00:41:09,459 --> 00:41:12,459
has proved whether cognitive dysfunction resulting from bipolar affective disorder

639
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:16,839
is a matter of medication or a matter of the disorder itself.

640
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:19,500
But if it's a matter of medication,

641
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,700
then it's basically irreversible.

642
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,010
- Are you all right? Be careful.
- Yeah.

643
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:34,360
There must be another solution out there.

644
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:39,630
Non-pharmacological cognitive interventions could be a better solution.

645
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,499
You mean… These are your areas of expertise.

646
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:45,490
Cognitive therapy and cued recall training.

647
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,360
That sounds a good approach.

648
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,570
Indeed there could be a key to that cage,

649
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,800
but so far there are no findings yet.

650
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,470
Do we have a direction?

651
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:00,419
What patients suffering from bipolar affective disorder often lose is their free memories,

652
00:42:00,419 --> 00:42:03,469
while their cued memories are rarely affected.

653
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:06,700
If their cued memories are intact,

654
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,230
we can help them retrieve their memories.

655
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:16,569
I believe you've got an answer, Professor. But you doubt this approach is viable.

656
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,989
I'm sorry, Professor. I was just making a suggestion.

657
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:27,900
The translation of the book is still in progress.

658
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,189
When it's done, perhaps we'll have enough theories and proof.

659
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,870
My student knows me best.

660
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:42,860
You're in the right direction, but memories... are subjective.

661
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,449
Other people's memories are bound to be a Rashomon scenario. (T/N: Rashomon = several conflicting ideas)

662
00:42:47,449 --> 00:42:53,029
Even so, we should give it a shot if it could help the patient regain their hopes.

663
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,709
Professor, does the patient have someone close to them,

664
00:42:56,709 --> 00:42:59,129
like a spouse, a relation, a friend,

665
00:42:59,129 --> 00:43:03,579
or someone who shares some precious memory with them?

666
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,880
