Sir, thank you.

20
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,210
Mom,

21
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,510
can we really see Qian Kaiyi and He Dun here?

22
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,999
You need to be polite. Call them Brother Qian and Sister He. Got it?

23
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,449
- Okay.
- Let's go. Go.

24
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,619
Although it was hurt by humans with injuries all over, I could still see

25
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:18,329
the longing and curiosity to this world in its eyes.

26
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:21,850
At that moment I saw the reflection of myself.

Ms. Wang has rescued and adopted

28
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:27,910
more than two hundred stray cats and dogs in the past 30 years, and this is what she tries to achieve.

29
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,470
Ms. Wang was forced to relocate her shelter many times.

30

Now she can't afford the increased expenses to keep it running anymore.

In addition, I need to watch out for some mysterious people

who would come to your place in the middle of the night, right?

46
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,820
you ground your teeth, snorted, and drooled

47
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,490
in your sleep last night?

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,750
Miss He, so you secretly checked on me.

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,010

Welcome back to Night Talk to Your Heart!

65
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,820
You're cheeky.

66
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,000
Miss He. I am here to thank you and Mr. Qian.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,670
You've given me a lot of help and your show also gave me great encouragement.

68
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,970
I got a little something for you.

69
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,550
You don't have to. It's the least I should do.

70
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,660
- I'm so flattered.
- Take it.

71
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,550
Sister, I picked this one for you.

72
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,770
You don't like it?

73
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,130
Oh, I love it. How can I not like it?

74

Okay, thank you.

00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:44,320
- Take it.
- You deserve it.

00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,600
So, Yezi, do you want to have some beverage?

77

- I'll take you to buy some.
- Yes!

Let's go.

79
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,640
Yezi, listen to Brother Qian.

80
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,509
Ms. Zhan, do you want to come inside?

81
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:58,500
- Sure.
- Come on in.

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,870
How's life treating you? Is everything okay?

83
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,410
I started looking for a job recently.

84
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,760
I sent a few resumes but nothing happened yet.

85
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,570
There were two companies that I was going to have an interview with.

86
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,050
But that was it.

87
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,700
But it doesn't matter.

88
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,200
I thought about it.

89
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,560
Certainly, it'll be a little difficult for me to get a job at this age.

90
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,940
It's already something that you are willing to take this step.

91
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,760
I believe that you have the power to solve whatever difficulties you encounter in the future.

92
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,439
As I said, I may not be able to help you outside the counseling room,

93
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,270
but when you need advice, I will be waiting for you in the counseling room.

94
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,600
Miss He, don't worry.

95
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,149
My mind has been adjusted to a healthy state by you.

00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:56,950

99
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,740
Not here.

100
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,980
I know a secret.

101
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,640
What secret?

102
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,230
You like Sister He Dun!

103
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,830
Okay, sure. I am available today.

104
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,640
I'll be there soon.

105

Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

106
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,900
Miss He,

107
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,159
a company I used to submit my resume to just called to ask me for an interview.

108
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,770
Really? Congratulations.

109
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,440
But I should have made an evening appointment.

110
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,030
No one's home now. What about Yezi?

111
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,760
- Mom!
- Yezi, come here.

112
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,840
Yezi? Why are you so happy?

113
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,140
I'm going to the amusement park!

114
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,880
Yezi, I have something to do this afternoon. How about we go another day?

115
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,649
Since you can't go with me,

116
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:49,720
Brother Qian and Sister He Dun can take me to the park.

117
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,160
Yezi, we can't trouble them to do this.

118
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,819
No trouble at all. None at all.

119
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,640
Anyway, we don't have a show today.

120
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,659
We should spend some more time with children to gain experience in child psychology.

121
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:02,510
But Ms. Zhan was my visitor.

122
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,039
It's against the ethic if we take Yezi to the park.

123
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,950
Yezi.

124
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,510
Who said "we"?

125
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,350
I'll be taking Yezi to the park.

126
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,200
And you will be following behind to protect us.

127
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,950
Right, Yezi?

128
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,470
Sister, you don't want to play with me?

129
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,529
Of course… I want to play with you.

130
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:26,099
Sister He!

131
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,230
Yezi, be a good girl. Mom will take you home now.

132
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,870
Let's go another day, okay?

133
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,409
It's okay, Ms. Zhan.

134
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:40,529
You can let Yezi stay with us if you don't mind.

135
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:43,070
We can take care of her for you.

136
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,030
Isn't that too much to ask you?

137
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,540
It's okay.

138
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,260
You have an interview which can be a big chance.

139
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,980
Just go.

140
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,930
Okay, thank you.

141
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,260
I'll come to pick her up as soon as it's over.

142
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,350
Yezi, listen to what they say, okay?

143
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,540
- Okay, I have to go.
- Don't worry.

144
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,160
Thank you.

145
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,969
Let's go.

146
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,760
- Hurry up! Brother Qian, Sister He.
- Which one do you want to play?

147
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,160
The merry-go-round!

148
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,830
And the Ferris wheel, too!

149
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:34,129
Yezi, remember, you need to stick with us after we get in there.

150
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:36,030
Don't wander away, okay?

151
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,520
Yes, Yezi. Look, there are so many people here.

152
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,289
If you get lost, the police will take you to the police station.

153
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,910
Qian Kaiyi!

154
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,570
Xiao Yezi, don't listen to him.

155
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,559
If you really have an accident in the park, go to the police immediately.

156
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,410
All right?

157
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,790
Don't scare children with police.

158
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,260
She won't dare go to the police for help if she's really in danger.

159
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,400
You're right.

160
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,380
People always scared me with the police when I was a kid so I didn't realize this is not right.

161
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,000
Yezi, sorry about what I said.

162
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,940
Sister He is right. You should take her advice.

163
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,440
Don't fight.

164
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,299
We're not fighting.

165
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:11,550
We're just discussing how to better protect you.

166
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,330
Don't worry.

167
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,880
Let's continue to play.

168
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,710
- Lets' go!
- Let's set sail!

169
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,030
Yezi, look!

170
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,910
Baby seal!

171
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,760
- Do you like it?
- Yes!

172
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,770
Let me take a photo for you guys.

173
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Smile!

174
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,400
Smile.

175
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,950
See that?

176
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,130
Dolphins!

177
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,770
Come here. Look!

178
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,870
Come here. What are you doing?

179
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,000
What's wrong?

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,740
You aren't even afraid of dolphins, are you?

181
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,550
I am not.

182
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,400
Come here.

183
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,030
Look!

184
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,000
Sister.

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,530
I don't want to see dolphins anymore.

186
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,220
Sister, let's go ride the Ferris wheel.

187
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,440
Didn't you say you want to see the dolphins?

188
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,620
We can go to the Ferris wheel later.

189
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,400
- I found Night Talk to Your Heart!
- Where is it?

190
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,779
Where?

191
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,080
It's over there!

192
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,000
There is the Little West Sea. That's a duty free shop.

193
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,500
There is an anime mall!

194
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,960
You're amazing!

195
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,150
Qian Kaiyi, what are you doing?

196
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,160
I am fine.

197
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,550
I didn't expect you to be afraid of heights.

198
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,560
I'm afraid of heights only under specific circumstances.

199
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,499
Xiao Ye, look. A grown-up man is afraid of heights.

200
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:15,210
It doesn't sound manly at all, right?

201
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,759
Who said I'm afraid of heights?

202
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,620
I am not!

203
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,130
Sister He, I want to tell you a secret.

204
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,180
What secret?

205
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,070
He likes you so much.

206
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,960
How did you know that?

207
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,929
There are still things you don't know when you're such a good therapist.

208
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,720
You little gossip.

209
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,320
I don't believe it.

210
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,400
Is she really so good?

211
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,350
I still heard him making a scene in his room

212
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,370
when I visited his parents two weeks ago.

213
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,440
I didn't believe it at first.

214
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,320
So I specially went to visit them.

215
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,590
That lad is like a totally different person now!

216
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,000
God bless them.

217
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,739
- He was lucky to meet Miss Wen.
- Yes.

218
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:01,549
- It was good for the whole apartment building, too.
- Yeah!

219
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:07,349
If he jumps off the building here, it'll bring bad luck to all of us.

220
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:10,199
I heard that Ms. Zhao's daughter is also in this line.

221
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:12,380
- Yes, she's also a psychological counselor.
- Ms. Zhao.

222
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,520
You're chatting happily.

223
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,080
Are you talking about my Dun Dun again?

224
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,809
I know this is what you've been worried about.

225
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:20,770
You want your daughter to get married soon.

226
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,590
You're almost obsessed with it.

227
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,550
Yes.

228
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,550
Ms. Zhao.

229
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:30,280
We were just talking about there is this amazing psychological counselor.

230
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,680
Many of our relatives went to counsel with her and all of them are healed!

231
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,770
Really?

232
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,329
Where is this psychological counselor? Is she living in this complex?

233
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:39,520
Yes.

234
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,109
I heard that He Dun is also a psychological counselor.

235
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:46,960
- I was thinking maybe I could introduce them to help her.
- Yes.

236
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,799
But no matter how good Miss Wen is, counseling with your own daughter is more reassuring.

237
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,450
Didn't you hear?

238
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:58,059
A psychological counselor can't give service to her family or someone she knows.

239
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:02,499
Because she knows their background and their privacy all too well, which is inappropriate.

240
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:05,590
Ms. Zhao, do you know Ms. Li?

241
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,929
Her son wouldn't go to work, or leave his home.

242
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:11,799
He's already in his thirties. Ms. Li was so anxious.

243
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,829
After he went to Miss Wen for help, they did a session for a month.

244
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:16,840
Guess what?

245
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,439
He found a job and even brought a girlfriend home!

246
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,570
Really?

247
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,130
Oh, sorry. He Dun is also pretty good.

248
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,520
She's on radio shows.

249
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,410
You must be proud.

250
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,960
She's busy with her work all day. I don't even know what she is up to.

251
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,899
When one's getting old, they will have a weak body.

252
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,779
On top of that they might get mental disorders, too.

253
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,200
I am so envious of you.

254
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,080
You have your own therapist at home.

255
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,099
I know, right?

256
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:47,880
But a psychiatrist can't offer therapy to their family members.

257
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,840
Yeah. Ms. Zhao, as the old saying goes,

258
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,150
"A healer can't heal themselves".

259
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,230
No. They just can't treat patients they know.

260
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,710
What is the term again?

261
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,550
- Dual relationship.
- Yes!

262
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:03,149
But it makes sense with the saying that a healer can't heal themselves.

263
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:05,969
I can help you get in touch with Miss Wen if you want.

264
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:07,640
Okay.

265
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,990
It's late. We chatted for a long time.

266
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,380
I should head home to make dinner.

267
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,690
Goodbye.

268
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,909
Sister He Dun, I want to become someone like you when I grow up.

269
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:24,000
Why?

270
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,400
You have magic.

271
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,710
You defeated the Dark Monster for my mom.

272
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,809
It's not me who defeated the Dark Monster.

273
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:35,419
Your mother defeated the monster herself.

274
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:37,230
What did you do then?

275
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:42,989
I just stood at the door and gave a beam of light to let your mom see future and hope.

276
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:44,540
When she decided to get out of the shadow by herself,

277
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,579
I would cheer her up and encourage her behind her back.

278
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,779
Then I want to be this kind of people when I grow up.

279
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:53,640
I want to protect mom and dad.

280
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,330
I also want to protect my brother.

281
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,649
What's the matter, Xiao Yezi? Why did you become so upset?

282
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:03,590
Talk to us.

283
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,440
Dad protects my brother.

284
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,100
Mom protects my brother.

285
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,910
Grandma protects my brother.

286
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,910
But no one protects me.

287
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,810
I like my brother.

288
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,530
But I also hate him, too.

289
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,800
I'm a bad big sister.

290
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,710
I want to be a doctor and invent a medicine.

291
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,150
This medicine can make people stop arguing.

292
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:39,449
And people will be very happy and satisfied after they take this medicine.

293
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:41,820
They'll love this world very much!

294
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,470
It's okay, Xiao Yezi.

295
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,769
I often quarreled with my parents when I was a kid.

296
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:50,809
I would also hate my mom and dad when we had a fight.

297
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:53,350
But it didn't mean I didn't love my mom and dad.

298
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,570
Right?

299
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,140
Yeah, Xiao Yezi.

300
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,770
Do you know why your mom came to me?

301
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,790
It wasn't just about defeating the Dark Monster.

302
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,870
She was also trying to protect you.

303
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,750
Really?

304
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,280
Of course.

305
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,010
Your mom loves you very much, Xiao Yezi.

306
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,990
So cheer up.

307
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,400
Xiao Yezi, look!

308
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,210
What is this? Should I put it on for you?

309
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,470
Our Xiao Yezi is so cute.

310
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,200
Look, I put it on, too.

311
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,810
Let's show Brother Qian.

312
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,220
Are we cute?

313
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,160
So cute.

314
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,470
Who is cuter?

315
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,960
Sister He Dun is cuter, of course.

316
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,830
But Xiao Yezi is also very cute.

317
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,750
Xiao Yezi is the cutest.

318
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,530
You are so childish.

319
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,400
You gang up against me!

320
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,410
Stop!

321
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,350
Catch him!

322
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,680
Qian Kaiyi, you're so lame.

323
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,950
Hi, Sweetie. Do you want to learn how to make cakes?

324
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,230
Yes, I want to make a coconut-flavor cake.

325
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,570
Her name is Yezi.(T/N: Yezi in Chinese is coconut)

326
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,900
Of course. Little friend, Yezi.

327
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,389
Parents can go to take a break and wait for her over there.

328
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,600
Yezi. You stay here to make the cake. Don't go anywhere, you know?

329
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,070
Please take care of her.

330
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,260
Sure, don't worry.

331
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,170
Let's make some cake!

332
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,110
How are you? Tired?

333
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,710
I'm okay.

334
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,299
Did your parents take you to the amusement park when you were young?

335
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,280
My mother was very busy when I was young.

336
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,210
She needed to work and raise me and my young brother at the same time.

337
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,140
She didn't have the time.

338
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,819
And you? You have a good personality.

339
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:31,310
I guess your parents have been dotting on you.

340
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,100
Not really.

341
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,530
But I think what my parents gave me

342
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,489
was better and much more than taking me to an amusement park.

343
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:41,780
I admired my dad very much when I was a boy.

344
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,070
He was a man with a great sense of justice.

345
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,920
A man who knew everything, too.

346
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,179
He knew how to fix computers, refrigerators, and water heaters.

347
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:53,609
People in the neighborhood would always come to him for help when they had something broken.

348
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:56,430
He would always go to offer help.

349
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:02,889
Sometimes when I had difficulties, I would think, what my dad would do if it were him.

350
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,469
For people to face and deal with difficulties fearlessly and help others at the same time,

351
00:19:08,469 --> 00:19:10,729
they need strength and experience.

352
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:14,129
In addition to these, there is another thing which is the most important.

353
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:15,930
What is it?

354
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,470
Bravery.

355
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,009
Bravery is a person's quality.

356
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:22,849
And courage can make a person

357
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:26,410
step forward without fear.

358
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,529
Every time I think of his smiling and calm face when there was a problem,

359
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:34,840
I would feel that nothing can stop me.

360
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,059
What about your parents?

361
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,380
How are their health now?

362
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,190
He was a fireman.

363
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,380
He died in fighting a fire.

364
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,349
With a broken heart, my mom had a serious illness and also died later.

365
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:52,800
Sorry. I didn't know that.

366
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,180
It's okay. It's a long time ago.

367
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,340
I wanted to be a firefighter very much when I was young.

368
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,545
Dad, what you just did was awesome!
[Dangerous Action Do Not Imitate]

369
00:20:00,545 --> 00:20:02,560
I want to learn it!

370
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,239
I want to be a hero who can come to the rescue like you!

371
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,680
Guess what? I really got admitted,

372
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,669
although I didn't make it in the end which made me feel frustrated for a long time.

373
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:12,899
But then I thought about it.

374
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:17,949
Actually, it's not bad to be a passionate and kindhearted civilian like my dad.

375
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:21,240
That explains why you were so agile and sporty.

376
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,639
[Dangerous Action Do Not Imitate]

377
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:29,519
That time when You Na... The poster earlier, didn't you tear it up…

378
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,930
Why did you decide to become a radio host?

379
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,520
Because of my aunt.

380
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,589
She asked me to go to an interview with the radio station after graduation.

381
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:51,110
My mentor at the time was Director Fei.

382
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,340
I started to do shows with him.

383
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,749
My aunt said our family couldn't afford another tragedy again.

384
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:59,000
I see.

385
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,169
I just knew that your original career dream wasn't a radio host.

386
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:06,310
Actually, I just wanted to do this thing right.

387
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,070
I just wanted to have success.

388
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,559
But after I started Night Talk to Your Heart, my mentality started to have some changes.

389
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,459
Especially when I see how our show has affected and given support and encourage to so many people,

390
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:24,069
I feel a sense of mission, especially after we saved Jiang Jing.

391
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:29,159
I guess there are many ways to be a hero like my dad.

392
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,509
More importantly, I think I am quite talented to work as a radio host.

393
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,520
And what about you?

394
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,629
How did you get on the path of chatting with people as your livelihood?

395
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:42,360
Me?

396
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,510
Because of my brother.

397
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,999
Actually, I didn't know what I wanted to be at the beginning,

398
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:52,050
until one day, my brother told me something.

399
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:57,569
He said, Sister, I want to invent a medicine that can make people all over the world feel happy.

400
00:21:57,569 --> 00:22:00,059
I wasn't good at chemistry and I couldn't invent it for him.

401
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:05,519
I just thought, maybe I could choose a profession which could relieve people of their worries.

402
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,430
That would also be great.

403
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,570
Then after working in this line for a long time, I've come to realize that what my visitors give me

404
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:17,020
is more than what I give my visitors.

405
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,230
Yezi.

406
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,800
You made this?

407
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,110
Not bad.

408
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:30,450
Brother, Sister, are you dating?

409
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,370
Brother Qian, men should be the ones to make the move.

410
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,660
You know?

411
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,190
You little know-it-all. I got it!

412
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,310
Sister, try it.

413
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,110
Okay, let me try the small cake Yezi made.

414
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,660
It's so good.

415
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,110
Can I have a marshmallow?

416
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,070
Sir, our marshmallow is not for sale.

417
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,169
It's given out for free in our three-time family portrait challenge campaign.

418
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,920
Sister?

He Dun,

422
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,200
actually, I have one more thing that I didn't tell you.

423
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,419
When I asked you to do a show with me,

424
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:11,199
I just wanted to find a gimmick for the show as buildup.

425
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,860
Please don't be offended.

426
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,220
But then I realized…

427
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,590
What?

428
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,320

Before we went to the amusement park,

What secret promise?

But I hope you don't just give me the attitude.

He Dun!

486
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
What now?

487
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,040
Nothing. I just want to call your name.

488
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,390
Go inside.

489
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,020
WeChat me and let me know when you get home.

490
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,880
Good night.

491
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,680
Good night.

492
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,380
Qian Kaiyi?

493
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,800
I saw you. You don't have to hide.

494
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,500
Come out.

495
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,660
Qian Kaiyi.

496
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,630
Qian Kaiyi?

497
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,000
Why?

498
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,180
- Xiao Mo?
- Why did you tell them?

499
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,280
What are you talking about?

500
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,120
They all know.

501
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,230
Everyone knows now.

502
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,210
Who knows?

503
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,060
I only told you.

504
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,000
You were the only one who knew it.

505
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,180
Why? Why did you tell them?

506
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,040
You… All ruined. You ruined everything.

507
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,471
You ruined it! It's ruined!

508
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:12,779
All ruined by you.

509
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,620
Why?

510
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,530
He Dun, are you okay?

511
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,640
He Dun, are you okay?

512
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,030
Watch out!

513
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,590
Qian Kaiyi!

514
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,690
You're bleeding!

515
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,310
- Stop, don't go after him.
- He Dun, are you okay?

516
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,090
Let's go to the hospital. You're bleeding!

517
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,980
I'm fine. It's just a minor injury.

518
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,660
Let's go inside.

519
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,130
Come on.

520
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,070
Why did you come back?

521
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,560
Fortunately, you left your ID in my car.

522
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,930
Or you would have been in danger tonight.

[Name: He Dun
Gender: Female Nationality: Han
Born: December 31, 1992
Address: 201, Unit 1, No. 96, Wennan Street, Jiyang District, Sanya City, Hainan Province]

524
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,590
No.

525
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,930
I knew him.

526
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,620
He isn't usually like this.

527
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,170
It's just that his mood is a little agitated and unstable today.

528
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,520
Unstable mood isn't his reason to hurt people.

529
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,739
He would have killed you had I not arrived in time.

530
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,020
I should have camped here in your yard.

531
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,430
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

532
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,730
He would have killed you had I not arrived in time.

533
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,110
You see, your neck is red.

534
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,969
It seems that he really wants to hurt you.

535
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:14,050
No.

536
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,880
I know him.

537
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,280
He isn't usually like this.

538
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,709
It's just that his mood is a little agitated and unstable today.

539
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:22,040
Unstable mood isn't his reason to hurt people.

540
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,300
He would have killed you had I not arrived in time.

541
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,660
[M]

542
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,500
Maybe we should go to the hospital.

543
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,489
It's okay. It's just external, some minor injury.

544
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:43,830
You call this a minor injury?

545
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,110
It's nothing.

546
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,189
The injuries I got when I was a kid were much more serious than this.

547
00:32:47,189 --> 00:32:48,640
- This is nothing.
- Don't move.

548
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,110
- What's wrong?
- Don't move.

549
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,690
The blood goes down to the back of your neck.

550
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,690
Don't move.

551
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,030
-Does it hurt?
- No.

552
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:05,630
This scar on your back…

553
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,880
An old wound many years ago.

554
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,120
I got burned in a fire.

555
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,750
You said that your father was…

556
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,470
Firefighter.

557
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,130
He put out fire for his lifetime.

558
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,190
At the end, his home was on fire.

559
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,480
Fire! Run!

560
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:37,100
Fire! Run!

561
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,970
Fire! Run!

562
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,760
Fire! Run!

563
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,660
Dad!

564
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,159
The door handle is hot, which means the fire is very close to us.

565
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,230
You can't go outside.

566
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:56,169
When you're surrounded by thick smoke and fire, don't open any door or window.

567
00:33:56,169 --> 00:34:01,059
Or there will be a lot of oxygen coming in which will increase the fire.

568
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:02,710
If there is a fire during the day,

569
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:07,209
take some clothes and go out to the balcony to wave as an SOS signal.

570
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:12,439
If it happens at night, turn on a flashlight and flash outside the window.

571
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:15,330
Let people know that there are people inside.

572
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:30,280
Dad!

573
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,110
Does it still hurt?

574
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,760
The wounds on my body no longer hurt.

575
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,050
But sometimes

576
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,250
my heart will still hurt.

577
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,570
My dad never came back

578
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,760
because of that fire.

579
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,080
So the firefighting you mentioned earlier… Yes?

580
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,860
My dad saved my life.

581
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,630
When I was young I used to think,

582
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,250
if I could fall asleep and never wake up again,

583
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,570
I would be free of so many worries.

584
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,290
But I won't think like this now.

585
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,600
Because all the people of the Wenchang Street are my family.

586
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,160
Colleagues at the radio station,

587
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,710
and you.

588
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,910
Why do you become quiet?

589
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,910
Nothing.

590
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,100
I just never thought

591
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,970
you would have such a painful past.

592
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:43,670
He Dun, do you want to visit Wenchang Street?

593
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:51,020
Thank you, Qian Kaiyi.

594
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,560
Why are you so polite all of a sudden?

595
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,420
It even makes me a bit awkward.

596
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,250
Do you want to go there with me?

597
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,779
- Okay.
- Really?

598
00:35:58,779 --> 00:36:01,570
I want to see what Wenchang Street is like.

599
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,100
Then I will pick you up tomorrow.

600
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,649
No need. You are injured.

601
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:06,810
I can go by myself.

602
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:11,439
How can I trust you to go alone? If the accident tonight happens again tomorrow?

603
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:12,870
No.

604
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,830
I know what kind of person he is.

605
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,850
There must be some misunderstanding.

606
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,090
It won't happen again.

607
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,929
It's difficult to really understand someone. Right?

608
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:28,099
Some people are good at disguising. You can't tell what he's really like.

609
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,409
Then I promise you that I'll be careful from now on.

610
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:34,430
I won't let myself fall into danger, okay?

611
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,560
Pinky swear.

612
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,130
You promise me.

613
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,420
Stamp.

614
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,070
Why didn't you just do as I told you?

615
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,240
At first I also wanted to expose her online.

616
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,100
But do you know

617
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,070
how bad she hurt me?

618
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,669
You never thought what would happen to you if she was injured?

619
00:37:30,669 --> 00:37:32,530
She was injured?

620
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,290
All ruined by you!

621
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,710
I have no idea.

622
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,330
I didn't know.

623
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,370
I took your medication at night and then…

624
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:51,319
Whenever I think that she told everyone everything about me,

625
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,100
I can't stand it.

626
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,040
I can't bear it at all.

627
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,629
Brother Fei, I called you. But I couldn't control myself.

628
00:38:01,629 --> 00:38:03,720
So, I did that.

629
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,910
Enough.

630
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,400
You don't need to worry about exposing her anymore.

631
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,560
This is the last time I give you medication.

632
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,460
Don't contact me again.

633
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,470
But Brother Fei, aren't we friends?

634
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,830
Stop when you finish this time's medication.

635
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,970
Okay, got it.

636
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:57,937
Jiahui?
[Duhuo Antalgic Linimentum]

637
00:38:57,937 --> 00:38:59,769
- Are you available now?
- Yes.

638
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:01,730
Then do you know how to pick vegetable?

639
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,040
What's wrong?

640
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,920
Please excuse him. Professor's hobby is to grow vegetables.

641
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,360
Professor, what are you doing?

642
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,220
I'm sorry. There is a burst in the faucet.

643
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,019
Jiahui, last time I said I would invite you to dinner. But we didn't have time.

644
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:27,690
Let's eat here today.

645
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,800
I don't think these vegetables can make it.

646
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,230
Let's cook them.

647
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,660
This is automatic irrigation equipment.

648
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,530
I was thinking in case I went out

649
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,819
and couldn't water them for a few days, nobody would take care of them.

650
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:40,010
So I installed automatic irrigation equipment.

651
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,569
I obviously installed it according to the manual. Why would it burst?

652
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:45,900
Maybe you turned the nozzle too tight.

653
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,930
Let me take a look.

654
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,269
Jiahui might not look like it, but he's a good amateur plumber and maintenance man.

655
00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:56,150
He often helps me when I have a network malfunction or a broken faucet.

656
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,370
It's fine. I'll just change the nozzle.

657
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,000
Good.

658
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,560
You are careless in private life.

659
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,050
You need someone who's scrupulous.

660
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,600
What are you talking about?

661
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,950
You got shy?

662
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,770
What's this on your neck?

663
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,620
I sprained it.

664
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,730
Does it even make sense?

665
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,670
I guess.

666
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,469
What is this? Newly cultivated species?

667
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:25,030
You mean the kidney bean?

668
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,230
Don't get me started.

669
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,959
This morning I saw his chickens came to destroy my vegetables.

670
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,080
I went to Old Ke.

671
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,969
He just gave me a handful of beans saying this is Golden Bean.

672
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:36,560
He's such a pain in the ass.

673
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:38,910
What?

674
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,510
Look!

675
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,620
Old Ke!

676
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,150
Why did your chicken come out of your yard again?

677
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,710
They're free-range chicken.

678
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,460
Walking free-range is the key. Got it?

679
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,600
All right, fine.

680
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,360
I am going to stew your free-range chicken today.

681
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,489
Jiahui. Give me a hand.

682
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:59,599
I've been resenting these chickens for a long time.

683
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,420
They must be very delicious.

684
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,740
You want to catch the chickens? Be careful.

685
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,330
- Do you want to be join us?
- No, no, no.

686
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,430
Hello, Qian Kaiyi?

687
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:14,429
He Dun, will you come and meet me here or you want me to pick you up?

688
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:18,350
Damn! I forgot. We are helping professor catch the chicken here.

689
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,289
We? Who else is there?

690
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:22,430
And… Jiahui.

691
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,809
How come he's always there? Is there anything he doesn't know?

692
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:28,180
Then I want to come to help, too.

693
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,430
Okay.

694
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:32,409
You can come and help them out. Okay.

695
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,720
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
