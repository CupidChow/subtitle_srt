So pretty.

19

Why are you in such a leisurely mood today?

20
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,992
I happened to pass by a florist.

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,029
The girls gave this to me.

22
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,580
It tastes very good. Try it.

Tell me more about your new book.

How's it going?

25
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,289
The sweethearts in the book have become man and wife.

26
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:32,130
However,

27
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,899
when two people's conjugal relations are endowed with family responsibilities,

28
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:40,739
time and trivialities wear away the love between them.

29
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,099
But at the same time, they've also found a brand-new side in each other.

30
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,269
A less-known side.

31
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,050
When they show their less-known side,

32
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,390
do they love each other more?

33
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,030
To me,

34
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,669
it's like a man flying a kite and the kite in his hand.

35
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:10,050
And that kite string is a bond between them.

36
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,650
You can take it up or put it down.

37

But that string will never break off.

38

Nobody is a kite.

Does the kite want to be free?

Because love is a topic of everyone's concern.

It has a much bigger probability of occurrence to the ordinary people than those uncanny events.

62

What's more, the previous generation, due to restraints of the times, had little chance to tell their stories.

162
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,420
I also have another agony, which is that I even dare not show my agony to my daughter.

163
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,259
I'm afraid if I grieve too much, the child will wonder if mom has regretted it,

164
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:17,299
regretted that her younger brother should be saved first instead of her.

165
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:20,549
Mom, what are you doing standing over there?

166
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,049
Could it be that you shouldn't have saved me?

167
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:26,040
Could it be that if you saved my younger brother,

168
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,600
dad wouldn't leave us

169
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,150
and leave this house?

170
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:40,659
As you know, since I've lost Jun Jun, I don't want to lose my daughter again.

171
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:42,279
I'm afraid of hurting her.

172
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,899
I especially don't want her father I don't want to lose my daughter again.

173
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:50,629
Sometimes I ask myself. Was I not being brave enough?

174
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:54,259
Had I been braver by holding tightly onto my husband and Dun Dun,

175
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:58,149
would our family have been able to pull through?

176
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,679
Auntie Zhao, you were being brave enough and strong enough.

177
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,040
Thank you.

178
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,670
You are the first one to tell me this.

179
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,180
Thank you.

180
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,910
I know.

181
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,219
In psychology, there is a concept and ritual called Loss and Mourning.

182
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:07,249
It refers to a process of dealing with loss, separation and grief.

183
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:10,029
During such a process, people can easily have

184
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,469
negative emotions, such as altercation, blame,

185
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,669
guilt, grief, and so on.

186
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,809
Once these emotions cannot be expressed or dealt with properly,

187
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:21,810
they are likely to affect people for the rest of their lives.

188
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,490
Does that mean I shouldn't have stopped

189
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,199
their altercations and anger?

190
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,329
How to part with close family members is a subject most people are reluctant to face.

191
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:36,310
But once such kind of emotion cannot be expressed,

192
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,500
it's very likely to turn into a kind of morbidity.

193
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,940
Therefore, as I see it,

194
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,250
when Jun Jun was gone, each of your family members

195
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,280
should be allowed to express your grief

196
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,880
and your negative emotions.

197
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,150
Flowers, plants,

198
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,519
and vegetables.

199
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,400
You are living a comfortable life.

200
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,149
It's good.

201
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,670
But it just seems something is missing.

202
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:18,150
I also often think something seems to be missing.

203
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,620
It is the fragrance of my tea that is missing.

204
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,330
Are we going to drink yours or mine?

205
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,080
Now that I'm here, of course we'll drink yours.

206
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,279
You've really picked a good place.

207
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,350
Come rain or shine,

208
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,349
you hunker down here to drink tea and look at the sky.

209
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:56,110
I spend more time looking at the earth.

210
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,130
Watching these things being planted

211
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,669
and slowly growing out again.

212
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,300
That's interesting.

213
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,190
One crop after another.

214
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,310
Just like people.

215
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,120
Over and over again.

216
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:20,950
You seemed to be taking things easy like this when you were a young man.

217
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,879
What's the point of being hasty?

218
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,670
Being too hasty or too radical

219
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,970
can easily make one trip and fall.

220
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:35,320
Later on, I often wondered if life would be any easier

221
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,970
had I slowed down my pace

222
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,280
and been less adventurous.

223
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,400
Then I figured it out.

224
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,470
Throughout a man's life,

225
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,439
from the moment he was born,

226
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,999
how much rice to eat, how many miles to walk and how much ease and comfort to enjoy,

227
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,860
these are all predestined.

228
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,439
What will come will always come.

229
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,420
Not one thing less.

230
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,230
You are the one who knows this best.

231
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,280
I do.

232
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,600
I'm even staying hidden here.

233
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,450
I can't stay away from disputes though.

234
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,030
Speaking of disputes,

235
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,760
how are you getting on with that thing?

236
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,230
Do you need help?

237
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,639
I can't lend a helping hand for things of the Psychological Society.

238
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:38,429
But I can get one or two media outlets to stick up for you.

239
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:41,140
It's not that I didn't want help.

240
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,029
That thing came so suddenly and seamlessly that

241
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,000
I didn't know how to work it out.

242
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,839
Forget it.

243
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,199
I'm getting old.

244
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,060
I want no more drama.

245
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,100
Let's just say I'm willing to take it lying down.

246
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,229
You seldom come to visit.

247
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,620
You are not just here to drink tea, are you?

248
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,980
Of course not.

249
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,230
Actually, I have a favor to ask.

250
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,640
Go ahead.

251
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,880
Help me find someone.

252
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:23,809
Let me hear the name of the man even you can't find in this world.

253
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,180
My wife.

254
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,790
Fu Tang.

255
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,719
Lili, although this restaurant is in a remote location,

256
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:44,300
it is the seafood restaurant with the best reputation in our City H.

257
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,830
I know. It's quite a famous restaurant.

258
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,259
Eat more later. Don't restrain yourself.

259
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,039
Mom, this is Lili.

260
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,960
- Lili.
- Hello, Auntie and Uncle.

261
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,879
What a pretty girl she is!

262
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,760
- Hello, Uncle, Auntie.

263
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,110
- Take a seat, take a seat.
- Hello, hello, hello.

264
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,449
Auntie, Uncle, I bought two pieces of clothes for you.

265
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:08,030
I don't know whether you'll like them or not.

266
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,519
- Thanks a lot. Thanks.
- There's even one piece for me.

267
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:10,799
It's very considerate of you.

268
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,829
Xiao Jin told me your sizes.

269
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,140
If they are wrong, people can come to your doorstep for an exchange.

270
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,159
Yes. vip.com offers convenient product exchange services.

271
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,150
Okay, all right.

272
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,859
By the way, Lili, I've also prepared a gift for you.

273
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:25,720
Be quick to open it and see if you like it.

274
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,999
Thank you, Auntie.

275
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,320
Quick.

276
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,499
Auntie, no, this is too costly. I can't take it.

277
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:32,879
It's not, it's not.

278
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,480
It's a little something for you.

279
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,739
It's the first time Xiao Jin has shown his girlfriend to us.

280
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:39,529
Early this morning, I was so happy that I became nervous.

281
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:42,189
Now I have an affinity with you.

282
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,159
Get along well with Xiao Jin.

283
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,140
If he makes you upset, just tell me and I'll teach him a lesson.

284
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,450
Mom, I won't.

285
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,260
- Auntie, but I really can't take this.
- Take it, take it. Its' not costly, not costly.

286
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,190
- Take it easy.
- It's okay. Take it.

287
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,889
- Be quick. Be quick to put it away. Be quick to put it away.
- Thank you, Auntie.

288
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,790
Excuse me, one more coconut chicken soup please.

289
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,559
This is a seafood restaurant. Why do you order chicken soup?

290
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,310
You know nothing. Don't bother.

291
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,880
It is good to have some chicken soup in this season.

292
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,460
It's good for your health.

293
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,440
Thank you, Auntie.

294
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,280
Lili, are your parents in City H?

295
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,059
Well, my mother is running a small grocery store here.

296
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:29,249
We don't live together, but I often go to see her.

297
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:30,980
There are only me and my mother in my family.

298
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,469
Really not easy for her.

299
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,560
Your mother must have endured a lot of hardships.

300
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,100
Xiao Jin, go and see her often in the coming days.

301
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,210
Take more care of her.

302
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,480
Here's the chicken soup.

303
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,780
Here's the chicken soup. Quick.

304
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,300
Here, Lili, help yourself while it's hot.

305
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,180
Thank you, Auntie.

306
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,540
Thank you, Auntie.

307
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,330
Professor.

308
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,519
You are out of breath.

309
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,770
Go in to have a glass of water first.

310
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,469
I have something to ask you.

311
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,189
You are in such a rush. What's the big deal?

312
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:39,350
It's about your personal affairs.

313
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,909
Is it because you are in a relationship that you begin to love gossips?

314
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,519
Fu Tang is Jiahui's mother.

315
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,560
Do you know that?

316
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,450
The look on your face shows you know.

317
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,979
Then why did you keep it a secret from us that you are Jiahui's adoptive father?

318
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,800
And pretend you didn't know him?

319
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:13,040
Who told you I'm Jiahui's adoptive father?

320
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,100
I'm not Jiahui's adoptive father,

321
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,879
and I'm even less likely to have sent Fu Tang to a psychiatric hospital.

322
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,190
What are you looking at?

323
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,060
[Ye Jiahui]

324
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,770
Why is it him again?

325
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,520
Why do you bring him up?

326
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,460
He Dun.

327
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,500
I've been looking for you for a long time.

328
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,229
I'm Ye Jiahui.

329
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,259
Same as you thought. Hope you'll trust me.

330
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:12,189
I study psychiatry to heal myself.

331
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,230
When I was seven, my mother abandoned me and left.

332
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,559
Mom… And she's never shown up again.

333
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,779
Why do I always feel I was already dead when I was seven?

334
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,070
His mother abandoned him when he was seven.

335
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,289
Mom! Don't go!

336
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:43,001
Mom! Mom!

337
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:46,230
Was that little boy Ye Jiahui?

338
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,860
[Mental hospital]
[F]

339
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,569
F's client file 99-00 Did this F use to be Li Yun's visitor before?

340
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:01,089
You are sending the file so early. Is it about a special case?

341
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,839
[Ji Mingcong]
On the sampling registration form I saw Professor Ji's name.

342
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,349
What happened to Jiahui is not that simple.

343
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:11,799
I will never provide any information about my visitor again.

344
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,159
Behind this there must be a bigger plot that lies hidden.

345
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:18,399
Everything you want to know is in here.

346
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,160
Who gave it to you? Shut up!

347
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,909
Fu Tang is the patient F Professor Ji has been secretly protecting and studying.

348
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:27,229
Who's this?

349
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,569
You often go to the sanatorium these days to see her, right?

350
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,400
Coincidentally, she also told me a story.

351
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,911
Do you have a child of your own?

352
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:40,270
- A son.
- Mom!

353
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,250
- He was only seven.
- Mom…

354
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,359
His adoptive father sent me to a psychiatric hospital.

355
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:51,800
Mom…

356
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,820
The two of us

357
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,760
have never met again.

358
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,590
My goodness. I'm completely dumbfounded.

359
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,290
They are not the same thing at all.

360
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,699
And are you sure they were telling the same story?

361
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:13,389
I'm sure. Because they mentioned the same person.

362
00:24:13,389 --> 00:24:15,130
My grandma has been in ill health these couple of years.

363
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,290
Now I'm working as a health consultant at the nursing home where she's staying,

364
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,210
so it's easier to take care of her.

365
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,180
I brought Jiahui up since he was a child.

366
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,299
Actually, Grandma Yun and I are not blood relations.

367
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:24,399
Grandma Yun?

368
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,759
The one we've seen before?

369
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,379
From that day on, Grandma Yun began to raise Jiahui as her own child.

370
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,799
What about that man?

371
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,349
Who is that man?

372
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:38,420
In Ye Jiahui's narrative, he doesn't seem to have mentioned that man.

373
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,450
This is also the thing that puzzles me a lot.

374
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,410
If we piece the two stories together, I think the truth would be…

375
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:50,280
Mom! Mom! Mom!

376
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:57,790
Mom! Mom! Mom!

377
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:01,210
His adoptive father sent me to a psychiatric hospital.

378
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,460
- The adoptive father.
- The adoptive father?

379
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,420
Exactly.

380
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,799
Jiahui's adoptive father was an eccentric man.

381
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,759
That's to say his mother did not abandon little Ye Jiahui

382
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:16,040
and was forcibly taken to a psychiatric hospital by his adoptive father?

383
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:20,970
But why does Ye Jiahui hate him so much?

384
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,589
Who is this man?

385
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,349
Is it Professor Ji?

386
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,849
No way. I believe in the professor.

387
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:30,359
So Jiahui's adoptive father as Fu Tang mentioned is definitely not the professor.

388
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:32,039
It should be someone else.

389
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,349
So mysterious.

390
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,150
No wonder I found nothing about his family background no matter how hard I tried back then.

391
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,810
[Adoptive Father?]

392
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,709
Who exactly is he?

393
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,630
Why does Jiahui conceal his identity?

394
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,900
Professor Ji is not your adoptive father, is he?

395
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,670
I've never said he is.

396
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,800
It's just that you think he is.

397
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,679
You didn't ask me to come today just for this, did you?

398
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,160
To keep defending Ji Mingcong?

399
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,109
You are thinking too much.

400
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,809
I asked you to come today out of care of a friend.

401
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,239
Do you think everybody in this world is an angel?

402
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:34,989
And all the problems can be solved with psychological counseling?

403
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:38,129
I got close to you to take revenge on Ji Mingcong.

404
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,280
I was just taking advantage of you.

405
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,730
Be it out of sincerity or exploitation,

406
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,149
I believe you must have a reason for doing what you did.

407
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,000
If you really only wanted to take revenge on him,

408
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,309
why didn't you just go to see him

409
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,560
instead of getting close to me and Li Yun with much ado?

410
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,680
Have you heard a saying that

411
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,660
"In order to hurt someone you must attack his soft underbelly"?

412
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,810
Are you doing it for the File on F?

413
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,929
If this is what you asked me to come here for today,

414
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:12,000
you are likely to be disappointed.

415
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,640
Everybody has a secret that one doesn't want others to know.

416
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,590
Aren't you the same?

417
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,080
I'll see you later.

418
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,160
You are looking for someone, aren't you?

419
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,050
Would you like to go and see her with me?

420
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,589
When did you begin to like candies?

421
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,830
Auntie Fu gave them to me last time.

422
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,759
Don't be angry anymore.

423
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,779
Since you've already come, don't pull a long face, all right?

424
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:59,160
Smile.

425
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,570
I'm worried about you seeing him alone.

426
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,799
What's there to be worried about?

427
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,779
I'm a living person, in broad daylight, what can he do to me?

428
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:07,399
I'm worried about you.

429
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,690
You like fussing over others' problems.

430
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,830
If in an unguarded moment I don't keep an eye on you, you'll drag yourself into it.

431
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,780
The thing is, since I've got to know

432
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,310
Auntie Fu is his mother, I can't just brush it aside, right?

433
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,370
I think you are just being soft on that brat.

434
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:27,869
No matter how tragic his past is, it can't be a reason for the mistakes he's made, right?

435
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:30,060
I didn't say I'll forgive him.

436
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,449
Just that I don't think anybody can stop him from seeing his mother.

437
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:38,579
But given Auntie Fu's current condition, can she recognize him?

438
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,680
I'm not sure about that.

439
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,130
I don't know whether she can recognize him or not.

440
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,799
Humanity is so strange.

441
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,999
If he does anything extreme, I can only protect you.

442
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:53,490
I won't be able to take care of Auntie Fu.

443
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,900
What extreme things can he do?

444
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:01,380
Don't worry. I've told him as long as Auntie Fu doesn't recognize him, he won't expose himself.

445
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,970
Did he agree?

446
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:11,259
To be frank, if I were him, I'd certainly have lots of questions.

447
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:12,810
But now I had to bottle them up.

448
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,519
He's having a hard time too.

449
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,949
He can't help it.

450
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:20,329
Given Auntie Fu's current health condition, she can't stand any shocks.

451
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:22,190
There's no better way.

452
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:27,689
What's more, to be frank, I'm not sure whether he'll come or not.

453
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,280
Let me have a look.

454
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,189
We are five minutes away from the agreed time.

455
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,690
I'm going to wait another five minutes with you.

456
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,959
If he doesn't show up, just go home with me obediently.

457
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:42,740
I'll do what you say.

458
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,980
Is this what she usually does?

459
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,159
Based on observations from the record,

460
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,739
she has improved a lot in controlling her emotions since she moved to the sanatorium.

461
00:30:51,739 --> 00:30:56,099
At least on the last two occasions of my visit, she looked quite happy.

462
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,159
She's been in therapy, but she still forgot a lot of things.

463
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,170
So she doesn't remember me now?

464
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,879
To say nothing of what she can remember,

465
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,909
as to her current situation, shouldn't we do something first to stop her?

466
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:23,709
There's nothing you can do now as long as she's not harming herself.

467
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:27,040
The only thing we can do now is to observe.

468
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,439
According to my observation, she must be looking for something.

469
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,050
Everybody can see that, all right?

470
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,069
What's she looking for?

471
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,100
I don't know.

472
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,260
If she knows what she's looking for,

473
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,280
maybe some of her memories have come back.

474
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,709
I found it.

475
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,470
I found it!

476
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,570
Auntie Fu.

477
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,430
What have you found?

478
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,130
A drawing.

479
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,380
What drawing?

480
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,679
Could you bring it over for us to have a look together?

481
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,550
I know who you are.

482
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,980
You know who I am?

483
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,380
Do they

484
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,210
both like you?

485
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:30,369
A-Auntie Fu, aren't you going to show us the drawing?

486
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,170
The drawing you are holding…

487
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,210
I've thought of a game.

488
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,709
Let's play it together.

489
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,310
All right.

490
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,290
Let's play it together too,

491
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,220
Okay?

492
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,189
What do you need me to do?

493
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,370
Acting.

494
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,440
Acting out what I say.

495
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,840
Okay.

496
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,330
Don't move.

497
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,469
I told you not to move.

498
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,760
I can't agree to this relationship.

499
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,329
The two of them fell for each other when they met for the first time.

500
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:46,010
Is that love at first sight?

501
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,149
What's wrong with love at first sight?

502
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,040
I think it's quite good.

503
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,420
Do you have a different opinion on this setting?

504
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,710
I have no objection to this setting.

505
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,039
But I think I… can better inhabit the role.

506
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,629
You see, he keeps getting stuck.

507
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,620
If I were him, I could inhabit the role in a second.

508
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,520
Do you also want to swap your role?

509
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,359
What exactly is the man I'm playing like?

510
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,490
Like a mountain.

511
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,430
Like a mountain?

512
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,469
Why do you say that?

513
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,440
Like a mountain, he's steady,

514
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,360
stubborn, and unshakeable.

515
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:31,660
Like a mountain, he rejects no dirt or dust.

516
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,280
I will not move.

517
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,900
Go on drawing.

518
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,279
Why don't you talk?

519
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,429
Didn't you ask me not to move?

520
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,330
You can move your lips.

521
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,330
Tell me what was going on?

522
00:35:55,330 --> 00:36:00,089
The Psychological Society approved my application and I went there on short notice for a meeting.

523
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:03,899
Was that nuisance society more important than me?

524
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,799
I called the housekeeper in advance to say I'd be late.

525
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,999
Did you tell me that?

526
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,010
Did I say okay?

527
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,490
So didn't I rush here

528
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,620
as soon as the meeting was over?

529
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,739
Come down.

530
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:29,010
You've finished it so soon?

531
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,570
It's not hard.

532
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,189
Aren't you playing favorites?

533
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,619
Haven't you arranged a childhood sweetheart role for me?

534
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:12,220
When will it be my turn?

535
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,949
I can't wait.

536
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,860
What's the rush?

537
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,870
It's your turn now.

538
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,090
He's an ambitious man.

539
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:31,200
He has undivided attention and is never distracted.

540
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,730
We grew up together.

541
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:37,949
I don't think there would be someone else

542
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,280
who knows him better than I do.

543
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,570
This is supposed to be their first encounter.

544
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:56,519
Back then I didn't expect there'd be so many stories that had yet to happen.

545
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,220
No, no.

546
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,189
You guys don't know each other yet.

547
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,039
Then have we met before?

548
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,319
As you know, he's a psychological counselor brought in by the girl's family.

549
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:14,319
What about him?

550
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,530
What's his attitude to me?

551
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:24,260
He… has heard nothing about you.

552
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,380
I'm his love rival anyway.

553
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,350
He doesn't even know who I am.

554
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,919
Maybe the man I'm playing has been thinking nothing of you from start to finish.

555
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,900
Didn't you just say you are a good actor?

556
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,279
Don't bring in your personal feelings.

557
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,409
- Keep it up.
- I can't do that.

558
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,900
I said long before now that you are going to make it.

559
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,820
Why do you always have so much faith in me?

560
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,570
Do I have a good eye?

561
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,720
Yes.

562
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,620
You have a very good eye.

563
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,820
Will I be cured if I take this?

564
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,159
This is the thing the man has been doing with the greatest sense of urgency

565
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:15,330
for his beloved woman over the past eight years.

566
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,480
But now…

567
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,770
There's only one step away from curing her.

568
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,729
Maybe he's just afraid there'll be something wrong with the medicine.

569
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:28,009
When he's doing anything, if he thinks too much and only cares about loss and gain,

570
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:29,629
he'll only have more to lose.

571
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,119
You are not him after all.

572
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,720
For a man like him, no matter how eager he is,

573
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,050
he's used to waiting.

574
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,520
So guess what he'll say next?

575
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,940
Not now.

576
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,010
Why?

577
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,360
Now the medicine is still in Phase 2 of clinical trials.

578
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,279
It hasn't got the official approval document yet.

579
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,950
Then I'll...

580
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,900
try it first.

581
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,500
Let's wait a bit more, all right?

582
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,770
I'm not yet 100% sure.

583
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:08,149
I promise you it'll be a success soon.

584
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,660
All right?

585
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,900
It'll be a success soon.

586
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,290
I'll keep it with me.

587
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,840
No.

588
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,790
We've agreed

589
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,999
that the first pill you make

590
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,300
will be given to me as a gift.

591
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,180
All right then.

592
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,380
I promise you.

593
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,220
But can I keep it for you for the moment?

594
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,700
When I get the official approval document, I'll give it to you as soon as I can.

595
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,290
Okay?

596
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,230
I don't want it.

597
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,389
Look at you.

598
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,470
Why are you angry again?

599
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,940
Let's do it this way.

600
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,599
I don't want your gift.

601
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,740
Let's make a deal.

602
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,799
Don't you always want me to draw a painting for you?

603
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,290
Now I'll draw it for you.

604
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:13,280
But this little pill

605
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,970
must be kept with me.

606
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,080
Jiahui, you are here.

607
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,229
Come on in.

608
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,050
I have something for you.

609
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,080
This… This is hers.

610
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,230
Do you have anything else to say?

611
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,700
- I'm going if you don't.
- Jiahui.

612
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,669
I've cooked some food.

613
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:37,000
If you are not busy…

614
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,140
