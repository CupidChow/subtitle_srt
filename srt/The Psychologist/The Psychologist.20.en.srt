If you're looking for more psychological help,

you could go to the official website of Night Talk to Your Heart.

44
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,529
There's a phone number of the exclusive hotline for the Counseling Office.

45
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:18,819
Brother Qian, You've got a lot of telephone inquiries lately.

46
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,879
We've received lots of inquiries from the audience of Say No.

47
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,390
They all wanted to consult with He Dun.

48
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,209
This call was from an audience member, too.

49
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,849
He asked for contact information for free psychological counseling.

50
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:32,899
He said his son refused to talk to anyone since childhood.

51
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:34,489
He probably has psychological problems.

52
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:37,639
But... they are not rich enough for psychological counseling.

53
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,399
Brother Qian, is it possible for the Counseling Office

54
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:43,699
to cooperate with non-profit organizations?

55
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,300
We can offer help for those in need.

56
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,190
Actually, I've asked He Dun the same question.

57
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,630
The problem is...

58
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,799
Before the establishment of counseling,

59
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:56,299
we have to set up a standard rule for both sides.

60
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:58,499
But if the counseling is free, the visitor

61
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,930
would lack the power of changing himself,

62
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,500
which would weaken the effect of counseling.

63
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,369
Some visitors would break an appointment or refuse to cooperate with us.

64
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:07,170
There'll be lots of problems like these.

65
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,659
So that's why they would rather counsel at a low price.

66
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:17,599
Miao, is it technologically difficult to build an Information Transferring Centre?

67
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:20,639
No. We could just develop a web page, make an application or an app,

68
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,670
a Tencent Official Account to be more simple.

69
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,769
I see. Brother Qian, you mean...

70
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,200
We can build a bridge between them,

71
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,649
and help the visitors who need psychological counseling

72
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,320
get in touch with the counselors.

73
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,989
At present, the quantity of visitors exceeds that of the counselors.

74
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,099
Maybe we could make someone the Heart Messenger

75
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:48,440
from the Night Talk to Your Heart and encourage more counselors to join us.

76
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,969
I'm going make a list of the counselors available now.

77
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:54,880
That's really helpful for our audiences.

78
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,669
- I'll be responsible for the customer service.
- I'll make the application.

79
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:01,790
I'll... I'll be wherever I'm needed.

80
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,340
- That's funny.
- Stop it!

81
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,510
Look at the photo.

82
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,600
It's silly.

83
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,139
- Miss Zhan.
- Miss He.

84
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,270
This is our first counseling session.

85
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,529
I might be asking and giving you a lot of questions and suggestions.

86
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:35,119
During this process, I'll write down all of them.

87
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:38,020
You could tell me to stop if there's anything wrong.

88
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,579
You kept looking at your watch. Is there any problem?

89
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,429
Excuse me, I have to go and pick up my daughter at 5.

90
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:50,700
I understand.

91
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,669
The counseling will last about 50 minutes.

92
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:56,249
We'll finish before 3:20 pm. Is that all right?

93
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:58,510
Yes, that will give me enough time.

94
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,269
Good. Let's get it started.

95
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:03,450
I want to ask you a question first.

96
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,269
Why do you want to have psychological counseling?

97
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:08,790
I...

98
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,470
I think...

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,110
I'm not in a good state.

100
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,610
Why do you say that?

101
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,850
I wanted to...

102
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,480
I wanted to hurt my son.

103
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,650
That was merely your imagination.

104
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,509
You only tried to do that in your mind, right?

105
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,450
Have you planned for it seriously?

106
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,720
No, I haven't.

107
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,309
It kept popping up in my mind. I don't know why.

108
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:19,200
I'm really afraid that I would...

109
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,710
I would actually do it one day.

110
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,099
I understand how you feel.

111
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,500
You are really anxious now.

112
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,209
But that doesn't mean you're going do it.

113
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:34,200
We have lots of ideas every day.

114
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,500
Perhaps this is not the most terrible one,

115
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,550
but the one which worries you the most.

116
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,279
If we want to know what makes you want to hurt him,

117
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,330
we must know why you're anxious, and what you really need.

118
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,490
This is very important.

119
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,230
We could make an assumption.

120
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,279
If you and your son's lives are threatened,

121
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,220
what do you think you'll be like?

122
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,730
I think... One finished, all is finished.

123
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,930
Maybe I could go back to my old life.

124
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,560
He was an accident.

125
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,450
But now I'm…

126
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,070
I can't bear it anymore.

127
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:20,139
It looks like you are not happy with your son's birth.

128
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:23,309
What life changes occurred after your son's birth?

129
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:26,720
The things that you want to finish, what are they?

130
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,010
Come in. Come in, please.

131
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,350
Have a look at my grandson.

132
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,810
After he was born my mother-in-law was really excited.

133
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:41,009
She liked to bring lots of people home regardless

134
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:46,140
of my awkwardness of being nursing.

135
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,989
She always took the baby away in front of all the people.

136
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:52,299
She just wanted to make a fool of me.

137
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,539
They would think I'm not a good mother.

138
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,839
I was just a free baby-sitter.

139
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,480
When my husband arrived home he just acted like he was looking after the baby.

140
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,089
Actually, he only cared about the football games.

141
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:10,880
There was one time, I'd just finished cleaning the floor.

142
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,660
It hadn't been a while before my mother-in-law yelled at me and asked me to cook dinner.

143
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,870
She just can't stand me having a break.

144
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,439
- My husband urged me for the dinner. The moment I started cooking he's calling for me.
- Lulu.

145
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:24,659
Lulu, is the dinner ready?

146
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:28,029
Was I the one to blame for everyone in the world not being able to

147
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:30,270
have dinner on time?

148
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,090
All right, you go finish up.

149
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,860
My life is full of these kinds of things.

150
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,180
I can't stand it anymore.

151
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,550
I can't see an end of this hopeless life.

152
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,890
No one can help me.

153
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,850
Miss He, no one can help me.

154
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,330
Before I came here, my mind had always gone blank.

155
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,220
And when I realized,

156
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,450
my face had been completely wet with tears.

157
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,279
You must be experiencing postpartum depression.

158
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,519
Remember the form you've just filled in?

159
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,480
This is a form of Edinburgh's postnatal depression scale.

160
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,670
You feel upset and self-condemned

161
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,299
for most of the life scenes mentioned is this scale in this scale.

162
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:38,470
One is evaluated as postpartum depressive

163
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,280
if she gets a total point of more than 13.

164
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,960
And you, you got 21 points.

165
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,230
I heard about it in the past.

166
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,050
But I never know I would be postpartum depressive.

167
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,399
Now you don't have to be worried.

168
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,659
Postpartum depression is actually quite common.

169
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:07,600
But it wasn't taken seriously before.

170
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,309
There are 15 million new mothers in China every year.

171
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:14,969
Sixty to eighty percent of them

172
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:20,159
are depressive to some extent during or after the perinatal period.

173
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,179
Only up to 20 percent would develop into postpartum depression.

174
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:26,949
More than 10 million new mothers are unhappy every year.

175
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:28,610
- More than 10 million?
- That's right.

176
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,740
You are not alone.

177
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,609
I want to have counseling.

178
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,639
Counseling? What counseling?

179
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,440
Psychological counseling.

180
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,650
Miss He.

181
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:46,870
Will they think I'm just being captious if I tell them about this disease?

182
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,619
I have a sense that my husband and his mother...

183
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:51,639
They've been looking at me like that the whole time.

184
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,739
No, they won't. This disease has a scientific basis.

185
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:58,759
Postpartum depression is related to the hormone levels

186
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,229
in your body, and the stress reaction

187
00:12:01,229 --> 00:12:03,789
caused by the great change of your life after the baby was born.

188
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,549
But believe me, I will be there for you all this time,

189
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:12,009
surveying and evaluating the level of your postpartum depression.

190
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:15,440
If your condition gets worse, I'll help you transfer to the psychiatry department

191
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,289
for drug therapy, which can ease your pain.

192
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:20,769
All right.

193
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:26,419
You know what, everyone would have a cognitive triad under great depression.

194
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:27,669
What is a cognitive triad?

195
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:29,640
The cognitive triad is,

196
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,930
in simple terms, one's cognition of the self,

197
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,690
the environment

198
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,970
and the future.

199
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,519
For example, I'm not good.

200
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,320
I'm not in my right mind.

201
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,420
Nobody can help me.

202
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,589
No one can help me.

203
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:58,999
I don't have any hope for the future.

204
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:01,080
I don't have a future.

205
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,030
[Ego Environment Future]
But what you think is not true.

206
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,429
Believe me, you will surely be better as your hormonal readiness gets stable.

207
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:17,350
And I will face the problems together with you.

208
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,960
Don't take too much each time.

209
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,660
There's a side effect.

210
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,930
Only take it when you can't control yourself.

211
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,950
Well... Does it really work?

212
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,060
You'll have to try it.

213
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,130
Thank you, Brother Fei.

214
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,480
In fact, every time I get out of Miss He's office, I feel like

215
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,120
I'm much better now.

216
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,100
She was really patient with me.

217
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,710
- So I'm thinking—
- She can't cure you.

218
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,470
If she can, why are you still emotionally unstable after so many counselings?

219
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,000
But Miss He said psychological counseling is a long-term process.

220
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,600
Don't you want to be cured sooner?

221
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,309
Some things are not what they look like.

222
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,150
What things?

223
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,100
You'll find out later.

224
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,239
Brother Fei! Brother...

225
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,500
You know what, Miss He...

226
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,219
Every time I wanted to hurt my son, I felt like I was the murderer in movies.

227
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,300
I didn't know if...

228
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,219
I didn't know if I was... really mad.

229
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:12,309
It's normal for you to feel that way.

230
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:16,569
People tend to have suicidal thoughts when they are in a depressed mood.

231
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:19,579
The thought of ending all of these... the baby, and themselves…

232
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:21,450
That happens.

233
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,280
Does it?

234
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,689
It does.

235
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:29,309
You don't have to worry about this idea of yours.

236
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:32,909
Actually, maybe we can dig a little deeper around this idea.

237
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:36,700
This might help us understand it better.

238
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,479
So, Zhan Lu, could you tell me,

239
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:43,910
under what circumstances would the idea of hurting your son come up a lot?

240
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,929
Why is Yezi still in the painting class? She doesn't need that.

241
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:51,719
She's not gonna be an artist anyway. Stop wasting the money on her.

242
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,970
Don't you think so?

243
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,359
Yezi, what are you doing?

244
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:58,079
How many times have I told you not to mess with your brother?

245
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,670
Never mess with your brother!

246
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,330
- My baby boy!
- It's all right.

247
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,869
- My baby boy!
- Grandma, I'm sorry.

248
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:06,639
- You nasty girl!
- Mommy.

249
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,199
Don't cry.

250
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:14,329
So you are worried that your daughter will suffer unfair treatment.

251
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:19,850
Miss He, you know, my mother-in-law has a strong preference for sons.

252
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:23,769
I don't want my daughter living in an environment like this and being hurt.

253
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:26,600
I have to protect her.

254
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,250
What do you think your daughter's going be like

255
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,080
if she was wronged by her grandma?

256
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,840
She must feel terrible.

257
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,919
She certainly wouldn't have the good personality she has now.

258
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,979
It could affect her for life.

259
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:47,099
So you're afraid that her grandma's preference for boys would hurt her.

260
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:49,280
I'd been hurt like that before.

261
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,839
I can't even recover until now.

262
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:56,769
You know the pain because you'd been there.

263
00:16:56,769 --> 00:17:01,010
So whenever you're worried that her grandma's preference for boys would hurt her,

264
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,319
the idea of hurting your son would be more likely to show up.

265
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,170
I'm not a good mother

266
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,020
to any of them.

267
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,040
I'm sorry!

268
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,880
I'm starting it again.

269
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,269
It's fine. You can release yourself completely here.

270
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,050
Why don't we take a different angle?

271
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,730
Under what circumstances

272
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,310
would the idea of not hurting you and your son come up?

273
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,049
Mommy,

274
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:46,020
you've got a white hair.

275
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,000
Mommy is getting old.

276
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,470
Mommy.

277
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,480
Could you stay young like this forever if I take care of you?

278
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,590
I won't get old as long as you behave yourself.

279
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,710
Have you behaved yourself?

280
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,230
I have.

281
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,560
Grandma, I saw a big snail downstairs just now.

282
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,510
- It's really big!
- Really?

283
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,950
Go with me and have a look! Come on! And Sister Grandma, too!

284
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,140
No, I'm holding your brother.

285
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,000
Come on!

286
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,660
Let's go and have a look. She's such a lovely girl.

287
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,830
All right, all right. I'll go.

288
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,419
Here. Hold him.

289
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,470
Let's go.

290
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,970
Mommy.

291
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,780
Are you sick?

292
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,060
Mommy. Don't cry.

293
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,910
Stop crying. Look, I'm not crying. Don't cry, all right.

294
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,159
So when your daughter is happy and healthy,

295
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:36,249
or when she's being protective of you,

296
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:41,009
the thought of hurting you and your son would gradually decrease.

297
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,899
Yes. Sorry, Miss He, I'm out of time.

298
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:48,430
I have to pick up my daughter from school. I'm really grateful.

299
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,940
It's all right. Let's call it a day.

300
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,760
By the way, Miss He,

301
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,109
I think my daughter has given me a lot of mental strength.

302
00:19:57,109 --> 00:20:01,059
Perhaps she's not as fragile as I thought.

303
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,400
Your daughter must be really lovely. She loves you.

304
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,810
Yes. And I'm happy. Thank you.

305
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,350
Bye.

306
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,139
- I'll come here earlier and pick you up today.
- All right.

307
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:17,269
It's a rebellious time for kids... The rebellious phase is coming early these days.

308
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:18,840
- That's true.
- What time is it?

309
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,769
It's almost time now. You're going to be late.

310
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:23,280
Come on! Hurry up. Be a good student.

311
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,790
- Don't mess with your classmates.
- Okay.
- Go! Go!

312
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,669
- Slowly!
- Okay.
- Bye bye.

313
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:29,849
- Bye bye.
- It would be a great help for his ability of self-correcting in the future.

314
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:31,749
If the kid is not interested in the subject, he would not listen to the teacher.

315
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:35,669
This week Zhang Hanyi got the greatest progress.

316
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:37,400
Excuse me, Miss Liu,

317
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,119
I'm Yezi's mother. How has Yezi's been doing in class recently?

318
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,779
Well, we were doing the daily quizzes this week.

319
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,870
After each quiz, the kids went back home and finished the electronic error question bank

320
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,679
with their parents.

321
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,979
We've been doing this for a week. Your daughter is the only one who hadn't finished it.

322
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,349
I see.

323
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:54,489
I'll fix that when I get back.

324
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:57,330
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

325
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,279
Miss Liu, I'd like to sign up for a hobby class for my son Tian Tian.

326
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:03,889
Do you have any recommendations?

327
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:06,080
You can sign up here at school.

328
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,600
Here, take a look.

329
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,420
Look at her! She's peeing her pants!

330
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,039
She's an adult who peed her pants.

331
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,400
I don't even pee my pants anymore.

332
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,410
- That's it for today.
- All right?

333
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,630
Go to the classroom.

334
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,000
- Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

335
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,350
Don't you come over!

336
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,740
Mommy!

337
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,360
Mommy!

338
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,330
I told you to go back to your classroom.

339
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,179
Hello, are you here for counseling?

340
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,330
I'm here for Tang Lili.

341
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,200
She's out on business. Do you want to leave a message?

342
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,180
I'll give it to her.

343
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,040
No, thank you.

344
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,130
I just wanted to make sure how is she getting along recently.

345
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,530
It's a nice house.

346
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,230
Did you buy it?

347
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,850
How may I address you?

348
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,710
Call me Tong Yao.

349
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,640
Tong Yao.

350
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,900
You and Lili are...

351
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,020
We're kind of friends.

352
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,760
Excuse me, I've never heard about you.

353
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,830
It's all right, that happens.

354
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,570
Everyone has something that no one knows.

355
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,160
We call it a secret.

356
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,050
Don't you think so?

357
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,630
Looks like she's not coming back very soon.

358
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,439
Well, bye for now.

359
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,170
Zhongyi.

360
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,560
Thank you.

361
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,480
For what?

362
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,430
Thank you for all the things you've done for me.

363
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,549
Thank you for helping my mother with the store.

364
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:03,829
You know what? My mother's so busy with the store that she seldom plays mahjong now.

365
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,000
That's nothing. It's only a store.

366
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,040
You're no longer worrying about her.

367
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,020
That's all that matters.

368
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,900
What's wrong?

369
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,980
It's He Dun. I don't know how to reply.

370
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,400
What did she say?

371
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,199
She said a woman named Tong Yao was there for me.

372
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:37,470
She asked if she was my friend.

373
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,930
Do you think she's just here for a talk?

374
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,350
Don't reply if you haven't.

375
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,430
Leave her some time to figure it out.

376
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,070
To be honest, you haven't made it up yet.

377
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,459
Being too friendly would reinforce your conflict.

378
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:53,181
Being too polite would put more distance between the two of you.

379
00:26:53,181 --> 00:26:56,040
You don't want to be friends who contact each other only when you're in trouble, right?

380
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,880
Of course not!

381
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,610
You've got a point.

382
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,130
Words can't express my heart.

383
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,820
It's going be awkward.

384
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,950
I should talk to her in person.

385
00:27:10,841 --> 00:27:14,040
How could you be so familiar with the girls' thoughts?

386
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,450
Sounds like you're really good at comforting girls.

387
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,630
I thought you were one of those who wouldn't be curious about someone's past.

388
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,150
I wasn't curious at all.

389
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,830
Until you said what you said.

390
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,321
Haven't I told you everything when we first met?

391
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:47,410
That's right, I've had a couple of girlfriends until I met you.

392
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,679
Now I just want to settle down and have a life with you.

393
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,880
Why? Want to be a good boy again?

394
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,410
You know what?

395
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:07,290
When I was little, I used to fantasize about my dad giving me away at my wedding.

396
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:11,659
He took my hand and gave me to the one I love.

397
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:16,230
But? That will never happen now.

398
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,999
But if my dad knew there would be a man who is so nice to me,

399
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:24,330
he's going be so happy.

400
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,250
What's the matter?

401
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,660
I'm thinking...

402
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,410
I will give you the best wedding in the world.

403
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,600
You're going like it so much.

404
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,030
I thought you wouldn't want to.

405
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,950
Nonsense!

406
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:20,660
Well, we've just talked about the problems new parents would face in the program.

407
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,100
Miss He, let me ask you something. Is it true that all the new mothers

408
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,419
have to deal with postpartum depression?

409
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:30,329
Well, the incidence of postpartum depression is actually very high.

410
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:32,530
Especially for new mothers.

411
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:36,299
It's quite common for them to have mild postpartum symptoms, like anxiety, or depression.

412
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:38,260
But that is as normal as us catching a cold.

413
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,849
If we can give them plenty of love and care

414
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:42,109
during the depression, their bad mood

415
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:44,740
will probably be over in a couple of weeks.

416
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,500
But if we don't see the problems they're facing,

417
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,459
they'll be very likely to turn into severe postpartum depression.

418
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:54,640
Actually, there's another thing I want to say.

419
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,080
Not only might the new mothers

420
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,760
the novice fathers would also have a certain chance

421
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,369
of being afflicted by postpartum depression.

422
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:05,060
Right. So during the perinatal period,

423
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,259
every family member should give each other more love and care.

424
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:11,350
Especially for the new parents.

425
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,229
The companionship and support from other family members is very important.

426
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,769
It can significantly reduce the incidence of postpartum depression.

427
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:20,949
So that is the problems that new parents are going to have.

428
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:25,369
Would that be different for families welcoming their second babies?

429
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:27,560
No, it would not. This is actually a misconception.

430
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,800
In fact, the incidence of depression is higher for pregnant women expecting their second babies.

431
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,289
Comparing with the first time, they have more pressure at this time

432
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:37,239
because of the change of family structure they're facing.

433
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:39,130
They need to be...

434
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,470
Professor Ji.

435
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,710
This is...

436
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,050
This is the only one left.

437
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,829
A gentleman does not take away others' love.

438
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:21,930
This is far from love. Just take it.

439
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,930
I'm not destined for this book.

440
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,190
I've got three of them in the past. Not a single one was left.

441
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,900
Thank you for your kindness.

442
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,640
Maybe you should keep it.

443
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,850
I saw one at He Dun's house. Was that...

444
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,660
Books on loan are like water split.

445
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,310
One book is with my student. One with my colleague.

446
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,050
And the last one...

447
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,370
It's getting late. We'll talk later.

448
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,950
- I'll drive you home.
- No, thank you.

449
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,690
Exercises like walking are good for me.

450
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,100
I was too busy to treat you properly last time.

451
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,049
Thank you for not blaming me, and this book.

452
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:06,290
Xiao He is lucky to have such a good neighbor.

453
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,310
I'm happy for her.

454
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,530
Miss He's teacher is like my teacher.

455
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,960
Well, are you in a relationship?

456
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,680
No, not like that.

457
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,700
I'm just interested in psychology.

458
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,530
I'm trying to cotton up with you.

459
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,280
Maybe you can help me in the future.

460
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,070
You want to buy me off with a book?

461
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,050
I'm afraid that's not going work.

462
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:33,559
He Dun takes everything far too seriously.

463
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:36,899
She'd even forget about meals when she's busy.

464
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:39,849
She's got a quick temper, easily offends others.

465
00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:41,780
Like we said, far water does not put out near fire.

466
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:47,029
If she's in trouble, could you help her?

467
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:48,310
She is my friend.

468
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,270
That's the least I can do.

469
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,880
Come to my house sometime.

470
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,100
I'll cook.

471
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,860
Meal fee?

472
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,680
Fine.

473
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,430
It's a deal.

474
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,860
[Garden Coffee House]

475
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,560
Are you looking for someone?

476
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,190
Uncle, is Sister He Dun here?

477
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,410
She's not here. Brother Qian Kaiyi is here.

478
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,070
What's the matter?

479
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,419
My mommy is a big fan of their program.

480
