18
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,990
Ms. Zhao, have some tea.

19
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,770
Thanks.

20
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,690
Would you like to tell me why you want

21
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,290
psychological counseling recently?

22
00:01:58,457 --> 00:02:01,287
I have a knot in my heart

23
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:05,615
that hasn't been untied for so many years.

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,970
I'd like to know details.

25
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,110
May… May I have another cup of water?

26
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,750
Thanks.

27
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,090
I have a younger brother called Jun Jun.

28
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,050
He died at the age of eight.

29
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:40,010
It was an accident, but I always felt

30
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,479
it was me who killed him.

31
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,039
That year, I was just 13 years old.

32
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,680
One day, we had an argument.

33
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,260
I slammed the door and went out.

34
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,960
My brother always followed me.

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,089
Sister, I don't like you anymore.

36
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,780
Mom doesn't like you, neither does Dad.

37
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,680
Fine, I'm leaving now. I won't annoy you anymore. Is that okay?

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,020
Sister, where are you going? I don't know the way here.

39
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,760
Jun Jun! Jun Jun!

40
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,980
Sister.

41
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,009
Help me, Sister.

42
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,040
Sister.

43
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,460
I still remember the image

44
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,370
while yelling in the water,

45
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,250
"Help me, Sister."

46
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,959
Miss Wen, do you think I was the murderer?

47
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,569
If I hadn't argued with him,

48
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,999
If my mom had saved him first, instead of me

49
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:50,370
my brother wouldn't have died. Is it right?

50
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:56,470
Over the past years, I have been sorry for my brother.

51
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,879
You think your brother fell into the water because of you

52
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,199
and your mom couldn't save him

53
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,130
because of saving you first,

54
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,070
- so you feel regretful, right?
- Yes.

55
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,739
You felt powerless when seeing your brother being washed away.

56
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:13,040
110.

57
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,600
Ms. Zhao, relax.

58
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,570
Close you eyes. 100.

59
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,019
Smell the air and describe your feelings.

60
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,210
What's the smell?

61
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,749
Is it sandalwood?

62
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:27,720
Yes. 90.

63
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,909
Touch the sofa carefully and describe its texture.

64
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:32,019
How does it feel?

65
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:34,090
It's cloth.

66
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,849
80.

67
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:38,150
Very crude.

68
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,630
60.

69
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,540
Ms. Zhao, it took great courage

70
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,200
to speak out the experience, right?

71
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,470
Now the danger has passed.

72
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,140
You're in a safe and comfortable counseling office,

73
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,980
instead of in the river, right?

74
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,900
Do you feel relieved?

75
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,639
Yes.

76
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,120
That's great.

77
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,420
After that accident, have your life, work or social contact been influenced?

78
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,420
Of course.

79
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,030
For example,

80
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,340
I always had nightmares.

81
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,210
What were they mostly about?

82
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,129
Mom. Jun Jun.

83
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,789
My brother called me in the water.

84
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:26,590
I dreamed of him at intervals.

85
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,799
Every time I woke up, I was very scared.

86
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,300
I always felt my brother

87
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,600
was still alive.

88
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,349
This feeling is the same as that when the accident happened,

89
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:42,230
as if bringing you back to the scene, right?

90
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,750
Then anything else unusual?

91
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,900
I'm also

92
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,230
very afraid

93
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,020
of an enclosed place.

94
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,460
Once I enter it, I feel like I'm out of breath.

95
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,970
Ms. Zhao, there is no window that can be opened here.

96
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,530
Are you afraid?

97
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,370
A little bit.

98
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,350
But this room is quite big.

99
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,500
Besides, you're here.

100
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,070
Have a cup of hot tea to ease your tension.

101
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,150
Cold and moist.

102
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,269
How long does the dyspnea you mentioned usually last?

103
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:41,230
At most, over ten minutes.

104
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:46,589
What makes you afraid and uncomfortable in the enclosed space?

105
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:48,300
Water.

106
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,160
After my brother died,

107
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,959
I couldn't even dare to see water.

108
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,940
That means in the enclosed space, you feel you're in the water, right?

109
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,640
Yes.

110
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,800
When did the symptoms you mentioned just now happen for the first time?

111
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,170
Two or three months

112
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,690
after my brother died.

113
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,900
That accident happened when you were thirteen years old.

114
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,620
You've never sought for help in over 40 years, right?

115
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,919
Then, there was no psychological counselor.

116
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,520
Besides, I didn't want others to know my pains.

117
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,880
If my daughter hadn't asked me to come here this time,

118
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,930
I perhaps wouldn't have had the courage.

119
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,390
Let's eat.

120
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,260
Why did you eat first?

121
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,740
Xiao Qian, thanks for your and Jiahui's help today.

122
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,999
Don't mention it, Professor.

123
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,929
As He Dun's best friend of opposite gender,

124
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,439
I take you as my own teacher.

125
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,200
Feel free to call me if you need help. I'll come instantly.

126
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,330
- You're so kind.
- What a sycophant!

127
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,270
I prepared this meal in a hurry today.

128
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,639
Next time, I'll prepare a feast for you.

129
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,959
Sit down.

130
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,500
This is good enough. Eat it now.

131
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,710
Yeah, we're close.

132
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,240
Don't be so polite.

133
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,820
I've heard of you from He Dun.

134
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,339
I didn't expect that you were so lively.

135
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:21,980
I listened to the Night Talk to Your Heart. It's a good program.

136
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,199
Thanks for your praise.

137
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,369
Such achievements are accredited to Miss He.

138
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,550
Professor, have you listened to our program?

139
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,680
Of course. You're my student, so I need to support you.

140
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,330
I've seen Jiahui before.

141
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,520
He's not only erudite, but also competent in life.

142
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,059
I'm flattered. You're much more erudite than me.

143
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:43,910
I'm just a teacher. Let's eat.

144
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,710
Professor, did you catch this chicken just now?

145
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,030
Did you really think I had stewed the chicken?

146
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,620
I took it out of the fridge. Only three legs; each of you has one.

147
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,730
I won't eat it. I did nothing just now, after all.

148
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,150
Don't say that. I'm a latecomer. I won't eat it.

149
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,729
Youths should eat meat.

150
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,980
- How old are you, Jiahui?
- He Dun, eat.

151
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,350
I was born in 1991.

152
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,470
In the Year of the Goat?

153
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,960
Yes.

154
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,690
What's up, Professor?

155
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,110
So you're a year older than He Dun.

156
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,540
Yes.

157
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,180
I was born in the Year of the Monkey. Dun Dun is my age.

158
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,380
What did you call me?

159
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,420
Xiao Qian, where did you come from?

160
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,609
The Wenchang Street.

161
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,130
I had an appointment with He Dun to meet the elders

162
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,860
who looked after me when I was a child.

163
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,049
So have I disturbed your plan?

164
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,610
No.

165
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,440
One should respect his teacher as he does his father.

166
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,199
I always heard of you from He Dun.

167
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,560
- So I've long wanted to visit you.
- When did I…

168
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,100
Enough.

169
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,210
The more, the merrier.

170
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,860
You all live alone,

171
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,439
so you got to pay attention to your diet.

172
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,859
Just take my home as your own home from now on.

173
00:10:56,859 --> 00:11:00,009
Tell me what you want to eat, and then I'll make it for you.

174
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:02,060
Professor, you're so biased.

175
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,620
You've never told this to me.

176
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,959
If you're ashamed, bring her with you

177
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,390
to make this place more alive.

178
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,530
- Then I'll often come here for meals.
- All right!

179
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,350
Make yourself at home.

180
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,830
My garden finally becomes alive.

181
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,830
Let's eat.

182
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,970
Please calm down.

183
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,540
Here is a form to be filled out.

184
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,440
Re-experience the traumatic accident.

185
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,029
I'm very afraid of an enclosed place.

186
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:46,319
- Once I enter it, I feel like I'm out of breath.
- High arousal.

187
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:50,149
After my brother died, I couldn't even dare to see water.

188
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,860
Avoid.

189
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,500
Miss Wen,

190
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,350
I've told you what I want to say today.

191
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,380
What do you think is wrong with me?

192
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,030
According to our talk and the form you filled out, I think

193
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,779
your symptoms are consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder,

194
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,589
PTSD for short.

195
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:17,949
PTSD means people may display

196
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:20,590
a series of symptoms after experiencing

197
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,949
or witnessing a major dangerous event.

198
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:27,390
But don't worry. It can be cured.

199
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,659
We need a step-by-step process.

200
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:33,200
After perhaps three talks, I'll discuss with you how to treat it.

201
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,250
Three?

202
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,900
Will you prescribe medicine for me after confirming my disease?

203
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,490
I won't prescribe medicine.

204
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,540
But if I think you need drug treatments,

205
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,410
I'll provide suggestions or recommend a suitable hospital for you.

206
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,790
But at first, now, I need to know more details about you and then discuss with you

207
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,060
how to cure your disease.

208
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:01,900
Prolonged exposure therapy is one of the most efficient treatments to PTSD.

209
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,060
I'll help you with the training of stabilizing emotions.

210
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,200
Next, face the trauma and heal it.

211
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,140
Because the trauma will damage our relevant memories.

212
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,760
The treatment can reassemble shattered memories

213
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,090
to help you recover and get used.

214
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,509
Then how long will it take?

215
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:27,189
It varies from person to person. My visitors spent from half a year to a year.

216
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:29,710
But because your symptoms have lasted for so long

217
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,850
and you're old, it'll take longer,

218
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,320
about three years.

219
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,350
Three years?

220
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,790
I perhaps

221
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,130
don't have so much time left.

222
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,270
[Breakfast Items]

223
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,080
- Is it heavy?
- Not really.

224
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,830
- We'll be there soon.
- Shouldn't we wait for Jiahui to go together.

225
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,100
There is no need. He'll come over after parking his car.

226
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,550
It's all right.

227
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,180
This way.

228
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,120
Uncle Qi.

229
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,640
- Hello.
- Hello.

230
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,830
- Great.
- Welcome.

231
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,620
Look. He Dun bought you some fruits.

232
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,520
You don't need to do that.

233
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,500
That's right.

234
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,160
- Let me introduce you. This is Uncle Qi, Auntie Qi.
- Hello, Uncle Qi.

235
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,290
- Hello, Auntie Qi.
- Hello.

236
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,170
- This girl is so beautiful.
- She is.

237
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,320
Have big eyes and a small mouth.

238
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,620
Looks pretty.

239
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,700
- Let her sit down.
- Come over here.

240
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,200
Have a seat Sit down.

241
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,919
Here are some fruits.

242
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,610
This is Uncle Qin.

243
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,950
Hello, Uncle Qin.

244
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,470
This is…

245
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,410
He Dun.

246
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,200
He Dun!

247
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,420
- We're coming.
- Madam.

248
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,850
A fruit party.

249
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,779
Madam He.

250
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:51,880
- Hello, Madam He.
- Eat.

251
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,020
Why are there so many people in your family?

252
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,790
I can't help it.

253
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,200
She looks florid.

254
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,610
How old are you?

255
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,050
I'm…

256
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,610
She is Kai Kai's age.

257
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,240
A perfect match. The Year of the Monkey.

258
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,390
She is Kai's age.

259
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,660
A perfect match.

260
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,060
Girl, who else is in your family?

261
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,740
Only my m-mom.

262
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,230
What's your job?

263
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,230
Now…

264
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,740
No more questions.

265
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,560
She doesn't have time to eat fruits.

266
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,400
- Right.
- Eat fruits.

267
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,440
- Yes.
- Let's eat.

268
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,560
It's all right, Auntie.

269
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,390
I'm a psychological counselor.

270
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,980
That's it.

271
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,740
I'll explain it to you.

272
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,400
When you feel unhappy or depressed,

273
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,060
talk to He Dun and you'll become happy instantly.

274
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,520
- Really?
- Yes.

275
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,500
Great!

276
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,490
I like He Dun's program.

277
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,520
Upon hearing your voice, I'll feel at ease.

278
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,810
Me too.

279
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,300
I'll…

280
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,150
Who is this?

281
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,060
Jiahui, come in.

282
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,600
This is my friend, Ye Jiahui.

283
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,950
- Jiahui.
- Hello.

284
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,030
- Hello, Aunties, Uncles.
- Come over here and sit down.

285
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,329
Hello, everyone.

286
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:05,300
Sit down.

287
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,690
- I brought you some gifts.
- You're so kind.

288
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,050
Jiahui. They're all my family.

289
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,420
Why is he here?

290
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,190
Don't you see it?

291
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,300
How long have you been here?

292
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,330
Just arrived. We've been eating fruits and talking.

293
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,270
We've got to help him.

294
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:25,150
How about asking Jiahui to do housework?

295
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,740
- To let Kai Kai and He Dun have more time to stay together.
- What are you doing?

296
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,950
That's a good idea.

297
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,949
Jiahui, what's your job?

298
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:34,210
I'm a doctor.

299
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,500
- Doctor?
- This job is good.

300
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,210
The salary is high.

301
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah, Jiahui is excellent.

302
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,590
He excels at acupuncture treatment, which specializes in treating nerves.

303
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,670
Don't be so impolite.

304
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,620
Department of Neurology?

305
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,110
I specialize in treating neuropathy.

306
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,930
A good retort.

307
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,629
Well, Jiahui, can you cook?

308
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:57,590
A little.

309
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,950
- Then how about helping me in the kitchen?
- No problem.

310
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,100
I can also help.

311
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,060
Don't stand up.

312
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,750
It's enough to have Jiahui help me.

313
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,660
- Come with me.
- I'll offer a helping hand.

314
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,820
Kai Kai, talk more.

315
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,540
Let's go.

316
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,320
Jiahui is really amazing.

317
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,060
Wherever he goes, he can cause a commotion.

318
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,730
I think you're the culprit.

319
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:27,260
Mom, this month's expense is ¥12,000. That's too much.

320
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,410
Let's try to keep the utilities under 200 and the purchasing cost at seven or eight thousand.

321
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,660
Is it all right?

322
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,280
Got it.

323
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,950
Mom. Why did you purchase so much again?

324
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,140
If it isn't sold out, we'll suffer a great loss.

325
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,470
You're an amateur.

326
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,440
The Shrimp Dumplings of Missing Brand sold well.

327
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,530
There was no stock in our fridge. So I hurried to purchase some.

328
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,690
Fine, you're the boss.

329
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,900
Lili, did you break up with that guy?

330
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,440
Yes.

331
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,940
Great. You have to.

332
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,540
We can't live against our conscience, right?

333
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,690
Is that your real thought?

334
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,830
Of course.

335
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,630
We need backbone.

336
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,830
He's lied to you, but we have to be upright. Is that right?

337
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,630
I'm glad you can think so.

338
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,010
Anyway, we need to return this shop to him.

339
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,220
What?

340
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,070
Return this shop.

341
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:28,659
But a shop is nothing to Fang Zhongyi, a boss.

342
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:32,500
We have no other choice. He bought this shop. So, it belonged to him.

343
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,040
Nowadays, youths are so capable.

344
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,630
It's rare to see such a good cooking skill.

345
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,230
Can you cook all this?

346
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,880
Yes.

347
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,540
Uncle Qi's cooking skill was also quite excellent.

348
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,099
But since he became a designated driver, he had cooked less often.

349
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:17,200
Why doesn't he enjoy the life at home?

350
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,870
It's a good job.

351
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,530
On the way. he can meet all kinds of passengers.

352
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,250
Those who sleep upon getting in the car.

353
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,900
Those who keep calling on the way.

354
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,590
And those who talk with him

355
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,780
about breaking-up, job hopping, and complaints.

356
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,670
It's quite interesting.

357
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,710
You have such a good cooking skill, a good appearance, and a promising career.

358
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,260
You must have had a girlfriend, right?

359
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,350
Not yet.

360
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,260
If only my daughter was single.

361
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,900
It's so happy to have a son-in-law like you.

362
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,040
Jiahui, what kind of girl do you like?

363
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,650
I'll help you find one.

364
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,930
Kind and filial to the elders.

365
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,090
- That's good.
- Yes, good.

366
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,410
My granddaughter just graduated from college.

367
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,000
It's a good time for her to have a boyfriend.

368
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,400
Leave your phone number to me.

369
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,690
I think you'll definitely be together.

370
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,580
Fang Zhongyi is even more mean than your damn father.

371
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,020
He made a mistake first.

372
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,540
Shouldn't he compensate?

373
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:25,410
Besides, how can he take back the gift he has given to you?

374
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,830
What kind of success is he?

375
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:33,350
Humph, even I, an illiterate woman, am more sensible than him.

376
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,930
Do you really want this shop?

377
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,640
Of course.

378
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,020
Fine, then I'll get back with him.

379
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,160
Why?

380
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,980
Because he's said he will give me this shop if I'm his girlfriend.

381
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,630
But, Lili, what's your thought?

382
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,600
My thought? It doesn't matter.

383
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,950
What matters is that you like it.

384
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,750
I listen to you.

385
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,350
Then I can only sacrifice myself.

386
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:05,000
Lili, everything has its solution, right?

387
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,010
Fine, return this shop.

388
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:15,710
Anyway, I don't want to use a mean man's money.

389
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,470
This shop is worth ¥500,000 or ¥600,000.

390
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,050
What a pity!

391
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,920
It doesn't matter.

392
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,629
We… We can save so much money by living frugally.

393
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:33,920
Mom, I'm teasing you.

394
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,420
You're so gullible.

395
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,230
Fortunately, I'm not as stupid as you.

396
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,820
What do you mean?

397
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,300
Explain this to me.

398
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,540
Mom, rest assured.

399
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:50,200
I've saved some money as dowry after working for so many years.

400
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Two days ago, I transferred the money for this shop to his account.

401
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,350
Now we're done.

402
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:01,120
- But…
- From now on, we live straight.

403
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,530
This shop is ours.

404
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,490
You've spent your dowry.

405
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,530
What if you marry in the future?

406
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,170
- I won't marry.
- Don't talk nonsense.

407
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,610
As long as you aren't tired of me, I'll live with you forever. Is that okay?

408
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,180
Is that okay?

409
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,230
Don't say that.

410
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,590
You have a house.

411
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,300
Why shall you stay here?

412
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,250
Go back to your house. Hurry up.

413
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,950
I have no house.

414
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,240
I rented it, instead of buying it.

415
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,040
But it takes money.

416
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,710
It isn't vacant. He Dun is running a studio there.

417
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,020
Lili, did you have an argument?

418
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,100
No.

419
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,150
Really?

420
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,000
Mom, don't you want me to accompany you for a few days?

421
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,650
- If so, I'm leaving now.
- I'd like to.

422
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:50,560
I'm happy when you're with me.

423
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,480
I'm so happy

424
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,770
to have you accompanied me.

425
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,260

- A final hit.
- We won.

435
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,170
We won again.

436
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,020
It's the first time our Wenchang Street has won the chess.

437
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,550
- Congratulations!
- Jiahui!

438
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,950
You're young yet capable. Wonderful!

439
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,590
I surrender.

440
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,300
It's you who taught me well.

441
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,040
- Nowadays, youths…
- Yeah.

442
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,760
Let's play again.

443
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,110
Everyone, I got to leave now.

444
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,590
I have an order at seven on Didi Taxi.

445
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,630
I have to drive my car out.

446
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,540
Don't hurry to leave.

447
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,260
It isn't easy to hold an activity.

448
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,200
We have to have a photo taken.

449
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,430
- I've prepared for it.
- All right.

450
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,950
Come on.

451
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,770
[Congratulations Wenchang Street on its Great Victory in the Chess Match]
Three, two. One.

452
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,920
Wenchang Street.

453
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,810
The nearby card shining with gold light is the gold card.

454
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,810
Then, who controls whom?

455
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,950
I control myself. Mine is also a gold card.

456
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,250
Get a bottle of drink and give it to the man in black behind us.

457
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,390
Ask him to play the game with us. Go ahead.

458
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,260
Okay.

459
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,630
Come on! Let's fight.

460
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,699
Brother, here you are.

461
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:03,470
- Have you chosen?
- Yes.

462
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,540
Thanks.

463
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,830
Can you play the game with us?

464
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,890
We need someone for our game.

465
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,490
Come on.

466
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,040
All right.

467
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,080
You lost.

468
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,560
Sit down.

469
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,830
Everyone, say Brother Ye.

470
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,630
Brother.

471
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,630
Who can teach him how to play the game?

472
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,470
- Me.
- All right.

473
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,440
This is yours.

474
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,530
This is mine.

475
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:40,420
If mine kicks yours off the table, you'll lose.

476
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,960
Have a try.

477
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,960
Come on.

478
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,370
The strongest in the world.

479
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,960
Dang, I have no cards.

480
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,590
Here you are.

481
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,749
This place is so lively.

482
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:23,140
- You can often come here.
- I'll give a final attack.

483
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,060
- Go ahead.
- Go!

484
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,420
It's your turn.

485
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,290
What's up?

486
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:33,499
Nothing. I'm just surprised that you don't look like a child who lost parents.

487
00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:34,629
They all said so.

488
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:38,230
The neighbors all look after me like their son.

489
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,740
It's been so many years.

490
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,750
I should let it go.

491
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,140
Even so, don't you feel lonely at all?

492
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,540
Yes, I do.

493
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,260
But I still have a long future.

494
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,780
I can't dwell on the past, can I?

495
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,060
Stop.

496
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,000
I'll shoot it.

497
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,740
Three-point shot in succession.

498
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,250
I'm going to take a call.

499
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,130
Come on.

500
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,950
Do you want to shoot?

501
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,770
Hi, Dad.

502
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,610
Come on.

503
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,960
All right.

504
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,230
Pick another one.

505
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,410
Another one.

506
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,160
I'll shoot yours with this.

507
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,040
Come on.

508
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,990
- Kaiyi.
- I'll shoot the one at the center.

509
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,410
I have something else to do. I'm leaving now.

510
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,040
Help me say goodbye to He Dun.

511
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,320
Sure, feel free to come here if you're available.

512
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,860
Thanks.

513
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,560
- Just go.
- Bye.

514
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,520
Well, go play yourselves.

515
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,430
Let's go over there.

516
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,010
Where is Ye Jiahui?

517
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,330
He left after answering a call.

518
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:47,429
Well, he looks quite like a bad character who got a mission.

519
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,130
You're quite popular in this area.

520
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,430
I'm the boss in the Wenchang Street.

521
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,630
I can see that.

522
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,300
Your underlings are quite capable.

523
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,380
I have something to tell you.

524
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,920
Our program wants to launch an activity called "Bridge of Hearts".

525
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,250
Bridge of Hearts? What does it mean?

526
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,770
Since the activity of saying no ended,

527
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,650
many listeners have called us for counseling.

528
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,200
But they don't know how to find good

529
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,010
professional counselors in their lives.

530
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,180
It happens that many counselors

531
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,680
come to us after listening to our program,

532
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,870
saying they can provide low-cost services for some financially challenged listeners.

533
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:36,069
So we want to serve as a bridge to match listeners and professional counselors.

534
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:39,350
It's quite helpful. Can I sign up?

535
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:42,880
Of course. You're our program's ace psychological counselor.

536
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,780
Don't flatter me.

537
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:49,529
He Dun, do you remember when I came to you then?

538
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:52,930
I asked, "Why do you want to open a psychological counseling office?"

539
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,590
You replied…

540
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,160
There's a lot that suicide intervention can't do.

541
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,470
I want to help more people.

542
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:07,949
So, it looks like our program can really help many people.

543
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,650
Qian Kaiyi, I find you're a little different here

544
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,470
from when you're at other places.

545
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,260
What's the difference?

546
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,910
You look like an adult here.

547
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:23,100
Do I look like a child at other places?

548
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,729
Then which pattern of me do you like, a child or an adult?

549
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,320
I don't dislike both.

550
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,760
That means you like.

551
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,710
That's quite another matter, alright?

552
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,000
What are you doing? Are you all right?

553
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,680
Look, you cared about me.

554
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,080
I was afraid that you'd die from falling to the ground.

555
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:47,260
- Brother Wang.
- Kaiyi.

556
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,790
- Do you have a lighter?
- Yes.

557
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,310
He Dun, do you have the guts?

558
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,830
Fireworks?

559
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,410
Don't burn your hands.

560
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,540
It's my first time to play with fireworks.

561
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,530
- Really?
- Yes.

562
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,020
- Did you play with hand-held fireworks for the first time?
- Yes.

563
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,010
He Dun played with hand-held fireworks for the first time.

564
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,820
Don't come over to me.

565
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:51,780
♫  Each dawn blooms with a word of flowers  ♫

566
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:59,080
♫  Here is an aroma of coffee and you  ♫

567
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:08,660
♫  Whether the haze turns into rain or the weather suddenly clears up  ♫

568
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:14,460
♫  I wish to be with you  ♫

569
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:25,540
♫  A shower of rain gently floats far out of the sky  ♫

570
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:32,660
♫  Taking with it my blue and cloudy memories  ♫

571
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:46,520
♫  I bloom like a scenery as clear as a song  ♫

572
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,440
You also have some.

573
00:32:54,820 --> 00:33:03,050
♫  They warm my smile and listen to my true voice  ♫

574
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:08,119
♫  Giving me the gentlest response  ♫

575
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:16,200
♫  I see the sudden arrival  ♫

576
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,300
♫  of a beautiful love  ♫

577
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:27,800
♫  Holding your hand, I can feel your heart  ♫

578
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:36,700
♫  Holding your hand, I can feel your heart  ♫

579
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,770
I'm sorry. Sorry.

580
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,060
I'm just a little sick.

581
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,520
I'm sorry. I ate too much.

582
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,550
Catch the ball.

583
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,370
Catch the ball.

584
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,720
I'm still not good at kicking a long ball.

585
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,280
You need to push it with your ankle.

586
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,750
The correct way can help you do more with less.

587
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,310
You're in good spirits recently.

588
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,820
I made a few interesting friends.

589
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,760
I'm about to try something different.

590
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,270
Tell me.

591
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,380
I think it's also good to find a girlfriend.

592
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:23,370
You really grew up.

593
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,370
Game is game.

594
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:29,310
The result matters, instead of the process.

595
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:32,900
But you have to remember one thing.

596
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,230
Get the stuff first.

597
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,870
Rest assured, Dad.

598
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,920
Are you all right?

599
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,420
Yes.

600
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,850
You're really strong.

601
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,520
I'll have a rest. Have a rest.

602
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,070
That's it for today.

603
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,550
By the way,

604
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:17,819
when I did the cleaning in our house, I found this.

605
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,180
What's it?

606
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,180
The letter your mom left to me when she left.

607
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,280
Forget it.

608
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:35,030
It's rare for us to be so happy like today.

609
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,080
Don't read it.

610
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,670
It's all right.

611
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,820
It's been 25 years.

612
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,300
I'm not a child anymore.

613
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,130
There's nothing I can't let go of.

614
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,170
How about

615
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,480
I read it out to you?

616
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,910
To Jicheng.

617
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:23,300
You've played many important roles in my life,

618
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,820
such as my elder brother, friend and husband.

619
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,860
In all these relationships, I'm a receiver

620
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,880
of everything, including my disease.

621
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,440
I'll abandon everything and leave.

622
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,050
I'll make up for it for the rest of my life.

623
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,990
I leave the child to you

624
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,820
because you always love him.

625
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,650
I hope you can protect him

626
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,590
and give him a peaceful life.

627
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:08,030
I'll coexist peacefully with my disease in my own way.

628
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,210
Promise me

629
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,260
not to look for me

630
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,820
for the sake of me

631
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,230
and yourself.

632
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,280
If it hadn't been for Ji Mingcong,

633
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,990
your mom wouldn't have been like this.

634
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:02,760
Five roses, two red dates and hot water of 80°C.

635
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,280
They can help recover your spirits.

636
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,930
Thanks.

637
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,720
This case is quite tricky?

638
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:22,879
Since the last case of Telesphorus, you haven't been back.

639
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:25,810
I thought I could take some time off.

640
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:32,170
Give me the case report.

641
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,380
Tell me the condition of your supervision.

642
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,690
The visitor's emotions changed a lot.

643
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,359
The second time he came to me, he was really depressed.

644
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,100
Miss He, am I doomed?

645
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,370
What do you want to hear?

646
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,560
I think my life is about to collapse.

647
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,989
He told me he was isolated by others because of his refusal.

648
00:40:02,989 --> 00:40:04,660
I think I've offended them.

649
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:08,770
The one who is disliked will be isolated.

650
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:13,830
But the third time he came to me, he was very aggressive.

651
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,680
I'm unhappy.

652
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,720
He happily told me that others were afraid of him because of his refusal.

653
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,520
One should show his power moderately.

654
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,450
Otherwise, others will think he's a pushover and always trample him.

655
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,480
That day...

656
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,819
Is the detailed reason why he attacked you that night?

657
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:41,179
The visitor lost his temper and got into a fight in public.

658
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:42,450
Later, it was broadcast in the news.

659
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,450
His counseling information was exposed.

660
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,210
His nickname was cuttlefish.

661
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,430
At that time, all the people mocked and excluded him.

662
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,940
He blamed you for all his sufferings.

663
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,269
So, he avenged on you in a fit of pique.

664
00:40:54,269 --> 00:40:55,969
I think so.

665
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:59,309
Did you reveal his counseling information to others?

666
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:03,229
No. It's a basic duty to keep privacy in this profession.

667
00:41:03,229 --> 00:41:05,320
I won't reveal it to others.

668
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,620
Have another drink.

669
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,010
Thanks.

670
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,460
It's dry.

671
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,480
You told the truth.

672
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,589
It's strange. Indeed.

673
00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:44,089
What do you think of the visitor's changed emotions?

674
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:46,460
I recalled it.

675
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,089
The third time he came to me, his response was beyond my expectancy.

676
00:41:50,089 --> 00:41:52,729
And yesterday's attack totally took me aback.

677
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:55,870
It messed up my counseling plan and rhythm.

678
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:58,919
I think it began to get out of control at that time.

679
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:01,040
But I don't know why it happened.

680
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,650
I also don't know what to do.

681
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,660
Does the visitor have a history of mental illness?

682
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,170
He told me he hadn't.

683
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,750
But now it's hard to say it.

684
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,370
According to the existing details,

685
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:13,500
It's indeed difficult to understand why the visitor suddenly changed.

686
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,230
But I think we may have missed some things.

687
00:42:18,062 --> 00:42:21,259
Do you want to continue the counseling with him in the future?

688
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:25,888
I know it's hard for you.

689
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,350
To be honest, I don't know.

690
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:35,510
The thought of him makes me afraid and hurts me. I even want to avoid him.

691
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,680
But on the other hand, I want to face the difficulty.

692
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,900
I want to help him. I'm concerned about the visitor.

693
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,220
Anyone who experienced this will feel afraid.

694
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,750
But I think there must be something that led to the visitor's change.

695
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,590
It's up to you whether to continue the counseling.

696
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,748
Miss Wen,

697
00:42:55,748 --> 00:42:58,900
do you think if there is a third party or something

698
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,070
that interfered in the counseling?

699
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,360
