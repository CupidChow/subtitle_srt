I... I made some delicious dishes.

If you are not in a hurry...

I'll get you a bowl of rice.

When I was your age,

00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,550
I'd faint from hunger for missing a meal.

Do you remember the sunflowers in our yard?

You wanted to pick some every time you walked by there.

Do you know why I'd prevent you from eating cakes?

You have all the reasons to be mad at me.

for not protecting you from falling into the water,

112
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,320
for not holding your hands firmly enough when you were swept away by water.

113
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,299
Right?

114
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:22,600
It really was my fault. I'm sorry.

115
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,770
I failed as a mother.

116
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:32,710
After your death, for millions of times, I thought

117
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:38,460
if only I was the one who got swept away by water.

118
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,400
However, I got but two hands.

119
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,249
There was no way I could save you both.

120
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:47,030
I was planning to come back for you after saving your sister.

121
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,470
But you were just a little kid.

122
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,129
You were trapped in a dark place.

123
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,900
You must be so scared

124
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,140
and hate me so much

125
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,990

I hate myself for that, too.

Do you know why I didn't kill myself?

128
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,760
It's not that I'm afraid of death.

129
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,980
No. I want to see you so much.

130
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,800
You see, I'm not only your mother.

131
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,350
I'm also the mother of your sister.

132
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,029
Your sister was also a kid back then.

133
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,100
I just couldn't imagine her growing up without a mother.

134
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,920
I would worry if she got bullied at school,

135
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,130
if she failed to focus on school or if she fell in love too young.

136
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,300
She is going to need my advice on her romantic relationship,

marriage and parenting skills.

138
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,940

You don't need me anymore.

I don't need to worry about you anymore.

you're a good boy now.

148
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,680
I have another reason. You see,

149
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,929
because of your death,

150
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:30,779
your dad and sister had a nervous breakdown.

151
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,890
I was worried about your father.

152
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,240
That's why

153
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,690
I chose to stay.

154
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,570

perhaps you don't understand what I'm saying.

156
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,180
You're just a kid.

157
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,550
You only need to understand one thing.

158
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,190
That is,

159
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,440

very, very much.

162
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,230
I just can't love you enough.

163
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,520
Go, go, go.

164
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,220
There you go. There you go. Hold your position.

165
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,780
Keep your back straight.

166
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,480
Breathe. Breathe.

Two more to go. One.

168
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,180
Put it down slowly. Put it down slowly. There you go.

169
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,580
I can't do it!

170
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,530
- One more to go.
- I'm exhausted.

171
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,690
I'm exhausted.

172
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,510
My legs are so weak.

173
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,050
Your mom called.

174
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,979
You don't want to call her back?

175
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:54,580
No need.

176
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,570
What happened? Did you have a fight?

177
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,240
We are good.

178
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,709
Come on.

179
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:14,130
Lili, you need to learn to take care of yourself.

180
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,180
Mr. Jin Tao, actually, I'm pretty good at it.

181
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,330
But answer my question. Why does a girl need a boyfriend if she can do everything on her own?

182
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,650
I didn't mean that.

183
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,180
I signed up for you here for one year.

184
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,350
Next time, let's go to the gym together.

185
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,910
Lili, don't waste your money.

186
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,900
I don't need it.

187
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,070
Okay.

188
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,739
Do you need gym card?

189
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:01,251
This card is for one year at the gym. It's for free. Do you want it?

190
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,620
Excuse me.

191
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,200
So, if you don't want it, no one can have it?

192
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,110
Don't be so capricious, okay?

193
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,800
You're not getting any younger. Don't be capricious.

194
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,310
I just want us to spend more time together.

195
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,809
Is there anything wrong with that?

196
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:15,110
What's wrong with you today?

197
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,910
Why don't we cut right to it?

198
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,410
Never mind.

199
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,420
Jin Tao, tell me the truth.

200
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,250
Your parents don't like me, do they?

201
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,010
Of course, they do. They like you very much.

202
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,010
It's just

203
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,260
I'll be gone for a while.

204
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,700
What you do mean?

205
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,490
Did I upset you by being capricious?

206
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,729
Not at all.

207
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:48,301
Then what on earth do you mean? Tell me.

208
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:49,659
Why are you being so evasive?

209
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:52,180
I can't explain.

210
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,350
It's complicated.

211
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,980
I think it's better for both of us to take a break.

212
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,650
Did I get you upset?

213
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,780
Not at all.

214
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,570
Do you know why I get to do things in my own way?

215
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,490
Because no one ever asked me to take responsibility.

216
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,280
Lili!

217
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,020
You're here.

218
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,250
Whose kid is Jiahui?

219
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,400
Fei Fei is obviously my kid.

220
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,790
Who is his father?

221
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,710
Let go of me!

222
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,770
Were you pregnant

223
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,640
when you left me?

224
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,880
Is he my child?

225
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,940
Is he my child?

226
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,629
Let go of me! Let go of me!

227
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:23,930
Mom! Mom! Mom!

228
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,970
- Fu Tang! Fu Tang! Okay, okay, I stop asking.
- Professor Ji. Professor Ji.

229
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,249
It's okay. It's okay.

230
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:40,419
Let's go back.

231
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:41,920
It's okay.

232
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,220
Professor Ji, you need to play it cool.

233
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,040
Let her get some rest.

234
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,730
Auntie Fu, are you writing something?

235
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,910
I forgot.

236
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,520
It's okay. Don't push yourself.

237
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,380
Do you want a candy?

238
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,310
See?

239
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,000
Your favorite candy.

240
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,179
Last time we were here,

241
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:35,010
you said you'd let us know the end of the story.

242
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,059
That's right.

243
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,689
Childhood sweetheart and love at first sight, what was her final decision?

244
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:40,770
Just give us some hints.

245
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,160
Even the TV show has a preview.

246
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,180
You just wouldn't give us a clue.

247
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:51,540
The story must go on till it gets to the end.

248
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,580
Then, let's keep on playing, okay?

249
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,280
This time, I want to play another character.

250
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,820
It's raining outside.

251
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,070
What are you doing here?

252
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,720
I'm here to see you.

253
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,110
I told you not to come.

254
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,810
You never meant it.

255
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,860
I really meant it.

256
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,480
I hate those who didn't keep their promises.

257
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,941
You just hate it when people failed to keep their promises to you.

258
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,270
Are you judging me?

259
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,300
Not at all.

260
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,420
I mean,

261
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,680
it's raining

262
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,480
outside.

263
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,820
I don't want you to catch a cold.

264
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,061
What I hate most is hypocrisy.

265
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,170
I understand why you're mad.

266
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,750
I haven't finished collecting the data of the phase II trial.

267
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,440
No one can be sure about the side effects of the drug.

268
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,820
Science is a serious subject.

269
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,720
It has to be precise.

270
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,700
Especially for you.

271
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,520
You have no confidence in your drugs.

272
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,510
Can't it wait?

273
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,270
It's like you don't know me at all.

274
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,220
Do you really want to give it a try?

275
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,070
You don't like this story, do you?

276
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,360
Well. This is your story. I don't get a say in this.

277
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,400
It's just that I feel a little sorry for this man.

278
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,580
You do?

279
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,991
Don't you think this man doesn't know her at all?

280
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:02,750
Why do you ask that?

281
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,530
They are more alike no matter in their personalities,

282
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,080
family backgrounds or many other things.

283
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,230
They belong to the same world.

284
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,230
I'm not too sure I agree with that.

285
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,520
Who says two similar people are meant to be together?

286
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,820
For me, what matters in a relationship is that the two people like each other.

287
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,220
Right?

288
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,780
They are like a pair of hedgehogs.

289
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,290
Standing back in back, they'd hurt each other.

290
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,310
However, once they turn around,

291
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,110
they'd find each other's gentle side.

292
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,610
Well,

293
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,020
that's the part of a story to be recounted later.

294
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,670
What are you doing?

295
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,670
I just bought this digital camera.

296
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,340
I know it's a digital camera.

297
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,029
I'm asking what you are doing with that.

298
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:07,560
Recording my study subject.

299
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,060
I accepted the offer on one condition

300
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,540
that I'll make a case study out of your case.

301
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,060
You're free to quit

302
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,960
if it makes you uncomfortable.

303
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,310
That makes me your guinea pig.

304
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,900
Rather, a volunteer.

305
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,090
Will this video

306
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,920
be made public?

307
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,969
Don't worry.

308
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,540
This is for psychological research purpose.

309
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,501
I'm probably the only one who gets to watch this video.

310
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:39,640
I'm obliged to keep your case confidential.

311
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,900
Hold on.

312
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,060
Let's get started.

313
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,970
Let's call it a day.

314
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,050
Before ending our session today,

315
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,400
I want you to promise me that for the following sessions,

316
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,610
you'll eat and sleep at regular times

317
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,810
and won't hurt yourself.

318
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,780
Can you promise me that?

319
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,590
Can you do that for me?

320
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,430
You've asked me so many questions.

321
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,800
Can I ask you one question?

322
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,750
What question?

323
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,620
Keep holding that digital camera.

324
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,910
Please go ahead.

325
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,830
Let's date.

326
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,520
No.

327
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,320
Why?

328
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,060
No reason.

329
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,050
This is against the rules.

330
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,680
I'm your psychiatrist.

331
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,260
I like breaking rules.

332
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,430
Don't you want to date me?

333
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,420
I just want to cure your disease.

334
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,590
You're avoiding the issue.

335
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,970
I'm not.

336
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,110
Then promise me

337
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,560
that we'll be together when I'm cured.

338
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,710
When I look back on my life,

339
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,540
it seems he was standing at the fork of each road,

340
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:08,540
smiling at me like a loyal solider.

341
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,120
It's just that

342
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,720
I never picked him once.

343
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,930
Is this a reward for me?

344
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,700
You're in good condition these days.

345
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,600
So, are we in a relationship now?

346
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,810
I just want to cure your disease.

347
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,600
Can't you tell I'm already cured?

348
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,700
Is it safe for her to use a scissor?

349
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,580
Actually, we should have confiscated such things.

350
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,359
But characteristically, even if we hide it somewhere,

351
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,610
she'd find it anyway.

352
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,290
It's for you.

353
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,249
"I have nothing to offer you"

354
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:41,240
The next line is?

355
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,600
"I have nothing to offer you but a blossom branch from my hometown in the spring time"

356
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,010
What does it mean, Mom?

357
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,500
There was this poet named Lu Kai.

358
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,490
He had a good friend whose name was Fan Ye.

359
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,130
They were very good friends. However, they lived very far apart.

360
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,680
One lived in the south while the other lived in the north.

361
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,610
They'd express how much they miss each other. In their letters.

362
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,300
One day, Lu Kai ran into a postman.

363
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,090
He asked the postman to deliver a letter to his friend.

364
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,129
But what to write about?

365
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:17,440
While he was pondering this, plum blossoms greeted his eyes.

366
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,970
So, he picked a blossom branch and wrote this poem.

367
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:27,090
"I have nothing to offer you but a blossom branch from my hometown in the spring time"

368
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:32,101
He wanted his friend to have a glimpse of the springtime in the regions south of the Yangtze River.

369
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,609
Thanks.

370
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:54,310
It's beautiful.

371
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,770
What happened then?

372
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,470
How would you like this story to develop?

373
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Well,

374
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:21,580
one day, the girl was found to

375
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,280
take pills secretly.

376
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,740
So, it's true you've been drugging her.

377
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,729
Can't you see she's getting much better?

378
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:33,160
Shouldn't you let me know before giving her pills?

379
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,030
Why should I?

380
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,070
Who do you think you are?

381
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,590
You also gave her this drug, right?

382
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,670
Listen, the bottle has no information on it.

383
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:03,210
I need you to explain to me the name and ingredients of this drug.

384
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,610
Otherwise, I'll report you to the SFDA for illegal drug use.

385
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,750
You're committing a crime!

386
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,660
Are you threatening me?

387
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,920
You're despicable.

388
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,320
Did you know your treatment never worked on her?

389
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,631
Did you know she tried to kill herself the other day?

390
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,999
That's not true.

391
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,250
That's true!

392
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:30,590
How could you ignore such obvious mood swings?

393
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,470
So, the psychiatrist believed

394
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,990
he has helped the girl feel better.

395
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:42,090
But the pharmacist thought the girl would have killed herself but for his drugs.

396
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,970
After that fight,

397
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,120
the rivals in love

398
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:55,380
started to accuse each other and became sworn enemies.

399
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,470
What happened then?

400
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,950
Did that girl get recovered?

401
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,950
Of course, she did.

402
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,650
But...

403
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,100
But?

404
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,940
News report. Sikang Pharmaceuticals announced early this morning

405
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,630
the termination of the research and development of a new drug for bipolar disorder.

406
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,419
According to a supervisory organization,

407
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:23,900
some clinical trial patients showed serious adverse reactions to the drug,

408
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,010
including memory impairment and confusion,

409
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,180
which led to protests from patients and their families.

410
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,730
Now, the research and development of the drug have been suspended at all levels.

411
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,630
It can't be true.

412
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,450
It can't be true.

413
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,681
They told me they were about to pass the phase II of the clinical trial.

414
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,040
I was framed.

415
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,760
I will find a solution.

416
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:45,460
It seems to me you always wear a red dress.

417
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,900
This has never changed.

418
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,660
Do you like it?

419
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,260
Yes.

420
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,709
Excuse me.

421
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:19,880
Can I get a face mask?

422
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,770
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

423
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,569
When I was at the entry,

424
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:27,520
I saw a person in the hospital gown looking for someone.

425
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,340
I thought this place has an entrance guard.

426
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,860
Crap.

427
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,600
[Fu Tang]

428
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,690
This is for you.

429
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,740
Where are we now?

430
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:07,700
You mean, you can have it because we are sort of related?

431
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,980
Your parents don't like me, do they?

432
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,980
Of course, they do. They like you very much.

433
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,470
It's just

434
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,290
I'll be gone for a while.

435
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,730
Both of them are nice.

436
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,160
That's a dangerous thought.

437
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,460
She has to choose from them.

438
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,910
Otherwise, the story will end in tragedy.

439
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,260
Whom would you choose if that were you?

440
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,269
I'm not her.

441
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:13,129
I can't make the decision for her.

442
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:16,660
Would you analyze it as a female psychiatrist?

443
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,870
It seems the girl thinks favorably of the psychiatrist.

444
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,550
Jiahui, are you all right?

445
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,230
I'm fine.

446
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,419
What do you think?

447
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:34,680
Whom do you think the girl will choose?

448
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,221
It seems she'll choose neither of them.

449
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:39,820
Why?

450
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:49,900
In this world, she has the right to love anyone, and not to love anyone.

451
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,660
She is not to be a prisoner of love.

452
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:59,150
Perhaps she loves no one but herself and freedom.

453
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,330
Jiahui, may I ask you a question?

454
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,160
Go ahead.

455
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,800
Is that pharmacist your foster father?

456
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,700
Professor Ji.

457
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,970
What brings you here?

458
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,770
Drop the vegetables. Come on.

459
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,170
Let's cook dumplings.

460
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,770
Aren't you a king at home?

461
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,370
See,

462
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,739
shrimp dumplings, a hit product.

463
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:35,219
It contains shrimps and vegetables.

464
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:37,420
It can save a lot of time and trouble. Let's go.

465
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,410
Come on, you lazy guy.

466
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,070
Let's go.

467
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,070
Old Zhang, take a seat.

468
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,220
You have a son, don't you?

469
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,569
How old is he?

470
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:56,570
Twenty-nine.

471
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:02,390
Is it hard to discipline kids of that age?

472
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,500
You call a 29-year-old man kid?

473
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,220
Discipline them?

474
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,680
How?

475
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,340
He is going to start a family.

476
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,910
There is nothing I can do.

477
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,980
I just want to know

478
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,560
how I should get along with them.

479
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,570
You mean my son and I?

480
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,630
There is no specific ways.

481
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,850
We can sit together for a whole day without saying anything.

482
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,430
It's the bond between a father and his son.

483
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,460
Perhaps you have nothing to say to each other.

484
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,450
That's better than saying mean things to each other, right?

485
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,710
It's nicer when people just get along.

486
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,260
Wait a moment.

487
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
What do you mean by that?

488
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,910
What? Don't point your fingers at me.

489
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,780
Do you have a crush on someone?

490
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,330
And she has an adult son?

491
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,520
Come on, at my age, that's not happening.

492
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm just curious.

493
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,550
It seems you don't get to enjoy the happy family time.

494
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:06,130
My son is getting married this year.

495
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,510
Perhaps I'll have a grandson next year.

496
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,530
Hey, I've got a plan.

497
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,940
I'll take care of the baby three days a week.

498
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,260
When the baby grows older, he'll live with me.

499
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,129
I'll teach him on my own.

500
00:40:19,129 --> 00:40:21,930
That will save the tuition fee for preschool education.

501
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,499
All right, give it a rest.

502
00:40:23,499 --> 00:40:25,110
Go cook the dumplings.

503
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,800
All right, wait right here.

504
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,420
I need you to sign here.

505
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,660
Mr. Ye, I told you before,

506
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,320
I was working on the promotion of pilot projects of group counseling.

507
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,229
The association has approved the budget.

508
00:40:48,229 --> 00:40:50,119
Opening shops in the communities

509
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:53,869
lays the foundation of the promotion of domestic therapeutic apparatus.

510
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:57,080
The committee members all believe this is the right time.

511
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:04,340
What about the feedback on the apparatus in commission?

512
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,910
All I need is your approval.

513
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:12,430
For any problem which may occur, I'll deal with it.

514
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,860
Once I sign these papers,

515
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,700
I'll be the one who takes full responsibility for the problems.

516
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,290
You can rest assured of that. Everything will be fine.

517
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,089
However, it's good to know that you have a sense of responsibility.

518
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:26,630
So, Mr. Ye, please send me a copy when the data collection is done.

519
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,970
That will be reassuring for me.

520
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,120
How is it going with the files?

521
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,530
Any good news?

522
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,950
Not yet.

523
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,940
I'm sorry.

524
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,550
I see.

525
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,120
You have a million things to do every day.

526
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,950
It would be impossible to cover every single issue in a perfect way.

527
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,650
I understand.

528
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,270
Thanks for understanding.

529
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:08,120
If there is no other business, I might now take my leave.

530
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,720
Lu Wen,

531
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,180
there is something I want to confirm with you.

532
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,000
We're still

533
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,939
on the same boat, aren't we?

534
00:42:28,939 --> 00:42:34,340
It depends whether we are heading in the same direction.

535
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,030
