[Episode 39]

18
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,200
So our previous guesses are all wrong.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,280
Professor Ji isn't Jiahui's adoptive father, but his biological father.

20
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,920
Jiahui has been brought up by his adoptive father.

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,920
In this case, Fu Tang is Professor Ji's patient.

22
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
But there is something wrong.

23
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,610
Fu Tang said she was taken away by Jiahui's adoptive father.

24
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,150
Then Jiahui should hate his adoptive father more.

25
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,350
Why does he hate Professor Ji?

26
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,020
We don't know how Jiahui gets along with his adoptive father.

27
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,940
But we know one point.

28
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,360
It was his biological father's absence that led to all these miseries.

29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,430
Maybe he transfers this hatred to Professor Ji.

30
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,150
He's been abandoned by his biological father. Of course, he'll hate him.

31
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,950
Keep your voice down. They're outside.

32
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,950
So what?

33
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,910
Can't I even express my emotions?

34
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,020
He's indeed pitiful.

35
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,050
But he did something wrong to you.

36
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,200
If it were me, I wouldn't have let him in.

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,000
Is it right, Lili?

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,200
Don't taunt me in insinuation.

39
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,500
It is a special situation, isn't it?

40
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,340
That's his biological mother, right?

41
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,980
I won't compromise in matters of principle.

42

Let's go.

47
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,240
I can't compromise.

48
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,513
Thanks.

49
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,580
Can you play a song for me?

50
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,010
I'd like to hear it.

51
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,113
Please.

52
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,640
Very good.

53
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,630
Look at my left hand.

54
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,110
Did you see it?

55
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,530
Raise your left hand like this.

56
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,580
That's right.

57
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,270
Put it here.

58
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,970
Here. Right.

59
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,500
Move it ahead a little bit.

60
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,311
Hang it over here.

61
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:59,043
Use your chin to pin it down.

62
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:02,001
Perfect. Let's play a long note.

63
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,593
Look.

64
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,990
Play a long note.

65
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,363
Music

66
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,950
is flowing.

67
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,360
I can see

68
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,040
it flowing.

69
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,190
Does it look good?

70
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,223
Yes.

71
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,770
It's flowing

72
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,950
with colorful lights.

73
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,453
Enough.

74
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:38,520
Let's go.

75
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,141
- Let's go.
- Didn't you say it looked good?

76
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,630
Nothing can be retained.

77
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,653
No wonderful things can be retained.

78
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,990
If only I had a music box.

79
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,540
Then I could keep

80
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,623
the music in the music box for some time.

81
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:59,360
That's right, a music box.

82
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,280
Yes.

83
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,370
So I like a music box best.

84
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,513
It can

85
00:08:05,513 --> 00:08:07,950
collect the music.

86
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,030
I like a music box best.

87
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,460
Memories can also be put inside.

88
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,920
So can everything wonderful.

[Exert behavior of no excitement]

90
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,390
I really don't know if I should trust him.

91
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,500
Miss He, I didn't want to lose my temper.

92
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,203
But the moment I thought of what I saw, I…

93
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:37,770
How could he do that thing?

94
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,000
Did you mean Old Song?

95
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,360
I really hope I saw it wrong.

96
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,531
- It's so high-end.
- Of course.

97
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,583
Get in the car.

98
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,690
She said she had seen everything.

99
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,160
She pulled a long face when I came back.

100
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,950
But that's not like what she said.

101
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,460
Nothing has happened.

102
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,690
Old Song, calm down.

103
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,423
Take it easy.

104
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,430
Li Lanzhi, mentioned by Fang, set up a stall

105
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,100
accidentally next to my company.

106
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,450
We're on the same way back, anyway.

107
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,780
I thought it was tiring for her to carry so many things.

108
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,400
So I wanted to give her a ride.

109
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,090
That's all for our relationship.

110
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,060
Then how do you understand Fang minded it so much?

111
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,830
She likes to speak or act on hearsay.

112
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:08,040
Once she hears of something, she will exaggerate it.

113
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,900
So you think Fang's guess about this matter is ungrounded and fake?

114
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,970
Of course, it isn't true.

115
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,730
After so many years spent with her, I know her well.

116
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,000
I just talked more with others.

117
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,641
But she thought we had had an affair.

118
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,860
Shall I turn off the air conditioner?

119
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,800
No, I'm not cold.

120
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,550
Brother Chang, you drove your boss's car.

121
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,880
What about him?

122
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,130
He'll call me if he has anything to do.

123
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,670
How lordly!

124
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,710
So in your description, you communicate with Li Lanzhi

125
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,150
in a different way from with Fang.

126
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,410
Yes.

127
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,850
I'm a man.

128
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,700
I also hope my wife can adore me

129
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,620
and care about me more in life.

130
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,540
But you know how Fang is.

131
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,500
So due to Li Lanzhi, you feel a little disappointed about your marriage.

132
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,350
It can be said so.

133
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,400
But we really didn't have an affair.

134
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,710
I don't have the guts.

135
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,570
You hid your emotional needs from Fang.

136
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,210
And your relationship with Li Lanzhi makes you

137
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,200
guilty about your marriage.

138
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,800
I never have that in my mind.

139
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,150
But when it comes to guilt…

140
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,170
She won't understand it.

141
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,340
I just hope Fang can be more considerate and gentler to me.

142
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,820
I never want to replace her with another woman.

143
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,350
After he knew that woman, he came back later.

144
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,000
Could a group of old men dance so late?

145
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,940
I'm sorry.

146
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,703
I just wanted to spend a little more time with Li Lanzhi.

147
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:57,280
He did not only come back late, but also lied to me.

148
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,170
Then why do you think Fang has a new misconception about you?

149
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,130
It's perhaps because of those days

150
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,410
when Li Lanzhi just joined us and wasn't familiar with dance steps,

151
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,430
so after dancing, I taught her alone

152
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,380
and went back over ten minutes late.

153
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,770
He usually came back at eight o'clock,

154
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,760
but that day, he didn't come back even at nine o'clock.

155
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,240
Then I called him.

156
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,810
Fang then called me.

157
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,710
I asked where he was.

158
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,520
I lied to her.

159
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,800
He said he was eating night snacks with a dance partner.

160
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,340
But unexpectedly, my dance partner who went back first exposed my lie.

161
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,920
When I went downstairs, I saw his dance partner taking a walk with his wife and child.

162
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,500
What about him? He must be on a date with that woman alone.

163
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,360
She said… He must be on a date with that woman alone.

164
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,680
- He said he was eating night snacks with a dance partner.
- I just went dancing.

165
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,480
Nothing happened.

166
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,690
But unexpectedly, my dance partner who went back first exposed my lie.

167
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,590
Get ready! Right.

168
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,430
Left. Right.

169
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,140
Two, three. Turn your body.

170
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:58,350
Look, we were just dancing like this, devoid of any intimacy.

171
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,020
He did such a thing.

172
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,400
How could I not suspect him?

173
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,860
I understand your feelings.

174
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,400
Lying will make you angry

175
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,870
and damage the trust between you.

176
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,510
You wanted to avoid Fang's discontent and complaints,

177
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,700
just in a pattern of seek-and-run we mentioned last time.

178
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,190
You wanted to get some breathing room by avoiding.

179
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,310
Yes.

180
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,040
Most of the time, I could fool her.

181
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,150
But she found it by accident that time.

182
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,450
I have no other choice.

183
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,860
I can't break off with all women except her just because of her doubt, right?

184
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,290
Is that Fang's request?

185
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,410
No, she didn't say that.

186
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,930
But do you know how she talked about the business

187
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,020
between Li Lanzhi and me with her relatives and friends?

188
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,270
I think that's just what she wants.

189
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,350
Faced with Fang's discontent and complaints, you've compromised.

190
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,140
But there is also much discontent accumulated in your heart.

191
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,850
Not really.

192
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,020
She has been dominant since we fell in love.

193
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,160
I'm used to it.

194
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,860
If there is a person who she doesn't allow me to have something to do with, I'll have to avoid him.

195
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,480
You don't want him to have contact with other women.

196
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,760
He was afraid you would get angry, so he lied to you, right?

197
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,320
In fact, I know

198
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,000
he doesn't have the guts to do that.

199
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,640
So she always asked you to break off with some people.

200
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,073
Yes.

201
00:15:36,073 --> 00:15:41,020
I don't want him to obey me or want to control him.

202
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,280
I just think without me, he could do nothing.

203
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,450
A while ago, one of my classmates at high school contacted me.

204
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:54,350
But when I was ready to go to see him, she purposely asked me to do something else.

205
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,980
One of his classmates at high school

206
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,770
hasn't contacted him for a long time. But he came to our house and asked to borrow money.

207
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,760
If I hadn't stopped him, he would have pretended to be generous.

208
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,300
As time went by, my classmate didn't contact me anymore.

209
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,070
Is he kind or stupid?

210
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,710
What do you think?

211
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,900
She looks proud and arrogant.

212
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,710
But she also has many disadvantages.

213
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,680
She's so mean in life.

214
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,100
She has no discernment.

215
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,620
Besides, she tends to be brainwashed

216
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,340
by fake knowledge of keeping healthy.

217
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,410
It's more than wasting money.

218
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,860
She also always takes me as a guinea pig.

219
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,591
What makes me saddest is that she always told those rumors to others,

220
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,290
which embarrassed me.

221
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,800
Before meeting Li Lanzhi,

222
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,570
I thought it was no big deal.

223
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,000
But once having a comparison, I can see the differences between them.

224
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,160
No matter what I do, Li Lanzhi will respect me.

225
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,160
So she lets you realize you've been always unhappy with Fang.

226
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,570
Yes.

227
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,900
Sometimes, I did have that thought.

228
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,690
How was your relationship when you just knew each other?

229
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,900
Did she make a lot of demands on you?

230
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,150
In fact, at the early stage of our relationship, she was the same as now.

231
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,910
Then I thought she was capable and got things arranged.

232
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,880
I'm a little weak-headed.

233
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,160
There were some things she could help me decide.

234
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,860
You know what?

235
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,340
What a couple appreciates about each other in the beginning

236
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,090
is often what drives them apart in the future.

237
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,803
Yes.

238
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:28,960
This will happen over time.

239
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,240
She controlled everything of mine.

240
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,860
At first, I didn't want to argue with her.

241
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,581
But later, she didn't even bother to ask me for any opinion.

242
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,410
I can understand it.

243
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,350
In the beginning, you took her as your umbrella.

244
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,443
You would think she was warm and sunny.

245
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:49,440
But after a long time, you would find many disadvantages of her.

246
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,370
Most importantly, she tended to ignore your emotional needs.

247
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,730
Have you ever told your real thoughts to him?

248
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:02,040
For example, you want to help him get rid of this useless friend.

249
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Yes.

250
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,140
I told him that person came to him with a bad intention.

251
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,520
But how could I get it through to him?

252
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,250
Have you ever told your real thoughts to him with sincerity?

253
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,450
For example, you don't want a divorce.

254
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:24,201
Have you discovered you seem to often avoid expressing your real thoughts?

255
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,200
Is that so?

256
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,243
Let's have an assumption.

257
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:35,280
Old Song wants to go out to dance, but you don't want him to go.

258
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,880
What will you say?

259
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,100
Where are you going?

260
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,910
Look, you said "where are you going?",

261
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,170
instead of "please stay here or don't go".

262
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,400
Much of the time argument…

263
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,680
I'm going dancing.

264
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,170
Go to see that b*tchy widow again?

265
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,970
Your words are so sharp.

266
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,530
- Avoid…
- Who are you calling?

267
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,450
China Mobile.

268
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,660
- Abuse…
- You always behaved like this in front of others.

269
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,490
It's not the most direct way to solve those problems through external forces.

270
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,110
I think you'd better just speak it out,

271
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,760
which is easier and more efficient.

272
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,880
In each marriage, the priority and thoughts of each one are different.

273
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,800
But now that you're a couple, you can't just ask each other for something.

274
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,820
It's also very important to know each other's needs and contributions.

275
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,590
A marriage will be the stablest when giving and taking

276
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,800
strike a balance.

277
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,080
Before the end of this counselling, I'd like to assign homework to you.

278
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,280
After going back, you can recall when you argued most fiercely

279
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,270
over the years and record it.

280
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:40,073
I hope you can bring it to me when you come to me next time.

281
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,770
What do you think?

282
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,820
It looks good.

283
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,900
Your son is handsome.

284
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,900
So he looks handsome in each suit.

285
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,180
Pack them up.

286
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,310
And this.

287
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,843
All right.

288
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,110
How much is it? I'll pay it.

289
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,100
I'll pay it.

290
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,950
It's my gift for you.

291
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,701
Hello, the total price is ¥1,280 (~$190).

292
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,000
These two are too thick. I don't like either of them.

293
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,010
I'll take this one.

294
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,760
All right.

295
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,490
This one costs ¥350 (~$52).

296
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,100
It's fine. I can't wear them all.

297
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,130
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

298
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,580
Thank you for your patronage. Please take care.

299
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,043
Mom, I'm back.

300
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:14,110
Why didn't you call me in advance?

301
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,710
I'll cook some dishes for you.

302
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,330
There is no need. I'm not hungry.

303
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,280
Why do you just eat this?

304
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,831
If I cook many dishes, I can't eat them up.

305
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:26,300
This is enough.

306
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,520
- Mom.
- Sit down.

307
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,410
I'm sorry.

308
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:35,650
I shouldn't have talked to you so rudely last time.

309
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,380
It's fine.

310
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,860
I didn't take it to heart.

311
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,220
If you're unwilling, it's fine.

312
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,480
It's quite good to live with you.

313
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,720
Sit down.

314
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,590
You know what?

315
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,470
The supermarket offered a discount yesterday.

316
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,420
All the old ladies went there.

317
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,910
I bought grapes and watermelon, which are you favorite fruits.

318
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,300
I bought a bunch.

319
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,620
Look at the grapes. They're so fresh.

320
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,910
What's up, Mom?

321
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,910
My arm hurts.

322
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,120
What? Why does it happen?

323
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,680
Because I was too greedy yesterday.

324
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,850
I couldn't carry so much, but I still carried them.

325
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,721
I'm fine. My arm probably…

326
00:22:14,721 --> 00:22:17,540
I'll get you a plaster.

327
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,380
I suddenly remember I have something to do in my office this afternoon.

328
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,910
I'll put the plaster here.

329
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,960
Bye, Mom.

330
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,180
Be care, it's hot.

331
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,000
Have a good rest.

332
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,170
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

333
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,550
Really?

334
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,083
Yes.

335
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,200
Where do you want to go tomorrow?

336
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,040
Beach.

337
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,643
No problem.

338
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Well, you get some rest.

339
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,413
I'm leaving now.

340
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,760
I'm sorry.

341
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,960
If I had saved more money,

342
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,880
I could have bought the two coats.

343
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,880
[The Marvelous Snail]

344
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,250
Why are you unhappy?

345
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,930
Hasn't Xiao Jin replied to you?

346
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,070
I've made up my mind.

347
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,760
If he still doesn't reply to me, I'll defriend him.

348
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,513
Who cares?

349
00:25:23,513 --> 00:25:25,650
I think he's quite responsible.

350
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,940
Wait for a while longer. Don't defriend others so casually.

351
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,860
Didn't you go back to your mom's house?

352
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,760
Why did you come back?

353
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,900
When I arrived there,

354
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,200
I knew he would not come back anymore.

355
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,780
But for a while…

356
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,611
I don't know. I felt uncomfortable.

357
00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:50,860
I didn't know how to face my mom. So I left.

358
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,900
I can't believe you become independent so late.

359
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,020
Why do you taunt me today? Have you been provoked?

360
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,100
Who's it?

361
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,820
Who comes here so late?

362
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,320
Could it be your friend?

363
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,850
Why are you here?

364
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,410
Use our kitchen again?

365
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,520
I'm here to apologize.

366
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,010
I brought some beer.

367
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:37,310
If I don't drink it, perhaps I won't have the guts to say what I want say.

368
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,833
I'm sorry for

369
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,090
bugging your house.

370
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,590
How did you do it?

371
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,100
Do you remember you asked me to come over to your house to fix the Wi-Fi?

372
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,790
I found an opportunity to install a surveillance plugin on He Dun's phone?

373
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,150
Anything else?

374
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,000
And...

375
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,980
I made Lili fall down on purpose and gave her acupuncture treatments to win her trust,

376
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,060
approach Auntie Zhao and get some information from her.

377
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,543
- What the…
- Lili.

378
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,493
Anything else?

379
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:45,580
You've known the matters of Yao Kexin and your senior Li Yun.

380
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,910
I also tried to destroy your counselling

381
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,730
with each one of your visitors, including Zhang Lizi and Xiao Mo.

382
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,423
Ye Jiahui,

383
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:03,360
if you want to hurt Professor Ji and me, you shouldn't get others involved.

384
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,043
I'm sorry.

385
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,440
I'm so sorry.

386
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,410
Is it helpful?

387
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,761
I just hope you can forgive me.

388
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,833
Okay.

389
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,200
I'll ask you one last thing.

390
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,490
Is Fang Zhongyi's matter the show you made for us?

391
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,490
No, that's real.

392
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,210
Well, you aren't completely heartless.

393
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,630
I can't forgive you for now for other things.

394
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,680
But I have to thank you

395
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,040
for helping me that time.

396
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,893
Ye Jiahui,

397
00:28:42,893 --> 00:28:45,380
I think sometimes you're really horrible.

398
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,240
I really don't know which is the real you and which is the fake.

399
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,490
Take now as an example.

400
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,840
I don't know if you're sincere.

401
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,100
Today I'm here

402
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:02,120
just to apologize to you.

403
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,191
I'm grateful to have you guys as my friends.

404
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,060
It doesn't matter whether you forgive me or not.

405
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,490
I can accept all the consequences.

406
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,540
You know what?

407
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:24,200
You can't go back once you do some damage.

408
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,070
I was really happy

409
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,830
over the past days.

410
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,563
Thank you.

411
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,813
I'm sorry.

412
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,173
Ye Jiahui,

413
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,670
can we believe what you just said?

414
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,983
Yes.

415
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,740
It's time to get reacquainted.

416
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,450
Hello, I'm He Dun.

417
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,410
Nice to meet you.

418
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,183
Hello,

419
00:30:21,183 --> 00:30:23,040
I'm Ye Jiahui.

420
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,140
Nice to meet you too.

421
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,630
Well, in this case,

422
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,170
we're still friends.

423
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,973
Move back here.

424
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,060
Who's going to say it first?

425
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,280
Me.

426
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,240
The wedding between Fang and me was held in the Harvest Qilin Hotel

427
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,880
right next to the city hall.

428
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,970
Her mother said her daughter's wedding had to be held magnificently.

429
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,340
We planned to save the money to buy a house.

430
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:54,840
As a result, we appropriated part of it to hold a great banquet.

431
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:01,560
The rest was used to buy an aiwa recorder, an imported product, because she liked singing.

432
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,760
And we bought a video recorder.

433
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,460
Wasn't it because you liked dancing?

434
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:18,610
I didn't expect such a beautiful bride also liked money.

435
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,680
How much did you count?

436
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,200
Let me have a look.

437
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,110
Careful with it.

438
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,800
This camera gives a pretty good shot.

439
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,900
Of course.

440
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,780
I bought it in a foreign exchange shop. It's an imported product.

441
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,513
How much is it?

442
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,500
Over ¥5,000 ($743.35).

443
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,530
It's so expensive.

444
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,350
Are you angry?

445
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:49,190
Your mom just gave ¥5,000 as my dowry.

446
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,410
You think my mom gave you too little?

447
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,860
You've spent the money for buying a house.

448
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,510
When will we be able to move out?

449
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,160
All right, I'm wrong.

450
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,640
Heng Bin happened to come back.

451
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,440
I asked him to get a foreign exchange voucher.

452
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,450
He gave us ¥800 yuan. We can't spend this money.

453
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,960
The wedding between him and Li Yuan is coming up soon.

454
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,060
Don't buy things randomly from now on.

455
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,480
We can show it to him when he grows up.

456
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,160
Don't change the topic.

457
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,910
All right, you're the boss.

458
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,610
I won't do that anymore.

459
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:32,550
This is the first confrontation between you that lets you realize

460
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,520
your confronted views on consumption.

461
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,490
I compromised.

462
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,440
Then she was in charge of the money.

463
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,940
I had to ask her before I wanted to buy something.

464
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:48,680
Old Song, if I hadn't saved, could we have bought a house for us so quickly?

465
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,480
I admit you indeed had credit.

466
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,820
I'll say something too.

467
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,730
On Mao's 18th birthday, we had a big fight.

468
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,010
It was the summer of his second year of high school.

469
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,630
He was going to be a senior soon.

470
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,480
It happened to be his birthday. He wanted to watch a basketball game.

471
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,150
- Look at the camera.
- Watch out!

472
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,321
Don't hit others.

473
00:34:10,321 --> 00:34:12,380
Well, go over there.

474
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,570
I'll have a talk with your dad.

475
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,903
All right.

476
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:19,090
You acted before reporting to me.

477
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,450
I don't want to argue in front of Mao.

478
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,400
Take him back right now.

479
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,870
I've promised him.

480
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,780
This thing is so important. Have you discussed it with me?

481
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,060
His college entrance exam is coming up next year.

482
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,520
It's a critical time now.
[Evening News in City H.]

483
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,740
It's a once-in-a-lifetime exam.
[The superstar Kobe arrives in Guangzhou to start his journey in China.]

484
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,280
His 18th birthday is also once-in-a-lifetime.

485
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,900
Mom!

486
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,203
Help me hold this and record it.

487
00:34:37,203 --> 00:34:38,040
Do you know him?

488
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,710
He's Kobe who scored 81 points in one game. Is he handsome?

489
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,490
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

490
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,240
You record it yourself. I don't know how to use the camera.

00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,900
Go buy some water.

492
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,433
All right.

493
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:50,440
Go tell him right now.

494
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,160
Don't you know our Mao's situation?

495
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,470
He can just be enrolled in a first-tier university.

496
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,350
If he doesn't study in summer, his grades will be worse.

497
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,610
What if he's even worse than Heng Bin's son in the future?

498
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,900
Why are you so unreasonable?

499
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,050
Why do you always compare Mao with Heng Bin's son?

500
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,660
We're different.

501
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,080
Do you think I'm willing to do it?

502
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,840
If Heng Bin's son doesn't study well, he can go abroad because his family is rich.

503
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,870
Then what about us?

504
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,930
What can we provide for our son?

505
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,380
I'm also willing to let Mao live happily.

506
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,880
I'm also unwilling to force him.

507
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,930
Anyway, I've bought the ticket.

508
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,390
I move my hands off this matter now. It's up to you whether Mao can go.

509
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:36,300
Two thousand yuan traded for just this piece of shit paper?

510
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,820
Mom, you bought the ticket?

511
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,310
Your dad bought it.

512
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,143
Thanks, Dad.

513
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,430
Get him back now.

514
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,190
No. You go.

515
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,040
I won't go, either.

516
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,610
Then it means you've agreed.

517
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,350
That's quite another thing.

518
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,720
Safety is also very important when he's outside.

519
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,070
What if something happens to him?

520
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,840
He's grown up. What could happen to him?

521
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,570
I'll ask Old Yang to pick him up at the station when Mao arrives in Guangzhou.

522
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,360
With Old Yang and his wife beside, he will be safe.

523
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,950
What are you two talking about?

524
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,650
We're talking about you.

525
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,450
Contact Uncle Yang when you arrive there.

526
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,570
Don't eat what others give you in the train, got it?

527
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,850
In other words, the conflict between you hasn't been really resolved.

528
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:35,480
It looked peaceful on the surface just because of another person in your triangle relationship, Mao.

529
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,823
Yes.

530
00:36:36,823 --> 00:36:39,870
Even at last, she didn't agree with my decision.

531
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:45,430
It was just because Mao studied harder after coming back from Guangzhou that she didn't say anything.

532
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,240
Why did you have that feeling?

533
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,630
After Mao came back, we saw the photos he took in Guangzhou.

534
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,930
He's so tall.

535
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,140
Did Mao get his autograph?

536
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,470
How is that possible?

537
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,920
He's surrounded by so many people.

538
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,470
I'm not bad at playing basketball.

539
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:02,770
Why does he like a foreigner?

540
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,530
With your poor skills?

541
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,260
You're really something.

542
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,260
One wanted to watch a game, and the other bought the ticket.

543
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,730
Give a two-man comic show to me?

544
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,610
I did it for our child's good.

545
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,640
Didn't I?

546
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,990
Fortunately, our child is self-conscious.

547
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,670
I knew when he entered the third year, he would have no opportunity to go out for fun.

548
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,640
It happened to be his 18th birthday.

549
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,700
So I wanted to give him a break, which was indeed helpful for him.

550
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,780
Come on.

551
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,760
You knew his studying condition after that and take the credit now?

552
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,280
So you're a good person both ways?

553
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,440
Why didn't you tell all this to him before he left?

554
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,700
Did you give me a chance?

555
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,850
In fact, when you two just got married, the conflict between you was resolved.

556
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:55,380
An American sociologist Sandy Burchsed once said this.

557
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,740
A marriage can be divided into three stages.

558
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,000
The first stage is learning.

559
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,490
That's when you just got married.

560
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,640
You were trying to build a family together.

561
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,570
At that time, you had clear goals.

562
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,560
When you disagreed, you would reach a consensus easily.

563
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,030
You've spent the money for buying a house.

564
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,580
When will we be able to move out?

565
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,480
Buy a house.

566
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,783
Yes.

567
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:26,540
Buy a house and a car, as well as have a child.

568
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:31,670
Those goals united you together as one.

569
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:35,990
After your son was born, your relationship entered the second stage,

570
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,950
parenting.

571
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:42,320
You turned all your needs on your son and pulled him

572
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,030
into the relationship between you two to make your communication in a triangle pattern.

573
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:51,460
At this time, your conflict could be ignored temporarily

574
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:56,050
because you had a common goal, your child.

575
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,660
Even if the root of your problem couldn't be solved,

576
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,811
your relationship wouldn't be threatened.

577
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,530
No wonder every time Mao came back, we would argue less.

578
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:10,220
Our goal is to let Mao grow up.

579
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:15,751
But when your son gradually left the family, the problems

580
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:18,380
you didn't solve before would come to the surface again.

581
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,530
It's so rare.

582
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,303
Fang,

583
00:39:25,303 --> 00:39:29,760
you're the first to bring a family member to the party.

584
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,990
Your relationship is so good.

585
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,910
He just happened to be free today. So I brought him here with me.

586
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,730
I'm admiring you, Fang.

587
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:38,440
My husband isn't home all day.

588
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,280
Maybe he's drunk at a bar.

589
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,030
He's doing business to let you enjoy a good life.

590
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,350
No, he even doesn't care about me when I have a fever.

591
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:53,440
If I call him, he'll say he's busy and ask me to drink some hot water.

592
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,160
Men are the same. My husband, who can't earn a lot of money doesn't care about me, either.

593
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,860
He acts like a boss at home.

594
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,210
He even won't get the oil bottle erected when it falls down.

595
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,450
I think Brother Song is better than my husband.

596
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:06,800
Your husband obeys you. He doesn't even dare to pick up a piece of meat.

597
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,870
He has high blood pressure. The doctor doesn't let him eat it.

598
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,790
What nonsense!

599
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,930
Will I die after eating a piece of meat?

600
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,120
You always make a fuss and are paranoid.

601
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,390
No one can tolerate the life with you.

602
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,240
I save your face but you don't take it.

603
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,860
It's more than a piece of meat. This is mutton, a kind of stimulating food.

604
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,640
The doctor doesn't allow you to eat it.

605
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,430
Don't you know you have prostatitis?

606
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,430
How could say I'm making a fuss?

607
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,780
Are you in menopause?

608
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,841
Will you feel uncomfortable if you don't say anything?

609
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:37,530
- Do you really want to make a scene here?
- Calm down.

610
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,560
Who's making a scene?

611
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,410
Why do you always say I'm in menopause no matter what I say?

612
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,540
You're so bad-tempered. I think you're in menopause.

613
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:45,870
Don't take it to heart.

614
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,930
Come on. You make me embarrassed in public. I've had enough.

615
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,350
You're so old.

616
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,640
And the present is all your classmates.

617
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,500
Please be more normal, all right?

618
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,050
Who's abnormal, you or me?

619
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,280
It's you.

620
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,620
- I'm telling you, go live with the person who you think is normal.
- You…

621
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,120
Why are you leaving, Brother Song?

622
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,353
Brother Song.

623
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,853
It's okay.

624
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,660
Miss He, she's a person with a sharp tongue.

625
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,460
How dare you scold me?

626
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,720
Miss He, he always tells lies.

627
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,670
How could you say that?

628
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:32,830
I find if you two don't get the help from a third party, your relationship will worsen.

629
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,970
In fact, conflicts aren't horrible.

630
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:39,360
Conflicts are the hints that there is something wrong with your relationship.

631
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,961
As long as you solve those problems, your relationship will be kept good.

632
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:46,930
Now let's simulate a scenario

633
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:51,200
and watch the moments when you argued in the past,

634
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,600
Both of you try to be onlookers and understand each other's feelings.

635
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,870
And then tell each other the thoughts at the bottom of your hearts.

636
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,680
You brought this back today. What about tomorrow?

637
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,780
Bring her home tomorrow?

638
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,080
Do you want to keep this family?

639
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,020
Do you have a lot of resentment towards me?

640
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,360
You don't treat me the way you did when you were young.

641
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,460
You're not considerate of me at all.

642
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,380
You don't want me?

643
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,800
Fine, I have many wooers.

644
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,640
Will I die after eating a piece of meat?

645
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,930
You always make a fuss and are paranoid.

646
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:30,530
- I'm telling you, go live with the person who you think is normal.
- You…

647
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,250
Are you angry with me?

648
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,930
Don't you know that?

649
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,910
A man just wants his dignity.

650
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,760
I save your face but you don't take it.

651
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,350
It's more than a piece of meat. This is mutton, a kind of stimulating food.

652
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,120
The doctor doesn't allow you to eat it.

653
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,010
Don't you know you have prostatitis?

654
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,530
How could say I'm making a fuss?

655
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:52,200
Can you tell me what exactly you need?

656
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,180
This family doesn't belong to me alone.

657
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,390
I hope you can help me do the chores.

658
00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:02,090
Even if you don't, don't make a mess and just entertain yourself.

659
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,780
Am I hindering you from dancing?

660
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,860
I didn't say I would go to dance.

661
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,640
So are you going on a date with that widow?

662
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,490
You never speak out what you want, but always pick on me.

663
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,050
Tell me what you want.

664
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,030
I don't like you talk about family affairs in front of outsiders.

665
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,680
I wanted to provoke you at that time.

666
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,490
Are you in menopause?

667
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,350
Will you feel uncomfortable if you don't say anything?

668
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,570
Do you really want to make a scene here?

669
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:30,990
Now in retrospect, I think I shouldn't have done it.

670
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:36,130
I shouldn't have laid bare everything to embarrass you.

671
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:39,870
Then if something happens later, let's discuss it secretly.

672
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,820
Wu Shufang, why did you say that?

673
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,260
I have no affair with her.

674
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,310
There are so many people dancing together.

675
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,680
If you don't believe me, why not go with me to have a look?

676
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,880
I'm not going.

677
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,900
Did you really not want to go because you were not interested?

678
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,540
No.

679
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,343
I'm just

680
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,610
not used to it.

681
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,680
I'm old now.

682
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:23,470
When I was young, I liked to play,

683
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:27,840
sing and go to the park.

684
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,910
But now, I just

685
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,250
want to stay at home every day.

686
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:40,110
Every day after work,

687
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,780
I'm wondering when you'll come back,

688
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,070
when Mao will come back,

689
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:49,290
and what to eat tonight.

690
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,920
Mao has grown up now.

691
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:57,530
He comes back less and less often.

692
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:04,820
I only have you by my side.

693
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,710
