You chose to come here in the end.

19
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,620
I can't sleep.

20
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,859
I would stay up all night.

21
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:02,580
The night has become a slow suffering.

22
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,210
When it's finally dawn,

23
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,910
I hope the night can arrive soon because

24
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,190
I think I might be able to fall asleep at night.

25
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,370
But again, I still can't fall asleep when the night arrives.

26
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,600
So how long will you rest within 24 hours?

27
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,060
When I get exhausted,

28
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,999
I will take a 30-minute nap in my office during lunch break.

29
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:33,330
How long has this situation lasted?

30
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,190
Four or five days.

31
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,821
Have you ever encountered a similar situation before?

32
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,080
No.

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,719
What do you do when you can't fall asleep?

34
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,440
Take a bath or wash my hands.

35
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,270
Take a bath?

36
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,120
How many times will you take a bath on average every night

37
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,989
and how long will it last every time?

38
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:08,859
Three or four times and at least half an hour each time.

39
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:13,659
What does it mean to you that you repeat the action of taking a bath?

40
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,830
Is there any reason for you to do so?

41
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,339
Li Wei, I believe that you came here in the hope that I can

42
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,569
help you make some changes.

43
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:38,570
But if you won't tell me anything, it's difficult for me to help you.

44
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,500
I think

45
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,520
my body is dirty.

46
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,300
And does it have anything to do with what happened a week ago?

47
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,260
Don't worry, I won't make you feel sick.

48
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,450
That's it?

49
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,100
Miss He,

50
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,320
can I trust you?

51
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,980
Will you understand me?

52
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,519
Certainly.

53
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,060
You can choose to trust me completely.

54
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,169
Now there are just the two of us in this room.

55

No one can hurt you here.

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,100
Okay.

59
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,390

60

Wake up.

67
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,850

Director Qi,

72
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,579
I can't drink anymore.

73
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:11,999
How about this?

74
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:16,010
If you finish this glass of wine, I'll sign this contract with your company today.

75
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,060
Really, Director Qi?

76
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,880
Of course. Definitely sign it.

Come on, Director Qi.

78
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:26,850
Let me make a toast to you

79
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,380
- on behalf of everyone in my company.
- Yes!

80

Hear, hear.

81

I like a girl like Xiao Wei.

82
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,819
A good drinker, and a good saleswoman, too.

83
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:52,859
She's straightforward. I'd like to sign the contract with you.

84
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:55,029
- I'll pour you some more wine.
- I really can't drink anymore.

85
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:57,860
Come on. You'll be fine.

86
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,629
Don't worry, I'll watch for the amount.

87
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,610
A little bit. Just a little bit.

88
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,410
Don't worry, I won't make you feel sick.

89
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,800
You all right?

90
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,219
Director Qi, I'm okay.

91
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:18,010
Let me steady you.

92

Everyone has left the party.

93

The party won't be over since you're still here.

94
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,999
I wouldn't overstate my importance.

95
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,299
Director Qi, you must be making jokes.

96
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:28,289
I'm talking about the party of just the two of us.

97
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:30,140
Us?

98
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:37,819
Speaking of which, Director Qi, our project depends on us.

99
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:41,480
When will we sign that contract?

100
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,110
I'll go to the bathroom.

101
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,210
What was your reaction at that time?

102
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,380
I just felt that

103
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,100
my whole body

104
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,710
was frozen.

105
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,200
I couldn't even move.

106
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,769
Can I take it as that you were very unwilling to do it,

107
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:28,470
but you were unable to resist?

108
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,149
Do you mind telling me what you were thinking at the time?

109
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,659
I have no idea.

110
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,229
I went all blank.

111
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:48,540
I don't know what I was thinking.

112
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,980
The bathroom was so quiet.

113
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,200
All the sounds were terribly clear.

114
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,660
I will arrange for the next party.

115
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,369
I couldn't make a sound and I couldn't move either.

116
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:07,660
I dared not look back at him.

117
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,049
I could only force myself to stare at the ceiling lights

118
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:14,569
and I'd been keeping track of time in my heart.

119
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:17,890
I wished time could pass faster

120
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,800
and this could be over soon.

121
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,340
Did you choose to call the police immediately after that?

122
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,590
Did you do emergency contraception

123
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,290
and go to the hospital for related checks?

124
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,599
I did, but I didn't have the courage to call the police.

125
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:36,179
I felt like I was defiled.

126
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:38,830
I dared not tell anyone.

127
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,699
And I was really scared

128
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:45,279
so I returned home immediately.

129
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,490
I kept taking a shower

130
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,450
as if this was the only way to get myself clean.

131
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,830
This bastard.

132
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,550
Why did he choose me among all people?

133
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,910
Why do I... Why do I have to be a woman?

134
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,129
Tell me, why did he choose me?

135
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:12,199
Every day as long as I close my eyes, I will feel flustered and very scared.

136
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:14,470
So I can only take a bath.

137
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,700
I guess I will feel better

138
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,030
only during bath time.

139
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,740
So you are blaming yourself and regretting your choice, right?

140
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,590
I just have this strange feeling.

141
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,220
The more I think about it, the more I feel

142
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,739
uncomfortable.

143
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:38,839
Because you know, I didn't want it to happen at all.

144
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,540
But I…

145
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,370
Why couldn't I say no?

[Self doubts]

147
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,899
Is it because from the bottom of my heart I wanted

148
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,270
to be violated?

149
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,929
It's not like this, Li Wei.

150
00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:00,150
You know? Sometimes when people are under pressure

151
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,629
we will have very complicated responses and emotions towards it.

152
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:08,780
What do you think?

153
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,960
Have some water. Take your time.

154
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,810
Firstly,

155
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,609
did you really want to do it with him so you didn't say no?

156
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:24,420
That's not true. I wanted to say no.

157
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,550
But somehow I

158
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,730
just let it happen.

159
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,659
When he locked the bathroom door from inside,

160
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:37,560
how did you feel?

161
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,109
He suddenly appeared in the mirror and I got scared.

162
00:11:42,109 --> 00:11:43,230
And then I was dumbfounded.

163
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,809
When you were dragged to the cubicle by him,

164
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:48,100
what was in your head?

165
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,380
I felt like I was screwed. I couldn't get out.

166
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,831
He was so strong.

167
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:55,030
There was no way for me to break free.

168
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,079
Okay.

169
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,769
Now we already know objective factors of your body and the environment.

170
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:01,179
Let's think back.

171
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:06,209
What did the rapist do that made you so scared

172
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:09,350
in such a degree that you dared not resist?

173
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,610
He was very strong.

174
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,420
I couldn't get away from him.

175
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,049
Don't make a sound, unless you want to be heard by people outside.

176
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:24,069
Guess what they'll think of you if they hear your voice.

177
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:28,519
I'll be over soon as long as you do as I say.

178
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,340
So you didn't dare resist

179
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,539
because you were afraid that others would hear you.

180
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:35,320
So you thought this is a very bad thing, right?

181
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,390
Yes, Miss He. You won't understand.

182
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,129
My life would be ruined if someone heard us.

183
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:43,760
What does "ruined" mean?

184
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,230
Ruined means

185
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,149
my reputation will be discredited and I'll be fired.

186
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:52,839
Everyone will despise me.

187
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,180
You were afraid that your life would be ruined. This is totally normal and reasonable.

188
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,249
It wasn't your fault that you didn't resist.

189
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:02,409
There were too many things to make you feel scared.

190
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:05,630
You even showed a certain stress response.

191
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,110
[Self doubt]

192
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,660
Stress response?

193
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,710
Yes.

194
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,910
When we face pressure,

195
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,769
most of the time we are hard-wired to either flee or fight.

196
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,900
But there is another response called stupor response

197
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,130
which will make people frozen like you just mentioned.

198
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:30,329
Fear makes the brain region responsible for rational thinking impossible to function properly.

199
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:35,279
Actually, it's similar to an animal when it's in danger.

200
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,740
For example, many animals will play dead when they are in danger.

201
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,400
Possum will stay totally still.

202
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,460
And rabbits will choose to show their bellies.

203
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,339
So I couldn't make a sound

204
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:53,880
because of this response?

205
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,140
Yes.

206
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,670
Actually, 80% of victims have the similar situation like you.

207
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,930
So this is not your fault.

208
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,469
Yes.

209
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:08,489
This is my fault.

210
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:10,149
How can humans compare themselves to animals?

211
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,859
Humans can control their own behaviors!

212
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:14,299
Actually, not necessarily.

213
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:19,599
Sometimes our body's reaction isn't controlled by our consciousness.

214
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,250
That's not true.

215
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,859
It's my fault.

216
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:28,510
I could have resisted!

217
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,110
Li Wei, was there something else back then

218
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,439
which led to the unusually deep sense of guilt you're having?

219
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,110
Miss He,

220
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,199
is it possible that

221
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,770
I did not resist

222
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,760
because my body didn't want to resist?

223
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,060
Can you tell me more specifically?

224
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,280
Actually ,I was sexually aroused.

225
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,139
I can live with the fact that I was raped and I couldn't resist.

226
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:22,350
But why would my body betray me at the most critical time?

227
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,080
It's all my fault! Why am I so lewd?

228
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,400
Why?

229
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,490
Li Wei, Li Wei! Li Wei, calm down, okay?

230
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,590
I know that you want to hurt yourself now because it will make you feel better.

231
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,520
But you listen to me. You can't solve any problem in this way!

232
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,140
Let's calm down first.

233
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,980
Come on.

234
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,210
Put your hands here for now.

235
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,710
Can you trust me?

236
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,280
Let's calm down, okay?

237
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,440
You know,

238
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,861
actually, I had many visitors who came to me

239
00:15:58,861 --> 00:16:02,130
because they met the similar problem like you have.

240
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,779
It's just that this problem is rarely mentioned by the public

241
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:07,740
so not many people are familiar with it.

242
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,739
So you mean...

243
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:15,339
There are many people like me?

244
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:17,270
Yes.

245
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,911
Li Wei, the fact that you were sexually aroused does not mean you are lewd.

246
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:24,369
It does not mean you want yourself to get violated, either.

247
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:25,779
Like I just said,

248
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:31,019
sometimes our consciousness can not control our body's reactions.

249
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:35,149
There are many people who will get sexually aroused when they are violated.

250
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:38,099
Their reaction can be even more intense than usual.

251
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:40,449
But this doesn't mean it's their consent.

252
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,790
They just can't control it.

253
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:49,409
So it's normal that you feel bad because you're violated.

254
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,930
But you shouldn't blame yourself because of it.

255
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,670
Can you understand what I just said?

256
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,040
Don't touch me!

257
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,680
Don't be afraid.

258
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,310
Come on.

259
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,560
It's already over now.

260
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,810
You are safe now.

261
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,110
It's over.

262

[Garden House Coffee]

263
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,869
Brother Miao, I noticed that you're under the weather recently.

264
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:13,190
I made you a cup of granule for treating cold.

265
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,849
- You have a cold?
- Thank you.

266
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:16,759
Boss, we were just talking about you.

267
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:19,299
Director Pan came to talk to you yesterday, right?

268
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,729
He came to you at this timing.

269
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:24,249
So it must be about Time Interview.

270
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,680
I told Director Pan that

271
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,959
I choose Night Talk to Your Heart.

272
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,269
Boss, I think we can also do Time Interview

273
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:40,459
since we're provided with this opportunity.

274
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:43,559
Isn't it better for our team to have two ace shows at the same time?

275
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,580
We already have to stay up late to have topic selection meetings for just one show.

276
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,820
You want to do another show at the same time? What?

277
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,939
You want to live in the office and never go home again?

278
00:18:50,939 --> 00:18:54,369
Brother Qian, we are already practically spending every night in the station.

279
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:57,529
But to be honest, I am starting to love Night Talk to Your Heart.

280
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:59,799
And I want to do this show.

281
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:03,829
Actually, what we are doing now is something more meaningful.

282
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:06,290
But still, it's a pity.

283
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,579
I understand how you must feel now.

284
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:11,610
Frankly speaking, just like you guys, I don't want to drop Time Interview, either.

285
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,539
But did you forget that Night Talk to Your Heart

286
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:16,350
was liked by the audience because of its excellent content at the beginning?

287
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,099
You need to make a choice if you want to make the show better.

288
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:23,170
Then why didn't you choose to drop Night Talk to Your Heart?

289
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,200
Brother Miao, there is no difference which show to do as long as we can do it together.

290
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,470
Yes, Brother Miao.

291
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,350
I believe that Brother Qian loves Time Interview as much as anyone else here.

292
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,680
Yes, Brother Miao. Night Talk to Your Heart's so popular now.

293
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,539
We've already gotten a good hand.

294
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:42,629
What we need to do now is focusing on what we have at present.

295
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:44,459
We have ups and downs in life.

296
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:47,559
We can go further not to be obsessed with the past.

297
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,400
Yes, you can doubt anyone.

298
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,210
But you have to believe in Qian.

299
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,700
Okay. Everyone has worked hard recently.

Yes, I am.

I am from the human resource Department of Youwen Company.

313
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:31,279
You had a video interview with us through 58.com.

314
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,300
The interviewer believes that you are very suitable for this post.

Miss He, I really want to thank you.

323
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:04,660
I wouldn't have received this offer without your help.

324
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,970
That's not true. Actually, I didn't help you that much.

325
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,050
You earned it with your own effort.

326
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,759
Miss He, don't be so humble.

327
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,320
I wouldn't have become who I am today without you.

328
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,870
No one understands how painful I was at that time better than you.

329
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,000
You saved my life.

330
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,789
I just assisted you in analyzing how you felt and what you were thinking.

331
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:25,189
The rest is thanks to your own hard work.

332
00:21:25,189 --> 00:21:28,509
What happened after our last session? Did you communicate with your husband?

333
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:33,110
He… He still doesn't like psychological counselling.

334
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,800
He doesn't want to come with me to the counselling.

335
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,979
But Miss He, ever since I started to observe my emotions, I've realized that

336
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:44,899
my communication with my husband has become smoother and he has changed a lot.

337
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:48,649
This is great! I think you are gradually getting better now.

338
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:51,679
Do you still remember the cognitive triad I told you the first time you came to visit me?

339
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,100
Yes.

340
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,190
Myself.

341
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,800
Environment.

342
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,940
and one more, future.

343
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,859
At that time I felt like I couldn't do anything right.

344
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:15,639
Yes. But look at you now.

345
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:18,149
You are rarely in such a mental state now, right?

346
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:23,109
Miss He, so do you think I can be completely healed one day?

347
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:26,819
Certainly. Actually, depression is like a whirlpool.

348
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:29,800
The more you are depressed and feel like

349
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,350
nothing in this world can make you happy,

350
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,630
the more you will be down in spirits.

351
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,110
Look at you now.

352
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,369
I think you've improved by a lot.

353
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:41,610
You start to do what you once liked.

354
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,699
This is a behavioral activation.

355
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:45,359
Whether you're at home or go to work,

356
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:47,859
you can try to write down what you're doing and

357
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:50,639
observe the relationship between what you're doing and how you feel.

358
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:52,129
Stick to this habit for a week or two.

359
00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:55,409
I believe that when you have self-fulfillment and get a sense of accomplishment,

360
00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:57,110
your mood will get better and better.

361
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:01,769
Miss He, I am no in high morale by your words.

362
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:03,590
Your life will get better and better.

363
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,040
Miss He, thank you.

364
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,889
- What are you doing here?
- I brought you some medicine.

365
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:35,569
Thanks, that's so sweet.

366
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:38,750
Actually, I've gotten better after the acupuncture you gave me this morning.

367
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,980
Look at me, I can peel apples now.

368
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,979
By the way, where's He Dun? Why isn't she home?

369
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:45,350
Didn't she have an appointment today?

370
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,870
It was over. She just got a call and hurried out.

371
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,060
[Fang Zhongyi]
Lily, I'll arrive at your place soon.

372
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,579
Give me a second chance, will you? Can we talk?

373
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,080
Where's Tang Lili?

374
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,410
Who are you?

375
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,000
I am her neighbor.

376
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,249
Lili, it's okay.

377
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:18,880
Qian Kaiyi and I will come to pick you up.

378
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,500
Excuse me, Sir.

379
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,830
Officer.

380
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,560
You are quite well dressed.

381
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,020
Do you have to get physical when you guys have a dispute?

382
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,729
I will teach you something about the law today.

383
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,919
According to Article 43 of Law of the People's Republic of China

384
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:35,779
on Penalties for Administration of Public Security, whoever assaults

385
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:37,269
or deliberately hurts other people physically

386
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,969
will be subject to detention of five to ten days

387
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:42,479
and a fine of between two hundred yuan and five hundred yuan.

388
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:45,420
Even if it is not serious enough, you'll still be detained for less than five days

389
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,009
or a fine of less than five hundred yuan.

390
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:50,080
Although you guys reconciled privately,

391
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,590
if something like this happens again, I'll detain you, understand?

392
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,090
Yes, Sir.

393
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,429
What are you laughing at? Come here.

394
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:02,530
I'll need to take your statement, too.

395
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,260
Make yourself at home.

396
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,409
Do you have something to drink? I am thirsty.

397
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:17,700
How about beer?

398
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,289
- Sure.
- How much do you want?

399
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:22,050
Bring me a lot of beer. One bottle is not enough.

400
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:26,210
I can booze it up with you tonight since you came to pick us up.

401
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,700
You did make yourself at home.

402
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,780
Seriously, you can really fight although you look so prim normally.

403
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,249
I can't compare with you.

404
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:38,800
You're more suitable to be the bad boy.

405
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,610
Come on.

406
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,360
Cheers.

407
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,150
We built our bond in fighting and misunderstanding, right?

408
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,539
I kind of like your personality.

409
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:01,940
You are a good person.

410
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,430
Very kind.

411
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,190
Let me tell you,

412
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,529
let me tell you this, don't act like a staid scholar.

413
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:20,779
You are so eloquent when you talk about psychiatry

414
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:25,080
but you're so quiet and private in daily life. You can't be like this!

415
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,029
You will be at a disadvantage when you try to hit on girls.

416
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:31,610
Do your handsome face justice.

417
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,509
Come on. You're so lame, Qian Kaiyi.

418
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:37,810
You started to gibber when you just drank a little beer.

419
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,929
Let me tell you, I can drink like a fish!

420
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,539
No, you can't. Come for a drink.

421
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,729
I need to lie down for a while.

422
00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:53,560
Come on, Qian Kaiyi!

423
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,070
Come here to drink with me.

424
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,230
Let me take a break.

425
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,529
I won't go home, I'll crash here for the night.

426
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,710
He Dun,

427
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,689
I'm sorry. Because of him, I've said many things that hurt your feelings.

428
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:43,509
It's water under the bridge.

429
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:45,940
If you still feel sorry, just drink it.

430
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,470
Come on.

431
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,740
I didn't ask you to drink it up!

432
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,330
Don't go to extreme. Take it easy.

433
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,580
Sometimes you really look like a fool.

434
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,129
You know, sometimes I envy you so much.

435
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,179
I think you can talk to other people about your feelings when you're down

436
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:13,760
and you will apologize when you think you were wrong.

437
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,680
These things are easy for you.

438
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,920
But if it were me, I couldn't just do it so naturally.

439
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,520
You're silly.

440
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,739
I can't think of anyone else in this world who would make me do these things

441
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:28,370
willingly and happily except you.

442
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,230
You said you envy me?

443
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,350
I am the one who envies you.

444
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,040
Why?

445
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,260
Because

446
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:44,029
you believe in yourself from the bottom of your heart

447
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:49,129
and you never have the slightest desperation and doubt on your future.

448
00:29:49,129 --> 00:29:53,210
You are always so persistent and so sure.

449
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,320
You silly girl.

450
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,799
Unlike me, I got myself in a hot mess just by dating someone.

451
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,560
I'm not silly.

452
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,779
Anyone will get frustrated now and then.

453
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:08,781
I also have my moments of desperation. Don't worry.

454
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:11,969
One day there will be a very handsome guy

455
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:14,830
who loves you and cares very much about you.

456
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,519
At that time I will not stop you when you want to move out.

457
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,270
Why are you crying?

458
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,700
Don't cry.

459
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,620
Thank you, He Dun.

460
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:43,600
If I am to move out, I'll be doing it only to make room for you and him.

461
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,490
Look at you cry like this.

462
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,630
Let me tell you a secret.

463
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,710
I turned Jiahui down.

464
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,050
He asked you out?

465
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,160
When?

466
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,080
But I think it's a pity.

467
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,639
I remember that when you two first met you had a high opinion of him.

468
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:15,660
Black symbolizes prestige, elegance, low-key, and creativeness.

469
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,679
But it also means this person can be obsessed, indifferent, and defensive.

470
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:22,430
This kind of person is like a predator.

471
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:26,689
He's always at the top of the food chain in the crowd.

472
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,659
It's all right.

473
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:34,020
I will support you whatever your decision is.

474
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:45,780
What about the one who's in an aloha shirt?

475
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,509
Dear audience, good evening.

476
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:49,750
Night Talk to Your Heart is livestreaming now.

477
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:54,040
Let's welcome my partner, He Dun.

478
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,879
Yes, smile. Keep it.

479
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,710
He Dun.

480
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,190
What now?

481
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,419
Nothing. I just want to call your name.

482
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:04,590
Why are you staring at me?

483
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,830
You are more important than the painted stars.

484
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,510
Do I look a little more mature and stable in this outfit?

485
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:14,870
- I still prefer the way you are in an aloha shirt.
- I thought you liked it this way.

So do you like the way I look like a boy or a grown-up man?

I don't hate neither of them.

488

- Miao…

He's out of office.

Right.

Brother Qian.

Actually, Brother Miao…

You're back, Miao. I bought you bread.

No.

520
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,710
It's not the first time Dong and I roast each other.

521
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,049
It's my own reason.

522
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:31,380
It has nothing to do with other people.

523
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,049
How can it have nothing to do with them?

524

We are a team. So we face problems together.

Actually, I'll still be working in this radio station.

How could you poach him from my team?

I poached him from your team?

Do you mean Zhang Miao? It's not my decision.

I'm asking you why you poached him from me!

Qian Kaiyi, don't try to make a fuse here.

You couldn't make him stay on your team and now you're blaming it on me?

00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,100
You got desperate because Night Talk to Your Heart ranked first, right?

542
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,770
You didn't dare have a heads-on battle with me.

543
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,019
So you played it dirty.

544
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:04,119
I used to think although you were shameless, at least you'd like to abide by professional ethics.

545
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,480
- But now you're capable of doing anything.
- Watch your attitude!

546

Firstly, Our Time Interview ranked first for so many times I already lose count.

547
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:16,729
Night Talk to Your Heart just got lucky to rank first once.

548
00:37:16,729 --> 00:37:20,009
Secondly, I'll tell you one last time,

549
00:37:20,009 --> 00:37:22,230
Zhang Miao asked to join us himself.

550
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,050
- Bullsh*t!
- I asked to join his team!

551
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,040
Zhang Miao, deal with it.

552
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,250
We'll be waiting for you to start the meeting.

553

Say it. Why?

554
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,930
I always wanted to do Time Interview.

555
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:57,859
You promised us that the only reason we did Night Talk to Your Heart was to get Time Interview back to our team.

556
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:01,059
So we followed you to the project of Night Talk and we worked together towards that goal.

557
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:05,219
Now we are capable of having it back and yet you gave up on it.

558
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,760
No celebrities and no gimmicks.

559
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,150
We ranked first once this time.

560
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,530
But can you guarantee we can win again?

561
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,459
I really don't understand why you are so insist on doing Night Talk to Your Heart.

562
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:23,420
What's the point anyway?

This show has helped so many people.

564
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,870
It means nothing to you at all?

565
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,900
There are so many audience waiting for us.

566
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,220
How can we give up on them?

567
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,380
I'm sorry.

568
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,730
I am not so selfless and kind.

569
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,410
My current job can't arouse my enthusiasm for work.

570
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:45,209
We just come up with ideas and do research every day.

571
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:49,040
We don't have the opportunity to make our voiced heard.

572
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,989
Besides, don't you already have an expert to help you solve everything?

573
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:56,000
Why would you still need us.

574
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,010
Spit it out. Don't be so subtle.

575
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,190
Let me ask you,

576
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,630
do you have the guts to say that you didn't choose Night Talk for a selfish reason?

577
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,970
You are always like this.

You get dates through work and you use your dates to help you in work.

579
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:20,210
If this continues, can you still tell if you really mean it by what you say?

580
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:37,560
Now if you excuse me, I have a meeting to attend.

581
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,380

I'll try some.

583
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,280
There seems to be something missing.

584
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,560
Are you crazy from all the teaching?

585
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,499
How dare you question me in my field?

If you don't think it tastes good, go home and ask your wife to cook for you!
