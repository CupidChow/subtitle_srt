It's normal for an accident to happen among classmates.

It wasn't me who pushed her, Mr. Qian.

After reciting my part, I was waiting for her to recite her part.

I don't know how she fell down.

It wasn't me who pushed her, Mr. Qian, Miss Chen.

It's not that. I just want to know more details.

I just felt I was pushed from behind.

You Na, could it be that you tumbled because of

42

43

What did you mean by that?

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,569
Miss Chen, Xiao Zhe doesn't want to admit it's her fault?

45
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,990
She's the culprit. Why did she deny it?

46
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,130
It was her,

You don't want it?

I find there is such a recliner in all counseling offices in movies.

51
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:59,220
Over 100 years ago, the recliner was indeed one of the symbols of psychological treatment.

52
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,260
It originated from Freud's counseling office.

Why?

61
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,409
Because it'll greatly increase counseling time.

Besides, it doesn't suit the fast-paced life nowadays.

00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:44,390
You like a multiple-floor house, right?

161
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,980
That's it, 879B.

162
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,150
Good morning, Mr. Qian.

163
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,810
- Good morning, Qian.
- Good morning.

164
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,670
Good morning, Mr. Qian.

165
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,130
- Good morning, Kaiyi.
- Have you had breakfast?

166
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,560
Yes.

167
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,279
Why are you so late today?

168
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,150
Director Fei is looking for you.

169
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,200
Come in.

170
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,910
Come, have a seat.

171
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,440
Kaiyi, how is the preparation of your program?

172
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,710
- Ask me over here just for this?
- Of course.

173
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,540
Our department has nothing else now.

174
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,239
Director, you can't imagine that the Weibo post of reopening the "Night Talk to Your Heart"

175
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:53,229
has been shared over 10,000 times.

176
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:55,900
I think we choose the right strategy.

177
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,599
After all, a classic program has a large mass base.

178
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:02,361
Of course, This program is the first late-night talk show

179
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:04,809
of emotion category in our country. Do you know that?

180
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:07,399
Its hostess, Wei Lan, was an absolute goddess

181
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:10,689
- who wasn't less famous than those current celebrities—
- So, Director,

182
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,470
now that we have a famous program,

183
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,440
we should rejuvenate it in a new era.

184
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,810
I've decided on the theme of the first episode, "Return to 1996".

185
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,455
Whether we can make a turn counts on it.

186
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:27,149
Kaiyi, It's good that you're enthusiastic about working.

187
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:29,899
But remember to be down-to-earth.

188
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:33,449
It's good if you can make a turn, but if you can't, you'll be doomed.

189
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:35,470
Have you found your expert partner?

190
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,300
- Not yet.
- It's been two weeks.

191
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,279
Not all psychologists suit this program.

192
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,960
They need expertise and be compatible with me.

193
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,499
- The sparks between us—
- Qian, you gotta understand

194
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:52,399
Director Pan pays attention to our group not because of you.

195
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,660
Not because of me?

196
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,570
- Then because of whom?
- Because of the strategy in your plan,

197
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,509
combining professional counseling with the talk about emotions.

198
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:08,210
You must quickly find your expert.

199
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,409
Stop right there, I haven't finished talking.

200
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:14,130
Don't leave. Stay.

201
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,499
Kaiyi, I've thought about it.

202
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,400
Why not have another partner?

203
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,639
The three of you will definitely make something together.

204
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,229
I knew you came to me for nothing good.

205
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:27,670
What bullsh*t!

206
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,719
Have you ever heard different ideas confuse right with wrong?

207
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:32,839
Fine, tell me who will be my partner.

208
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,650
I want to know it.

209
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,320
Wang Zhuo.

210
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,790
Is it Director Pan's idea?

211
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,569
Mr. Ye, this detached house definitely meets your need for multiple floors.

212
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,160
What do you think of it?

213
00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:26,050
Director Pan, why do you want to insert Wang Zhuo
into my program?

214
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,060
Knock before entering.

215
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,450
Knock outside.

216
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,080
Come in.

217
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,589
Director Pan, at that time, when radio newscast viewing

218
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:48,780
plummeted by two-thirds,

219
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,179
the "Time Interview" took place of it.

220
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:54,110
But after less than three months, you replaced me with Wang Zhuo.

221
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,299
You said it needed a new host.

222
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:58,527
I didn't complain.

223
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:00,359
But now this new program hasn't started yet.

224
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,689
Why?

225
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:04,280
The "Time Interview" is our station's mega-hit.

226
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,130
It's to let you work together.

227
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,049
Your business plan has been approved.

228
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:10,499
Your program has been publicized, Its schedule has been arranged.

229
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:11,789
The sponsors have been found.

230
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:14,880
But when will you find the psychologist?

231
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,663
I'll be less worried if Wang Zhuo helps you.

232
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:19,150
I see.

233
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,699
You did all this not for me, but for the psychologist.

234
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,279
In one week, I'll find the psychologist.

235
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,690
If the program viewing is in the top three, don't replace me again.

236
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,225
If it's No. 1, give the "Time Interview" back to me.

237
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,670
Deal.

238
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,010
Wait for my good news.

239
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,917
You Na,

240
00:16:02,582 --> 00:16:04,349
although we've met each other before,

241
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,899
this face-to-face counseling might be different

242
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,750
from the talk on the phone last time.

243
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,420
What's the difference?

244
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,110
Last time, I helped you in order to ensure your safety.

245
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,860
But this time, I'm want to help you solve the puzzles in your life.

246
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,610
May I?

247
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,400
Yes, Miss He.

248
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,150
Relax.

249
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,010
Have you felt unwell recently?

250
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,740
I'm fine, Miss He.

251
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,320
All right, let's start.

252
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:48,772
Why did you choose to come to me?

253
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:50,809
My mother asked me here, so I did.

254
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,809
I know that.

255
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:56,010
But now you're sitting here.

256
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,670
I want to ask you,

257
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:01,960
don't you have any wishes or ideas?

258
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,670
We've met before, and you helped me.

259
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,439
If it hadn't been for you, I would not have come.

260
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:14,019
Thanks for your trust.

261
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:17,460
But I can see it's hard for you to trust others.

262
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,560
Now that you came to me, you must have a lot of things to share with others.

263
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,900
But you don't have anyone who you can trust, right?

264
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,350
I've told them many times that it was Xiao Zhe who pushed me.

265
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,590
It couldn't be Xiao Zhe.

266
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,630
Mr. Qian, is there a misunderstanding?

267
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,419
She's not like that.

268
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:38,579
She's never been angry with others since she was born.

269
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:44,020
Xiao Zhe's mom, we don't know for sure yet what happened on stage.

270
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,270
But in the dormitory, Xiao Zhe indeed hit You Na.

271
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:51,281
You Na is hurt and wants to commit suicide now.

272
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,761
So her mom hopes you can pay for some of the emotional damage.

273
00:17:57,761 --> 00:18:00,180
What do you think?

274
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:02,710
How much?

275
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,340
Xiao Zhe's father died

276
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,059
long ago, leaving only us behind.

277
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:12,740
So I don't have a lot of savings.

278
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,125
Mr. Qian, when Xiao Zhe pushed You Na,

279
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,690
was there anyone else with them?

280
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,975
Did anyone see it?

281
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,316
I saw it.

282
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,486
It's painful not to be trusted, right?

283
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,050
Xiao Zhe can always answer Mr. Qian's questions.

284
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,830
He must trust her more.

285
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,729
You think Mr. Qian

286
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:53,019
trusts her more, but his trust

287
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:57,280
is very important for you, right?

288
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,410
It wasn't like this before.

289
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,049
Well, that's all for today, You Na, please demonstrate this part.

290
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,660
All right.

291
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,859
My first gifts to my friends are books and music.

292
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:13,360
I hope they will bring them joy.

293
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,040
You have to practice your voice every morning to master the basic skill. Do you hear me?

294
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,379
Yes.

295
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:23,410
By the way, You Na, you're in charge of singing for your classmates' practice, okay?

296
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,040
Okay.

297
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,099
But everything has changed since Mr. Qian arrived.

298
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,780
Xiao Zhe, go to the gate and pick up Director Li from the Media University for me.

299
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,299
Tell the doorman he's the guest of the performance. Hurry up!

300
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,770
Okay.

301
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,680
I'm so jealous!

302
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,690
How come good things always fall on her?

303
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,630
Do you think Mr. Qian likes Xiao Zhe more?

304
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,230
I don't know.

305
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,220
Maybe he really doesn't like me.

306
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:22,279
You Na, I find what you care about isn't whether teachers recognize you or not,

307
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:27,350
but whether Xiao Zhe wins more approval than you do.

308
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,000
Why do you all think that she's not at fault?

309
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,630
Why is it always my fault?

310
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,150
Why am I so bad?

311
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,729
You Na, you're not bad at all.

312
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:44,360
You're great and outstanding.

313
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,980
I'm not.

314
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,770
Otherwise, why did my father even help her?

315
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,430
I think it's normal for children to fight with each other.

316
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,690
Don't be hard on the other child as well.

317
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,110
After all, they are about to take the college entrance exam, and they...

318
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,510
Na Na!

319
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,470
Do you think it was unfair to you that your dad defended Xiao Zhe when you got hurt?

320

Take this.

Na Na's taking the art exam soon. She said she needed a suit.

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,459
I thought Xiao Zhe might need one, too.

326

It must be quite expensive.

Take it.

All the other children have one.

Don't let it affect Xiao Zhe's exam.

I'm two intersections away from your school. I'll be there soon.

Isn't this the latest suit selling for several thousand yuan?

Xiao Zhe, you're so beautiful.

How do you feel as a boss on the first day?

I'm not a boss. Don't tease me.

Have you solved the problem?

350
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,710
Far from it.

351
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,149
Then why don't you come out? I'll invite you to a big meal for your studio opening.

Yes. 879A. Right here.

Excuse me, where's Qian Kaiyi?

This listener, you're a little unkind.

I heard you had turned down all the experts the station found for you.

00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,810
Pretty good. Do you have a trick up your sleeve?

395
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,580
Tell me so that I don't have to worry about you.

396
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,400
Well... I did find one.

397
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,310
I see. I'm going to tell Dongzi and the others to save their worries.

398
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,400
You don't look reliable,

but you always know what to do when it comes to work.

400

But I'm not that confident.

401
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:47,100
It indeed takes some time to persuade her.

402
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,300
Why?

403
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,950
The psychologist is indeed competent.

If I can persuade her to join us,

I'll definitely get it back.

You're so confident. Looks like this expert is of great importance, right?

But our program needs to be publicized at the early stage, right?

Think about it. If you do advertising well

440

and the expert signs the contract, this program will be a hit immediately.

Why should I publicize the program?

Forget about the chicken and the egg first.

445

You have to let the expert see listeners' needs and puzzles, right?

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,689
We… We don't have to do this like young people at this age.

482
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:25,569
It's a waste of money.

483
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:29,410
He said to me that I should

484
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,240
have what others have.

485
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:42,749
That day, Ling Ling's mom was also there.

486
00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:45,280
She said she looked younger.

487
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,000
And Mei's mom and Xuan's mom…

488
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,570
We're divorced.

489
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:23,259
Mom, the porridge spilled. I don't have time to clean it up. I'm leaving now.

490
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:25,119
Dun Dun, don't go.

491
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,809
Leave me alone.

492
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,559
I'm old enough to take care of my own affairs.

493
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,970
You'll regret it if you go.

494
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,209
You!

495
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,689
What are you doing, Tang Lili?

496
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:02,050
It's still early. What time is it now?

497
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,729
Finally awake?

498
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,159
Yes, you…

499
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,110
Why did you scare me early in the morning?

500
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,140
It's 7 o'clock.

501
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,469
Isn't it Saturday? Why did you get up so early?

502
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:15,750
Oh, yeah, it's Saturday.

503
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,420
I was awakened by your alarm.

504
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,420
I didn't set an alarm.

505
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,890
[You Na's Mom]
The eleventh time.

506
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,470
It doesn't matter. It's normal.

507
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,759
When you want to change your current situation,

508
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,019
it's more effective than you passively receiving advice from me.

509
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:42,479
Yes, Miss He. So I've discussed with You Na's father for a whole night.

510
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:47,339
We are determined to solve this problem together and let Na Na completely recover.

511
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:49,679
Are you available today?

512
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,329
We want to visit you at 10:00.

513
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,850
10:00?

514
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,509
No problem. See you later.

515
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,650
- Okay, thanks. 
- Okay, bye.

516
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,810
You've got a lot of business since your studio opened.

517
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:05,620
What's the situation about You Na?

518
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,239
Fine, I got it.

519
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,569
You have to keep your client's secrets.

520
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,679
You know me well, Lili.

521
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,849
That's boring.

522
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,971
Oh, are you busy this afternoon?

523
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:18,919
- What's up?
- I hired an engineering team.

524
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,049
Engineering team?

525
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,219
Although our house is new, there are a lot of problems.

526
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:24,609
For example, the sewer.

527
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:26,329
So I want to get them all solved in one go.

528
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,520
Good. Anyway, I'll go to visit my mom this afternoon. It's up to you.

529
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,170
Got it.

530
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,040
Na Na, you're in a good mood today.

531
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,809
People are in high spirits when involved in happy events.

532
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,960
- What's that?
- I don't know.

533
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,919
Your swimming costume looks great! Where did you buy it?

534
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:56,020
- Vipshop.
- She receives packages every day.

535
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,439
I'll have a look.

536
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,580
All the clothes look great.

537
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,050
Please take a look at this.

538
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,609
Sorry, Miss He.

539
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:30,875
Yesterday, we chickened out.

540
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:36,510
Mainly because we have never told others about the matter between us.

541
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,169
So for a while, we weren't prepared for it.

542
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,420
It's all right. It happened so suddenly.

543
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,667
Even You Na wasn't ready.

544
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,420
The reason I asked you how your marriage was

545
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,759
is that during the counseling,

546
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,979
I found her unusual behaviors had something to do with your marriage.

547
00:36:58,979 --> 00:37:03,679
So today, I want find a reason from your family relationship and interactions.

548
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,370
May I?

549
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,080
Then let's start.

550
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,920
When did you get divorced? Does You Na know it?

551
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,610
She doesn't even know yet.

552
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:27,709
I remember we divorced last year when she just started her second year of high school.

553
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:30,539
But because the college exams are coming soon,

554
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,830
we decided to hide it from her.

555
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,660
Why did you divorce last year?

556
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,720
Because he was going to hold a sculpture exhibit.

557
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,039
You Shanhua. why don't go home? What are you doing here?

558
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,990
Stay up all night?

559
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,220
I'm talking to you. Look at me.

560
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,569
Where are you going?

561
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,070
- What do you want?
- That's what I want to ask you.

562
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,919
You Na is at the most important time, the division of Arts and Sciences.

563
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:20,919
You don't care about her and help her choose,

564
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,420
but stay here all day long and focus on this sh*t exhibit.

565
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,909
She's come of age. I can't help her make this decision.

566
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:29,769
Now that you like to help others make decisions, why don't you help her?

567
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:31,180
Bullsh*t!

568
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,160
Why do I need you if I can do that?

569
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,119
It's because she has a dad like you that she says she wants to learn art every day.

570
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,239
I'm speechless.

571
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,329
It's good to learn art.

572
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:45,090
What nonsense! To become like you who has no achievements in life?

573
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:48,269
You wanted my opinion, and I said it was good.

574
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:51,230
But is it useful?!

575
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,029
Are you insane? Why are you shouting at me?

576
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,959
Fine, fine, fine!

577
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,849
Let her learn art and be like you, ambitious yet incompetent.

578
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,489
Like father like daughter. Is it good?

579
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:04,410
Don't mock me like this.

580
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:07,179
If you look down upon me, just say it. You don't need to get You Na involved.

581
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:10,230
All right, I indeed look down upon you.

582
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:15,170
You Shanhua, I'm telling you, I look down upon you because you can't earn money at all

583
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,579
but pretend to be a pure and lofty artist who dislikes money.

584
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:21,270
I look down upon you because you focus on the stones here every day

585
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,750
and leave your family and child behind. I do despise you—

586
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,280
I want a divorce.

587
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,860
What did you say?

588
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,920
I want a divorce.

589
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,920
Fine.

590
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,959
And then,

591
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,719
we went to finish the divorce procedures

592
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,910
when we were both available.

593
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:14,620
But we have agreed that we won't tell her

594
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,620
until college exams are over.

595
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,239
Could it be that You Na already knows about your divorce?

596
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,389
No way. We still live together.

597
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:23,239
We even still share a bed.

598
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,369
And she never asked about the business between us.

599
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:33,119
Miss He, do you mean Na Na did all this because of our business?

600
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,519
That's impossible.

601
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,849
It's because she had a confrontation with Xiao Zhe.

602
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,239
The teachers saw it.

603
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:45,890
As far as you can remember, when did Na start to have extreme behaviors?

604
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,980
Welcome.

605
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,840
What do you need?

606
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,040
Girl, I'll help you find it.

607
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,429
Catch the thief! Stop! Catch the thief!

608
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,990
Catch the thief! Stop!

609
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,090
Catch the thief!

610
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,790
What's wrong with you? You're so slow.

611
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,580
Na Na!

612
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,690
- Sorry, we're a bit late from the airport.
- What are you wearing?

613
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,270
How did you get so dirty? What's this?

614
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,279
Sign this.

615
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,800
Wait. Sir, she usually behaves well. She's unlikely to steal anything.

616
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,759
Yes, there must be a mistake.

617
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,919
Here is the video evidence.

618
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,360
No mistake.

619
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:54,450
I'm telling you, you're also responsible

620
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,369
for your child's mistake.

621
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,710
Teach her what she can't do.

622
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,879
Considering she is still a student and she just made a minor mistake,

623
00:42:00,879 --> 00:42:03,060
the owner of the convenience store won't sue you.

624
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,369
Just compensate him for the damage.

625
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:09,669
All right. H-h-how much? I…

626
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,511
- He's over there.
- The child's mom, sign it.

627
00:42:12,511 --> 00:42:15,179
- Hi, I'm the child's father.
- Hello.

628
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:17,999
Thanks for forgiving my child.

629
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,809
Well, how much have you lost?

630
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,279
I can give you more.

631
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,650
Thirty yuan for five bags of chips.

632
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,420
Chips?

633
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,549
If she did this just for the excitement from stealing,

634
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:39,049
puffed chips with the most obvious packages

635
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:43,159
are the least easy to hide and the least valuable option.

636
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:45,759
Did you ask her later why she did this?

637
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,569
Yes. She said she did it for fun, regardless of the consequences.

638
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:53,060
W-w-we've harshly scolded her.

639
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,510
There might be another reason.

640
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,129
There's no other possibility.

641
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,089
Children are of curious nature.

642
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,649
She said she did it for fun.

643
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,609
- Since then…
- Is it a misunderstanding?

644
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:05,369
She hasn't done it again.

645
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:10,090
By the way, five bags of chips worth 30 yuan in total are nothing to our family.

646
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,850
She doesn't need to steal.

647
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,409
She usually behaves well.

648
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,809
She's unlikely to steal anything.

649
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,960
Yes, there must be a mistake.

650
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,300
I want a divorce.

651
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:28,759
She usually behaves well. She's unlikely to steal anything.

652
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:30,719
Yes, there must be a mistake.

653
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,099
Na Na's taking the art exam soon. She said she needed a suit.

654
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:36,779
I thought Xiao Zhe might need one, too.

655
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:40,869
I think it's normal for children to fight with each other.

656
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:43,070
Don't give the other kid a hard time.

657
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:45,180
After all, they are about to take the college entrance exam, and they

658
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:49,749
But you care more about whether Xiao Zhe wins more approval than you do.

659
00:43:49,749 --> 00:43:52,199
Why do you all think that she's not at fault

660
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,229
After reciting my part, I was waiting for her to recite her part.

661
00:43:54,229 --> 00:43:55,809
I don't know how she fell down.

662
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:59,180
She's the culprit. Why did she deny it?

663
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,610
