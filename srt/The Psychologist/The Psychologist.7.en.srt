You're so famous. How could I not know you?

Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.

33
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,229
I can tell you've got a serious problem with me. Am I right?

34
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,600
Since you have a problem with me, why don't you tell everyone about it on the live radio show

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,830
so that everyone could hear you?

Night Talk to Your Heart as a loyal friend for their psychological growth.

The show was the top among the emotional programs in the 1990s.

56
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:23,949
This time, we managed to keep the essence of this program and also invited Miss He Dun,

00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,239
a prestigious psychologist, as a guest to our show.

Well, now, we got the first call for today's show.

61
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,050
Let's answer it together.

62
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,930
Hello, listener.

63
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,199
Hello, Mr. Qian. I'm Xiao Wen.

64
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,390
Hello, Xiao Wen.

65
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,110
Mr. Qian, I have a question for you.

66
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,720
Go ahead, please.

67
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,849
Mr. Qian, why would you choose an expelled psychologist to be your partner?

68
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,909
Was that intentional? How could she say that?

69
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:20,769
He Dun is so unlucky. She met someone who caused trouble at the start.

70
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:23,240
Her mind might go blank.

71
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,620
I don't think so.

72
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:31,249
First, I'd say sometimes what we hear and see on the internet doesn't cover the whole story.

73
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:33,970
I hope you can treat the issue rationally.

74
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,470
Second, I chose Miss He

75
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,450
because of a phrase she once said to me.

76
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,930
There is a limit to how much suicide intervention can do.

77
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,430
I want to help more people.

78
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,700
She wants to get more people out of the tribulations.

79
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,140
Then, I'd like to ask Miss He.

80
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,770
Miss He, did you get out of the tribulations?

81
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,210
Look at that, are you afraid to answer my question?

82
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,180
If I tell you that I've led myself out of the tribulations and that I'll never get involved again,

83
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,410
will you believe me?

84
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,060
No, I don't believe you.

85
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,989
Xiao Wen, we all need to go through our own hardships.

86
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:41,110
It's impossible for us to avoid such suffering.

87
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,500
I'm the same.

88
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,100
Growing up is a lesson for us to learn in our life.

89
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,910
What we can do is to keep a dynamic balance.

90
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,390
Everyone gets lost now and then.

91
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,320
I believe you just got lost.

92
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,380
You will finally lead yourself through it.

93
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,949
That's right. Xiao Wen, for any doubts you have in your life, you're welcome to tell us. Perhaps we can help you—

94
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:04,100
You abandoned me because of her.

95
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,510
Dear listener, thank you for your appreciation.

96
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,790
Also, thank you for your support for the show.

97
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,370
However, you need to respect the truth.

98
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,110
Do you know her or not?

99
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,190
If you know her, I need to know about it. It's necessary for our communication.

100
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,830
I really don't know her.

101
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,230
Qian Kaiyi, are you humiliating me in public?

102
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,110
How could you do that to me?

103
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,590
Well...

104
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,319
Calm down. Let He Dun handle this.

105
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,010
- Xiao Wen, can I have a chat with you?
- I have nothing to say to you.

106
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,209
You wouldn't have made this call if you didn't want to talk to me.

107
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:56,210
You calling us showed that you still wanted to talk to someone, right?

108
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,259
You've been doubting me during the live radio show.

109
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:01,640
You said some fierce words.

110
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,450
I understand you were doing this to frighten me.

111
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,690
However, I saw fear in your eyes.

112
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,810
I know you recognize me as a great threat.

113
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,799
You think I'm destroying a relationship in which you deem very precious.

114
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,390
That is, the relationship between you and Qian Kaiyi,

115
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,960
right?

116
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:43,479
However, I can tell that Mr. Qian doesn't remember much about you.

117
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:49,300
If what I think is correct, you two have never met before, have you?

118
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,050
No.

119
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,310
We haven't met before.

120
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,350
But you know him.

121
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,770
You two have been in contact.

122
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,230
Yes.

123
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,660
We've been in contact.

124
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,180
We communicate on a weekly basis.

125
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,200
I've been sending Mr. Qian an email every week.

126
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,060
And Mr. Qian replies to my email every time.

127
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,540
We... We're good friends.

128
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,639
You're that listener who keeps sending me emails.

129
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,400
Yes, that's me. It's me, Mr. Qian.

130
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,450
We've been in contact.

131
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,280
However...

132
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,949
- However, you hardly replied to my emails recently.
- No.

133
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:47,100
Did you dump me for someone else?

134
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:56,000
Xiao Wen, I can tell that Mr. Qian didn't realize

135
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,550
how important he is to you.

136
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,040
But you trust him and rely on him very much.

137
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,789
You even take your daily communication as your emotional support.

138
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:09,631
When your communication suddenly ceased,

139
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:13,100
you started to feel depressed and broke down.

140
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,199
That's right. That's how it is.

141
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:18,989
Every week, I've been waiting for Mr. Qian to reply to me.

142
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:22,080
You never bailed on me before.

143
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,520
Let me guess, this is not the first time

144
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,720
that you have this pattern of relationship.

145
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,999
You had a similar pattern of relationship before Mr. Qian.

146
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,779
You became very dependent in this kind of relationship.

147
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:45,349
But in the later part of this kind of relationship, you always felt that you were abandoned, right?

148
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:48,210
I don't know why.

149
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Why this always happened?

150
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:59,220
So you're afraid that Mr. Qian will abandon you, give up on you like all the others did.

151
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,470
Xiao Wen,

152
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,590
I remember you.

153
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,750
You've been an important listener to me.

154
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,010
However, I never realized that I've become so important to you.

155
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,150
I felt bewildered recently.

156
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,880
I didn't mean to distance myself from you.

157
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,379
I've been working on a show that means a lot to me.

158
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,520
Perhaps our first meeting is not perfect.

159
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,780
But I want you to know that you're still

160
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,280
the most important listener to me.

161
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,729
Xiao Wen, you may have experienced this pattern of relationships many times,

162
00:12:57,729 --> 00:13:02,479
all of which made you feel vulnerable and depressed.

163
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:07,619
But trust me, you can come out of that terrible suffering.

164
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:12,820
If you trust me, I could give the name of a prestigious psychological counselor.

165
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,100
Would you give yourself such a chance?

166
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,320
You're back.

167
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,519
Hey, Jiahui. Taking out the trash?

168
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,279
Yes. Congratulations! I listened to the radio show. It was great.

169
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,320
Thanks.

170
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,030
As a psychologist specializing in crisis intervention, you're admirable.

171
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,690
Such a crisis won't happen again.

172
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,210
What happened to your elbow?

173
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,499
It's okay. It's just a graze.

174
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,430
Come to my place, I'll treat your wound.

175
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,329
Never mind. It's no big deal.

176
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:42,319
It's okay. Just think of it as my paying back for your fruit.

177
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:44,440
Otherwise, I'll feel I owe you something.

178
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,879
Jiahui, it's actually a minor injury. I'm totally fine.

179
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,799
Now I see you never let yourself to be taken care of by others.

180
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,959
Actually, they have treated my wound back in the radio station.

181
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,440
As for what happened today in the radio station,

182
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,000
that girl seems to be a fanatic who has the delusion of being loved.

183
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,210
Generally, people like that are self-consistent.

184
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,430
They're unlikely to turn to someone for help.

185
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,399
Each setback or destructive transformation is with the same or greater beneficial seeds.

186
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,470
By Emerson.

187
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,549
Actually, I wanted to help her. But I can't do that.

188
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:30,919
She's paranoid and suspicious, which drove her to attack you.

189
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,440
She showed great hostility toward me.

190
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,760
If I start a counseling relationship with her,

191
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,300
her animosity will do her no good.

192
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,039
So I referred her to a psychological counselor whom I trust a lot.

193
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,789
When the wound becomes inflamed, white blood cells start to devour foreign material.

194
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:49,080
Then the white blood cells die and are lost from the body.

195
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,440
That's the end of disinfection and sterilization of the wound.

196
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,010
No injury, no need for healing.

197
00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:00,099
It takes a lot of effort for a psychological counselor to get to know someone's mind.

198
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:01,840
She is not a god.

199
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,569
Jiahui, thank you. It's getting late. I'll leave you alone. I'm going.

200
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:10,500
- Please let me walk you home.
- Please don't.

201
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,189
If Tang Lili sees you sending me home late at night, we'll never hear the end of it.

202
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:15,560
Bye.

203
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,540
Cool, the show has become a trending topic.

204
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,900
We got so many comments. I have but two hands.

205
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,610
Great. Let me help you.

206
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,530
Good for you, Qian. The show went trending right after its debut.

207
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,499
Come on, ask Director Pan to give you credit. Come on.

208
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:12,110
I owe you guys big time.

209
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,880
- I'll treat you to a nice dinner.
- You better keep your word.

210
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,260
We'll have hotpot and barbecue.

211
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,660
Okay, I'll tell Xiong Qiao.

212
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,600
A'Yi, come over here.

213
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,700
See?

214
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,349
I heard the girl in that room is also a psychological counselor.

215
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:32,760
Is Wang Zhuo trying to...

216
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,519
It's my honor to have Miss Wen in our radio station.

217
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,710
Mr. Wang, I've heard of you a lot.

218
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,850
Enjoy the tea.

219
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,951
Recently, I feel upset, restless, and miserable.

220
00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:15,099
Every night, I lie in bed with my eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling till it is light.

221
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:19,160
Everything tastes like sawdust to me.

222
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,059
I've gone to all the prestigious hospitals, only to be told that I'm all right.

223
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,570
Report?

224
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,800
I mean your medical examination report.

225
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,820
I've been to departments of medicine, surgery,

226
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,460
E.N.T,
(T/N: Otolaryngologists who diagnose, manage, and treat disorders of your head and neck)

227
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,660
and cardiology.

228
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,819
I've undergone CT, Patient list Examine Review Print System

229
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:51,020
blood test,

230
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,000
massage,

231
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,920
and acupuncture.

232
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,880
Am I all right?

233
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,189
According to your medical examination report, there is nothing wrong with you.

234
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:09,680
I feel I'm dying. How come there is nothing wrong with me?

235
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,190
Director,

236
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,170
am I under a spell?

237
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,799
Let go of me! Let go of me!

238
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,770
Get out of here!

239
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,660
Sir, are you alright?

240
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,820
Do you need a carer?

241
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,710
I'm sick.

242
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,880
I need to see a doctor.

243
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,520
Mr. Xun, Mr. Xun... Well... What are you doing here?

244
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,830
Why wouldn't you stay at home?

245
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,669
You insisted on visiting the hospital and now you got mistreated.

246
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:44,070
I went to this public hospital

247
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,160
because I wanted to have a thorough

248
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,170
physical checkup in all the departments.

249
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,170
However...

250
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,780
Calm down, calm down.

251
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,430
No one would tell me the truth.

252
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,139
Mr. Xun, please don't say that. Look at me.

253
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:05,110
I'm absolutely loyal to you.

254
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,800
Then answer my question.

255
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,969
- Do I look sick to you?
- What's wrong with you?

256
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,349
- You psychopath!
- Who called me a psychopath?

257
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:25,630
You're a psychopath!

258
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,230
That's the last piece of the puzzle!

259
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,049
- Hey.
 - It's me, Ji.

260
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,550
Why are you calling at this hour?

261
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,350
W-w-well, here is the thing.

262
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,060
A friend of mine has gone mental.

263
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:00,520
You're a prestigious psychology professor.

264
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,050
Do you think you can meet him?

265
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,640
Old Xun, I'm afraid my hands are tied here.

266
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,310
How come?

267
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,900
We've been good friends for so many years.

268
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,610
The duality of the relationship is not conducive to counseling.

269
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,899
Besides, maybe your friend hasn't been diagnosed yet.

270
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:26,879
It's better to talk to a counselor to see if psychiatric expertise is necessary.

271
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,690
Who am I going to turn to?

272
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,540
- Well—
 - Don't worry.

273
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,910
I'll refer you to someone.

274
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,110
Who?

275
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,680
He Dun.

276
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,310
Horton?

277
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,929
What's wrong? You don't like the mask?

278
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,190
It's average.

279
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,160
So it's not working.

280
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,280
I thought we use the same mask.

281
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,009
Not really. I used a different one.

282
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,560
Then what is it?

283
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,680
Are you running a test on my face?

284
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,320
Nope.

285
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,490
My last video went viral.

286
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,549
And somehow I received testers from various brands.

287
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:07,610
So I let you test the product.

288
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,480
Guess that's why I feel my face itching.

289
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,550
Am I having an allergic reaction? Look.

290
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,350
It's okay.

291
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,319
I got many soothing serums upstairs. You can use them.

292
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,130
Otherwise, it will keep you from going to the show.

293
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,419
That would be fantastic. That would be a great excuse not to be on the show.

294
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,470
Do you hate Qian Kaiyi that much?

295
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,110
He's been doing all the nice things for you.

296
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,760
Also, he brought about justice for me.

297
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
He really is a nice guy.

298
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,520
I don't thinks so.

299
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,820
He has an ulterior motive.

300
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,050
He wants me to be his show partner, okay?

301
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,760
What about the guy that lives next door?

302
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,520
It seems he's interested in you.

303
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,090
He made a music box for you.

304
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,160
That's very thoughtful.

305
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,350
Now that you brought it up, did you know he's a psychiatrist?

306
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,690
[Background Check: Ye Jiahui, psychiatrist]

307
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,859
You met He Dun in a bar and then became her neighbor.

308
00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:59,520
Isn't that coincidence too conspicuous?

309
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,460
My grandma's health hasn't been well these past few years.

310
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,470
She often asks me to come back to City H.

311
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,000
This is the location of the nursing house my grandma stays in. Only 700 meters from here.

312
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,059
- Yes, I knew.
- Why didn't you tell me?

313
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:12,840
If I told you, you'd overthink it.

314
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,460
Don't you find this weird?

315
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,569
The first time we met him, he was taking medicine after drinking wine.

316
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,230
Now he happens to be our neighbor.

317
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,760
Sir, how do you like this house?

318
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,489
I tried to probe him yesterday. His answer was very obscure. Do you not see how weird that is?

319
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:35,219
You must be thinking why would a medical school graduate take medicine after drinking wine.

320
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:39,269
Actually, there are many similarities between psychiatry and psychological counseling.

321
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:40,800
Yet there are many differences.

322
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,520
Come on, do you want him to tell you directly that he had the intention to commit suicide?

323
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,430
Come on, keep your voice down.

324
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,570
Anyway, what you said sounds reasonable.

325
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,730
[Director's Office]

326
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,520
Come on in.

327
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,260
The show is a hit. What makes you upset?

328
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,920
The show being a hit makes me upset.

329
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,830
Kaiyi, I know that this show is like your child.

330
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,110
Don't you want to make it a top show?

331
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,099
Of course, I do. But I want to do it on my own.

332
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,379
As for Wang Zhuo, don't you think you owe me an explanation?

333
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:33,489
Wang Zhuo... That day, I just brought it up casually,

334
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:36,810
seeing if he got any good idea to inspire you.

335
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,520
Come on, Director Pan, I just don't get it.

336
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,170
Why would you make me feel like a failure all the time?

337
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:44,069
The show budget document. I've signed it.

338
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,640
Then, Wang Zhuo...

339
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,229
Wang Zhuo came to me the other day, saying that he knew a prestigious psychological counselor.

340
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:02,760
I didn't give it much thought.

341
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,180
Thank you, Director Pan.

342
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,710
Well, I... I feel much better now.

343
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,500
I'll be on my way.

344
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,910
I'll close the door for you.

345
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,139
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

346
00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:49,130
Yes, yes.

347
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,620
I'm listening.

348
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,070
Ring the bell.

349
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,330
Mr. Xun...

350
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,680
I can't. I can't.

351
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,830
Well, I just can't.

352
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,960
Come on!

353
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,900
Is it so hard to ring the bell?

354
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,580
Well, I'm not an actor. I'm not a veteran actor.

355
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,590
I'm afraid I can't pass for you.

356
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,439
You received my money. Now you're telling me you can't do it?

357
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:22,799
- You psychopath!
- Who called me a psychopath?

358
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,000
You're a psychopath!

359
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,920
That's the last piece of the puzzle!

360
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,930
I'm sorry for what happened just now.

361
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:41,580
Do you need a carer?

362
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,980
Let me think about it.

363
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,430
How much do you earn a day as a carer?

364
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,210
500 yuan.

365
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,179
- I'll hire you for one day.
- Really?

366
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:04,470
Wait a moment, sunglasses.

367
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:20,340
All right, I'll give you 500 yuan more.

368
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,080
Really?

369
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,310
Then, Mr. Xun, would you give me more...

370
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,800
You're reminding me.

371
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,449
With that money, not only a veteran actor, I may even hire a movie star.

372
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,910
It's okay if you won't ring the bell. Just give me back my money.

373
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,120
Hello,

374
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,780
I'm Mr. Xun.

375
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,980
Thank you for having me here.

376
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,130
Come in, please.

377
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,130
Later, I need to you repeat after me.

378
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,800
Okay, no problem.

379
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,110
This place is so fancy.

380
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,200
I'm He Dun. Nice to meet you, Mr. Xun.

381
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,520
Sure, I'll let Mr. Xun know it.

382
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,110
- Well, Mr. Xun...
- Speak it out.

383
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,520
- Well...
- Tissue.

384
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,540
What's wrong?

385
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,190
Face.

386
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,580
I'm Mr. Xun.

387
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,790
I know you're Mr. Xun.

388
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,820
Mr. Xun, well, we're required

389
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,949
to pay another 5 million yuan as the commission for the sale.

390
00:28:46,949 --> 00:28:48,390
Another 5 million yuan?

391
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,300
Mr. Xun, what do you do for a living?

392
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,040
Are we doing charity?

393
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,540
Charity.

394
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:01,899
They won't sign the contract unless we pay the 5 million yuan commission for the sale.

395
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:05,839
What happened to the PR department? Are they good for nothing?

396
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,319
Charity? I'm interested in this field.

397
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,130
What stuff do you do?

398
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,499
Let them goof off. I'll fire them very soon.

399
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:17,119
Goof off. And fire people.

400
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,250
Mr. Xun, that's impressive and courageous.

401
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,210
Well, let's get started.

402
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,900
Mr. Xun, do you feel unwell these days?

403
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,390
I should go there?

404
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,780
People in the PR department are limbs missing?

405
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,560
Mr. Xun?

406
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,839
Limbs missing. But I still need to go there.

407
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:44,330
Okay, I'll be on my way.

408
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,540
Wait a moment.

409
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,280
Do you do exercise?

410
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,830
Do ten push-ups and learn your lesson.

411
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,300
Yes.

412
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,210
I do push-ups.

413
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,560
And twenty high knees.

414
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,450
And high knees.

415
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,959
Hey, I got scolded for it.

416
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:16,110
Mr. Xun, you look very healthy to me.

417
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:19,400
Mr. Xun, the PR department called again,

418
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,830
asking you to take a step a back.

419
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,190
Take a step back?

420
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,059
Two, three, or four steps? Is this ballroom dancing?

421
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:28,800
Do I need to perform square dancing for him?

422
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,650
I also do square dancing.

423
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,739
All right, get off the phone. I'll call him myself.

424
00:30:50,739 --> 00:30:53,000
Okay.

425
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,980
Mr. Xun, are you tired?

426
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,010
Do you want to have a chat upstairs?

427
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,349
I know, you want to know why I'd ask someone to pretend to be me.

428
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:34,390
But most importantly, you're here.

429
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,950
I'm here because I'm at the end of my rope.

430
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,420
So, you have no faith in psychological counseling

431
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,009
and try to test me by finding someone to pretend to be you, am I right?

432
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:48,339
If that's what you want to call it. I just wanted to test you.

433
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,710
Did I pass your test?

434
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,219
It's okay. Just act as you see fit.

435
00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:57,779
Our conversation is confidential.

436
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:00,809
You don't have to answer this question if you don't want to.

437
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,649
I'm going ask you many questions, which will be the basis for our communication.

438
00:32:04,649 --> 00:32:06,640
Is that okay for you?

439
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,009
You didn't trust me.

440
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:15,590
And you tested me by finding someone to pretend to be you.

441
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,310
But now you're here.

442
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:22,679
So I gather that you have certain expectations for this psychological counseling.

443
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,310
Is this Horton as brilliant as you said?

444
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:30,040
He Dun is a very talented, diligent student.

445
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,950
If you can trust me, then you can trust her.

446
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,740
Don't let her know that I'm behind it.

447
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,110
Okay.

448
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,199
To be honest, I feel that I have an incurable disease.

449
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:50,219
I've been to all the major hospitals, seeing the experts and professors of all the departments,

450
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:52,759
only to be told that I'm all fine, that I'm in good health.

451
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:55,940
But there must be something wrong with me.

452
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,879
I'm here because a friend of mine suggested that I see a psychological counselor.

453
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:03,170
What symptoms do you think you have?

454
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:08,750
At first, I sweated and trembled.

455
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,530
Then my chest went weak and I would loose my breath.

456
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,080
I also felt sick.

457
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,140
When I was in bed, I felt I was dying.

458
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,400
I had white blindness.

459
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,290
My soul was leaving my body.

460
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:26,159
Despite these obvious symptoms, they just couldn't find the reason.

461
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,739
These experts and professors are nothing but swindlers.

462
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,000
Mr. Xun, take your time.

463
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,479
Try to remember what were you thinking when such symptoms were gone.

464
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:43,280
I was thinking I wanted to stay alive.

465
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,660
I wanted to live a few more years to see...

466
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,300
To see my son.

467
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,339
With this weird disease, I'm not going to last long.

468
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:57,169
But according to your medical examination report, there is nothing wrong with your bodily functions.

469
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,430
That's the worst part!

470
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:03,329
I had this relative back in my hometown who was as strong as a horse and died suddenly.

471
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:04,969
I'm growing older and older.

472
00:34:04,969 --> 00:34:08,559
At my age, you don't look for diseases but the disease will look for you.

473
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:13,309
Besides, my family is not blessed with longevity genes, not within several generations.

474
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:17,150
Mr. Xun, do you want to know what I think?

475
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,630
I'm listening.

476
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,529
What you have is anxiety.

477
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:24,529
- Anxiety?
- That's right.

478
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:27,130
Doctors asked you to see a psychological counselor

479
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,869
not because they couldn't find your physical problem

480
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:34,509
but because they could see what you have is typical psychological symptoms.

481
00:34:34,509 --> 00:34:38,739
In psychology, it's known as panic disorder.

482
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:43,600
The initial symptom is trembling and sweating.

483
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,690
Soon, you'd be aware of your physical changes. Am I right?

484
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,950
Exactly. Yes.

485
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,759
I can tell that you're very concerned with your health.

486
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:56,889
So, upon the first attack, you went to see doctors frequently,

487
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,019
only to be told that there is nothing wrong with your body.

488
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:03,829
During the next attack, you found yourself in a worse situation.

489
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:07,300
At the height of it, you experienced nausea, vomiting,

490
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,840
heart rate speeding up and loss of breath.

491
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,770
Mr. Xun, are you alright?

492
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,000
Mr. Xun?

493
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,430
As time moves forward,

494
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,419
it often doesn't last long before your body calms down.

495
00:35:46,419 --> 00:35:49,629
The attack lasts about three to five minutes. Am I right?

496
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:51,490
Exactly.

497
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,309
Every time the symptoms were gone, I was dog-tired.

498
00:35:56,309 --> 00:36:00,190
Well, how come you know so well about these details?

499
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:04,190
Mr. Xun, this is what we called panic attack.

500
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,659
When these symptoms occur, you'd have a near-death experience.

501
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:10,969
But this is not a problem with your body. Nor is it an incurable disease.

502
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:15,429
In fact, among ordinary people, about three to five percent of them have experienced panic attacks.

503
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:20,729
Some of them would pay special attention to it and feel anxious about it.

504
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:23,319
That's when it becomes a problem.

505
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:25,739
So, what you're saying is this weird disease also happens to other people

506
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:28,929
and it's not a terminal disease and it can be cured?

507
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:30,520
It can be cured.

508
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:38,800
Every time you come here, you'd leave my grapevine bare.

509
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,110
You're exaggerating. I just pick two clusters of grapes.

510
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,160
I'm craving for grapes.

511
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,120
You won't go abroad anymore?

512
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,459
With everything fantastic at home, why would I want to go abroad?

513
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,190
But you don't even go home.

514
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:03,470
So, you're here to meditate.

515
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,250
I'm not meditating.

516
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,950
It's that someone is in a bad place.

517
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,150
I feel sorry for him.

518
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,429
He's been suffering from all kinds of discomfort.

519
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:21,730
It won't be long before he goes to all the hospitals in the province.

520
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,410
What happened?

521
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,609
He was fine a few days ago.

522
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:28,190
I've no idea.

523
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:31,470
I think the answer lies in you.

524
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,290
Since when do you start beating the bush?

525
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,849
The cat will be out of the bag if you still stay at my place.

526
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:08,709
Miss He, could you tell me why I got this disease?

527
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:10,470
It never happened to me before.

528
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:15,000
Why did I have panic disorder?

529
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,659
I should ask you the same question.

530
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:20,040
Did anything happen to you recently?

531
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,470
Not that I'm aware of.

532
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,230
I noticed that you denied it immediately.

533
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:35,299
But before that, during our conversation, you've been in doubt.

534
00:38:35,299 --> 00:38:37,990
I totally understand that it takes time for you to trust me.

535
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,520
I also totally understand

536
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,729
that you find it difficult to open yourself to me in this face-to-face conversation.

537
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:46,699
However, if you can't face me and talk to me

538
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,710
in a genuine way, then there is a limit

539
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,760
to how much I can help you.

540
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,459
Sometimes, it's even harder

541
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:58,760
to deal with our feelings than with our work.

542
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,660
We can control our behavior.

543
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,489
However, sometimes it's hard for us to talk about our feelings.

544
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,319
Mr. Xun, we're not in a hurry. You can take your time.

545
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:19,390
If you want to call it a day, I'm totally okay with that.

546
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,280
My son went abroad.

547
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,729
You promised that you won't go abroad. Why did you change your mind?

548
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:31,840
Do you still see me as your father?

549
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,669
You'll lose me as your father if you still go abroad.

550
00:39:34,669 --> 00:39:36,600
And I'll lose you as my son.

551
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,389
Panic attack happened after your son's call.

552
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:53,950
This is not the first time that you have a panic attack.

553
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,710
The symptoms have become obvious.

554
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,630
[Son]
He wants me dead. He wants me dead.

555
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,199
Bai, drive faster. Hao's plane is about to take off.

556
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:13,630
I can't miss it.

557
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,320
No problem, Mr. Xun.

558
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,150
Assh*le! Assh*le!

559
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,829
Mr. Xun? Are you all right, Mr. Xun? Mr. Xun?

560
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:25,390
Mr. Xun? I'll send you to the hospital, Mr. Xun.

561
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,889
Xun Hao sent a message: Dad, I've already left.

562
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:33,190
There is no need to see me off.

563
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:36,289
The father and son didn't get to see each other even before the departure.

564
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,140
Recently, many countries have declared the outbreak of the pandemic.

565
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,000
- According to incomplete statistics...
- How does it happen like this?

566
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,950
Near ten thousands of people have been infected.

567
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,130
- The governments appealed to the crowd...
- How does it happen like this?

568
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,940
To minimize outdoor activities and gathering.

569
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,020
No suspected case has been detected in the province.

570
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:00,470
[Latest News: Outbreak of Pandemic in Various Countries; the Number of Confirmed Cases Continues to Climb]

571
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:05,100
Come on, whatever I do, I do for his own good.

572
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,160
I've been worrying about him. Why was he so disobedient and still went abroad?

573
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,699
Well, should anything happen to him, what will become of me?

574
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:14,120
Did he ever think about that?

575
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,080
Mr. Xun, I think I've learned your situation.

576
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,600
However, I still want you to say it yourself.

577
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,840
This is a family tray.

578
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,290
This tray is a tool for you to talk to yourself.

579
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,220
Maybe I'm not able to fix your problem today.

580
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,760
However, we may get to know the origin of your problem.

581
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,020
Then...

582
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,230
What do you expect me to do?

583
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,800
See those figurines in the bag?

584
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,630
These figurines can represent anyone, me, you, or Xun Hao.

585
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:58,500
You can pick some figurines from the bag to represent persons who are important to you

586
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,560
and place them on the tray as you see fit.

587
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,800
Assh*le! Assh*le!

588
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,100
Why did you choose the black one?

589
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,800
I've no idea.

590
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,280
Go on, please.

591
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,150
Who is this one?

592
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,320
My wife.

593
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,640
Xiao Fang.

594
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,600
What are you trying to say? Come on!

595
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,360
I'm listening.
