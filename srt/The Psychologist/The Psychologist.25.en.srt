Professor Ji.

19

You're here. Give me a minute.

20
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,970
I'm getting some chives.

21
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,989
I brought you a bottle of wine and two copies of books.

22
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,340
I'm happy enough that you guys would like to dine

23

with an old man like me.

24
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,300
You don't have to bring a gift. I kind of dare not invite you to dinner next time.

25
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,110
Didn't you say that all your books will be borrowed by He Dun sooner or later?

26
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,530
That's a nice and subtle move.

27
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,429
I didn't have time to show my cooking skills last time.

28
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,770
You must try my dishes this time.

29
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,290
I didn't see He Dun when I left home.

And she doesn't have a radio show today, either.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,590
You didn't give her an assignment, did you?

32
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,899
She's having a family problem.

33
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:33,050
I wouldn't give her more things to worry about.

34

It's a pity she won't be able to taste the delicacy.

35

One of my students gave me some hairy crabs full of crab roe.

They go perfectly with my home grown chives.

Yes, go down to the end.

You can leave the books on the shelf on your way.

Where did you find these?

59
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,280
Well, any household would prepare some common medicine

60

for slight illnesses.

61
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,449
The receipt wrote that you bought them yesterday.

Yes.

63
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:27,309
I couldn't sleep well recently so I took some medicine to help my sleep.

64
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,500
This is not a two-day prescription.

65
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,740
The amount is enough for six months.

66
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,419
It's okay, Mom. Let's go to the hospital for an exam to see what the doctor has to say.

67
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:44,049
We can start the treatment in time if you are diagnosed with any disease.

I don't need to go to the hospital.

You've been sick for six months.

You felt sick or dizzy but you never told me about it, not once.

Do you think I am mentally ill

I just think that your job is so unique.

You've heard a fair share of sad stories already.

163
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,110
Come on. Cheers.

164
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,310
I read some of your papers after I came back to China.

165
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,739
So one will get different answers from the perspectives of psychology

166
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:26,949
and neuroscience respectively even when they look at the same problem.

167
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:31,670
No matter how greatly they overlap with each other, different disciplines have their differences.

168
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,779
But as far as I know, cognitive dysfunction rehabilitation goes heavier on neuroscience.

169
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,779
You are so interested in this book.

170
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:41,590
Does someone you know have these symptoms?

171
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,240
I haven't even given counselling for a long time.

172
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,390
I don't know anyone with these symptoms.

173
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,960
I just flipped through casually.

174
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,249
Old men tend to keep their lives casual without many purposes.

175
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:56,760
Let's not talk about this.

176
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,470
Have some hairy crabs.

177
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,689
I always tried to seek methodology from books when I was younger.

178
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:14,629
What you said reminded me of myself when I was a young lad.

179
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:15,929
Very pragmatic.

180
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:20,770
I had to find an answer to everything.

181
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:26,640
But now that I look back, you can't force it in many things.

182
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,120
What changed you then?

183
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,530
I haven't really changed.

184
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,609
But even if I could find the right answer

185
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:37,659
to guide me to choose another path of life, would it be a better life for me?

186
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,890
Not necessarily.

187
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,979
But sometimes when I look back, I will doubt

188
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:46,370
if I have lost something precious.

189
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,280
What do you think you have lost then?

190
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,279
Opportunities that I could have enjoyed more delicacy when I was younger.

191
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:06,540
I am old with high cholesterol now.

192
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,690
But I just can't give up on good food.

193
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,250
It seems that you prefer enjoying life

194
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,200
to searching for meanings and answers.

195
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,680
You have a sober philosophy of life as a young man.

196
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,180
I wouldn't say that.

197
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,550
But you've been taking care of He Dun.

198
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,199
Actually, I came here this time to learn from you.

199
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,740
I saw what you're up to last time.

200
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,910
I'm not taking care of her specially. But the more the merrier.

201
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,880
You treat He Dun as your own daughter.

202
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,300
As the saying goes, "Be one's teacher for a day and a father for life."

203
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,520
Now that I've made acquaintance with you, my house will have more guests.

204
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,099
You young people shouldn't let your professional pursuit

205
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:11,470
stop you from dating someone.

206
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,439
He Dun is a good student of mine, and a good girl, too.

207
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,230
I wish you good luck.

208
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,910
He Dun.

209
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,211
- Sorry, Sorry.
- It's okay. Are you okay?

210
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:42,270
- Apologize to him.
- Sorry.

211
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,010
Little Coke, let's go.

212
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,910
Mom will take you to buy coke.

213
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,741
- Where is Zhao Xiping's family?
- Over here.

214
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:01,110
She just fainted and was sent to rescue.

[Fang Zhongyi]

217
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,400
I met you and I finally want to settle down.

218
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,080
I want to be with you.

219
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,000
I will give you the best wedding of your dreams.

220
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,569
By the way, let me introduce her to you.

221
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:43,280
- This is my...
- Hello, I am Tong Yao.

222
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,440
Fang Zhongyi's wife.

223
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,740
Tang Lili. You are so lame.

224
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,520
You're so obsessed with him because of these pity things he gave you?

225
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,449
You're so needy.

226
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:54,330
What is so good about him that makes you so pathetic now?

227
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,210
What do you see in him?

[Controlling Emotions, Never Rely on Endurance]

229
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,970
What have you lost then?

230
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,830
He Dun. I bought some food. Have some.

231
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,369
I'm not hungry yet. You eat it.

232
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:46,369
Okay, eat something when you're hungry.

233
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:48,370
You can't go without food.

234
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,950
She's been asleep all the time?

235
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,920
Your mom is really something.

236
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,590
She didn't tell you anything all long.

237
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,830
It was my fault.

238
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,370
I didn't pay attention to her health in time.

239
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,309
She wouldn't have kept it from me for so long

240
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:11,159
and turned into this had I paid attention earlier.

241
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,470
He Dun, I know you blame yourself now.

242
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,640
But it's not the time for you to feel sad yet.

243
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,230
You can't have a mental breakdown.

244
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,800
If you do, who can give your mom mental support?

245
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,770
Right?

246
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,590
Our priority is to find out what the disease is.

247
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,230
I know.

248
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,920
- Which one is Zhao Xiping?
- I am her family. You can talk to me.

249
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,379
Judging from the exam results, we didn't find any intracranial tumor

250
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:40,960
or signs of brain injury in Ms. Zhao. Everything looks normal.

251
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,790
- Really?
- You freaked me out.

252
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,230
- Mom, when did you wake up?
- Doctor.

253
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,899
I really don't have any disease?

254
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:48,660
No.

255
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,000
Let me see.

256
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,350
Thank you, Doctor.

257
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,040
There are many causes that can lead to fainting.

258
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,509
In your mother's case, it's necessarily a brain problem.

259
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:02,059
It may be due to excessive pressure or too much mental stress.

260
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:05,580
She will get better when she goes home and recuperates for some days.

261
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,729
- We can't take her in even if you want to be hospitalized.
- Understood.

262
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:11,700
- All right, thank you, Doctor.
- Okay.

263
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,790
Thank you, Doctor.

264
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,910
- Dun Dun!
- Thank you.

265
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,310
We can be discharged now!

00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,020
- I'm fine!
- Let's get out of here. Yes.

Doctor Wu.

268
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,460
Dr. Ji, you came to visit the patient?

269
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,640
Judging by your look, you can't find her again?

270
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,969
Did you see her?

271
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:02,950
She was in her ward when I had my afternoon round.

272
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,031
Don't worry. I'll send someone to help you find her.

273
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:05,969
It's okay.

274
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:08,231
She does this every time. I'll go find her myself.

275
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:10,000
Okay. Excuse me.

276
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,610
Thanks.

277
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,210
Is it too hot?

278
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,040
It's fine.

279
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,720
Dun Dun, what are the many herbs you put in water?

280
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,230
Shell of abalone,

281
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,560
root of asiabell, Angelica, Fructus Arantii.

282
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,130
I can't remember. There's a dozen of them.

283
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,800
It's spelled Aurantii. A U R A, aurantii.

00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,149
Force of habit, huh?

285
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:35,040
Yes.

286
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,629
I just thought of something when I was in high school.

287
00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:39,880
What is it?

288
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,580
Do you know which class I hated the most when I was in high school?

289
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,730
Chinese.

290
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,579
I knew it.

291
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:49,179
Why?

292
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:50,800
Because you were a Chinese teacher.

293
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,250
I could secretly have a nodding-off if I got sleepy in other classes.

294
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,920
But I wouldn't dare since it was your class so I didn't dare take a nap.

295
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,920
You wanted to take a nap in classes.

296
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,110
Yes.

297
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,579
You were a straight-A student. I can't believe you would do that.

298
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:06,110
Straight-A students will get sleepy in classes, too.

299
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,179
Do you remember?

300
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,950
Once before the mid-term exam you got

301
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,880
some insider news so you insisted that

302
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,830
three classical Chinese essays would be in the exam.

303
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,749
So you asked us to memorize all three essays in one day.

304
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:21,030
The whole class encouraged me to intercede with you. Do you remember?

305
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,270
Oh, I remember it all too well.

306
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,800
You guys didn't really care about it.

307
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,510
But there was this boy in Class No. 2 who said I favored you guys.

308
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,840
So he asked me to reduce the task to memorizing only two essays.

309
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,759
I remember that boy vividly.

310
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,249
He was very eloquent and quite smart.

311
00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:38,749
I couldn't beat him in the debate.

312
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:40,740
Who was it?

313
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,640
I only took his teacher's classes twice.

314
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,969
So I don't remember what his name is.

315
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:47,149
He was tall.

316
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:48,939
There was another tall boy.

317
00:24:48,939 --> 00:24:52,409
The two boys were rapt in extracurricular activities instead of studying.

318
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,589
One was playing basketball and the other was...

319
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:57,249
School's broadcasting, I guess.

320
00:24:57,249 --> 00:25:00,000
Qian Kaiyi? Is it Qian Kaiyi?

321
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,150
Qian Kaiyi was the only one in Class No. 2 who joined school's radio station.

322
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,510
I think so.

323
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,769
He was so bold to confront you when he was in high school?

324
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:09,980
He didn't really confront me.

325
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,969
He just kept asking me to reduce one essay they had to memorize.

326
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:16,520
So I had to reduce the amount.

327
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,930
No wonder he looked familiar

328
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,659
when I saw him for the first time.

329
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:25,940
He was my student.

330
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,150
This is really interesting.

331
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,370
Does it hurt?

332
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,590
Dun Dun, let me tell you one thing, too.

333
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,310
What is it?

334
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,470
What's wrong?

335
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,060
Every time

336
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,000
when I called you Jun Jun,

337
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,860
did it hurt your feelings bad?

338
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,930
Thank you, Jun Jun.

339
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,000
Jun Jun.

340
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,299
Why are you in a dress?

341
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:13,760
You look beautiful.

342
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,590
Jun Jun.

343
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,780
Now you're lying.

344
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,170
Do you know that I did it on purpose every time?

345
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,350
I used to think that

346
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,070
I might die soon.

347
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,310
I didn't want

348
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,610
all the memories I left you when I died to be good ones.

349
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,830
I wanted you to hate me.

350
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,450
I wanted you to think I was an incompetent mother. Then you...

351
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,640
wouldn't miss me.

352
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,810
You did it on purpose.

353
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,220
Yes.

354
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,350
I just wanted you

355
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:23,110
to hate my guts so that you wouldn't feel

356
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,880
lonely after I died.

357
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,310
I was such a stupid mom.

358
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,810
I had no idea I would only hurt you even more.

359
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,430
Right?

360
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,960
Why are you so silly?

361
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:00,000
You know, I have double love for you.

362
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,900
Just love you, love you, and love you more.

363
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,830
Look at my poor memory.

364
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,179
Qian Kaiyi is still waiting for you downstairs.

365
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:24,900
Go.

366
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,190
Come on.

367
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,560
Just go.

368
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,800
I can't be any better now.

369
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,760
I can't make it.

370
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,800
You guys order whatever you want.

371
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,520
I'll pay the bill.

372
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,570
He Dun, how is your mom?

373
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,780
She's fine. She was just tired.

374
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,760
She had some good sleep.

375
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,209
False alarm.

376
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:07,330
But I think her concerns and doubts have gone through this accident,

377
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,210
which is a good thing.

378
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,419
I have another good news to tell you.

379
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,369
Which is?

380
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:16,939
The last Say No Special Show ranks first in the rate of audience.

381
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:19,680
Among all shows of my station and all shows of that time slot, we rank first!

382
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,720
Really?

383
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,190
Great, we did it!

384
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,660
He Dun, thank you.

385
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,680
Why would you thank me?

386
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,410
I am very happy

387
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,230
to have you in Night Talk to Your Heart.

388
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,640
Don't mention it. It's also my show.

389
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,800
I'm also very happy.

390
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,710
I'll drive… I will drive you home.

391
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,350
Jiahui?

392
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,950
It's so late. What's up?

393
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,640
I'm waiting for you to come back.

394
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,310
Waiting for me?

395
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,539
I have something to tell you, alone.

396
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,350
What's the matter?

397
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,811
Thank you for the ride. Can you give us some space?

398
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,950
Be careful on the road. Goodbye. Won't walk you out.

399
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,760
Make it brief. She had a long day today.

400
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,620
Go to bed early.

401
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,280
See you tomorrow.

402
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,400
Today, you…

403
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,040
You go first.

404
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,000
I'll go first then.

405
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,290
What are you hiding behind your back?

406
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,730
You noticed it.

407
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,500
Noticing the hidden truth is my job.

408
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,459
I handmade this for you.

409
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:16,860
Music Box with Podalirius's statuette.

410
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,490
Thanks.

411
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,930
When I was making this music box,

412
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,050
I kept thinking

413
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,040
what I needed to say when I gave it to you

414
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,500
and how your reaction would be when you saw it.

415
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,400
Would you like it?

416
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,260
Even when you're smiling now,

417
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,979
I'm still worried about whether I can tell you what I try to say deep down in my heart.

418
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,899
He Dun.

419
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:48,470
I am happy during the past period of time

420
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,480
with you guys in my life.

421
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,740
You gave me a lot of surprises.

422
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,070
I am very happy.

423
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,160
We are all friends.

424
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,729
So you don't have to be so formal.

425
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:03,040
But I want to be more than friends.

426
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,579
Jiahui, it's too late now.

427
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:15,620
We should both go to bed.

428
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,110
The music box is beautiful.

429
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,880
Maybe we can talk about it another time.

430
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,420
Good night.

I'm your partner. Your beloved partner!

437
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,180
How can you be so cold-hearted and treat us differently?

438
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,820
Wipe your neck. There's dust all over.

439
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:33,430
If you need a special audience one day,

440
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,000
just turn around.

441
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,860
I'll always be there for you.

Jiahui, I want to tell you something.

461
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,430
I've fallen in love with someone else.

462
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,850
Sorry.

463
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,040
You don't have to say sorry to me.

464
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,100
It only makes me feel more embarrassed.

465
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,040
My heart was pounding as if it was burning.

466
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,500
But the fire was put out by your words.

467
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,250
Thank you, He Dun,

468
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,190
for telling me frankly that you've fallen in love with someone.

469
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,430
Jiahui, I'm sorry.

470
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,230
I don't know what I should say.

471
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,360
I cherish your friendship.

472
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,230
Lili and I both cherish it very much.

473
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,260
We need to thank you

474
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,179
for everything you've done these days.

475
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:43,039
You've been taking good care of us.

476
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:45,570
Lili and I rely on you.

477
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,050
Like you said, you are happy that we walked into your life.

478
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,250
we walked into your life. We are also very happy

479
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,840
that you walked into our lives.

480
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,860
I hope we can be good friends for lifetime.

481
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,570
What do you say?

482
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,810
Qian Kaiyi is a lucky bastard.

483
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,430
But actually, I quite like Qian Kaiyi.

484
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,050
Not in that way.

485
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:23,079
I mean, during the past period of time I spent with you guys, I experienced

00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,840
many heartwarming events.

487
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,710
I understand.

488
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:36,580
Actually, I've been thinking lately,

489
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:41,269
how nice it would be if I could live here with you guys forever.

490
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,770
I used to...

491
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,840
I like this kind of lifestyle.

492
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,739
Well, I'll tell you how grateful I am to you later.

493
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,390
You don't need to specially talk about it.

494
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,019
We will be friends for life.

495
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:02,360
You don't have to be so polite with your friend.

496
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:06,300
Then will you accept the music box from your friend?

497
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,000
Certainly.

498
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,390
Long live friendship.

499
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,050
Long live friendship.

500
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,660
Will it be too much to ask

501
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,430
if I ask you to give me a hug?

502
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,050
All right.

503
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,530
Good night.

504
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,290
Good night.

505
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,279
Why would you call me since you can't stand the pain?

506
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:07,870
I just screamed to get distracted from the pain.

507
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:12,069
Do you have any other problems except for the bruises?

508
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:15,610
I'm always dizzy lately and I would feel limp and exhausted.

509
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:18,569
And an upset stomach, too, except for the bruises?

510
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,289
What is the function of this acupuncture point?

511
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:24,040
Heal a broken heart.

512
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,320
Are you going to say it or I still need to ask?

513
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,710
I'll say it myself. Be gentle!

514
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,950
That scumbag.

515
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,390
I didn't know he has a wife.

516
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,740
He said he was single when he went after me.

517
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,769
Now that I look back, there were many clues.

518
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:43,459
I couldn't reach him during weekends.

519
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:46,449
When he was with me, he always put his phone face-down.

520
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:49,660
He would avoid the topic whenever I talked about our future together.

521
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,760
No wonder people say a girl in love will become dumb.

522
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,280
There were so many things that looked fishy but he managed to fool me.

523
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,470
Yet this stupid girl even made excuses for him.

524
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:01,280
See this bruise? I got this during the fight with his wife.

525
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,120
But I won.

526
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,040
Do you think I deserve it?

527
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,670
Your hand.

528
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,469
Your dizziness is caused by spleen deficiency, qi depression, and frustration.

529
00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:27,770
I'll give you acupuncture another day.

530
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,280
You are a good girl.

531
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:39,720
You are a great girl who deserves to be loved wholeheartedly by someone.

532
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,099
So please don't get your heart broken over an unworthy guy again.

533
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,559
And next time, use your wisdom and intuition that you used to investigate me

534
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:56,060
to do a background back on your date, alright?

535
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,670
You are so unforgiving.

536
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,840
I already apologized to you!

537
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,700
I'll get it.

538
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,460
Hello.

539
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,800
Is this Studio of Happy Talk? And you are?

540
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,250
I came to see Miss He.

541
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,800
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes.

542
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,659
But I seem to be here early.

543
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:36,390
It's okay. Please come in.

544
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,770
I think my body is dirty.

545
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,300
