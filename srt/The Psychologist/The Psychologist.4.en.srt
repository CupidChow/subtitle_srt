[Episode 4]

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,529
Mr. You, why were you at the airport before you hurried to the police station?

19
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,410
Why are you packing?

20
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,799
You Shanhua, what on earth do you want to do?

21
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,020
I'm tired.

22
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,400
I can't bear it anymore.

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,600
We agreed that neither of us would move away before Na Na finishes her college entrance exam.

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,700
If you move away now, how can I explain it to Na Na?

25
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,420
You can.

26
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,810
You were quick on the trigger every time you found fault with me.

27
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,910
That won't be hard for you.

28
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,530
Dad, where are you going?

29
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,820
I'm going to Beijing for a business trip.

30
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,319
I left my recording pen at school.

31
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,920
- Dad, Mom, I have to go to school.
- Na Na!

32
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,410
That's not right.

33
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,560
She hadn't been out at all.

34
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,420
If she had returned home from school and would go back to school, she would say

35
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,819
"I have to go back to school" but what she said was

36
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,030
"Dad, mom, I have to go to school."

37
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,040
[12:00 PM]

38
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,249
Oh gosh! What should I do? What should I do?

39
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,370
We agreed that neither of us would move away before You Na finishes her college entrance exam.

40
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,739
If you move away now, how can I explain it to her?

00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,460
Dad, where are you going?

42
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm going to Beijing for a business trip.

43
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,439
I left my recording pen at school.

44
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,350
Dad, Mom, I have to go to school.

45
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,100
Na Na!

46
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,839
So that is the first time you have planned to live apart.

47
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,659
Have you lived apart since then?

48
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:50,714
- I-I planned to.
- Planned to?

49
00:04:50,714 --> 00:04:53,559
I wanted to take business trips as an excuse to stay at a different place for a few days.

50
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:57,160
So you never implemented the separation plan, right?

51
00:04:57,869 --> 00:05:02,210
Can I know the reason that hindered your plan?

52
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,780
Dad, look at this...

53
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,149
Dad, I'll cut a kiwi for you. It's your favorite fruit.

00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,980

58
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Are you not feeling well?

59
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,460
Na Na? Na Na?

60
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,440
Dad, when will you come back?

61
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,229
Does it hurt, sweetheart?

62
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:09,617
I'll catch the earliest flight to come back.

63
00:06:09,617 --> 00:06:11,957
Okay, I'll wait for you!

64
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:21,439
I thought

65
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,890
she wouldn't get hurt

66
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,670
as long as we kept it from her.

67
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,429
The intimacy between you two has had a fundamental change.

68
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:37,219
Even if you didn't say anything, your child could still notice it.

69
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,520
You're feeling self-condemned and guilty, right?

70
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,549
In fact, it's okay.

71
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:51,390
The senior year is indeed a special period.

72
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,939
It is common that a marital conflict escalates into family conflicts.

73
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:59,020
You mean our situation is a common case?

74
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,259
Yes.

75
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:05,389
The senior year is a period when a child is leaving his or her family and becoming independent.

76
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:09,550
Therefore, his or her family relationship will turn into one that consists of only parents.

77
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,720
If the parents' relationship is not so good during this period,

78
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,299
the child will worry that the parents' relationship

79
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:18,070
will not be sustained after he or she leaves.

80
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,039
So during this period, the child tends to show various behavior problems.

81
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,709
The motivation behind all these different behaviors is the same,

82
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,050
which is to sustain his or her family relationship.

83
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,390
You mean,

84
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:39,510
she did these in order to keep us together?

85
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,270
I think you've already known the answer.

86
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,440
There is still some time left.

87
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,620
Let's do a test.

88
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,110
In this box of matches, red ones represent You Na,

89
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,414
yellow represents Mrs. You, blue represents Mr. You,

90
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:01,511
green represents a friend or a colleague

91
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:04,159
and white represents a relative.

92
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,649
I'd like to ask you to recall the reasons of and people related to

93
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:12,830
the five most unforgettable quarrels you two had in the past two years.

94
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,640
Mrs. You, you first.

Na Na choice of studying in Arts and Sciences.

96
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,640
Nana skipped school for a singing contest.

97
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,400
Na Na wanted a smartphone.

98
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,170
My mom.

99
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,440
[You Na, Mrs. You, Mr. You, Friends & Family]

100
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,910
My mom secretly bought a smartphone for Na Na.

101
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,210
Na Na wanted to study broadcasting and hosting.

102
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,400
Very good. Now let's do the test again.

103
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,109
This time, you will make choices separately.

104
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:18,349
Please think it over.

105
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:24,140
Among these 5 quarrels, which one made you feel

106
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,909
very upset or hurt you badly?

107
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:29,700
And whom was it related to? Okay?

108
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,530
[You Na, Mrs. You, Mr. You, Friends & Colleagues]

109

[You Na, Mrs. You, Mr. You, Friends & Colleagues]

110
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,909
[You Na, Mrs. You, Mr. You, Friends & Colleagues]

111
00:10:24,909 --> 00:10:28,289
Mrs. You, when you mentioned why you

112
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:31,230
did not support You Na to study arts,

113
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,500
I sensed your dissatisfaction with Mr. You.

114
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:39,379
When You Na chose to study arts in spite of your objection,

115
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:44,800
you felt very sad, lonely,

116
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,429
and even had a sense of abandonment and isolation.

117
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,359
There is a big problem with the intimacy between you two.

118
00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:00,219
Perhaps Mrs. You wanted to communicate but found the way was inappropriate

119
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:04,889
while Mr. You wanted to make efforts but felt the communications were frustrating

120
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:06,710
and wanted to escape.

121
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,429
Have you found that you both have the same goal

122
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:13,180
in your subconscious mind is You Na?

123
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,740
Therefore, You Na was always actively or passively involved in your conflicts.

124
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,909
As a result, she is uncertain about her self-value.

125
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:26,219
She thinks it is she who caused the failure of your marriage.

126
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:30,099
She mistakenly believes that you two will stay together and make interactive efforts

127
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:34,739
only when she has troubles.

128
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,229
I'm sorry. I-I-I...

129
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:45,710
I didn't expect I would cause so much damage to Na Na.

130
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,040
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:55,609
Finally, I'd like to ask you two to light these five red matches in sequence.

157

00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,979
I thought it over.

160
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:24,180
Instead of leaving this platform exposed to the weather,

161
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,780
we'd better turn it into another working area

162
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,899
which can be used as a sandbox room and a group activity room, right?

163
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,319
Now I know why He Dun doesn't have a boyfriend.

164
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:35,770
Why?

165
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:40,389
You've done everything a man should do. You don't leave any chance to men.

166
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:43,839
Mr. Qian, do you think I asked you to come over only for a visit?

167
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,280
What else?

168
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,470
To give you a chance.

169
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,110
This is a very typical pursuer-distancer pattern.

170
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,740
Pursuer-distancer pattern.

171
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,679
One side complains and has demands while the other side avoids and refuses.

172
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,039
One side has intense emotions while the other side shows indifference.

173
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,769
Many marital relationships are possible to be in the pursuer-distancer pattern.

174
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:19,030
This husband's avoidance is very typical.

175
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,079
His wife's aggressiveness made him feel very incompetent.

176
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,310
So he thought his avoidance could ease the conflicts and bring peace in return.

177
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,959
But it has never occurred to him that his avoidance further irritated his wife.

178
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,370
And the worst part of this family is that

179
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,810
their daughter has been involved in their conflicts.

180
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,769
The triangulation obscured the focus of the conflicts between the couple.

181
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:45,259
At the same time, the daughter showed her willingness to follow her father.

182
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:48,770
So the wife felt a strong sense of betrayal

183
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,670
and supposed her daughter would perhaps keep away from her just like her husband.

184
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,739
Therefore, she attacked her husband more violently in order to strike a balance.

185
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:57,590
What method did you adopt?

186
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,100
I did a match test

187
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,059
and basically, the couple has restructured their perceptions.

188
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,820
How about the child?

189
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,490
This child's core fear is her family relationship.

190
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,900
If her family relationship is improved, her defense mechanism will naturally collapse.

191
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,559
Of course, that's the best result.

192
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,829
But anyway, in the end, I will bring my focus back to the child's individual therapy.

193
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:31,110
An individual therapy together with a family therapy, plus an imagery method.

194
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,430
Every solution is well targeted.

195
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,800
Very good.

196
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,759
It all owes to your teachings.

197
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:40,140
You told me not to rigidly adhere to only one style.

198
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,970
I'm following your teachings.

199
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,049
Little girl, you know so well how to make me happy.

200
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:48,000
Tell me, what do you want for lunch?

201
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,579
I won't stay here for lunch. I have to go back.

202
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:52,930
I have just relocated. Tang Lili is waiting for me at home.

203
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,919
If I don't go back, she'll be stressed.

204
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,269
Perfect. I've prepared all you need.

205
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,190
They are all your favorites.

206
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,709
I have free meals here every day

207
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,630
and now even get these vegetables before I leave. How inappropriate!

208
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,680
Well, I'll leave them to myself.

209
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,390
I was just being polite.

210
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,099
Watch your back. Handle it with care.

211
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,490
Be careful.

212
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,500
I've sorted and labeled these shelves.

213
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,040
You just need to put those on the shelves.

214
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,229
Models! I love models.

215
00:18:30,229 --> 00:18:31,940
Three thousand pieces.

216
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,980
Well, see you.

217
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,980
Where are you going?

218
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,159
Beauty salon.

219
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,700
You can do it.

220
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,039
How carefree you are, hands-off manager!

221
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,700
I'm flattered.

222
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,349
Really? Why is there still a truck of things here?

223
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:01,629
- Which building are you from?
- This one.

224
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:04,350
We work for the next building, not yours.

225
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,069
Did you leave something behind again?

226
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:20,760
Mentor.

227
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:17,519
Well, He Dun's studio is just on the right track.

228
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,649
As her senior, you can give her a lot of useful advice.

229
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,879
Don't worry.

230
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:27,289
What you said is all about He Dun.

231
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,679
I think you're more biased towards her.

232
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,029
Working as a psychologist, you rely on spirituality.

233
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:37,680
I am worried

234
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,069
He Dun relies on strength.

235
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:45,679
I always worry that she will hurt herself for using too much strength.

236
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:51,309
Go up the stairs. Be careful.

237
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:54,810
- What are you doing?
- Well, one, two, three, lift your foot.

238
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,829
Don't open your eyes until I say one, two, three.

239
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:01,310
One, two, three.

240
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,760
Do you like it?

241
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,080
What's wrong?

242
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,930
Unsatisfied?

243
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,800
I did it according to your drawings.

244
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,799
Lili, I don't know how to repay you.

245
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,830
The only way is to marry you.

246
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,200
It's a little early to say that, honey.

247
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,370
Actually, it's...

248
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,650
I take back what I just said.

249
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,279
Even if you want to marry me, I don't necessarily agree with it.

250
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,349
She somewhat targets me.

251
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:50,070
Why does she always have such a strong grudge against me?

252
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,440
It's fate, perhaps.

253
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,410
I'll leave the room to you two.

254
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,760
Well, you are really something.

255
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,880
I've been working on them all this afternoon but you don't even thank me.

256
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,430
Thank you.

257
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,589
Actually, it's not a big deal.

258
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:23,079
Lili arranged all these. I'm just an assistant.

259
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,690
I don't like to owe others favors.

260
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,369
Tell me again about the radio program you mentioned before.

261
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:33,929
But I have to make it clear first. I will not necessarily join

262
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:36,980
but I will do everything I can to help you.

263
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,730
Okay.

264
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,659
The program I want you to join is called "Night Talk to Your Heart".

265
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:48,839
It was the first and the most popular emotional program in China at that time.

266
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:51,869
In those days when psychological counseling was not recognized by the public,

267
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:54,019
it became an emotional pillar for countless people

268
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:57,739
and helped many who felt lost in cities find themselves.

269
00:22:57,739 --> 00:23:00,559
I spent one year re-planning this program

270
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,809
and convincing my station to repackage "Night Talk to Your Heart".

271
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:07,529
In this day and age, there is too much information and things change so fast.

272
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:09,860
So I think the voice of a professional

273
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,170
is needed more than ever to help people

274
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,040
tackle with their inner confusion.

275
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,400
So you plan to?

276
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,500
Invite a psychologist to join us

277
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,789
and work with me to help people in cities today

278
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:23,759
with different stress and confusion to relieve their depression.

279
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:26,219
We will use voices to accompany them through their difficult times

280
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:29,899
and also share their heartwarming emotional stories.

281
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,449
What's wrong? Do you still think I have some scheme?

282
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,840
No. I just have a question.

283
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,799
As the program was so popular back then,

284
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:45,579
why did you spend one year convincing your station?

285
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,719
Mentor, can you do me a favor?

286
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:55,310
My students will never come if they have nothing to ask for.

287
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,799
Be frank.

288
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,300
Just say it.

289
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,729
I transferred an F file to He Dun before.

290
00:24:04,729 --> 00:24:10,699
I want to know if I can transfer that case back and take it over.

291
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:15,580
You said you wanted to change the direction of your research

292
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,159
so I transferred the file to He Dun.

293
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:20,420
Why?

294
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,680
Is there any problem with your new topic?

295
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,350
No, there isn't.

296
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,439
I just worry He Dun is too busy with her studio.

297
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:32,740
I think I should share her burden.

298
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,870
I think you'd better finish the topic you're working on first.

299
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,170
- Well, that case...
- Let's talk about it later.

300
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,100
I'll ask He Dun about it.

301
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,050
I don't know her opinion.

302
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,370
Okay.

303
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,300
Radio programs are not as popular as they used to be.

304
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,659
People today listen to radio programs only for traffic conditions and news when they are in their cars.

305
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:21,830
People no longer listen to programs under their covers.

306
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,349
Indeed, it's not a promising industry worth expecting.

307
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:30,570
That's why I was ready to be refused by you a long time ago.

308
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,760
Do you know how my mom uses WeChat?

309
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,600
As long as WeChat is updated, I will rewrite one for her.

310
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,559
In every era, every city, every community,

311
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:59,259
there are always people running fast, walking slowly, and even falling behind.

312
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:00,330
[Zhao: Okay.]

313
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,319
"Falling behind" is not an appropriate phrase to describe them.

314
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:09,049
It's better to say that those people prefer to live in the past,

315
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:13,299
to stay in yesterday's happiness but miss today's brilliance.

316
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:18,310
But it's often those people's difficulties and ideas

317
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,829
are easily ignored and can't be bothered with.

318
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,849
In fact, if what you said is true, I'm willing to accept your invitation.

319
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:30,040
I don't care if it is a promising industry.

320
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,899
My only concern is how much help and influences my expertise

321
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:38,109
can offer and have in a field that I am not familiar with.

322
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,210
I'm sorry, Miss He.

323
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,020
Actually, I can swim.

324
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,430
No need to say sorry to me.

325
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,279
In fact, you have done very well.

326
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,480
If I had been you, I wouldn't have known what to do.

327
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,189
I mean it.

328
00:27:30,189 --> 00:27:35,409
It's very difficult to silently bear all the burden at your age.

329
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,800
Miss He,

330
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,790
will my parents make up?

331
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:56,260
To be honest, I don't know. It depends.

332
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,860
Have you heard of transplanting vegetable seedlings?

333
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,450
In brief, it's to uproot a vegetable seedling

334
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,209
right after it has three or four leaves

335
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:16,760
and then plant it on another piece of land.

336
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,950
As to the little seedling that

337
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,580
leaves its original piece of land and is planted in another one,

338
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,290
you believe it will die, right?

339
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,930
But in fact, it's quite the opposite.

340
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,980
In real life, many people choose transplantation

341
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,660
because both the yield and the growth rate

342
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,570
will be one third higher than before.

343
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,769
There is no perfect family on this planet.

344
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:53,060
Every family has its own problems.

345
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,869
Sooner or later, we have to come out from the shell that protects us.

346
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:02,009
We may encounter violent storms. We may be afraid.

347
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:06,980
But we can also grow stronger just like that little vegetable seedling.

348
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,430
You need to trust yourself.

349
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,500
You are not the only case.

350
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,410
You are not alone.

351
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,589
Yes. Please wait for a second.

352
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:33,879
Coming. Coming. Coming.

353
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:36,830
Feel free to order. Feel free to order.

354
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,469
This is the place where Xiao Zhe's mother works.

355
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:46,070
Xiao Zhe's father died in an accident and left Mrs. Zhou to support the family alone.

356
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,930
She has to work very late here every day.

357
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,379
Mrs. Zhou's father helped your family when your father was laid off.

358
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:59,119
That's why your father tried so hard to help them.

359
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,349
Okay, okay, okay.

360
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:07,539
Coming.

361
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:11,330
Scan the code. Scan the code.

362
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,000
Okay. Please wait for a second.

363
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,979
Xiao Zhe! Xiao Zhe!

364
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,259
Oh gosh. Where are you hurrying to?

365
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:05,169
My mom's barbecue stand. She has many customers today. I'm to help her.

366
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:07,880
I saw You Na at your mother's barbecue stand.

367
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,569
What's she doing there?

368
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:10,799
Coming. Coming. Coming.

369
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,890
Leave it to me.

370
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,670
I'll be with you in a second.

371
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,079
She seemed to help Mrs. Zhou there.

372
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:20,590
She was diligent and attracted many customers.

373
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:23,829
I heard that the misunderstanding between her and her parents has been cleared up.

374
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:27,549
After this incident, our school opened a professional psychological counseling office.

375
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:31,859
If we students have conflicts in the future, psychologists will communicate with us and guide us.

376
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:34,979
I know she wants to say sorry to you

377
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:38,230
but perhaps she still needs time.

378
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,960
Take it. This is what You Na asked me to give you.

379
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,660
[Yunifang]
(T/N: Chinese Skincare Brand known for their face masks.)

380
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,860
Hello?

381
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,680
I've decided.

382
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,190
Let's make it a good program together.

383
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,190
I'm sorry.

384
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,779
I'd like to know if you know any interior decorating team.

385
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,560
I just moved in next door.

386
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,099
- Are you that... That night at the...
- He Dun?

387
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,980
I've been looking for you for a long time.

388
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,010
Come in, please.

389
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,350
Sorry, I wasn't wearing my glasses.

390
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,700
It is too dark outside so I didn't recognize you.

391
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,679
Never mind.

392
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,409
I'm Ye Jiahui. Just call me Jiahui.

393
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:22,870
Jiahui.

394
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,910
These are?

395
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,040
I just moved in and haven't had time to tidy up.

396
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,680
May I help you?

397
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,280
Thank you.

398
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,480
What a coincidence! I didn't expect you would be my neighbor.

399
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,830
Yes.

400
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,520
Have a seat.

401
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,860
Actually, I've been looking for you for a long time.

402
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,779
I went to the address you gave me on your business card.

403
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,680
But they told me you had resigned.

404
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,669
You didn't leave your phone number on the card so I couldn't contact you.

405
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:58,590
Sorry, I was too busy that day.

406
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,699
It doesn't matter. Doesn't this indicate we are predestined?

407
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,570
Thank you.

408
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,459
I saw the medicines you took.

409
00:34:09,459 --> 00:34:12,050
Do you see a psychologist on a regular basis?

410
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,899
Actually, I've been taking medicines for a while and controlling my matter quite well.

411
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:19,599
I just arrived in City H on the day you ran into me.

412
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,320
My friends said they wanted to treat me on arriving.

413
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,870
I was happy so I drank too much.

414
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,760
You should pay more attention to it in the future.

415
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,819
Right. I really want to thank you for that day.

416
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,860
Without you, I would die.

417
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,709
It's no big deal.

418
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:38,909
I worked at the Suicide Intervention Center

419
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:41,290
and saved people every day. I'm used to that.

420
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:45,279
By the way, how about continuing your psychotherapy in City H?.

421
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:47,020
I can recommend a psychological counselor to you.

422
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,800
I don't need one.

423
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,800
It's just my suggestion.

424
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,910
Why don't you recommend yourself?

425
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,000
I've just started psychological counseling but if you need

426
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,080
- I think I can—
- No, I don't need it.

427
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,519
It's not because you're not qualified.

428
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:13,620
It's me who doesn't want you to be my psychologist.

429
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,460
Because...

430
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,470
a psychologist can't have a relationship with her client.

431
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,800
Qian Kaiyi?

432
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,420
What brings you here in the middle of the night?

433
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,330
She agreed.

434
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,040
Really? What did I say?

435
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,710
You would get what you deserve for the hard work.

436
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,519
Michelin meal.

437
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:46,199
I think I'm the one who should take credit for it.

438
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,710
You ungrateful boy!

439
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,110
Sister Li, Sister Li, don't do it. A big meal. I promise.

440
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,840
It is a piece of cake to me.

441
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,159
Where's He Dun? I called her but she hung up.

442
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:58,390
She has some business to do and will come back later. Come in and have a drink.

443
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,860
Thank you, Jiahui.

444
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,420
- I'll see myself out.
- Don't worry about it.

445
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,710
Qian Kaiyi? What brings you here?

446
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,460
Jiahui, this is the other person who saved you at the bar that day.

447
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,760
Nice to meet you. I'm Ye Jiahui.

448
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,770
Thank you for saving me that day.

449
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,810
That's not a big deal. Don't mention it.

450
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,350
Was he kicked by a donkey on the head?

451
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,790
Excuse me, I have to go in and see what's wrong with him.

452
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,320
Good night.

453
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,490
Nice to meet you. Good night.

454
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,600
Are you having an epilepsy episode?

455
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,710
Unique. So unique.

456
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,979
If the decoration on your table

457
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:16,360
is too unique, your clients will

458
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,770
have a stereotype of your inner vulnerability.

459
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,280
I've wanted to give it to you as a gift

460
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,390
but I couldn't get in touch with you.

461
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,230
Today I finally got the chance to give it to you.

462
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,320
Did you make it yourself?

463
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,310
Do you think it is childish?

464
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,150
Not at all! I like it very much!

465
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,689
The sound from a music box has an alpha wave that

466
00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:11,700
matches a wave at 528 hertz in our brain.

467
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,629
So it can make people feel very peaceful.

468
00:38:14,629 --> 00:38:18,569
Its function is to calm people down.

469
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,600
Do you think I'm calm?

470
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,710
Unfortunately, my brain waves are at 857 hertz.

471
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,169
Miss He, I advise you not to listen to other people's nonsense.

472
00:38:33,169 --> 00:38:37,499
Qian Kaiyi, have you got sh*t in your head?

473
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:39,630
I just want to check the music. Why are you so sarcastic?

474
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,599
What do you want to do?

475
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:43,120
What do I want to do? Why don't you ask what that guy wants to do?

476
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,459
You went to his apartment in the middle of the night and even hung up on me.

477
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:48,700
I know, you're jealous, right?

478
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,769
I-I'm jealous? Why am I jealous?

479
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:54,120
Am I jealous?

480
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,829
What about you? Why did you come to my house in the middle of the night?

481
00:38:56,829 --> 00:38:58,329
Why did I come to your house?

482
00:38:58,329 --> 00:38:59,569
For business.

483
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,590
What business?

484
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,599
The contract. Go to the station at 9 tomorrow morning and sign the contract.

485
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,849
It's a paid job. Good. This is good.

486
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:17,980
I never thought I would get paid.

487
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,279
Don't think too much.

488
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:21,919
This contract is the same as the counseling mechanism.

489
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:25,050
It's to discipline you and encourage me.

490
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,999
Bye-bye. I have business to do tomorrow.

491
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,279
Wear sunglasses at night.

492
00:39:37,279 --> 00:39:38,900
Isn't he afraid of being run over by a car?

493
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,040
Perhaps he is afraid of being beaten.

494
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,100
He Dun,

495
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,049
I found when you two quarreled, you looked somewhat like a couple.

496
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:49,290
- What nonsense are you talking about?
- It's true.

497
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,220
He is so annoying. Am I the same as him?

498
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,210
Yes.

499
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,950

It is said abroad that the sound from a music box

502
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:25,520
matches a wave at 528 hertz in our brain.

503
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,469
Its function is to calm people down.

504
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,660
A darn music box. What's the big deal?

505
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,599
- Hello. What a coincidence.
- Hi.

506
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,390
These are...

507
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,079
There is still some luggage left behind.

508
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,819
The moving company just carried them here. I'm tidying them up.

509
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:06,599
The movers working for you last time are quite professional.

510
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,040
Where did you find them?

511
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,560
On 58 home.

512
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,549
Just download the app if you have any need.

513
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:16,080
They are on call.

514
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,759
I'll download it later.

515
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:19,640
- Let me help you.
- No thanks. I'll do it myself.

516
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,690
- It's okay.
- No, thanks.

517
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,290
- It won't bother me. I have nothing to do now.
- I was not being polite.

518
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,250
I'm sorry. My luggage is too heavy. Let me do it myself.

519
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:33,269
It's okay. I... Excuse me.

520
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:35,380
I'm taking out the trash.

521
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,150
Bye bye.

522
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,390
I know.

523
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:47,100
I know. I've tried them all.

524
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,940
But the problem is that I can't get

525
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,760
that file from her in a short time.

526
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,570
Don't worry, okay?

527
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,840
I will try my best.

Ms. Tang, Mr. Cao can't attend the shareholders meeting at 10. He said he would do it another day.

534
00:43:50,649 --> 00:43:52,530
Have you followed up on Mr. Cao's physical condition?

535
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,290
He said he was fine. So I didn't ask anything further.
