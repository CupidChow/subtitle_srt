18
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,010
See those figurines in the bag?

19
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,809
These figurines can represent anyone, me, you, or Xun Hao.

20
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:55,159
Now it's time for you to decide.

21
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:59,400
You can pick some figurines from the bag to represent persons who are important to you

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,560
and place them on the tray as you see fit.

23
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,930
Who is this one?

24
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,880
My wife.

25
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,400
Who is this blue figurine?

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,000
My eldest son.

27
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,639
It's been a long time, I can hardly remember their faces.

28
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,120
If what I think is correct, this is your youngest son,

29
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,930
Xun Hao.

30
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,980
Xiao Fang!

31
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,369
Xiao Fang! Are you all right?!

32
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:32,849
Wake up! Xiao Fang!

33
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,459
Xiao Fang! Xiao Fang, hurry up!

34
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,579
What are you trying to say? Come on, I'm listening.

35
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,240
Hurry up!

36
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,379
Why are these figurines so distant from you and turning their back on you?

37
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,810
I've no idea.

38
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,159
Perhaps subconsciously, you are avoiding each other.

39
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:16,370
Perhaps you feel Xun Hao is very distant from you.

40
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,980
And you two can't get close to each other, right?

41
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,640
That kid, he just wouldn't listen to me.

42
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,980
He was always trying to get away from me. Running further and further away from me.

43
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,120
Why would he do that?

44
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,880
Xiao Fang,

45
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,700
you and Qiqi will be fine.

46
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,609
What were you saying??

47
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:46,139
Tell me, I'm listening.

48
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,729
What was your mom saying? What was she saying?

49
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:55,980
I didn't hear anything!

50
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,860
Mom!

51
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,540
When was the last time you two communicated face to face?

52
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,670
You said you had three panic attacks.

53
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,739
During these three panic attacks, Xun Hao was not there with you.

54
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:17,980
But he was the cause of such attacks.

55
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,049
You two used to talk on the phone.

56
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:21,769
Then you texted each other.

57
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:24,880
Now, you've been out of contact.

58
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,740
Well, how is my dad?

59
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,440
He is sitting alone.

60
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,320
I've got everything covered, don't worry..

61
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,759
Mr. Xun didn't mean what he said, he'll come around soon.

62
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,210
Please take care of my dad when he loses his temper. He has high blood pressure.

63
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,870
Sure, Mr. Xun Junior. Without you being here, he won't lose his temper.

64
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,520
Why did you place Xun Hao at that position?

65
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,240
Because...

66
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,990
I want to keep him under my control.

67
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,739
After the death of your wife and your eldest son,

68
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:02,670
you and Xun Hao have to depend on each other.

69
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,769
Xun Hao went abroad to pursue his further study, leaving you all alone.

70
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:09,820
Later, you saw news about the outbreak of pandemic in foreign countries.

71
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,350
Anxious and worried, you had a panic attack.

72
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,420
Meanwhile, you were afraid you couldn't take care of your son

73
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,570
if you had an incurable disease or anything happened to you.

74
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,490
Am I right?

75
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,389
You can tell all that without me saying it?

76
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,940
Because I saw the intensified love and constraint you have for Xun Hao.

77
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,960
[]879-A

78
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,340
Hi, I'm here to meet Miss He.

79
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,440
Thank you, Miss He.

80
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,670
Talking to you makes me feel much better.

81
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,800
You're welcome.

82
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,070
We can't solve a problem once and for all through psychological counseling.

83
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,920
See you next time.

84
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,559
Sure, I'll be visiting you.

85
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:04,040
Dad.

86
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,890
- Dad.
- Where the hell have you been?

87
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,390
- Dad.
- Didn't you go abroad?

88
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,600
- What are you doing here?
- Don't come back if you're capable enough.

89
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,649
I want to beat you to death.

90
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,949
What happened to the Big Ben you've been talking about?

91
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,880
What happened to your... Man..ster...

92
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,650
That Oxferd University... What are you doing here?

93
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,789
You came to me only because you couldn't make it out there.

94
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:34,760
Dad, it's Oxford University.

95
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,400
Still, Oxferd.

96
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,579
All right, you're the brightest person in the world, okay?

97
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:41,049
You know that I'm illiterate.

98
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:42,879
However, I'm a successful entrepreneur.

99
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,250
You just spent a few days out there and now you start to lecture me?

100
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,709
Dad, I'm sorry, It's my fault.

101
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:56,720
Actually I came back a few days ago.

102
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,669
I was afraid to come home because I didn't know what to say to you.

103
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:05,610
Now you know what to say to me?

104
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,950
You came back a few days earlier and why am I just hearing about this now?

105
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,619
Well, Uncle Ji said you didn't feel well these days.

106
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,250
So I hurried over here to see you.

107
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,820
Why didn't you tell me about this?

108
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,659
Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad, don't blame Uncle Ji.

109
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:21,550
I asked him to keep this from you.

110
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,270
Dad, I'm sorry.

111
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,300
I shouldn't have left you alone at home.

112
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,890
I shouldn't worry you.

113
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,110
I know,

114
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,470
my mom and brother's death hurts you a lot.

115
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,790
That's why you pin all your hopes on me.

116
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,530
You always want to protect me.

117
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,960
But, Dad, I've grown up.

118
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,450
It's my turn to protect you, all right?

119
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,500
You protect me?

120
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,029
Miss He was right.

121
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:07,550
I used to be a control freak.

122
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,520
From now on, you can make your own decisions.

123
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,250
I won't interfere with your business.

124
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,469
Thanks, Dad.

125
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:17,200
Don't play that foreigner thing on me.

126
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
That's gross.

127
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,760
Sorry to interrupt you. Xun Hao, who is Uncle Ji?

128
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,739
Well, Uncle Ji. Professor Ji Mingcong.

129
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:30,699
You know him? My dad is an old friend of his.

130
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:33,160
I met him when I was a middle school student.

131
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,860
Dad, you know what, Uncle Ji has been so nice to me.

132
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,650
He cooked delicious meals for me every day.

133
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,590
After we fought on the phone the other day, I was really upset.

134
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,080
He comforted me and said that I could go to his place

135
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,770
and he'd treat me like his own son.

136
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,770
You two should talk to each other more often.

137
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,740
I've got to go.

138
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,880
Well, speak of the evil.

139
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,910
Are you here to blame me?

140
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,320
What are you talking about?

141
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,010
I want to thank you for introducing clients to my counseling office.

142
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,140
You referred Mr. Xun to my office. Don't you want to talk about it?

143
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:25,049
No problem, I must warn you, however, I can't supervise this case.

144
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:27,079
You asked Xun Hao to come back?

145
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:30,130
Hao Hao was worried about his dad's health.

146
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,320
He didn't say it, but he was worried sick. So he came back.

147
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,720
Don't tell my dad.

148
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,390
He heard that his dad was going to your place for psychological counseling.

149
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,879
So he decided to wait a few more days,

150
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,630
thinking that meeting him in a rush would make things worse.

151
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,860
What about his studies? Putting it aside?

152
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,710
Actually, he didn't go abroad for study.

153
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,150
His father is semi-literate.

154
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,240
He even didn't know how to write his name until I taught him.

155
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,670
The reform and opening-up brought many small enterprises to success.

156
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,810
When it comes to global trade,

157
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,549
as an old illiterate,

158
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:03,859
he's been set up by his friends and rivals.

159
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:07,279
Xun Hao really wanted to help his dad.

160
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,779
But he didn't want to hurt his feelings.

161
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,299
So he asked to study abroad.

162
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:16,669
However, his dad was so against this idea.

163
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:20,519
You'll lose me as your father if you still go abroad. And I'll lose you as my son.

164
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,019
He threatened with cutting all the ties between them.

165
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:25,430
He even didn't pick up his call.

166
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,470
Well, like father, like son.

167
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,249
They care for each other, without expressing their feelings.

168
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:35,120
Sometimes it's hard for father and son to express their love for each other.

169
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,590
Too many expectations, too much silence.

170
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,010
The more you love someone, the harder it for you to say it.

171
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,280
Besides, things are complicated in their family.

172
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,899
So, how did you cure that visitor?

173
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:57,319
I didn't cure him, I was leading him.

174
00:11:57,319 --> 00:12:01,819
I just turned our conversation into a chance for him to talk to himself.

175
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,190
That's it?

176
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,009
How does it work?

177
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:10,689
- So you choose yellow?
- Yeah.

178
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,230
Yellow is your favorite color.

179
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,880
It shows that you're a joyous girl.

180
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,839
If the visitor chooses black,

181
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,960
it means he is experiencing aloofness and sadness in his life.

182
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,570
It's always difficult to deal with the loss of family members.

183
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:30,699
So Mr. Xun paid all his attention to his son Hao Hao.

184
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,080
Now place the yellow figurine on the tray.

185
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,299
- Like randomly?
- Place it as you see fit, any way you want.

186
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,650
Then choose a figurine to represent me.

187
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,099
Why would you put it there?

188
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:58,099
Because we're meant to be together.

189
00:12:58,099 --> 00:12:59,670
That's right.

190
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,400
The central place is our home.

191
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:31,789
Dad, I went abroad not because I was disobedient.

192
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:36,379
I went abroad for six months because I wanted to secure that overseas client for you.

193
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:41,400
Seeing you practice your conversation repeatedly

194
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,650
and act subservient in front of the mirror

195
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,620
makes me

196
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,650
feel sad.

197
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,750
It's all my fault.

198
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,619
All these years,

199
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:04,420
my love for your brother and mom is all given to you.

200
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,690
That's too much pressure for you.

201
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,260
Actually,

202
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,330
I don't blame you for wanting to go abroad.

203
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,690
It's just that I'm sad about it.

204
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,490
I remember

205
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,790
how you used to follow me around.

206
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,310
I don't understand

207
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,840
why you wouldn't stay with me.

208
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,030
It's my fault.

209
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,000
I forgot

210
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,640
that you've grown up,

211
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,300
that you're an adult now.

212
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,610
What's your plan for the Telesphorus treatment?

213
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,459
Exposure of internal feelings. Pranayama Practice.

214
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:33,390
The first cognitive behavior modification worked on his catastrophic thinking.

215
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,470
Next, I'm going to focus on his deep relations and personal issues.

216
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,610
However, I didn't ask further about his wife's accident.

217
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,570
You're going in the right direction.

218
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,300
Modifying distorted perception is a crucial step.

219
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,740
As a psychological counselor, you're doing well.

220
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,469
There is a lack of sympathy.

221
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:59,380
I avoided the part where I should dive deep into the feelings of my client.

222
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,320
I hid behind my expertise when I was expected to

223
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,430
sympathize with and understand him.

224
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,240
I shouldn't have done that.

225
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,280
Technically speaking, you've done nothing wrong.

226
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,329
This case might be a challenge for you.

227
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:19,180
If you feel strong counter-transference, we can have supervision
courses more frequently.

228

Hello, Sir.

What are you guys talking about? You look so delighted.

251

The viewership hits 600 thousand. We're celebrating.

252
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,550
He Dun, I'm confused about one thing.

253
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,770
At the end of the show, why didn't you offer Xiao Wen psychological counseling?

254
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,879
With our show being a hit, this segment will attract a great audience.

255
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,289
I'm also curious, why didn't you pitch yourself?

256
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:17,580
Well, the way I see it, Director. Xiao Wen has an intensive emotional attachment for Qian Kaiyi.

257
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,400
In that case, for his partner, which is me,

258
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,709
Xiao Wen would have a strong emotional reaction.

259
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:24,859
Are you the one who hung up that banner out there?

260
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:27,980
There must be some misunderstanding here.

261
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,419
Why are you holding her hand? How are you related?

262
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,280
So it is you, He Dun!

263
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,219
Now I get it, she takes you as a rival in love.

264
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,730
If I'm going to be her psychological counselor, it will take a long time for me

265
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,659
to build with her a relationship of trust.

266
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:47,950
It will not only hamper the counseling process,

267
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,560
it's also against ethics to put counseling on the show.

268
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:57,500
Come on, let's toast to Director Fei for his continued support for our show, okay?

269
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,540
Come on, let's drink another toast.

- Thank you, Director Fei. Thanks a lot.
- Thank you, Director Fei.

271
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,969
Director, as for the show budget,

272
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:07,700
and all sorts of things...

00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,780
We always went toe to toe during our talk.

277
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,490
That way, it's difficult for us to be in tune in the show.

00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,310
Bride, look here. Don't move.

322
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,519
Come on, look here.

323
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
Okay, one more take.

324
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,040
Okay, come on. Powder her face, powder her face.

325
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,810
There you go.

326
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,369
Sir, I'm wearing too much makeup. I don't think it's necessary to powder my face.

327
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:08,350
Not really. That will make you look great in the camera.

328
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,939
Sir, I need you to lift your bride higher.

329
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:13,540
Higher.

330
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,250
Higher. Higher.

331
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,560
Higher. Higher.

332
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,290
Higher. Higher. Higher.

333
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,030
Higher.

334
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,170
Are you alright, baby?

335
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,740
- Baby?
- I'm not alright!

336
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,750
- Don't you know how much I'm afraid of water?
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

337
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,310
Don't touch me!

338
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,350
- I'm sorry.
- What the hell were we doing?

339
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,710
The photographer sucks.

340
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,430
You guys have been bullying me!

341
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,070
- Now... You brought me here.
- I'm sorry, Baby.

342
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,280
I'm sorry, Babe. I'm so sorry.

343
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,260
- It's all my fault. It's all my fault.
- It's too late for that now.

344
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,430
Where the hell did your mom find this photographer?

345
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,079
Does he know anything about photography?

346
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,249
What the hell has he done?

347
00:24:05,249 --> 00:24:07,830
I'm sorry, babe. I really am sorry.

348
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,050
It's all right, babe. It's all right.

349
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,369
This is the photographic studio your mom chose!

350
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,880
3999 yuan for nationwide photo-shooting tour.

351
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,060
What the hell are these photos?

352
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,250
This is what you look like on your retouched photos.

353
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,419
You look great in that photo.

354
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:22,050
Are you kidding me?

355
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,660
Can't you tell how ugly these photos are?

356
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,260
What are you doing?

357
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,059
My mom's friend opened a wedding dress shop.

358
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,520
We were just doing a favor to her friend.

359
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,280
What about the time we were choosing the wedding dress?

360
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,039
I made my peace with the wedding dress and photos.

361
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,760
But haven't we made a deal about having a French wedding?

362
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,530
Now you want to make it a Chinese wedding

363
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,100
because your mom believes white means bad luck?

364
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,610
Did you ever show the least respect to me?

365
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,190
Of course, we respect your feelings.

366
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,469
That's why I'm checking with you.

367
00:24:57,469 --> 00:24:59,230
So I should say thank you?

368
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,470
Shasha, the guests are mostly elderly people.

369
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,000
Older people prefer joyous Chinese wedding and red color.

370
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,580
Just think of it as giving my mom what she wants.

371
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,050
- Let me ask a question.
- Go ahead.

372
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,430
It this our wedding or your mom's wedding?

373
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,040
Of course, it's our wedding.

374
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,850
But my mom was trying to do what's best for us.

375
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,060
- My mom also said—
- Your mom said, your mom said...

376
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,000
Why do you always listen to your mom and never listen to me?

377
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,510
What's the matter with you?

378
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,680
Kang Ziyuan, what did you say?

379
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,070
What's the matter with me?

380
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,280
Yeah, that is, being with you！

381
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,070
Listen, the wedding is off.

382
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,580
Marry whoever you like.

383
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,900
Xuanxuan! Xuanxuan, are you home? Xuanxuan?

384
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,820
Xuanxuan!

385
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,310
What happened?

386
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,579
We broke up.

387
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:05,380
The wedding is off.

388
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,250
[Double Happiness]

389
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,900
Xuanxuan, why hasn't Yuan contacted me yet?

390
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,590
Did I overact?

391
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,230
You're the one who started it.

392
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,899
Just leave it behind. Come on and have some food.

393
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:38,590
I'll take you to go disco dancing later.

394
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,640
Start a new life and change your mood.

395
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,369
I'm in no mood for that.

396
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:44,640
Yes, I started the whole break-up thing,

397
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,090
But as a man, shouldn't he make a peace offering?

398
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,559
His mom stuck her nose into your wedding photos.

399
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:55,350
If you two really get married, you'll suffer a lot.

400
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,470
Then I won't marry.

401
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,420
Isn't it too late for you to say that?

402
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,070
What did I tell you?

403
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,800
Get another man if you're not satisfied with the current one. The earlier, the better.

404
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,369
What about your current boyfriend?

405
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:12,860
Is he much better than your ex?

406
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,280
He is a late son in the family.

407
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,760
His parents are in their seventies.

408
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,420
They don't have that energy.

409
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,500
That makes things easier.

410
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,800
A late son in the family.

411
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,960
His parents must love him very much.

412
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,520
He must grow up in a wealthy family.

413
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,700
Xuanxuan.

414
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,390
A video call from him! What should I do? What should I do?

415
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,280
Just pick it up. Wait a moment.

416
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,000
I got an idea.

417
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,330
Darling,

418
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,359
where are you?

419
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:48,209
I'm disco dancing. Sort of busy now.

420
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,470
Say what you have to say.

421
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,830
Disco dancing?

422
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,439
Did you go out for a drink?

423
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:54,950
Yeah. Why? Do you have a problem?

424
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,880
Not at all, not at all.

425
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,760
Shasha, drop the phone. Let's play drinking games.

426
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,230
Come on.

427
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,059
Fifteen! Twenty! Ten! Fifteen! Twenty! Ten!

428
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:07,190
- Fifteen! Twenty! Twenty!
- Drink it, drink it.

429
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,910
- Okay, drink with me.
- Bottoms up.

430
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,920
Cheers!

431
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,170
If you're done, I'm hanging up. I'm in the middle of a party.

432
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,359
Please don't.

433
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,020
Darling, it was all my fault. I need to apologize to you.

434
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,400
Please forgive me. Please forgive me.

435
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,640
Just let it go.

436
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,560
It was all my fault.

437
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,400
What did you say? I can't hear you.

438
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,849
Shasha, so many hot guys here, come on.

439
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,430
I'm coming.

440
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,950
Darling, I'm sorry.

441
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,369
Isn't it too late to say sorry?

442
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:42,800
No, no, no. I have a surprise for you.

443
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,849
You can decide whether forgive me or not after seeing the surprise.

444
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:45,950
Okay?

445
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,290
Well, I'd like to see your surprise.

446
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,940
Well, we were listening to a song by Maroon 5, Sugar.

447
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,130
As we know, Adam Levine, the lead singer of Maroon 5,

448
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,580
is a man obsessed with long legs.

449
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,070
All his girlfriends were models.

450
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,520
His wife is also a model with an amazing body.

451
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
He really has it all.

452
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,200
Here, I should add that this lead singer

453
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,000
went to America with his girlfriend for career development.

454
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,830
When he became famous, he abandoned his girlfriend

455
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,600
who had stayed by his side for many years, enjoying success all by himself.

456
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,760
Is that true?

457
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,680
Yes. It has been turned into a movie.

458
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,520
You can check it yourself.

459
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,400
All right. Thank you very much for sharing such an unsavory love story with us,

460
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,679
bursting the bubble of so many young girls.

461
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,760
Yes, sometimes young girls need to wake up to reality.

462
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,830
Speaking of romance, Miss He, I want to know your thoughts on one thing.

463
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:53,249
Say you suddenly get involved in a relationship that you don't think highly of.

464
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:56,470
This relationship may even sometimes confuse you.

465
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,180
In that case, what would you do?

466
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,680
That's not happening.

467
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,070
First of all, it's all of a sudden.

468
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,579
Second, I don't think highly of it.

469
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:04,679
It makes things much easier.

470
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:09,900
I'll tell him honestly about my thoughts and feelings.

471
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,590
Let's make it an extreme case.

472
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,579
You have refused him more than once,

473
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:19,070
but he still wouldn't give up and prepares to confess his feelings for you.

474
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:22,760
Moreover, he is convinced you two will eventually get close.

475
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,280
Getting close is a normal emotional development,

476
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,489
provided that neither of these two persons finds it confusing or troublesome.

477
00:30:33,489 --> 00:30:36,280
If one person finds it troublesome or overwhelming,

478
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,110
he or she should be respected.

479
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,190
Here is what I'd like to say.

480
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,059
In our real life, some people

481
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:47,669
choose to hide their feelings because they don't want to hurt anyone else.

482
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:49,720
In a relationship, what really hurts

483
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,079
is when someone does not follow his or her true feelings.

484
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,670
Exactly.

485
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,310
Okay. Okay.

486
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,850
Come home early.

487
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,680
You should have three meals at home.

488
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,699
All right.

489
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,660
Buy some meat?

490
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,590
Son, fresh meat?

491
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,889
Ms. Zhao, fresh meat. I've saved some pork ribs for you.

492
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:19,360
I forgot. I just had pork ribs last week.

493
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,380
How about the bottom part? It's fresh.

494
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,999
- Okay, don't give me too much.
- No problem.

495
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,350
I'll give you this piece.

496
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,160
Ms. Zhao, are you okay?

497
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,709
I feel a little woozy. It's okay.

498
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,700
Woozy? You should have pig's skull. That would help.

499
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,329
- Come on, don't make jokes. I'll have two bone sticks.
- Aye.

500
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:42,829
- My daughter likes it.
- No problem.

501
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:45,640
I've already cut it for you.

502
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,400
- That would be fifty yuan, Ms. Zhao.
- All right.

503
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,340
All right.

504
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,250
- Fifty yuan.
- Great!

505
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,430
Ms. Zhao, headache can be a serious problem.

506
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,069
You may want to get it checked out. Take a physical examination.

507
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,519
All right, thanks.

508
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,010
Okay.

509
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,989
Come, have some meat. It's fresh. Come.

510
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:08,520
Fresh pork.

511
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,960
Come.

512
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,550
Miss He, do you look forward to our amazing journey today?

513
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,730
Oh, please. Give me a break.

514
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:25,360
I agreed to come only because of Director Fei.

515
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,090
I'm setting out. Get prepared.

516
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,759
Lili, I just don't know how to use it.

517
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,680
Oh, god.

518
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,189
Don't knock. You almost made yourself a member of this family.

519
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,559
What do you say? Do I look new and shiny to you?

520
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,429
You dress like a groom.

521
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,129
Don't worry. The groom is even more dashing.

522
00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:57,220
What are you doing here? Don't you need to pick up the bride?

523
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,469
Already done. I'm here to pick you up.

524
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:01,880
I'll get there on my own.

525
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,399
He Dun, you really should change your name.

526
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,500
To what?

527
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,900
He Dui.

528
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,399
You get it? Do you need help?

529
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,660
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

530
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,829
What makes you want to set a security camera?

531
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,420
Because of what happened at the radio station.

532
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,120
Someone rushed out with a knife in the hand. That's horrible.

533
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,399
Come on, I'll set it for you. You can adjust the position on your phone.

534
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:27,610
Go get changed.

535
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:31,179
Already done. I'm wearing this. I can leave at any time.

536
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:37,570
He Dun, I won't charge you for wearing my clothes. No need to be so polite.

537
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:40,190
What's wrong with my look? Anything wrong with it?

538
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,679
Miss He, I'm curious.

539
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,059
Are all the female psychologists so dull?

540
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:51,310
Mr. Qian, I'm also curious.

541
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:54,680
Are all the male hosts so annoying?

542
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,759
Give it back to me. Give it back to me.

543
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:59,300
It took a long time to fix it. Give it back to me.

544
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,649
- Give it back to me.
- Have fun.

545
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:04,989
Give it back to me. Give it back to me.

546
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:22,610
He Dun, my friend's cloth is dry cleaned.

547
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,530
You may put it on.

548
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,229
A dress.

549
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,190
Which dry cleaning store did you go? The dress is so clean.

550
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,600
Well, we're going to a formal occasion.

551
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,759
Wedding is very important to a person.

552
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,480
Boys are wearing suits. Shouldn't girls wear formal dresses?

553
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,880
If... If you don't mind, you can put it on.

554
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,079
I like what I'm wearing today.

555
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,670
I don't feel embarrassed at all. I won't get changed.

556
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,919
- I only agree to accompany you to the wedding.
- Well.

557
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,560
Get out of the way.

558
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,190
You may reconsider it.

559
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,599
Why are you so stubborn?

560
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,390
Just drive the car.

561
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,210
All right, just like that.

562
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,860
Great, all right.

563
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,930
That's good. Let's take another one.

564
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,010
Your hands cramping?

565
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,180
- Hello, you can leave it here.
- All right, thank you.

566
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,470
Here.

567
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,680
Nobody told you not to touch other people's things?

568
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,260
Xiao Yuan, hurry up!

569
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,570
Thanks.

570
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,850
He Dun.

571
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,220
This way, please.

572
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,420
[Double Happiness]

573
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,470
Thanks. Thanks.

574
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,419
Thank you for coming all the way here.

575
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,869
Welcome, welcome.

576
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,430
Come on.

577
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,080
Godmother.

578
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,560
Kaiyi.

579
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,560
It's been a long time. I miss you so much.

580
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,969
Come on, you're just saying it. You never came to visit me.

581
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,119
Well, this is Haijuan, my cousin's daughter.

582
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,349
A brilliant girl. You two may get to know each other.

583
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:53,710
Okay.

584
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,210
This is...

585
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,710
- This is... This is...
- Nice to meet you, Auntie.

586
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,149
I'm Qian Kaiyi's coworker. My name is He Dun.

587
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:02,980
Nice to meet you.

588
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:08,710
They told me you're still single.

589
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,119
Well, for the moment.

590
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,120
Are you dating someone?

591
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,470
Pay attention. Shasha's maid of honor is also here today.

592
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,899
She has asked about you many times. Well, I didn't tell her anything.

593
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:25,190
You're so wise, Godmother.

594
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,230
Shasha, open the door!

595
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,600
I already said I'm sorry. Shasha!

596
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:40,530
Tell me, Miss He, which style do you prefer?

597
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,100
I like it to be warm instead of exciting.

598
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,390
Actually, they're an interesting couple.

599
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,319
A painter and a TV host.

600
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,360
Have you ever seen a couple of such polar opposites?

601
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,999
Some couples are like that.

602
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,530
Some people squeeze the toothpaste from the head ends, while some others from the tail end.

603
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,449
Some people love spicy food, while some others can't have spicy food.

604
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,760
Some people like egg white, while some others like egg yolks.

605
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,779
Anyway, boys and girls can sometimes become lovers despite the difference they have.

606
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:13,900
The way I see it, no two persons are exactly the same.

607
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,119
They only need to understand that sometimes they may have different ideas

608
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,279
and then find a way that both find comfortable.

609
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,709
Only in this way can a marriage last long.

610
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:27,390
In a relationship, we are not expected to efface our differences.

611
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,320
On the other hand, we need to learn to coexist with such differences.

612
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,299
I don't like egg yolks. I don't like egg white.

613
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:37,390
Miss He, do you like men who eat egg yolks or egg white?

614
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,630
I like men who don't waste food.

615
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,560
Shasha, open the door.

616
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,560
What is this about?

617
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,290
Shasha!

618
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,559
Shasha!

619
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,740
What is going on here?

620
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,469
Where are you going?

621
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,880
Kaiyi,

622
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,179
there is a big problem.

623
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,470
What happened? Calm down first.

624
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,489
Shasha won't get married. I need your help.

625
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:14,120
Are you kidding?

626
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,500
I've no idea.

627
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,819
We've been persuading her in front of her door. But she just wouldn't open the door.

628
00:39:19,819 --> 00:39:21,940
Well, if I go, she'll open the door?

629
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,619
Let's make every possible effort. Hurry up! Hurry up!

630
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:26,430
Wait here.

631
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,960
You're... He Dun?

632
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,670
And you are?

633
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,990
Fang Yuxuan.

634
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,660
Kaiyi's ex-girlfriend.

635
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,220
I'm He Dun. Nice to meet you.

636
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,219
I thought men would never change their taste.

637
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:52,000
It doesn't seem so this time.

638
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,889
Qian Kaiyi told me the other day that he wanted to taste a different type of candy

639
00:39:56,889 --> 00:40:00,889
because he had enough of the previous ones, way too sweet.

640
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,049
Anyway, thank you for taking care of Kaiyi for me.

641
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:12,480
Do you mind having a drink with me?

642
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,980
Sure.

643
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,920
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so clumsy.

644
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,559
And I don't have tissue with me.

645
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,079
It's okay.

646
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,700
That's an impressive gift for our first meeting.

647
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:32,300
Well, red goes well with the wedding.

648
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,529
I've tasted the wine. Can I leave now?

649
00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:38,130
Go ahead.

650
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,470
Xiao Yuan, come on, this is your fault at all levels.

651
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,809
Shasha, I'm Kai Kai. Cool down.

652
00:40:50,809 --> 00:40:53,250
All the friends and relatives have been waiting outside.

653
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,390
Let's just finish the wedding.

654
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,610
Let's kick Xiao Yuan's ass together later on.

655
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:00,469
That's right. Shasha, we can talk when we get home.

656
00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:03,070
Let's complete the wedding first.

657
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,810
I'll let you do whatever you like to me when we get home. Okay?

658
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,119
That's right.

659
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,060
Shasha!

660
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,470
Shasha!

661
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,199
Do you see that? I tried to be nice to your daughter.

662
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:19,810
But there should be a sense of harmony.

663
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,499
She has done this over and over again, more times than I can count.

664
00:41:22,499 --> 00:41:24,760
Why does she have to choose today?

665
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,460
They're having the wedding at the best hotel in the city. What else does she want?

666
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,709
Xiao Yuan's Mom, what do you mean by that?

667
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,700
Why can't our kids have the wedding the way they want?

668
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,610
Your daughter is just high maintenance.

669
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,560
We're both parents.

670
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,700
Shasha? Are you all right, Shasha?

671
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,519
Shasha? Open the door.

672
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,510
What's going on?

673
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,470
Do you see what she is doing?

674
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:52,899
If you keep knocking on the door, you'll break the door as well as your relationship.

675
00:41:52,899 --> 00:41:56,060
Shasha? Shasha?

676
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,810
I thought of a person who can help.

677
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,049
Fun? Come on, it's irritating.

678
00:42:03,049 --> 00:42:05,929
Irritating? Something happened?

679
00:42:05,929 --> 00:42:08,509
Wait, wait. Let me guess.

680
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,180
Did you run into Qian Kaiyi's ex-girlfriend?

681
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,040
How did you know that?

682
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:18,179
Friend's wedding is also the battle field for ex-girlfriends.

683
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:20,340
I have the experience.

684
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,670
Why didn't you tell me about it? If I had known, I wouldn't have come.

685
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:28,270
Come on, it's the perfect chance for you to handle those women. Got it?

686
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,500
Tell me, did you win or lose?

687
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,469
My clothes got ruined. I got wine all over me. I'm not sure if I can wash it off.

688
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:39,369
Throw wine at you? That's declaring the war.

689
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,319
Come on.

690
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,780
What's her name? Let me look into her.

691
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,330
She just told me her name...

692
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:50,930
- Fang Yuxuan.
- Fang Yuxuan?

693
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:54,250
He Dun?

694
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:58,469
You're in the ladies' room. Qian Kaiyi is really pushing it.

695
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:00,709
Let me see what he wants.

696
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,970
Well, about his ex-girlfriend, don't mess it up, okay?

697
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:06,330
Don't worry, I got a plan.

698
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,630
Look at you, covered in wine.

699
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:19,999
Just speak!

700
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,410
There is a problem which can only be solved by you, Miss He the psychologist.

701
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:31,290
Any search results?

702
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:34,530
No need to search. You know her.

703
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,439
I know her? How come?

704
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:40,300
Fang Yuxuan used to be a host of the Emotional Inn.

705
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,800
You asked us to listen to the program.

706
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,070
What do you mean?

707
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:50,270
She was Qian Kaiyi's partner. As rumor has it, she was his girlfriend.

708
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,010
Well, Qian Kaiyi...

709
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,950
I'm coming.

710
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,680
- Hello, are you Miss Tang Lili?
- Yes.

711
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,509
- Here is your parcel.

712
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:11,020
Did I buy something that big?

713
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:28,850
