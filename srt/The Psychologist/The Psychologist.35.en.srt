Fu Tang is over there.

Auntie Fu,

what game are you playing today?

27
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,259
I'm catching bugs. There are so many mayflies.

There is no pond here, let alone mayflies.

Can mayflies only exist in the water?

30
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,909
They're in my eyes.

31

Yes.

I like you so much. So how will I tease you?

You aren't.

He was only seven years old.

48
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,170
Right, he was only seven when I left him.

49
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,550
So,

50
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,060
I only remember what he looked like when he was seven.

Yes, a son.

I'm listening.

60
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:35,880
And then, you know that, a boy is sometimes well-behaved,

61
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,540
but sometimes naughty.

62
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,170
He liked to go to our neighbor's house

63
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,220
where there were many germs.

64
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,200
I've told him not to go there many times, but he didn't do it.

65
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,510
He brought germs back home.

66
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,750
Although he's a boy,

67
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:43,079
he was very well-behaved and clingy, even more clingy than girls.

68
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,870
He always liked to stay with me.

69
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,379
When I was cooking, he would do me a favor.

70
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,060
When I was reading, he would read with me.

71

No. It's just that there is a scar that stops hair from growing, looking quite ugly.

Don't say that. It isn't ugly.

Then let's continue running.

167
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,780
- No. I'm not ready yet.
- Let's go.

168
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,489
Give me a break. Give me a break.

169
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,699
I don't run anymore.

170
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,770
I'm done.

171
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,250
I'm exhausted.

172
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,410
- Lili.
- You go ahead alone.

173
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,540
Why did you give up?

174
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,840
I don't think you're a quitter.

175
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,850
I am.

176
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,259
Don't doubt it.

177
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:30,010
I give up this sport.

178
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,710
Fine. Let's move on to the next sport.

179
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,579
Another one?

180
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,230
What's it?

181
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,779
Self-defense skills training.

182
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,230
Self-defense skills training?

183
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,270
Why should I learn it with you beside me?

184
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,749
I'm a policeman whose major duty is to protect people.

185
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:50,080
I'm one of them. You can also protect me.

186
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,790
What if someone bullies you when I'm absent?

187
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,880
He Dun,

188
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,590
when I got the medicine,

189
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,149
I saw Professor Ji's name on the registration form.

190
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:55,060
[Ji Mingcong]

191
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,819
He's been watching Fu Tang's disease for so many years.

192
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:00,440
So our guess is right.

193
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,289
Fu Tang is the patient F who Professor Ji has been secretly protecting and studying.

194
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:08,589
- And that letter should be written to her.
- What an evil and shameless heart.

195
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:09,920
Where did you get it?

196
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,509
A man has been taking care of a woman wholeheartedly for so many years.

197
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:16,200
And the letter tells his regret.

198
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,920
I think Professor Ji really falls for Fu Tang.

199
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,870
Do you remember Fu Tang said she had a son?

200
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,590
Yes.

201
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,209
When you were off, I talked a lot with her.

202
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,419
She said after she was separated from her son,

203
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,469
she was taken to an asylum by her son's foster father.

204
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:33,899
An asylum?

205
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,910
Yes.

206
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,489
The man is Professor Ji,

207
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,850
and the child is Ye Jiahui.

208
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,370
Are you sure?

209
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,330
Yes.

210
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,639
Ye Jiahui's past is really similar to that of Fu Tang's son as she said.

211
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:55,959
If Fu Tang has a son, Jiahui bears a striking resemblance to him.

212
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,609
Right, he was only seven when I left him.

213
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:03,800
My mom abandoned me and left when I was seven years old.

214
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,009
But why did you say it was Professor Ji who took Fu Tang to the asylum?

215
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:12,430
Because all the existing evidence targets him.

216
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,909
Fu Tang told me when the child was seven or eight,

217
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:20,899
his foster father took her to a mental hospital in front of him.

218
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:24,389
It's perhaps the shadow that haunts the child for the rest of his life.

219
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,830
So Ye Jiahui has been taking revenge on Professor Ji.

220
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,779
Because of what happened in his childhood,

221
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,759
he hated Professor Ji for separating him from his mom.

222
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,979
This explains why Ye Jiahui has been looking for the File on F.

223
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:39,780
Because the file is about his mom.

224
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:45,579
So his retaliation against Professor Ji starts with you.

225
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,310
No. All this is just our analysis based on emotions.

226
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,110
We have no positive proof.

227
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,780
Did you ask Fu Tang about this?

228
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,160
No.

229
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,310
If what she said is true,

230
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,109
I don't dare to make a detailed inquiry because of her unstable mental state.

231
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:03,180
I'm afraid that it will stimulate her.

232
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,940
Let's go to Professor Ji now.

233
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,669
What's up? Don't you want to ask him for confirmation?

234
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:18,350
I can't do it.

235
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,599
If my guess is right, it means my teacher falls in love with his visitor

236
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,010
and stays with her.

237
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,719
If he's afraid this matter will affect his career

238
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:31,730
so that he took Fu Tang to the mental hospital…

239
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,700
He Dun, you can't have a preconceived guess.

240
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,620
Of course, I believe my teacher won't do those.

241
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,859
But all the evidence is right in front of me. I can't be so sure now.

242
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,089
From what you know about Professor Ji,

243
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,899
do you think he'll sacrifice his love for the sake of his reputation?

244
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:51,440
Maybe Professor Ji has his own reasons.

245
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,299
I know you believe him, so you're afraid to hear the answer you don't want.

246
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:01,809
But compared with that, having no answer is perhaps more painful.

247
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:03,260
Is it right?

248
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,910
Let's go.

249
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,130
You don't need to go in.

250
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,040
I think there are some questions that I should ask by myself.

251
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,010
Wait for me at the door, all right?

252
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,179
Go ahead. It's fine.

253
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,130
Professor.

254
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,489
Why are you here?

255
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,230
To visit you.

256
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:48,740
Why did I use the tea to water the flowers?

257
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,760
Wait a minute. I'll get some water.

258
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,090
How stupid I am!

259
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,260
How's it going?

260
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,500
What did he say?

261
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,080
I didn't ask.

262
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,480
Why?

263
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,640
How about I go ask him for you?

264
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,500
No.

265
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,930
It isn't that I didn't dare.

266
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:46,489
On a moment, when I saw his back, I suddenly realized he was getting old.

267
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,990
I took him as my father and model before.

268
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,999
I thought he could do anything and I couldn't make any one

269
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:03,819
of the achievements in science he had made forever.

270
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,780
I thought

271
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,739
he would stand forever in an upright way when I was at school.

272
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:15,079
I thought he would be wise and playful forever.

273
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,679
Why are you standing in my vegetable patch?

274
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,859
You're blocking all the nutrients sent to my cabbages.

275
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,079
If you hide a few minor things in your heart, I perhaps won't see them through.

276
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:30,569
But if you hide something major, I'll be able to discover it just from your eyes.

277
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,000
Open your eyes wide.

278
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,230
Open my eyes wide?

279
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,600
But human beings aren't like this.

280
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,190
They'll grow old.

281
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,230
But just now I suddenly thought

282
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,320
I couldn't reveal his faults in front of him.

283
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,579
It doesn't matter, He Dun.

284
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,949
If you don't want to ask, you can bury this question in your heart forever.

285
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,920
Professor.

286
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,960
He Dun.

287
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,730
What you want to know is all in here.

288
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,260
[Documents]

289
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,209
This time, you can read carefully.

290
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,510
Come ask me if you have any doubts.

291
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,879
That year, I just joined the Psychological Association.

292
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:27,150
I was very enthusiastic about research.

293
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,860
At that time, I got a special commission for counseling.

294
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,419
The patient suffered long-term bipolar disorder,

295
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,330
thus having serious mysophobia.

296
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,720
She refused to contact others.

297
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,180
Sometimes, she was impulsive and aggressive.

298
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,860
And sometimes, she was silent.

299
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:53,489
As time went by, she habitually locked herself in her room

300
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:56,150
and rarely had contact with others.

301
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:01,689
The consignor didn't tell me the patient was a beautiful woman.

302
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:03,659
It was a sunny afternoon.

303
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,060
She stepped on the ladder and looked back at me.

304
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,140
Then I didn't know

305
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:17,409
that image would repeatedly appear in my dream in the next decades.

306
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,890
I'm sorry.

307
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,579
Don't get the order wrong.

308
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,849
Excuse me?

309
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:31,869
I mean the order of the stack of books. Make no mistake in arranging them.

310
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:35,299
The first book is the Classic of Mountains and Rivers. The second book is the Investiture of the Gods.

311
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:37,149
The third book is Guangling Essays.

312
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:38,779
The fourth book is Journey to the West.

313
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,059
The fifth book is Darwin's the Origin of Species.

314
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,810
Please arrange them in order.

315
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:50,070
Why would the Origin of Species be also classified in this subject?

316
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,419
Because the Origin of Species is not really a serious science book.

317
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,070
So it's no different than other fairy tales.

318
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,330
Hello, I'm Ji Mingcong.

319
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,539
No one told you that I never shake hands with people?

320
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,609
Even though you're wearing that.

321
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,450
I know.

322
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,270
But I got to give it a try anyway.

323
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,700
Do you need to take my pulse?

324
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,179
No.

325
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,200
Why do you lock yourself in the house every day?

326
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,350
This hut of mine is a humble one, but I make it virtuously fragrant in repute.

00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,549
The patient was admitted to the mental hospital in City H in 1998.

339
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:56,639
The patient had a series of psychiatric complications due to medicine.

The patient showed early signs of schizophrenia.

There are lamb bones, chicken bones, and pigtails in it.

There is no need.

It's me who should apologize.

398
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:41,080
I want to say sorry because as your friend, I didn't care enough about you before.

399
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,619
I was aware of your difficulty, but I couldn't do more for you.

400
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:50,060
You know and care about me so well, but I

401
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,710
know nothing about you.

402
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,460
It seems that you also rarely mentioned your family.

403
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,689
I know you're the person who likes to keep everything to yourself.

404
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:03,290
If you want, if you really take me as your friend, you can tell it to me.

405
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,760
Maybe it will make you more comfortable.

406

He Dun,

00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:14,570
I don't need your help.

409
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:17,419
Your behavior will only make me feel I'm an abandoned wretch.

410
00:36:17,419 --> 00:36:18,840
It's not like that.

411
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,810
I think you can speak out what you've been hiding in your heart.

412
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,109
Maybe we can solve the problem together. What do you think?

413
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:28,640
You don't take me as a criminal, but as your visitor, right?

414
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,520
Or

415
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,220
do you take me as a psychopath?

416
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,680
You misunderstood me, Jiahui.

417
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,180
- I think I might have misjudged you a little bit.
- No!

418
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,220
There is no misunderstanding.

419
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,520
That's what I'm.

420
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,840
Everyone has their own values.

421
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,089
You shouldn't use your moral standards to judge others.

422
00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:51,190
I'm not like you.

423
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,870
Our ways of handling things are also different.

424
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:56,319
Do you really think you're so important and everyone around the world needs your help?

425
00:36:56,319 --> 00:36:58,190
Everyone has their psychological problem.

426
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,390
Do you really take yourself as a doctor?

427
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,370
Fine.

428
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,160
I'm sure you did all this for some reason.

429
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:18,119
The best thing you can do now is to vent the emotions repressed in your heart for so long.

430
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:21,140
Of course, if you're unwilling, it doesn't matter.

431
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,330
If what I said stings you,

432
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,900
I'll apologize.

433
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,330
Come in.

434
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,530
Kaiyi.

435
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,250
What's in your hand?

436
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,870
Have a look.

437
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,980
A new form and a new package.

438
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,179
You got to figure out how to change this situation.

439
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:18,960
You've made a great change and proposed such bold attempts.

440
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,329
I know I have no qualifications to make a request now.

441
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:25,230
But I've considered this new form for a long time.

442
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,420
There's no making without breaking. I hope you can support me once again.

443
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,290
Tell me about the details.

444
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,199
I want to open a contribution section on classic stories from the 1990s.

445
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:39,129
According to listeners' contribution, we'll take a field trip and find some clues in line with that period.

446
00:38:39,129 --> 00:38:43,089
From the perspective of exploration, we'll restore the scene in details

447
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:47,150
to let listeners feel as if they were on the spot.

448
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,989
Do you mean the program pattern

449
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:53,480
of narrating stories of a few years ago?

450
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,920
It's long been criticized.

451
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,829
After a few days, listeners became more tired of it.

452
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:00,600
Judging from my experience,

453
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,379
I think those programs were criticized because their stories were made up.

454
00:39:04,379 --> 00:39:06,990
I think only real stories can touch others.

455
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,559
But real stories aren't enough now.

456
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:10,569
Why?

457
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,139
Because no one is willing to show up and expose their secrets.

458
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:15,670
So this is one advantage of our program.

459
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,730
Here is another thing.

460
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,950
Get to the point.

461
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:22,559
We only do one theme, the Forgotten Lovers of the Past.

462
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,400
Thanks.

463
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,620
What do you want to know?

464
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,640
What did your mom look like when she was young?

465
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,279
In my memories for her, there are a lot of things involved,

466
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,520
positive or negative.

467
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,560
I can't remember it well.

468
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,799
I think in those bad memories of yours, your mom didn't hurt you on purpose.

469
00:39:51,799 --> 00:39:53,370
Maybe.

470
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,800
I don't know how to start my narration.

471
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,940
How about starting it with your happy memories?

472
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,430
In my memories,

473
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,510
she was always beautiful.

474
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:17,449
She taught me how to play the violin and read stories before I slept.

475
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:24,519
Even if I flied paper planes around the whole house, she was always smiling.

476
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,320
She was so smart.

477
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,500
Looks like nothing could stump her.

478
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,659
Others thought she was fragile.

479
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,010
But in front of me, she showed her toughness,

480
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,220
though in her own way.

481
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,160
Are you going to eat?

482
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,160
If not, don't sit here.

483
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,640
Do you want to eat white rabbit rolls?

484
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,160
These two rolls belong to you.

485
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,180
Now close your eyes

486
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:20,850
and count from one to ten.

487
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,619
I didn't want to tell you before

488
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:49,029
because people always take a sympathetic look at the children from broken families

489
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:51,229
and blame mistakes they make at adulthood on their original families.

00:41:51,229 --> 00:41:53,570
But I don't think it's fair.

491
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:57,209
Won't the child from an entire family make a mistake in his whole life?

492
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:06,620
I don't need your sympathy.

493
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,760
Now that I made a mistake, I can afford the consequences.

494
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,040
I don't need your forgiveness.

495
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,570
I won't forgive you,

496
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,160
at least now.

497
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,939
But it's my own choice to make friends with you.

498
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,840
That's quite another thing.

499
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:35,459
Jiahui, I think in some aspects we're really similar.

500
00:42:35,459 --> 00:42:40,410
We've both suffered the pain and had the memories that ordinary people can't have.

501
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:44,080
But we shouldn't let our past affect what we are now.

502
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,179
Each day is a new day.

503
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,229
We can't always dwell on the painful past.

504
00:42:49,229 --> 00:42:51,460
And I believe

505
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,220
your mom must love you so much.

506
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,080
