[Episode 19]

18
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,720
Mr. Mo. How did you feel at that moment?

19
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,099
I felt that one should show others he's not a pushover now and then,

20
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:57,330
or people will always think you are a pushover

21
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,690
and they will bully you all the time.

22
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,100
You look different now.

23
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,460
Miss He, I'm much better.

24
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,279
Although my colleagues still don't like me, I think I can focus on my work now.

25
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:16,100
Although your colleagues still don't like you, you seem to be less affected by their attitude.

26
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,670
After a session was over, many visitors

27
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,419
would feel their mental state had improved for the better and then they wouldn't come back.

28
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:26,019
But Mr. Mo, you still came back as we scheduled.

29
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,810
I think I still

30
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,900
need this counselor-visitor relationship.

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,930
Mr. Xiao Mo.

32
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,439
I think you might have something to say but you are not ready yet.

33
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,550
I am not a victim anymore.

34
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,470
Not anymore.

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,559
Does the fact that you're no longer a victim make you feel happy?

36
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,570
I am not happy!

37
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,720
I'm sorry, Miss He. Sorry. So sorry.

38
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,540
I'm sorry. I lost control. Sorry.

39
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,470
It's all right. In this place, you can release any of your emotions.

40
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,990
Why?

41
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,909
I really don't know why. They bullied me and isolated me.

42
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:21,099
I just fought back once. But I still feel as if I was the one who did the wrong thing.

43
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:24,149
Why would I feel so guilty about it?

44
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:27,639
They forced me to drink, laughed at me, and scolded me. But none of these made me feel so upset.

45
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,039
But why am I so upset when I just spoke out what I always wanted to tell them?

46
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,850
I feel bad. I'm such a coward!

47
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,909
Miss He. Do I deserve to be pushed aside and isolated?

48
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:44,119
So somehow you feel guilty when what you did was speak out the truth to protect yourself.

49
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,549
If speaking out your inner thoughts is the best way to protect yourself,

50
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:11,220
but you feel that your sense of security should not be built on hurting other people.

51
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,010
Hey.

52
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,129
You abided by the rules during the exam

53
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:19,360
and successfully prevented us from going astray.

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,590
To show our gratitude we bought you a white rabbit toffee.

55
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,659
It's okay. I don't need it.

56
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:24,620
Just take it!

57
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,569
Open it.

58
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,570
Hurry up!

59
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,040
It's sweet. Taste it.

60
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,249
Eat it!

61
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:35,200
I'll tell the teacher if you guys don't stop.

62
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,560
Xiao Mo. How do you feel when you think of that classmate now?

63
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,850
I feel guilty.

64
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,390
I hate myself.

65
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,239
I could have told the teacher or the principal what happened to him. but I didn't.

66
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,510
I hid.

67
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,270
I was a coward, a wuss.

68
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,920
I hid. I hid in a corner.

69
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,269
I could hear their voices. I could hear him twitching.

70
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:05,269
I knew how much he wished someone could step forward to offer him some help. But no one did.

71
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,729
I didn't.

72
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:10,709
The reason you hate yourself is you didn't help him back then.

73
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:14,509
What do you think the result is had you chosen to help him?

74
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,230
That's him!

75
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,730
It's him!

76
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,490
What is in your head now?

77
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,270
I would be isolated again.

78
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,370
I would be beaten up again.

79
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,550
What happened?

80
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,350
Because I helped him.

81
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,340
They would target me had I stepped forward to help him.

82
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,480
They would torture me in many ways.

83
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,310
You know, I even thought it was good for me. I was thinking,

84
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,129
they finally went to bully another kid so they wouldn't target me every day.

85
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,250
Now that I think about it, my thoughts were so despicable.

86
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,100
I think I deserve everything bad that's happening to me today.

87
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,110
No.

88
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,559
You didn't protect him because you had to protect yourself first.

89
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,730
Can I really do that?

90
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,689
Can people really protect themselves regardless of other people?

91
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,780
I am not sure.

92
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,670
That sounds so cruel.

93
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,969
I watched them shove chalks into his mouth. His mouth was full of chalks.

94
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:23,999
Not only the white ones but also red, green and blue ones.

95
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,300
He tried to spit them out. They didn't let him do that.

96
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,309
They held his mouth and forced him to swallow.

97
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:31,540
And he did.

98
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,339
They also ground chalks into powder and stuffed into his nose.

99
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:39,739
They blew the powder into his nose, again and again. They just repeated it.

100
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,100
He was only fourteen years old that year.

101
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,460
[Dun Dun]

102
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,469
Xiao Mo, do you remember the form you filled out when you visited me for the first time?

103
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:23,270
At that time there was this sentence,

104
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,099
"I will feel like a bad person if I can't dedicate everything to others at any time."

105
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:31,750
You checked the box.

106
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,480
Miss He, I'm a bad person!

107
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,230
I'm being selfish. I'm so selfish!

108
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,880
But Xiao Mo,

109
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,470
don't you think you also deserve to be protected?

110
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,219
It's not wrong for you to protect yourself.

111
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:51,539
If you want to be a braver person because you want to protect others,

112
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:55,769
the first thing you have to do is to protect yourself.

113
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,650
I feel that I can relate to you at this moment.

114
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,290
I also understand why you would feel lonely.

115
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,249
Because no one has been standing by your side since childhood.

116
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's imagine this.

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,049
A picture emerges in your head.

118
00:08:22,049 --> 00:08:24,640
Don't put any pressure on yourself.

119
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,010
What do you see now?

120
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,830
I see

121
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,840
the apartment we lived when I was little.

122
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,910
Very good.

123
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,399
Now think of yourself as the younger version of you.

124
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,779
You can walk out of your room.

125
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:13,980
Tell me what's out there?

126
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,489
This is our living room.

127
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:22,480
Mom and Dad are working.

128
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,030
Okay. Now please go in front of them and talk to them.

129
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,170
Dad. Mom.

130
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,399
Tell them that you have a bad time at school.

131
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,450
Recently my classmates always bullied me.

132
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,520
Really?

133
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,099
They called me names and they also shoved me around.

134
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:48,030
They were just joking with you.

135
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,470
But I don't like these jokes!

136
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,049
It hurts my feelings every time I think about it.

137
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:57,180
Then tell them that you don't like it.

138
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,979
I told them, but they wouldn't stop.

139
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:03,570
Then just don't mess with them.

140
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,350
I didn't mess with them.

141
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,389
If you didn't mess with them to begin with, why would they pick on you and bully you?

142
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:12,929
Xiao Mo, if others don't like you, you need to reflect on what you did wrong.

143
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:14,080
You know?

144
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,329
Mo Yu, you have to learn to get along with your classmates.

145
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:24,320
You can't throw a tantrum to your classmates like you did to us at home.

146
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,900
Good boy.

147
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,600
You don't love me at all!

148
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,150
Younger Mo Yu.

149
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,200
Don't be sad.

150
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,790
Now we'll let the grown-up you

151
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,200
travel through time to tell you something

152
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,710
different about your childhood.

153
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,230
Al lright?

154
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,780
Okay.

155
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,810
Mr. Mo Yu.

156
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,880
He is in front of you now.

157
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,250
Do you have something to tell him?

158
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:12,680
Why... Why would mom and mad take other kids' side?

159
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,609
They didn't take other kids' side.

160
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:25,590
They just didn't know how to help you.

161
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,550
- They don't love me?
- They love you.

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,880
They just...

163
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,420
Don't have the time to tell you that.

164
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,860
Why would everyone make jokes about me?

165
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,650
I don't like those jokes.

166
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:50,000
They make me sad every time I think about them.

167
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,670
Mo Yu.

168
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,690
Those are not jokes.

169
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,749
They did it on purpose to make you unhappy.

170
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:02,099
Why would they want to do that?

171
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:04,879
I don't want to make others

172
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:07,880
sad or upset at all.

173
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,670
You are right.

174
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,080
It is wrong to make others sad.

175
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,309
Those who hurt you deliberately are not doing the right thing.

176
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,840
But I'm scared. I can't beat them in a fight.

177
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,670
You don't need to beat them.

178
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,299
You just need to protect yourself.

179
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,490
You need to tell the teacher if they want to hit you again.

180
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,840
Or tell the police.

181
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,659
Tell them everything you are going through now.

182
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:37,200
Don't believe in their threat.

183
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,960
That's all you need to do.

184
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,779
So I'll have to stay here?

185
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:44,300
Can I go with you?

186
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,490
Sorry.

187
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,150
I am sorry.

188
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,050
It's okay, Xiao Mo.

189
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,740
I'll stay here.

190
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,750
You need to grow up and be well.

I'm sorry, Miss He.

released your emotions and stress here.

- Again?
- I'm so sorry.

You can register online now.

Oh, yes. I can find the registration system online, right?

- Okay.

Ma'am, wait. Someone just canceled the appointment.

Really?

225
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,280
Look at that. Good luck is more useful than a good head.

226
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,100
- Okay. Thank you.
- Take this.

Is your blood pressure high?

229
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:27,290
No. I had it checked in our community clinic the day before yesterday.

230
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,000
Usually, I would check it every morning

231
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,470
and every night and it looks pretty normal.

232
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,770
This is just a routine question.

233
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,200
You don't need to be nervous.

234
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,699
Because high blood pressure always comes with symptoms such as headache and nausea.

235
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:42,639
We had some blood routine exam, urine routine exam, and blood sugar level check.

236
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,550
There is nothing serious with all your indicators.

237
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,280
Doctor,

238
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,740
is it possible that

239
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,849
I have a brain tumor?

240
00:15:56,849 --> 00:16:00,880
So do you show any other symptoms except for the headache and nausea?

241
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,280
Yes, I have. Sometimes I can't see anything

242
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,810
because my vision would blur suddenly.

243
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,230
There are many causes of blurred vision.

244
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,780
But we can't completely rule out this possibility, either.

245
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,679
If you often show symptoms of headache, dizziness, and nausea,

246
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,749
I'd suggest you do an MRI accompanied by a family.

Can you stay away from me?

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,660
- Don't call me Jun Jun.
- Then why did your mom call you Jun Jun?

258
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,040
Jun Jun is my younger brother's name.

Do you really want me to follow you around every day?

284

You want me to wait for you to ask how I feel, like I don't have better things to do?

Lili, it's a good thing for you to fall in love.

But I'm worried that you might be acting impulsively.

Do you know what I mean?

289
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,649
I'm just dating. You call it acting impulsively?

290
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:51,711
That's not what I mean.

291
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:53,830
What do you mean then?

292
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,299
I think that wealth is very important.

293
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,330
But I hope you can see this man for who he really is.

294
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,160
Does he really love you?

295

Does he want to make a commitment in this relationship?

296
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,720
You have to think about these things.

297

So you saw his fancy car.

298

You know what? You are my best friend.

302
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,810
So why did I keep hiding it from you?

303
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,659
Because I can't stand the way you always want to be the savior.

304
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,310
You always seem to stand on the moral high ground to judge me.

305
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,880
It seems that everything I've done is wrong.

306
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,969
In front of you, I'm like a child who is still so naive.

307
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:37,489
Yes, I admit that I like rich guys.

308
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:39,280
I always feel insecure.

309
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,090
I just like mature men older than me because I have daddy issues. What's wrong with that?

310
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:46,380
I am happy with my current life and I will be responsible for my choices. All right?

311
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,159
Lili. You just said it yourself that you just feel insecure.

312
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,940
So you don't really love them. You just need them.

313
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,059
Can you understand? Can you let me finish?

314
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:58,800
- I don't understand and I don't wanna hear it!
- Can you… Can you listen to me?

315
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,560
You don't really love them. You just need them.

316
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,920
But please believe that one day you will meet someone you truly love.

317
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,849
Someone I truly love?

318
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:24,150
Do you even understand what love really means?

319
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,520
You are so pretentious.

320
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,959
You will only run away when there's a good opportunity for you to find true love.

321
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:30,550
Do you know who you really love?

322
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,520
Even if you do, do you have the courage to admit it?

323
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,079
I have said everything I should and done everything I can.

324
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,460
Take care.

325
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,499
I have said everything I should and done everything I can.

326
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,040
Take care.

[Ye Jiahui]

328
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,660
Jiahui.

329
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,230
Sorry.

330
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,760
I did not expect you two to quarrel over this matter.

331
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,860
Lili did it because I let her down.

332
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,559
You did it because you wanted to protect her from being deceived by those guys.

333
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,949
Jiahui,

334
00:22:58,949 --> 00:23:04,019
do you think that I always stand on the moral high ground trying to be the savior?

335
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,400
Say no more.

336
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,899
He Dun, actually you don't have to be right about everything.

337
00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:16,560
Real life is not counseling.

338
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,830
You don't have to be so cautious and want to be absolutely right in everything you say.

339
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,259
You fought with Lili which also reflected the sincerest emotion in your heart.

340
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:27,290
I think you are right.

341
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,100
Time is up. Let's go. I'll take you to the garden house.

342
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,699
Don't you have a livestreaming later today?

343
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:40,260
You'll be just on time if you depart now.

344
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,160
You are so pretentious.

345
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,369
You will only run away when there's a good opportunity for you to find true love.

346
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:46,420
Do you know who you really love?

347
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,389
Even if you do, do you have the courage to admit it?

348
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,190
It's okay. I can go by myself.

349
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,940
Brother Qian. This garden house is pretty enough.

350
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,380
Why did you buy more greenery?

351
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,109
This afternoon I saw an old lady selling flowers and greenery in the blazing sun.

352
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:21,070
So I bought some.

353
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,430
How about this pot of mint?

354
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,110
Nice.

355
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,470
Brother Qian, this is for you.

356
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,779
You asked me to do a research on several situations that are most likely to lead to bullying

357
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:36,247
and psychological changes victims are likely to face after being traumatized.

358
00:24:36,247 --> 00:24:38,280
I've put them in your script.

359
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,779
- I have a few questions that I want to ask you.
- Okay.

360
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:44,059
The so-called intrusive symptoms you wrote in the script.

361
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:47,119
I have never figured out what the symptoms are like.

362
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,349
Intrusive symptoms mean people who have a PTSD

363
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:55,049
will vividly see or dream about some trauma-related experiences.

364
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:57,149
And they will experience strong

365
00:24:57,149 --> 00:25:00,659
physiological or psychological response again in a similar scenario.

366
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:03,020
Don't call me Jun Jun!

367
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,019
Because it's so painful, they will avoid this kind of scenario.

368
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:11,109
But he or she only temporarily locks the memory up.

369
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,970
The pain isn't really gone.

370
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,600
Instead, the sealed memory will prevent them from really letting go and moving on.

371
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,830
Can I put it this way?

372
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,400
If the human brain is like a room,

373
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,709
the memories that we don't want to remember are like someone who keeps knocking on the door.

374
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:27,610
Although we can't see him, every time we hear the knocking sound,

375
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:32,199
it'll remind us that the knocker is always there, so are the memories.

376
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:34,280
Yes! This metaphor just nails it!

377
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,489
Even if the door is sealed from inside, these memories will break in through the window.

378
00:25:38,489 --> 00:25:42,399
Xiao Li, you're good. You'll be as good as Miss He if you keep it up this way.

379
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:45,899
Oh, no. I am nowhere near getting there.

380
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:50,049
There are some psychological terms that I'm not very familiar yet.

381
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,560
I'll double-check with Miss He Dun later.

382
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,570
Sure, no problem.

383
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:59,389
Xiao Li, do you also know in what form the suppressed memories will relive?

384
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:02,099
I remember I saw it somewhere. Let me see.

385
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:04,680
Here it is. They will appear in the form of a nightmare.

386
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,820
And if a similar scenario happens in front of them, it may also trigger their stress response.

387
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,810
I know what you want to ask me.

388
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,159
Don't you just want to ask me if I am dating someone?

389
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,420
If you are, I will feel very happy for you.

390
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,840
It's just that I'm worried…

391
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,639
Lili, you just said it yourself. You just feel insecure.

392
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,600
So you don't really love them.

393
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,330
- I don't understand and I don't wanna hear it!
- Can you let me finish?

394
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,530
One day you will meet someone you truly love.

395
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,050
Someone I truly love?

396
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,040
Do you even understand what love really means?

397
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,089
60 seconds counting down.

398
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:13,730
Light up your heart like stars.

399
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,109
The night is still young and let's feel the cool breeze.

400
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:20,099
Welcome to Night Talk to Your Heart.

401
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:21,660
You seem to have a sore throat.

402
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,940
Drink some tea to sooth it.

403
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,159
- Thanks.
- Be careful, it's still hot.

404
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,919
Why did you put so many plants in the house today?

405
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,299
You want to open a botanical garden?

406
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:39,179
What? Am I really overdoing it?

407
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,530
They said that greenery can freshen the air.

408
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,430
Smell this pot of mint.

409
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,430
I heard it has a soothing effect.

410
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,700
It smells nice.

411
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,040
Thank you.

412
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,460
The paper smells of eucalyptus.

413
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,489
Yes. Refreshing and soothing.

414
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,860
You also have a stuffed doll here.

415
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,580
Like it?

416
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,820
I bought two.

417
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,310
Happy Doll.

418
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,420
If you like them, you can take them home.

419
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,080
When did you prepare these things?

420
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,800
Back on air in three seconds.

421
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,000

[Night Talk to Your Heart]

424
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:29,489
Welcome back! This is Night Talk to Your Heart.

425
00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:34,149
- The topic we are gonna talk about is about campus life. Miss He...
- Yes?

426
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:39,280
Imagine you can travel back to your schooldays to a student who is being isolated by other people.

427
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,000
Every time he or she can only watch from a distance how other classmates are playing,

428
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,320
but he or she can't fit in.

429
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,330
What would you say to this student?

430
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:50,210
I think I will tell them, "You are not alone."

431
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:54,319
John Donn, a famous British poet living in the seventeenth century had this famous poem,

432
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:59,330
"No man is an island unto themselves;

433
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:04,949
every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main."

434
00:29:04,949 --> 00:29:06,760
I think at this moment you will definitely think,

435
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,880
''Why do I have to live such a miserable life?

436
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,849
Isn't campus supposed to be a place full of sunshine and happiness?"

437
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:20,430
And now you are in a long narrow tunnel and you can't see the end.

438
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:24,349
If you are in such a state, you have to tell yourself,

439
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:27,080
don't just blame yourself for everything that's happening to you.

440
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,930
Actually anyone's behavior, especially campus bullying

441
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,090
or other forms of violence have their own complicated reasons behind.

442
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,270
You can't simply attribute it to any certain mentality.

443
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:40,830
It's shaped by multiple dimensions made up of society, family, the person's personality, and friends.

444
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,230
Psychologically, individuals affected by it

445
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:49,509
may show social aggression or social withdrawal in the long term.

446
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:51,890
Or maybe they won't show any behavior.

447
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,460
But the trauma will psychologically affect the individual's emotions and perception.

448
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,630
Night Talk to Your Heart
That's right. Whether it's verbal violence such as sarcasm,

449
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:03,759
shoving a person around, destroying their belongings, spreading rumors about a person, or isolating them,

450
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:05,970
these are all bullying behaviors.

451
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,070
Yes.

452
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,560
In fact, the most harmful thing about bullying is that

453
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,910
the behaviors will make us feel weak, inferior, and helpless.

454
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,199
And the feelings are unable to reverse.

455
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:19,350
But I still want to say that

456
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,879
actually, our world isn't just so cold and abominable like we just described.

457
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:27,759
No. Don't escape, don't remain silent, and don't back off.

458
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,729
I want to say this to everyone who's living in it.

459
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:35,369
As long as you need help, as long as you are willing to reach out and open your mouth to speak,

460
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:38,709
there will always be ears waiting to listen to your trouble.

461
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:40,560
You are not alone.

462
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,120
You can change yourself.

463
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,410
You are not alone. This is a very warm statement.

464
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,130
Then Miss He, I have one more question.

465
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:53,129
For those who made a mistake but want to make it right, if they want to apologize to

466
00:30:53,129 --> 00:30:56,439
the people they once hurt, what do you think of such an apology?

467
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:59,210
In other words, will you accept it?

468
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:02,859
I believe we should leave a door open for kindness.

469
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,009
All right, dear listeners.

470
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:08,699
So much for today's Night Talk to Your Heart.

00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:37,930
Did I do something wrong?

478
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:41,189
If I upset you, you can hit me, scold me, whatever you want to do to me!

479
00:31:41,189 --> 00:31:43,160
But don't be upset, okay?

480
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,760
Sorry.

481
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,710
I can't do this with you anymore.

482
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,849
Why not? If it's because what happened just now, I'll apologize to you.

483
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:53,210
No, it's my problem. I can't stay in a room without windows for three hours.

484
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,360
I can't do it.

485
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,179
Dear listeners, good evening.

486
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,409
Here is the live broadcast Night Talk to Your Heart.

487
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:01,560
I am your host Qian Kaiyi.

488
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,739
Let's welcome my partner, He Dun.

489
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:09,520
♫  That melancholic but beautiful rainy season  ♫

490
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,220
This is the fixed publicity mode of our radio station.

491
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,010
Everyone has shot this before.

492
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,660
What poster?

493
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:23,009
You want me to shoot a poster with you?

494
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:25,589
I'm your partner! Your fellow partner!

495
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:28,720
How can you be so cruel and treat me differently?

496
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,260
Wipe your neck. It's all dusty.

497
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:36,969
If you need a special audience one day, just turn around.

498
00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:38,760
I will always be there for you.

499
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:45,850
♫  Those bits and pieces, those memories  ♫

500
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,729
He Dun, give me a second.

501
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:49,979
Dong is collating data. I'll drive you back in a while.

502
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:51,560
You can also take some greenery home.

503
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,410
It's okay. I will forget to water them if I take them home.

504
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:57,359
Lili can help you. She can take care of them.

505
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,370
It's okay, thanks.

506
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,460
What's wrong? You're not feeling well?

507
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,800
Do you want me to take you home now?

508
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,830
No, I'm fine.

509
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:14,469
I'm going back to my mom's place today So I won't go back to the counseling office.

510
00:33:14,469 --> 00:33:17,039
Don't you still have work to do? Just go.

511
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,060
Qian.

512
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,720
Okay. Text me when you get home.

513
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,740
Qian Kaiyi,

514
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,400
thank you for everything you prepared for me.

515
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,100
Thanks.

516
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,040
Can we sit together?

517
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,970
I'll give it back to you later.

518
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,330
- What do you guys want?
- Mind your own business!

519
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:20,709
I heard what you just said. I am telling you, don't even think about it.

520
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,150
I'll give you ten seconds to piss off!

521
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,630
I'll call the police if you don't leave.

522
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,100
If you don't want to be arrested, beat it!

523
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,569
I will give you two choices.

524
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:32,899
Option No. 1, let me be your psychological counselor.

525
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:36,279
No. 2, let me be your good friend?

526
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,460
I choose No. 2.

527
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:47,419
Many people were born wrapped in sugar coat.

528
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,910
Although we don't have a sugar coat,

529
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,700
we can still hug each other to keep warm.

530
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,320
He Dun, it's so nice to meet you.

531
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,150
Me, too.

532
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,630
Potatoes are coming.

533
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,900
I can peel potatoes.

534
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,170
Good girl. Mom's favorite food is potato.

535
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,739
Look at you.

536
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:36,649
Let me tell you, Dun Dun, you really need to learn to cook.

537
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:38,000
Give priority to it.

538
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,319
At least you need to cook the way I do.

539
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:42,870
Otherwise, you will starve to death if I die.

540
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,600
Mom, what are you talking about?

541
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,699
I'll go wherever you go.

542
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:47,089
If you die, I will die with you.

543
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:49,610
No, absolutely no. You can't be so clingy.

544
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:53,020
Your hand! You know I'm a neat freak.

545
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,600
Naughty girl.

546
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,850
How are you recently?

547
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,570
Do you still have nightmares?

548
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,140
Well, it's okay.

549
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,120
Mom, how about you go live with me?

550
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,549
I don't want to live with you. I feel carefree to live by myself now.

551
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:12,710
I'll come back to live with you then.

552
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,050
You want to live with me?

553
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,460
No. You won't be able to find a husband.

554
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,420
Did you have a fight with Lili?

555
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,600
No. I just think if I live here and

556
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,899
commute to my office every day, there is a sense of ritual as working.

557
00:36:27,899 --> 00:36:30,100
Don't use some fancy terms to lie to me. What sense of ritual?

558
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,670
You don't even blush when you lie.

559
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,050
Did you two fall out?

560
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,940
No.

561
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,459
Let me tell you this, Dun Dun.

562
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:44,849
I want to have a good chat with you about some issues and don't think this is useless.

563
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:48,599
When it's about human hearts and human relations, we old ladies

564
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:51,719
can talk to you for seven days nonstop and we haven't finished yet.

565
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,080
I just like listening to you talk about these things.

566
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,280
Then let's talk for seven days nonstop!

567
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,630
Really?

568
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,230
Okay.

569
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:06,059
If you ask me, my silly daughter seems to be very energetic and strong all the time.

570
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:11,509
But I know well that you have a soft, fragile, and kind heart.

571
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:15,629
You can easily get obsessed and struggled with things. Right?

572
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,560
Dun Dun, here's the thing.

573
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,390
maybe you think everyone and everything you meet

574
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,630
seems to be just a little part of your life.

575
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,229
So you can deal with them casually by just throwing them away.

576
00:37:27,229 --> 00:37:29,849
You might avoid a problem instead of solving it.

577
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:32,230
But actually one's life

578
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:36,699
is made of things happening and people you meet.

579
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:38,840
All of them form your life.

580
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,719
You can't always avoid and give up when you encounter problems.

581
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,050
What are you left with your life then?

582
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,800
Take Lili for example.

583
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,240
I don't know what conflict you two have.

584
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,479
No matter who is right, I hope you can be the bigger person.

585
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:56,230
Don't just give up such a good friend.

586
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,430
Face the problem bravely.

587
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:02,040
You can't solve a problem by pretending it's not there. Did you hear me?

588
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,649
- Um.
- Uh-huh.

589
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,480
Don't just hum. Are you a mosquito?

590
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,169
Mom, come on. I know what to do.

591
00:38:11,169 --> 00:38:12,950
Okay, I'll stop.

592
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,970
Dun Dun.

593
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:46,800
I just want you and Lili to get along well.

594
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,999
I hope you can have someone to be with you by your side.

595
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,747
Even if…

596
00:38:53,747 --> 00:38:56,634
Even if I die one day,

597
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,730
you two can take care of each other.

598
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:03,119
So I will feel relieved.

599
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,600
Here.

600
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,169
After you move in, you can contact the housekeeper anytime if you have any questions.

601
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:35,589
I'll ask them to buy some daily necessities for you later. And furniture, too.

602
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:37,420
You don't need to worry about anything.

603
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,870
Okay.

604
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,330
What's wrong?

605
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:54,479
I didn't expect my competitor in love to be a woman.

606
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,140
If you still feel sad, I'm about to be jealous of He Dun.

607
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,870
I said a lot of things that hurt her feelings

608
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,390
before I left.

609
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,250
I don't know what was wrong with me.

610
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,660
I think I'm so selfish.

611
00:40:20,277 --> 00:40:23,950
She never takes the initiative to express her emotions.

612
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,660
She must be devastating this time.

613
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,689
You know, once our company went for a team building.

614
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:35,120
I took her to a field training.

615
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,639
A log about four hundred pounds hit her foot. But she didn't tell me

616
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:40,810
She just gritted her teeth against the pain until the team building was over.

617
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:43,940
I didn't find out until she limped home.

618
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,200
She said that she didn't tell me so that the accident wouldn't spoil other people's mood.

619
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,020
She was afraid I would focus only on taking care of her.

620
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,460
She is always like this.

621
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,360
She always puts other people's feelings first.

622
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,639
She always treads lightly and endures the pain herself.

623
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:01,930
But I know that deep down she is actually very lonely.

624
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:08,309
I am her best friend, yet I hurt her so much.

625
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:11,010
I should be damned!

626
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:15,659
Now that I moved out, she won't even have someone who she can talk to.

627
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,820
You did it just so that you wouldn't be hurt by her.

628
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:24,189
You two best friends are like two cockleburs sticking together.

629
00:41:24,189 --> 00:41:27,939
You are dependent on each other and you see through each other.

630
00:41:27,939 --> 00:41:29,840
You know exactly what her soft spot is.

631
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,539
Likewise, she also knows where your soft spot is.

632
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:37,080
So those things you said might hurt her, maybe…

633
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,569
Maybe what?

634
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:40,870
Maybe it's because you knew her very well.

635
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:46,170
You knew exactly what she wanted to say or what she was going to say.

636
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,810
You...

637
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,089
Just didn't want to hear those words that would hurt you.

638
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:56,929
So you beat her to it to say it first.

639
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,330
This is not selfishness.

640
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:04,079
This is human instinct of self-protection.

641
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,390
Just like her loneliness is also a kind of self-protection.

642
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,100
Young man.

643
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,190
Do you want to buy this book?

644
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,030
Professor Ji?

645
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,570
You are?

646
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,370
Professor, this is Jiahui. Professor Ji.

647
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,090
Hello, Professor. My name is Ye Jiahui.

648
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,080
Hello.

649
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,390
The one who came with He Dun last time.

650
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:03,940
My name is Ye Jiahui.

651
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,950
Yes. I am getting older so I have poor memory.

652
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,500
Professor Ji, how are you?

653
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,290
Hello.

654
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,140
