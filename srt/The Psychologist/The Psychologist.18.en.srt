00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,010
I know it! I just know it!

159
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,469
Why will you know how things are going to turn?

160
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,650
Have you experienced similar things before?

161
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,229
It's okay. Take your time to think.

162
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,909
Ever since I was a kid, I had always been ready to take a hint.

163
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:20,111
Their expressions, for example. If what I said would make them happy, I would think about it all day.

164
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:22,800
You know, when I text other people, the emojis they use or their simple replies of "fine" or "hmm"

165
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,660
would make me wonder if I did something wrong again.

166
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,879
So I can't afford to let others hate me because it will break me mentally.

167
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,979
You don't want others to hate you, you want to be liked by everyone

168
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:38,679
because you want to prevent your own world from crashing down.

169
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,890
Because being hated

170
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,720
means you will be isolated by others.

171
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,039
- Xiao Mo.
- Sorry.

172
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,780
I understand.

173
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,639
If you don't mind, can I ask you, have you ever

174
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,199
been isolated because you were hated by other people?

175
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,160
[Preciseness]

176
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,850
Come here.

177
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,689
Bro, can I ask you for a favor?

178
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:14,379
The class teacher will come to check our job in a while.

179
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:16,079
Can you help us clean up the classroom?

180
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,099
Yes, it's easy.

181
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:19,959
Yes, do us a favor.

182
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,639
But I need to go home to do my homework.

183
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,300
Sorry.

184
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,710
He's coming.

185
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,510
Xiao Mo!

186
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,949
Xiao Mo, get up! You'll be late for school if you don't get up now.

187
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:41,519
Xiao Mo, I'm going to work.

188
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,769
We can talk when dad gets off work and comes home, okay?

189
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:48,030
What's the matter with this kid?

190
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,050
What are you looking at? Haven't seen a handsome guy before?

191
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,709
They were just joking around with you.

192
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,880
If other people don't like you, you need to reflect on what you didn't do right. You know?

193
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,350
You're a big boy. Just bite the bullet and it'll go away.

194
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,439
No one will want to make friends with you
if you are not well behaved.

195
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,890
I feel like I am reliving my childhood memories.

196
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,109
I should have helped them do the presentation.

197
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:24,949
At least I should have helped the boys clean up the classroom that day.

198
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:28,409
So they wouldn't have beaten me up or isolated me.

199
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:32,579
Do you still remember since when you started to have this feeling?

200
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,580
Hi. What's your name?

201
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,810
My name is Mo Yu.

202
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,059
Mo Yu, do you get along well with your classmates?

203
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,440
Why?

204
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,740
They don't play with me. They hurt me.

205
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,389
How do they hurt you?

206
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:57,829
They tore up my exercise books.

207
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:00,029
They spoke ill of me in front of the teachers.

208
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:02,180
They also called me a crybaby.

209
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,149
They call me names.

210
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,929
It must feel terrible.

211
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:08,010
Do your parents know that?

212
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,979
They are busy.

213
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:12,900
- Have you ever told them?
- Yeah.

214
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,760
What did they say?

215
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,609
They asked me to stay away from the bullies.

216
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:24,219
They said if others didn't like me,

217
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:27,319
just bite the bullet and it would go away.

218
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,529
They also said that I should reflect on what I didn't do right.

219
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,510
They failed to help you.

220
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,590
So after that, you didn't want to talk to them even if anything bad happened to you again.

221
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,470
Right?

222
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,439
What happened later? How did you get through the difficult time?

223
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,000
Xiao Mo?

224
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,820
I just got used to it.

225
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,110
Maybe I'm not good enough, so I am not worthy of being liked.

226
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,180
But that's not true.

227
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,610
Xiao Mo, you have a very kind heart.

228
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,550
You think everything bad happening to you is your own fault.

229
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:22,009
You don't want to say no to others because you think who you really are doesn't deserve to be liked.

230
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:24,229
So when they ask for your help,

231
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,550
whether it is well-intentioned or malicious,
you will always say yes,

232
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,280
because you think it's the only way to make everyone like you.

233
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,820
Ms. He,

234
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,420
I think what you said makes sense.

235
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,399
But you know what, Xiao Mo?

236
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,489
Only when you accept and start to like your true self,

237
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:52,670
will it be possible for other people to like you for who you really are.

238
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,500
Here, check out please.

239
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,260
Bye.

240
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,809
- Auntie.
- Dun Dun.

241
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,759
Is Lili with you?

242
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,469
I called her but she didn't pick up.

243
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,999
Lili is not with me right now. Can I ask what this is about?

244
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:30,499
I tried to pay the utility bills.

245
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:33,299
But I can't figure out how, so I haven't paid the bills yet.

246
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:34,969
You mean your water and electricity bills?

247
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,880
I asked Lili to bring you a manual on paying bills online last time.

248
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,429
Did you read it?

249
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,010
You can pay online with your phone.

250
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,640
Not the electricity bill at home.

251
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,429
Lili didn't tell you, did she?

252
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,219
She rented a storefront for me to open a grocery store.

253
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:48,949
I'm trying to pay the store's electricity bill.

254
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:54,769
I really didn't expect this silly girl to have so much money. Right?

255
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:58,000
She should be with her new boyfriend now.

256
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,739
- She didn't tell you?
- Don't you just want to ask me if I'm dating someone now?

257
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:07,160
Lili recently got another job which came with a great pay raise.

258
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,259
- Auntie.
- Lili just called me back.

259
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:11,979
Dun Dun, come to check out the grocery store when you have time.

260
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:14,260
Sure. Bye, Auntie.

261
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,689
Lili, over here.

262
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:33,930
Qian Kaiyi.

263
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,410
I ordered you some hot water.

264
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,199
Girls should drink a lot of hot water.

265
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,359
Thank you.

266
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,180
You're not afraid that I might tell He Dun that you asked to meet me in private?

267
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,830
Say it. What do you want to know about He Dun this time?

268
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,179
I just want to have a casual chat with you.

269
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:56,759
I want to know if you girls occasionally share some secrets that you can't tell anyone else?

270
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,559
Since I can't tell anyone else, why would I tell you?

271
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,809
No, I mean, when you girls have problems with your romantic relationship,

272
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,610
will you share them with each other?

273
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,549
- Certainly.
- So did He Dun mention me recently?

274
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,249
- Occasionally.
- Occasionally?

275
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:20,089
When she mentioned me, did she say it
with a happy face or a serious one?

276
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:21,279
Are you trying to solve a murder now?

277
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,460
- Let me tell you, the clock is ticking and you seem to have a lot to ask. Spit it out!
- Don't go.

278
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,559
Then I'll cut to the chase. I mean, do you think He Dun

279
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,629
likes me romantically, even just by a little bit?

280
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,230
No.

281
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,950
Well, I can't be absolutely sure.

282
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,679
- Maybe a little bit.
- A little bit?

283
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,430
You are still happy when it's just a little bit?

284
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,919
Lili, let's be frank.

285
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,209
I know that I look quite unreliable.

286
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,310
Sometimes I can be quite annoying.

287
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,640
But I really like He Dun.

288
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,890
Although it was just a while ago that we met again, I am sure that I've fallen in love with her.

289
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,640
Maybe I realized my feelings when I saw her step forward to help others regardless of her safety.

290
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,100
Maybe it was when I was so scared when she was in danger.

291
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,280
There seems to be magic in her that I can't take my eyes off her.

292
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,999
I'll laugh when I see her happy.

293
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,030
I get nervous when she frowns.

294
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,829
When she cries, I wish the one who gets hurt is me, not her.

295
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,529
I was anxious when I saw Ye Jiahui follow her around.

296
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:33,380
So what can I do to impress her?

297
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,109
Honestly, I am very optimistic about you.

298
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:45,100
But technically speaking, you are not her type.

299
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,060
What is her type then?

300
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,700
Maybe an intricate and calm guy.

301
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,149
- You mean Ye Jiahui?
- I didn't say that.

302
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:57,560
There is an old saying, "Things will change, so will people's hearts".

303
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,460
She used to chase you. Now you try to chase her.

304
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,850
You two are a typical example of how important timing is in love.

305
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,839
- What did you just say?
- How important timing is.

306
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,050
No. Before that.

307
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,820
Bro, can you handle it?

308
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,620
Don't make me feel bad.

309
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,340
Mind your own business!

310
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,400
Don't tell the girls that I'm in detention.

311
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,230
Did you hear me?

312
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,209
Go get it! Go get it!

313
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,850
Guy Number Nine is me!

314
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,320
Qian, I told you everything.

315
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,770
You can't rat me out to tell her that I told you that!

316
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,259
Lili, thank you for sharing this news with me.

317
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:46,690
This is such great news for me!

Thank you.

You do advertising planning?

332
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,479
I have some problems about media placement and channels.

333
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:00,389
I wonder if you have a few minutes so that we can communicate?

334
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:02,730
Let's exchange contact information.

Sister!

Sister!

338
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,300
Sister!

339
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,420
Sister!

340
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,679
Sister, didn't we agree you would raise your hands and surrender if I found you?

341
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,640
Sister, you lied!

342
00:26:09,678 --> 00:26:12,078
Sister, you are not happy?

343
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,720
I am very happy.

344
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,500
Sister is so happy to see you, Jun.

345
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,300
Then why are you crying?

346
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,880
Is someone bullying you?

347
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,520
If someone bullies me, will you help me?

348
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,659
I'm going to kick those bullies' asses!

349
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:42,299
Then I will invent a medicine that can make you happy.

350
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,110
A sweet medicine which tastes like candy.

351
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,289
I want to give this medicine to all the people in the world who are unhappy.

352
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:51,210
They'll become happier after they eat it.

353
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,829
Jun Jun, I am sorry. I am so sorry.

354
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:06,600
Don't leave me, okay?

355
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,980
Stay by my side, okay?

356
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,920
I will never fight with you again.

357
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,699
Don't you like beef jerky?

358
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:14,640
I'll go buy some for you, okay?

359
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,819
And your favorite cupcakes. I will buy them, too.

Jun Jun, don't leave me.

363
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,740
Don't leave me ever again. Okay?

364
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,430
Jun Jun!

365
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,970
Come here. Come to Sister.

366
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,679
It's all your fault! I blame you!

367
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,400
I don't want to see you again!

368
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,729
Jun Jun. Jun Jun!

369
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,830
What are you doing?

370
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:38,229
This is my house. I should be the one asking you this question.

371
00:28:38,229 --> 00:28:40,280
What are you doing here early in the morning?

372
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,020
Meeting a friend here.

373
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,890
Aren't you going out? Off you go.

374
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,940
This is my house. So leave me alone!

375
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,860
You're here to wait for He Dun, right?

376
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,800
Leave me alone!

377
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,810
Then take your time to wait.

378
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,540
He's boring.

379
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,010
He Dun,

380
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,560
what's wrong?

381
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,710
It's okay. I'm here. Get up.

382
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,710
Don't squat.

383
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,120
Adjust your breathing.

384
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,460
Breathe out, and in.

385
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,230
Out. In.

386
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,040
Out.

387
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,780
Better now?

388
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,270
Thank you.

389
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,059
But your rhythm of breathing out and in was the opposite of what I was doing.

390
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:58,640
Sorry.

391
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,980
I am okay now. I was caught in a nightmare just now so I felt sick all of a sudden.

392
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,500
What was the nightmare that scared you like this?

393
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,560
Nothing.

394
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,560
I just remembered some bad memories.

395
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,330
What are you doing here? Did something happen in the radio station?

396
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,700
I…

397
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,520
Wow!

398
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,930
Look! Something just flew over there!

399
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,560
Did it?

400
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,999
- But I just…
- Nothing at all.

401
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,059
You'll be fine. Don't be upset.

402
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,400
So what brings you here really?

403
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,500
Oh, yes.

404
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,779
We went to the same high school, right?

405
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:53,420
Xiao Yuan and I found a group photo of us at that time.

406
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,700
I don't know if you still have it, so…

407
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,250
It got wet.

408
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,680
High school group photo?

409
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,590
No. I haven't seen it for a long time.

410
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,430
That's it?

411
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,310
Yes.

412
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:33,529
I mean you especially came here just to give me this photo?

413
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,410
Yes. Actually, I just wanted to take a walk to help digestion.

414
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,170
You came all the way here just to help digestion?

415
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,720
Yeah, I was so full.

416
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,590
Why do you dress all in black?

417
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,280
Do I look more mature and stable?

418
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,730
Why do you try to imitate Ye Jiahui?

419
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,980
I imitate him?

420
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,880
I thought you liked it this way.

421
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,120
Thank you. I like it very much.

422
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,600
Really?

423
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,830
I mean I like this photo.

424
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,630
And also,

425
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:24,349
I still prefer you are in an aloha shirt. It suits you better.

426
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,320
Mo Yu.

427
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,230
Brother Fei.

428
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,810
Do you want some coffee? I'm going to buy two cups.

429
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,720
It's okay. I brought soft drinks for us.

430
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,170
Take a seat.

431
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,610
Thanks.

432
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,900
Cheers.

433
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,350
Brother Fei, you can just call me Xiao Mo if you like.

434
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,299
I think your company's

435
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:33,039
distribution channels in the subway stations and the malls are perfect for my agency's perfume ad…

436
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,299
We're off work now, so let's not talk about work. Let's talk about it tomorrow.

437
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,729
I called you to ask you out today to have a casual chat with me.

438
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,680
Brother Fei, you must be joking.

439
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,401
You are so attractive, knowledgeable, and courageous.

440
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:53,359
There must be a lot of people who want to hang out with you and be your friends.

441
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:56,130
Why would you want to chat with me?

442
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,830
Those people can only be regarded as colleagues.

443
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,760
We associate just for interest's sake.

444
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,850
But during my spare time,

445
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,870
I just want to find a true friend

446
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:12,269
who I can have a real conversation with about our feelings.

447
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:23,080
I am just a nobody. When I am in the crowd, no one will want to take a look at me.

448
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,309
We would never have met if it weren't for me losing my work permit.

449
00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:28,040
Right?

450
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:32,259
What do you want to seek in making friends?

451
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:34,620
It's not like buying some cabbage.

452
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,380
All you need is a sincere heart.

453
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,180
Thank you, Brother Fei.

454
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,010
It's been a long time since someone talked to me like this.

455
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,190
Well, there is one.

456
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:56,689
I'm afraid only a psychological counselor would have such a conversation with me.

457
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,430
What psychological counselor?

458
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,050
I am a nobody in the company.

459
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,800
I have been in the company for more than six months now

460
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,280
but the management still doesn't know what my name is.

461
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:16,390
They won't invite me when they have an after-work dinner or karaoke,

462
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,700
but I am okay with it now.

463
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,130
They don't like me, so naturally, they won't talk to me.

464
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,870
Right?

465
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,570
Are you really okay with it?

466
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,260
Brother Xiao Mo, can you help me do the presentation?

467
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,730
Thanks a lot! I don't have time now.

468
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,759
Xiao Mo, you are still on your way to the office? Can you bring me a latte when you arrive?

469
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:51,690
Americano, venti, no ice.

470
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,120
I'm sorry, Brother Fei.

471
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,760
You treat me as a friend.

472
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,600
I shouldn't have lied to you.

473
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:16,139
Actually, I want to be a good employee, good subordinate, and good colleague, too.

474
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:19,870
But no matter how hard I try, how much bubble tea I bought them and

475
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,001
how much work I did for them, they wouldn't like me.

476
00:36:22,001 --> 00:36:24,930
They won't care about me.

477
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,369
I really don't understand why.

478
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:29,479
Maybe in this world there are some who are destined not to be liked by others.

479
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:32,559
Maybe I don't deserve to be liked. I don't deserve to be trusted by others.

480
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,610
Xiao Mo, hey.

481
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,560
This is not your fault.

482
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,470
Do you know?

483
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,620
Not everyone in this world needs to fit in.

484
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,230
Look at me.

485
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,910
I am a lone wolf and I am used to it.

486
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,150
I live a happy life, too. Right?

487
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,559
When you are strong enough, you don't need to get others' recognition.

488
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:00,080
You can still live a good life.

489
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:16,670
Fei, can I really become as strong as you?

490
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,530
Sure.

491
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,430
I will help you.

492
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,219
Xiao Mo, you're so active in this meeting.

493
00:37:58,219 --> 00:38:00,740
Look at you sitting at the front of the room.

494
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,600
Not bad.

495
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,430
Director, what's the good news?

496
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:19,099
This time's cosmetics project, the client is very satisfied with our marketing plan.

497
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:21,369
If this revenue can continue to maintain,

498
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:24,969
the brand is even willing to sign a framework agreement for the whole year.

499
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,910
This is great!

500
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:32,840
Xiao Lin, you made the marketing plan, right?

501
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,430
Well done.

502
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,489
Xiao Mo, I have something that may need your help.

503
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:40,170
This file is really important.

504
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,899
Sure, Brother Lin.

505
00:38:41,899 --> 00:38:43,230
I'm counting on you, Xiao Mo.

506
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,520
No problem.

507
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,910
I knew I can count on you. You're a good friend.

508
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,040
I will buy you coffee another time.

509
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,819
- Xiao Lin, you should take us to a treat.
- A treat!

510
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:55,419
Thanks. It's everyone's credit.

511
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:58,760
Most members of our team are guys.

512
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,349
I was worried our plan wouldn't have enough highlights to catch the client's attention.

513
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:06,710
Xiao Lin, how did you learn

514
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,670
so much in an unfamiliar field in a short time?

515
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:13,189
Come on. Share your experience with everyone else.

516
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,150
It's nothing really.

517
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:24,799
Everyone in our team did the homework and found references together.

518
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:27,660
- Right?
- Yes, yes.

519
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,100
Don't be shy.

520
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,840
Although you guys worked this plan out together,

521
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,509
I want to know who should take the credit for which part.

522
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:38,940
Please rest assured.

523
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,720
I want to have a clear answer to know who should be rewarded.

524
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,920
Tell us.

525
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,590
Director,

526
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,969
recently after he got off work, Xiao Lin would often call his girlfriend.

527
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,230
In the calls, they would discuss cosmetics.

528
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,091
Although you asked him to share, surely he can't

529
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:55,959
share with us what he and his girlfriend talked about during the phone calls, right?

530
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:58,230
So he learned it from his girl.

531
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:02,120
We can't do that like him. Okay, then.

532
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,829
Let's analyze this marketing plan made by Xiao Lin, all right?

533
00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:10,409
There are indeed many things worth studying in it.

534
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:12,710
Not only the cosmetics here.

535
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,129
There are many projects in the days to come which can find referenced in this plan.

536
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:22,039
Our client is very satisfied with the customer persona analysis.

537
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:25,000
The product is positioned as an entry lux neo domestic product.

538
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,599
Originally the main market segment was urban women in first-tier cities such as the city of Hai.

539
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,290
But the effect was not so good, but Xiao Lin did the opposite.

540
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:38,010
He made an in-depth analysis of

541
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,529
consumer group profiling in inland cities such as Shan, An, and Xinan.

542
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:44,390
It not only provided ideas to our client,

543
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:48,759
but also gave a new direction for our future promotion campaign.

544
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,270
- Congratulations, Lin.
- Well done.

545
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,760
Xiao Lin,

546
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,020
I remember that the group analysis our client sent us was already very detailed.

547
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:08,660
I want to know why you suddenly decided to make a new one?

548
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,599
- Yes. You can at least tell us that.
- He can't.

549
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:21,280
I guess he can't even understand what the latter part of the plan is saying.

550
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,090
Why not?

551
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,630
You ask me why he can't share anything with us?

552
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:34,209
Because I wrote the whole marketing plan by myself.

553
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:37,089
Brother Mo, Brother Mo! Calm down! Let's talk nicely. You…

554
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:41,559
Consumer groups, promotion direction, market analysis, channel plans.

555
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,530
So familiar.

556
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,389
If it weren't for me who put my head down to friend all kinds of people on WeChat...

557
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:53,080
If it weren't for me sending red envelopes to them to ask them to forward the questionnaire to their friends,

558
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,040
you think you would get such detailed data?

559
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,159
Do you think you can get it by making a call to your girlfriend and just asking her a few questions?

560
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:02,260
You just made a questionnaire. What's the big deal?

561
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,230
You sound like you are so good.

562
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,779
So simple? Then why didn't you write it yourself?

563
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:10,070
Your previous presentation was also written by me, right?

564
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,160
Director, it was because I suddenly had another job so I had to…

565
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,520
Didn't you say

566
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,790
you wanted to know who should take the

567
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,140
credit for which part of the project?

568
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,560
- Yes.
- Then I am telling you now.

569
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,949
I wrote every word of every part of this marketing plan.

570
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:30,010
Do you remember it now?

571
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,690
[879-B]

572
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,120
Dad,

573
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,460
why are you here at such a late hour?

574
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,110
You live here?

575
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,609
I was going to ring that doorbell.

576
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:01,090
I pressed the wrong doorbell.

577
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,800
She wouldn't answer my call or reply to my messages,

578
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,570
so I had to come here to find her.

579
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,630
It's a bit late now.

580
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,640
Maybe you can come back another day.

581
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,870
That makes sense.

582
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:27,690
Dad, the thing about He Dun. Give me some more time.

583
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,220
