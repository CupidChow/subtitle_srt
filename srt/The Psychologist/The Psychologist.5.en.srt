- Stars with the largest followings.

She is an expert.

00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:43,441
You only granted 50 and I have to pay the rest 200 yuan. Is it appropriate?

There is no other option.

You have the right not to do that. This is the law of society.

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,349
Our program is on air from 9 pm to 12 am every weekday night.

161
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:16,039
The time for music and commercials... For each episode, we will select a theme.

162
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,569
If you have interest and time, you can join us.

163
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:21,640
Since this is a talk show, it's all about improvisation.

164
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,340
Theoretically, you can say anything, just like chatting with others.

165
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,910
It's not hard for you.

166
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,439
I get it.

167
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:30,970
Now let's have a try so that you will have a direct experience.

168
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,470
Come.

169
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,900
Okay.

170
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,910
Put on the headphones first.

171
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,420
Let me help you.

172
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,580
Thank you.

173
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,589
Remember, keep a distance of two fists

174
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:49,309
from the microphone or it will be hit by the air from your mouth.

175
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:51,320
Okay. Is this alright?

176
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,960
Almost.

177
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,180
Are you nervous? Don't be nervous.

178
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,000
After the opening music, you need to do a brief self-introduction.

179
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,420
Then we will get straight to the point.

180
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,099
Hello, every listener.

181
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:16,750
Welcome to "Night Talk to Your Heart", a city-oriented

182
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,029
emotional and psychological program of Haifeng Radio International,

183
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm your emotional listener, A'Yi.

184
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,709
Don't be in a daze, It's your turn after I finished.

185
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:29,790
I'm your emotional listener, A'Yi.

186
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,450
I'm your happiness ambassador, He Dun.

187
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,999
Good luck with the financing of our group.

188
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,370
Congratulations. Congratulations, Mr. Cao.

189
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,130
This way, please.

190
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,300
Mr. Zhou and Mr. Li are here.

191
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,400
Have you informed everyone of the arrangement?

192
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,519
- Nice to meet you. Long time no see.
- Remember to remind me 10 minutes before the party starts.

193
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,030
Okay.

194
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,539
Mr. Zhou, Mr. Yu, it's been a long time to see you.

195
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:16,590
Mr. Cao knows you're coming today and has prepared some gifts.

196
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,900
My assistant will show them to you.

197
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,039
- Okay. All right.
- We'll go and check them out as well.

198
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,689
- See you later.
- See you.

199
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,219
Mr. Cao, the backdrop is white.

200
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:36,050
Your shirt is also white. It's a bit contrasting.

201
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,250
How about putting on another one?

202
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,150
[Employee Badge: Tang Lili]

203
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,879
Nice to meet you, Miss He. May I call you like that?

204
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,440
Yes.

205
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,000
Psychology is a very popular subject today.

206
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,339
As to psychology, some people will think of depression, bipolar disorder,

207
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,129
obsessive-compulsive disorder and so on.

208
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:22,029
Miss He, can you give us a brief introduction of

209
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:26,190
what psychology is truly about?

210
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,710
How much time do I have to explain the terminology?

211
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,079
You an expert. Aren't you experts very good at

212
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:38,220
using one simple sentence to metaphorize and summarize complex concepts?

213
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,239
I'm still learning, I'm not an expert.

214
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:45,530
My teachers spent six years dispelling my doubts,

215
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,609
plus my work experience.

216
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:49,229
I can't say I know everything.

217
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:52,400
But I at least have five years of accumulation.

218
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,710
But even so, even if I am as eloquent as you are,

219
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:01,419
I may still not be able to use a metaphor and overgeneralize this rigorous subject.

220
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,400
Okay, let's move on to another question.

221
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,539
When people talk about psychology, they tend to regard it as a very mysterious subject.

222
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:12,640
Some listeners tend to associate

223
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,149
psychological counselors with fortune-tellers and astrologers.

224
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:20,470
What's your opinion about this phenomenon?

225
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,779
In fact, metaphysical methods such as fortune-telling and astrology,

226
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:29,249
are external forces that questioners use to analyze their situations.

227
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:32,640
In fact, they feel very confused inside.

228
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,459
As psychological counselors, our job is also to help them exclude anxiety.

229
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:42,909
An outstanding counselor can also predict a specific behavior.

230
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:46,079
However, what the counselor uses is psychological science.

231
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,539
Based on that, he or she makes

232
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:51,509
a comprehensive judgment on the clients' behavior patterns and organic variables.

233
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:55,259
After integrating all these, the counselor will reach a final conclusion.

234
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,039
Very well, I believe listeners have had

235
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,839
a preliminary understanding of psychology as I do.

236
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,999
We received an online question from a listener whose cell phone number ends in 8772.

237
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:12,529
He wants to know why a person can be kind

238
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:15,159
to others but always groundlessly makes

239
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,309
malicious speculations against a certain person.

240
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:22,130
Listener 8772, how can you confirm

241
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,779
that the person in question indeed targets a certain person?

242
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:28,310
Listener 8772 says the person in question can be nice

243
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:33,490
when facing other people but is often angry when facing him.

244
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,530
So he wants to know the mentality of the person in question,

245
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,740
or if this person needs psychological counseling.

246
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,929
Listener 8772, I think there's nothing wrong with the person in question.

247
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:48,800
It's because you did not get the response you wanted.

248
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,779
So you feel very angry, right?

249
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:55,049
Listener 8772 says the person he wants you to analyze is not him.

250
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,999
Listener 8772, generally, a psychological counselor

251
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,810
only accepts counseling from the person in question.

252
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,590
No one can do it for him or her. Of course, if you are so angry and

253
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,820
have no way to eliminate it or it even affects your normal life,

254
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,039
I think you should be the person who needs counseling.

255
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,560
He Dun!

256
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,410
Miss He. Miss He!

257
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,130
He Dun. He Dun.

258
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,930
What's wrong with you? Are you okay?

259
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,800
Are you feeling better?

260
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,409
I'm sorry, I can't record this program with you.

261
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:46,039
Why? If it's because of what just happened, I apologize to you.

262
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,880
It was just a joke.

263
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,740
Besides, there is no need to be so angry about that question.

264
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,010
You were nervous so I wanted to lighten the mood.

265
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,190
The program will start airing in a week, if you quit, who else can I find?

266
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,040
It's not your problem.

267
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,430
It's mine, I can't stay in a room without windows for three hours.

268
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,610
I can't do it.

269
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,230
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,610
- Have you heard of that?
- What?

271
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,100
- What?
- Yunjin Group.

272
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,750
- I know.
- Its president, Cao Wanli

273
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,899
- which was caught by his wife.
- Really?

274
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:21,660
- Of course.
- There's even a video.

275
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,470
Hello, Mom.

276
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,640
Look at you.

277
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,520
How could you lose such a good job?

278
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,160
Now your affair is all over the internet.

279
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,190
Which company will dare to employ you in the future?

280
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,690
Why did you do that sinful thing?

281
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,760
Mom, can we not talk about it now?

282
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,539
- I'm vexed. 
- You are vexed?

283
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,430
Do you have any reason to be vexed?

284
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,760
What a good job!

285
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,060
Why did you do that sinful thing? Why?

286
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,160
Mom, don't worry.

287
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,130
Even if your daughter starves to death, you'll get everything you want, okay?

288
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,040
Okay, remember your promise.

289
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,510
Bye-bye.

290
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,290
[He Dun]

291
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,830
He Dun, calm down.

292
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,450
It's useless to go there now.

293
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,489
I'm not capable of this program. I mean it. Don't waste your time on me.

294
00:20:50,489 --> 00:20:51,800
Don't jump to the conclusion.

295
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,610
Give me a couple of days. I'll work it out, okay?

296
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,699
What on earth do you want to do?

297
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:58,319
As far as you know, Tang Lili would never do such a thing, right?

298
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,760
Of course.

299
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,430
I know Chang Chunmei.

300
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,500
Technically speaking, I don't really know her.

301
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,950
I just interviewed her on "Time Interview".

302
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,920
Chang Chunmei is not an ordinary noble lady.

303
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,830
She was the second in command of Yunjin Group.

304
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:15,429
She accompanied Cao Wanli to strive for decades and developed today's Yunjin Group.

305
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:17,290
She retired last year.

306
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,349
You mean...

307
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:21,470
I mean, if Lili was not such a person...

308
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,369
Of course, I believe Lili isn't like what they said,

309
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:28,800
if she hadn't done that, would Chang Chunmei, a sophisticated and powerful woman,

310
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,509
have mistaken the situation and fired her?

311
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:35,210
Or... She doesn't care about the truth.

312
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,400
Do you have the videos of her interview?

313
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,250
Yes.

314
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,930
It is no longer a time for a price war.

315
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,359
It may only be attractive to consumers during their first purchase...

316
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,029
It's the quality of the products that determines whether

317
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:54,260

I have some business to do.

If you need anything, just tell Qing Qing.

Okay.

Ms. Chang, we are flattered. You think highly of us.

We will go all out to support your return!

It's really strange.

What's this?

338
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,539
Why did Mrs. Cao always meet with the investors separately

339
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:05,580
after Cao Wanli had a meeting with them?

340

Where did you get it?

Good job, man. Where did you get it?

342
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:14,319
At my first glance at Tang Lili's candid photos on TV, I knew they were taken by Hao.

343
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,560
So I contacted him.

344
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,650
Who's Hao?

345
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,920
A member of paparazzi.

346
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,490
Paparazzi's circle is very small.

347
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,431
After seeing the photos and following the clues to ask,

348
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:25,579
people in charge of interviews and shooting outside will know who took these photos.

349
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:28,879
But if the photos are illegal, the paparazzi will leave copies.

350
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:33,219
So these are the evidence the paparazzi hold to counter buyers.

351
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:34,490
Let me put it another way.

352
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,919
Tang Lili's candid photos are likely to be faked by Hao

Who are you?

00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,130
Tang Lili told you to come?

358
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,370
Tell her, don't waste time.

359
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,350
We both know what she did.

360
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,169
I know very well about what kind of person Tang Lili is.

361
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:11,749
I believe you know better about what she is like in the workplace than I do.

362
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:13,350
If she had been likely to do that kind of thing,

363
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,340
I believe you wouldn't have kept her until today.

364
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,500
Unless her leaving can benefit you, for example,

If I had a chance to choose again in my next life, I would still choose to be a woman.

These are the last sentences of your autobiography.

What on earth do you want to say?

373
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,431
In your autobiography, you completely avoided

how you competed with and surpassed

375
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,110
the former industry leader.

376
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:54,029
Shouldn't this part be the most exciting part of your autobiography?

377
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:57,309
So I looked up the information of the former industry leader and found

386

00:30:34,469 --> 00:30:37,300
You came up with a good idea.

477
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,310
Thank you, Sister.

478
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,639
Thank me for what?

479
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,430
Did I agree?

480
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,780
The program will start airing on Friday. Get down to your business.

481
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,560
Yes!

482
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,230
There is nothing you can't do.

483
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,560
The last dish, sushi.

484
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,819
Thank you, Jiahui.

485
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:54,350
Sorry for making you so busy.

486
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,099
It's our first meal to celebrate us being neighbors. Not a big deal.

487
00:30:57,099 --> 00:31:00,110
A man who can cook can get ten points from me.

488
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,229
Now, I'll transfer these 10 points to He Dun's impression of you.

489
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,629
Lili likes to joke. Hope you don't mind it.

490
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:09,040
She's quick-tempered and straightforward.

491
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,160
I can see that.

492
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,860
She is anxious about your life event.

493
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,300
You understand me.

494
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,640
He Dun, do you know?

495
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,919
When I think I don't have to work from tomorrow, I feel relaxed.

496
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,529
I didn't see it. You don't seem to be able to relax.

497
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:24,640
Lili has devoted a lot to Yunjin.

498
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,489
She indeed feels relaxed but also can't banish it from her mind.

499
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,160
In fact, I'm clear that

500
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,919
I am the victim of the struggle for interests between Mr. Cao and Mrs. Cao.

501
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:40,059
But in the past two years in Yunjin, Mr. Cao thought highly of me.

502
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:44,889
Although my resume was not outstanding, he gave me a lot of opportunities.

503
00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:47,849
Every enterprise needs a sacrificial lamb for its development.

504
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:50,980
I have nothing to complain about.

505
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,590
Although Mrs. Cao told them to delete the news,

506
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:01,670
Cao Wanli whom you are loyal to said nothing to help you even if he knew you were wronged.

507
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,760
Are you just going to let it go?

508
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,310
Countdown for the live broadcast.

509
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:21,040
Five, four, three, two, one.

510
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,830
Hello, dear listeners.

511
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,590
Welcome to Haifeng Radio International.

512
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,909
You are listening to today's episode of Emotion Station.

513
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:28,950
I am your host, Qian Kaiyi.

514
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:32,759
Speaking of girls' friendships, especially the besties that girls usually mention,

515
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:37,779
in today's society, this word seems to become a derogatory term, to some degree, with sarcasm.

516
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:40,430
Their besties stole their boyfriends, their besties borrowed money but didn't pay back,

517
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,940
besties only photoshopped themselves, etc..

518
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,129
Some netizens even ridicule that girls' friendships are like plastic flowers.

519
00:32:47,129 --> 00:32:49,230
They are fake but never wither.

520
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,409
Are girls' friendships indeed too weak to withstand a strike?

521
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:53,690
Of course not.

522
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:58,090
Girls have hypocritical friendships, so do boys.

523
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,129
It has nothing to do with gender.

524
00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:02,930
Sincerity and moral quality matter.

525
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,330
Here is an account called Love Spicy Hot Pot.

526
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,690
He says real good friends are not those who flatter you on the dinner table

527
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,920
but those who still want to be your friends when you are in troubles.

528
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,670
I'm curious about how you met each other.

529
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,260
- Get off.
- What are you doing?

530
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,000
- Get off.
- Are you serious?

531
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,360
No, I will not. No!

532
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,680
There are so many people here. What are you doing?

533
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,120
I was kidding.

534
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,269
You are crazy! Jack*ss.

535
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,330
What are you looking at?

536
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,290
Do I look good?

537
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,580
Boss, two bottles of beer.

538
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,519
Okay. Two bottles of beer.

539
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,900
Can I sit here?

540
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,130
Thank you.

541
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,300
Those two girls look pretty.

542
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,120
- I'll pay you back later.
- Let's talk with them later.

543
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,900
What are you thinking, buddy?

544
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,230
How can they have a crush on you?

545
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,350
We just have a try.

546
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,840
We pretend to be polite.

547
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,910
Go over there and hit on them, understand?

548
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,559
Look at that girl. She looks flirtatious, doesn't she?

549
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:45,390
She must be dumped by a rich man.

550
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,150
You two, go over there and ask that girl,

551
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,570
how much does she want?

552
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,760
Will it work?

553
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,840
- Go, go, go. Just ask her.
- No. You do it.

554
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,560
You two cowards!

555
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,520
Look at how I do it.

556
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,100
- What do you want to do?
- None of your business.

557
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,740
Who are you?

558
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,760
Don't get in my way.

559
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,281
I've heard what you just said.

560
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:16,820
Listen, don't even think about it.

561
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,821
I'm telling you, it's none of your business. If you keep like this, I'll beat...

562
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,049
You have 10 seconds. Get lost!

563
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:29,730
You bully girls. Shame on you!

564
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,230
If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

565
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,660
If you don't want to go to jail, get away right now.

566
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,170
You're making trouble here? I'll call the police!

567
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,520
Scoundrels.

568
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,830
You bully women. Look down on you!

569
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,460
You are pretty good.

570
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,050
So are you.

571
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,570
Real good friends are those who stand up when one is lonely

572
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,649
and who give each other their strongest applause in all sincerity.

573
00:36:00,649 --> 00:36:03,720
They are not jealous of each other to become a better person.

574
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,889
They see through each other's vulnerability and ugliness but are still willing to

575
00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:10,220
embrace each other firmly.

576
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,129
Among thousands on thousands of people who come and go,

577
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,980
they know our feelings the best.

578
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,900
When cities return to silence from the hustle and bustle, amid city lights,

579
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,849
I'm having a long heart-to-heart talk with you over wine.

580
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,560
Thank you.

581
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,630
Thank you.

582
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,760
No worries.

583
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:40,130
I was so crazy to keep a man to stay.

584
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,220
Embarrassing, right?

585
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:48,419
If a man can make a woman fall in deep love with him,

586
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:51,320
he must have shining points.

587
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,520
Does he?

588
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,080
Yes.

589
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,040
He is rich.

590
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,520
I love his money.

591
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,260
Vain, right?

592
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:15,419
Everyone's deepest needs are determined by his or her innermost emptiness.

593
00:37:15,419 --> 00:37:17,180
It's understandable.

594
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,580
You are right.

595
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,450
I was too poor when I was little.

596
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,230
After I grew up, I tried all I could to make up for it.

597
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,720
Have you heard of a saying?

598
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,180
Money is not everything

599
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,980
but without money, you can do nothing.

600
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:47,390
Our fates had been destined when we were born.

601
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,670
Everyone has a different life.

602
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,190
I think that's my life.

603
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,870
There is no way to change it.

604
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,560
No, there is.

605
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,760
I mean there is a way to make you better.

606
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,109
You have two choices, one, let me be your psychological counselor,

607
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:13,430
two, let me be your good friend.

608
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,190
I choose the second one.

609
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,151
Well, my dear listeners, this Friday,

610
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:27,120
I will bring you a brand new program.

611
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,889
It will be a magical journey that can clear up your confusion.

612
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:32,659
It will be a perfect encounter between voices and your heart.

613
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:35,430
Let's look forward to it.

614
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,870
Oh my god!

615
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,130
- Oh my gosh!
- Gross!

616
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:58,830
This place is so dirty and so big.

617
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,659
When can the three of us clean it up?

618
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:03,720
Yes, Brother Qian, we won't finish it till the cows come home.

619
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,219
We must clean it up however late it will be. What shall we do?

620
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,950
Qian!

621
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,340
Just put the stuff here.

622
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,360
You are so thoughtful.

623
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,390
This must be reimbursed.

624
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,910
No, no, no. Sister Qiao helped us to contact them.

625
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,470
We can't take credit for it.

626
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,049
Sister Qiao said the greenhouse had been left unused for a long time.

627
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:26,279
If it just relies on us to clean it up, it will be too demanding.

628
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:27,850
So, helpers.

629
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,840
Sister Qiao is so thoughtful.

630
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,900
Thank her in all your sincerity later.

631
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,149
I'll thank her.

632
00:39:36,149 --> 00:39:39,290
- Why are you blinking?
- Thank her in all your sincerity.

633
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,650
Buddies, thank you for your hard work today.

634
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,020
- Of course.
- Thank you.

635
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,560
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

636
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,009
- Buddies, let's get to work.
