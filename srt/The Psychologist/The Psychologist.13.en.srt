00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,840
[Episode 13]

18
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,740
All the misery in the world stems from the attention we devote to one another,

19
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,900
be it good attention or bad attention.

20
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,890
The truth is, we're all the same, just a bunch of marionettes.

21
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,790
And now let's talk about your vomitory habit.

22
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,460
When do you think you're least likely to fall back on your vomitory habit?

23
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,863
The peach.

24
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,720
But you were emotionally unstable before you left that day.

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,970
I'm done talking. Let's call it a day.

26
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,030
Does it mean you tend to restrain your vomitory habit

27
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,580
when you're emotionally unstable?

28
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,850
No. You got it wrong.

29
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,660
I was in a very good mood after I'd left that day.

30
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,550
Excellent.

31
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,530
You're unlikely to resort to your vomitory habit when you're in a good mood.

32
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,000
Now let's talk about the last time you fell back on your vomitory habit.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,340
What happened? What were you thinking at the time?

34
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,540
Are you feeling better now?

35
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,783
Yeah.

36
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:08,530
You mean you felt awful before you vomited?

37
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,550
Before I vomited, I'd feel

38
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,270
rather anxious,

39
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,940
feeling like a monster.

40
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,463
Why?

41
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:23,530
Because I couldn't help overeating.

42
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,320
What do you think would happen if you hadn't vomited?

43
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,360
I'd put on weight if I hadn't vomited.

44
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,260
You think vomiting would prevent you from putting on weight?

45
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:41,010
I felt clean after vomiting, as if I hadn't overeaten in the first place.

46
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,750
By now we've fully realized how you got into the habit of overeating and vomiting.

47
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,160
In other words, every time you feel anxious, on edge, or furious,

48
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,250
you'll want to relieve stress by overeating.

49
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,800
But afterward, you'll be trapped in misery about having lost control.

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,300
Then you resort to vomiting as an act of compensation to relieve your stress.

51
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,023
Am I right?

52
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,820
What did you see?

53
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,100
I saw I was going to be humiliated.

54
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,290
What about now?

55
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,520
You can treasure up all the beautiful moments.

56
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,440
Shadow and vulgarity are as inevitable as sunlight.

57
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,210
Do you think it worthwhile to feel miserable and start overeating

58
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,060
and vomiting just because of some cruel remarks by other people?

59
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,660
I don't care about what other people say.

60
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,830
But why would she do that to me?

61
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,700
- Stop it.
- Let go.

62
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,931
Isn't a mother supposed to protect her daughter?

63
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:12,540
Thanks to her diminishing me and demeaning me every day,

64
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,230
I feel like I've lost my self-esteem.

65
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,100
I feel like I'm unworthy of the name of a human being.

66
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,330
I feel that my life is beyond hope all because of her.

67
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,890
No other mother in the world would cudgel her brains

68
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,650
to humiliate her daughter with acid words day in and day out.

69
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,263
See?

70
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:39,010
You're not crushed by other people's attention, comments and sneer.

71
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,380
What really crushes you

72
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,863
is yourself.

73
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:54,790
It's been put on display here for others to pry into, but it doesn't mean it's bad.

74
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,010
You developed a sense of self-destruction to protect it.

75
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,370
From a different perspective, this means it's worth protecting, don't you think so?

76
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,573
Jiang Jing, everyone in this world is an independent individual.

77
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:09,510
So are you and your mother.

78
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,860
You don't belong to each other.

79
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,270
If your mother did what she did to humiliate you,

80
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,701
why would she do so in front of so many people instead of talking to you directly?

81
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:29,230
Maybe it was her way of strengthening her onslaughts.

82
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,640
Or maybe she was just putting on an act.

83
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,850
That's spot on. She was putting on an act.

84
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,040
Maybe they'd been enjoying stable wealth, social standing

85
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,670
and value perception for such a long period of time that they longed

86
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,680
to get some satisfaction and novelty in their lives.

87
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,720
So she chose to humiliate me in this manner to make herself happy?

88
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,040
Maybe she talked you down as an instinctive behavior to protect herself.

89
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,970
Meanwhile, she thought she was protecting you as well.

90
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,440
She didn't want you to fall in love at an early age.

91
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,540
- She was protecting me?
- Yes.

92
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,430
It was like that in her world. Her educational ideas are largely flawed.

93
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,390
I can understand it, but I find it unacceptable.

94
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,270
Now let's turn to another perspective.

95
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,720
Let's observe the younger you from the sidelines

96
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,000
and see what you think about the girl.

97
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,340
I find her pitiful.

98
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,430
What about that one?

99
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,510
I find her cute.

100
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,270
She did well in her studies.

101
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,100
As for maths… She was good at maths.

102
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,421
I'm sure that boy wasn't your only admirer then.

103
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,120
But my mother hated me.

104
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,790
Well, we can talk about him a bit more later.

105
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,290
Now let's turn to how we feel about that little Jiang Jing.

106
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,920
What do you think was the most painful

107
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,950
and sad part of her life?

108
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,180
It was the future.

- You are...
- Hello. I'm Jia.

112

Hello, Mr. Jia. Have a seat, please.

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,690
Have a try, Mr. Jia.

This is the best Pu'er tea they've got. Here.

115

It's so kind of you to meet me despite your busy schedules.

116
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,050
I was surprised to find you so young.

117
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,450
You're so young and so successful.

118
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:06,540
I'm on this business trip for the New Year's concert the Oriental Theatre is to hold this year.

119
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,280
We've sent out invitations to outstanding young pianists around the country.

120
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,730
It's a golden opportunity.

121
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,030
A friend of mine recommended Jiang Jing to me.

122
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,510
I watched some of her videos and was quite impressed.

123
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,880
Mr. Jia, you're such a discerning gentleman.

124
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,440
After watching her performance at a piano competition,

125
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,100
piano master Wu Muye, one of the judges, was much impressed

126
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,240
by the rich tones of her fingering, the completeness of her work

127
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,370
at a high speed and her natural, smooth, and delicate rendition.

128
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,570
She's won more awards than I could count.

129
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,130
You must know it, too.

130
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,351
Her great achievements couldn't have been possible without your hard work.

131
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,200
My daughter does owe her success largely to me.

132
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,520
She started practicing the piano when she was five,

133
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,050
spending at least 10 hours on it every day.

134
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,230
During weekends and winter and summer vacations, other children

135
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,480
would hang out with friends, but I had her practice the piano every day.

136
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,350
She took such pains to improve her skills that all her fingers got callused.

137
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,450
When she was ten, she practiced Debussy's "Prelude"

138
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,160
so hard that the keys got smeared with blood.

139
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,780
Of course.

140
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,490
Then she grew up, became sensible, and stopped throwing tantrums.

141
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,720
But recently she…

142
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,953
It's yourself.

143
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:55,790
She could feel everything you're doing for yourself now.

144
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,770
It would give her confidence to face the future.

145
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,970
She'd even give you hope and strength

146
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,650
so that you could open up new dimensions.

147
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,010
We've explored so many high-risk scenarios.

148
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:12,680
We can tell that these scenarios gave rise to your overeating and vomitory habits.

149
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,863
And now let's talk about the solutions, all right?

It will help us figure out why the transformation is necessary.

152
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,740
The direct results and delayed results of overeating.

153
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,460
Positive effects.

154
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,540
Negative effects. What do these terms mean?

155
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,120
As for the direct results, the positive effect of your overeating

156
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,400
is that it could help you relieve your current anxiety and unease,

157
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,300
while the negative effect is that you'll feel you've put on weight,

158
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,900
which proves to be a new source of anxiety.

159
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,701
And delayed results refer to the pros and cons it brings you

160
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:48,470
after this period of time from a long-term perspective.

161
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,453
So you need to fill in and analyze this form on your own.

162
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,890
You therapists are amazing.

163
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,690
You've been helping me better understand myself.

164
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,810
Over time you may become your own therapist.

165
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,150
Now let's talk about the second solution.

166
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,450
It was your own choice.

167
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,220
I can't do it.

168
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,520
But you chose it subconsciously.

169
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,100
You've been craving a warm and comfortable relationship.

170
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,710
I needed it when I was a child, but I don't need it anymore.

171
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,910
You dare not hope for it because you're afraid of getting hurt and disappointed even more.

172
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,980
I hate you. I hate you.

173
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,570
I can tell you care about your mother very much.

174
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,840
You wish her well.

175
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,060
Jing Jing, it's dinner time.

176
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,830
It's just that you wish she could treat you with the right attitude.

177
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,910
Ever since your childhood, you'd never let her know

178
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,780
when you felt uncomfortable physically or mentally.

179
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,803
You'd deal with it yourself, am I right?

180
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:06,100
Emotionally speaking, you're more like your mother's caretaker and nurturer.

181
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:12,140
I bought you this dress, didn't I?

182
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,850
It's beautiful.

183
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,610
It doesn't matter. Everyone needs an outlet for their frustration.

184
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,860
You can let off steam if you want.

185
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,820
Is our session today finished?

186
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,140
Not yet.

187
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,150
There's one last question:

188
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:36,183
What are you going to do if you can't solve these problems?

189
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,550
What does this picture remind you?

190
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,990
I'm scared of an overreliance on someone.

191
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,960
You're scared of reliance and overprotection?

192
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,100
May I ask how you feel about your father?

193
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,260
I can barely remember him.

194
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,441
My mother told me he was an irresponsible man.

195
00:14:07,441 --> 00:14:09,540
What do you think?

196
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,780
He left us many years ago.

197
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,010
Sometimes he's just some fuzzy memories.

198
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,900
I vaguely remember

199
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,980
that he'd put me, a little girl at the time, on his shoulders and then raise me

200
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,933
very high in the air

201
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,100
so that I could see very far

202
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,860
as if I were a bird.

203
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,340
Jiang Jing, I don't think this problem can be solved unilaterally.

204
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,830
I'd like to have a good long chat with your mother.

205
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,230
She sent me here.

206
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,380
I don't suppose she'll say no.

207
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,500
I think we should talk a few more times, and I have every confidence

208
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,500
in helping you find your way out of your plight.

209
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,480
- You think so?
- Absolutely.

210
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,910
Miss He,

211
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,860
is what you told me part of science?

212
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,700
I could explain the theories to you if you'd like to hear them.

213
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,420
What I did is a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal communication therapy.

214
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,400
I believe you.

215
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
You don't have to explain those theories.

216
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,160
When shall we have the next session?

217
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,610
Following the arrangement of the counseling course will do.

218
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,130
But remember to finish your homework.

219
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,903
All right.

220
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,950
See you next time.

221
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,273
Jiang Jing,

222
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,300
don't forget to stick to the things you love.

223
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,010
Ordinary people only know that it takes extraordinary diligence for a child to study music.

224
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,610
They tend to overlook the painstaking effort made by the child's parents.

225
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,310
You did the right thing.

226
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, Mr. Jia.

227
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,100
We parents have to harden ourselves in order to secure a bright future for our children.

228
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,550
I didn't stay idle while she was practicing the piano.

229
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,640
I kept her company day in and day out.

230
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,200
Every genius in the world needs a push to achieve excellence,

231
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,400
do you agree, Mr. Jia?

232
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:32,420
Similarly, this Pu'er had to undergo many indispensable processes,

233
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,450
including picking, withering, deactivation of enzymes,

234
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,860
rolling, deblocking, drying of raw tea,

235
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,890
and pile fermentation before it could become a real prize.

236
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,050
We've got plenty of good seedlings and technological processes.

237
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,930
What we lack is experienced tea-pickers like you.

238
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,120
Mr. Jia, you're absolutely right.

239
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,660
You're such an expert.

240
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,610
I think I should arrange some intensive training for Jing.

241
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,180
Don't worry, Mr. Jia.

242
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:05,400
I promise I'll help her further improve her performance before the New Year's concert arrives.

243
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,200
I'm glad to hear that.

244
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,663
Let me share with you my schedule.

245
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:12,030
I'm going to organize an audition.

246
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,561
Then the Oriental Theatre will send a formal invitation to those who have passed the audition.

247
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:16,820
Great.

248
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,570
As a reference for Jiang Jing, I've got a suggestion to make.

249
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,010
I hope you won't mind.

250
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,840
Of course not. I'm all ears.

251
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,961
A parent knows their child best.

252
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:31,850
Guidance given by others, substantial as it is, won't harm their own children, anyway.

253
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,150
- Am I right, Ms. Zhang?
- Yes. Yes.

254
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,330
We can tell from the first issue of data analysis

255
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:57,830
that our Time Interview, as 99.7's ace program, has a clear picture

256
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,830
about its target audience.

257
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,700
Financial sector practitioners aged between 36 and 45

258
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,970
with an annual income between 200,000 and 500,000 yuan

259
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,840
are the main audience of our program.

260
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,750
But I hope we can upgrade our program in the next stage.

261
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,230
Rumor has it that a mysterious sponsor

262
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,310
spent this amount of money on some customized data research

263
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,100
for Time Interview.

264
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,593
50,000 yuan?

265
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,043
500,000 yuan.

266
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,200
Of course, we're heavily indebted to our superiors and our investors…

267
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,350
…for their support and love of our program. 
- Who cares?

268
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,060
Mr. Zhang, do you have any questions?

269
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,170
I care.

270
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,830
Please answer.

271
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,421
Professor, may I ask you a question?

272
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:49,010
Professor, could you take a look at this question?

273
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,560
Guys. Guys. Guys.

274
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,460
I shouldn't be giving you an extra lesson outside class.

275
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,610
You guys ought to take a break and get refreshed.

276
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,990
All right, bye.

277
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,610
Professor. Professor.

278
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,720
Hey, couldn't you just give me a break?

279
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,180
"The Mystery of the Mind."

280
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,313
Good.

281
00:19:21,313 --> 00:19:23,700
I'll keep the book.

282
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,010
Well, you've cheated many books out of me under all sorts of pretexts.

283
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,110
You can keep this one, too.

284
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,700
Knowledge is supposed to be shared.

285
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,680
I'm helping you.

286
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,060
Yeah. Yeah.

287
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,090
You're always right.

288
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,540
When did you get back?

289
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,073
Yesterday.

290
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:38,250
You were talking about helping me.

291
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,771
Well, I do have a favor to ask of you.

292
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:46,010
Guess whom I ran into on my flight home yesterday?

293
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,020
I'm too old for this guessing game. Just cut to the chase.

294
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,840
It was…

295
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,730
Isn't that old gentleman…

296
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,600
Ye Niantang.

297
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,073
Dr. Ye,

298
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:05,030
you don't have to worry about the marketing and sales of your machine once it's developed.

299
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,050
We've already worked out a name for it.

300
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,470
Yeah?

301
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,110
Automatic Teller.

302
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,300
What Teller?

303
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,920
Automatic Teller.

304
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,660
ATM for short.

305
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,493
Right. Right.

306
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:26,060
I'm familiar with the complicated processes in the lab,

307
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,620
but I'm hopeless at business.

308
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,840
I see old friends as well as new ones here.

309
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,050
First, I need to make something clear.

310
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,370
Protecting the interests of the vast majority

311
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:43,580
means that some of you here may not be able to get authorized

312
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,190
for this product.

313
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,950
I owe you an apology.

314
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,090
Director Ye, don't worry about it.

315
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,850
Gains alternate with losses, and advance with retreat.

316
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,130
We all know it.

317
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,180
All right. Bottoms up.

318
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,013
Yeah. Come on.

319
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,640
Well, scholars can indeed be modest.

320
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,380
Dr. Ye,

321
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,310
speaking of advance and retreat, you're much more experienced than us businessmen.

322
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,900
You used to take the best seat, and today you're retreating for the sake of advancing.

323
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,590
So you're always right.

324
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,520
Dr. Ye has a mind of his own.

325
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
Come on, Mr. Guo. Let me propose a toast to you.

326
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,620
Sorry, but I'm on medication.

327
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,310
It's all right.

328
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,660
We should face our troubles with a broad mind.

329
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,781
Xiao Li, have you analyzed the audience of our program?

330
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:53,720
The gender, age, and profession of our audience.

331
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,370
In the past, only radio stations'

332
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,460
got to analyze their ratings and market shares.

333
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,300
But with the live streaming nowadays, big data in this field can actually be sorted out.

334
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,370
Brother Qian, don't assign this task to Xiao Li in such haste.

335
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,540
After all, data research isn't our profession.

336
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,820
I think you should talk to Director Pan first.

337
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,190
Professional data research can be very expensive.

338
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,070
And we've already…

339
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,433
What?

340
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,820
It's… It's nothing.

341
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,470
Dong, I'll leave it to you, then.

342
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,300
Brother Qian, I don't think data research

343
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,930
is our biggest breakthrough for the moment.

344
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:35,380
Our first few episodes were well-received,

345
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,130
but our recent episodes were obviously less popular.

346
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,210
That's why we need to do data research.

347
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,440
It's not a matter of money.

348
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,230
For instance, we could figure out the topics our audience like

349
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,180
and the topics they don't like by analyzing

350
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:55,010
the increase or decrease of the size of the audience who were watching our program at the time.

351
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,060
This type of reverse analysis will be more accurate than the peak data we get from the report.

352
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,300
Besides, it'll be costless.

353
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,460
Live audiences and traditional audiences are completely different groups.

354
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,540
No, no.

355
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,820
I think the live group is also our audience.

356
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,800
If we can understand our own audience, even only a fraction of them,

357
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,180
it'll be meaningful in terms of our feedback collection and long-term planning.

358
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,301
Why don't we use our premiere as a reference?

359
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:17,850
It's a classic case of success.

360
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,820
Since the episode about Xiao Wen went viral,

361
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,781
why don't we follow the pattern and produce a few more episodes about people in focus?

362
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,410
Stop beating about the bush. You can speak freely.

363
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,800
Um, Brother Qian, listen to me.

364
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,243
The scripts we wrote are certainly not as catching as real cases.

365
00:23:35,243 --> 00:23:38,130
Don't forget that Miss He is a therapist.

366
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,070
She's got plenty of cases we can draw on.

367
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,660
Do you remember the therapist Wang Zhuo contacted the other day?

368
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,850
I heard that she'd offered many real cases.

369
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,900
Many to choose from.

370
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,803
No.

371
00:23:54,803 --> 00:23:57,230
I don't know what Wang Zhuo told the therapist,

372
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:01,420
but a professional therapist should never disclose the privacy of their clients.

373
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,010
That's He Dun's professional ethics and the bottom line of her ethics.

374
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,501
We wouldn't touch her bottom line. Miao was saying we could use those character archetypes, right?

375
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:12,180
For Miss He, each client is an individual case.

376
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,860
We can rewrite the case and make it a new story.

377
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,941
It wouldn't make a difference to He Dun.

378
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:21,330
It'd be a disclosure of privacy if the story should reach us from her office.

379
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,163
No, it wouldn't.

380
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:26,960
She'd only need to erase the identity-telling details, and we wouldn't know who the client is.

381
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,000
- With the script rewritten, the audience—
- We need another idea. This one won't do.

382
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,090
We need another idea.

383
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,223
Kaiyi.

384
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,210
You're taking He Dun's side on this problem, don't you think?

385
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,770
What are you talking about, Brother Dong?

386
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,610
What do you mean by me "taking her side"?

387
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,750
It's showing our partner due respect.

388
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,890
Cut it out.

389
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,630
You invited her in precisely because she was a controversial figure,

390
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,070
remember?

391
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,230
You respect her, but do you respect us?

392
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,663
Dong.

393
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,280
If you ask me, I'll say we're just some stepping stones to you, a tool for you to carry out your revenge.

394
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,610
Yes. Everything I did, including starting Night Talk to Your Heart

395
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,070
and inviting He Dun in, was meant to get back Time Interview.

396
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,803
So what?

397
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,043
Any problem?

398
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,280
This meeting is over.

399
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,510
Brother Qian, we haven't decided on the topic yet.

400
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,610
Where are you going?

401
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,950
We called each other by our English names back when we were abroad.

402
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,810
I learned about his Chinese name only recently.

403
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,280
What favor were you talking about?

404
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,090
We're going to lose our job.

405
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,610
Wouldn't that be great?

406
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,980
We can justifiably retire, then.

407
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,210
Yeah.

408
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,710
You've long been distracted.

409
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,490
Speaking of retirement,

410
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,900
he went abroad to study neuropsychology and perform some craniotomies,

411
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,080
and then came back declaring that he'd medicalize psychologic counseling.

412
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,640
He produced a thick pile of operational papers, disguising himself

413
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,330
as a Frankenstein.

414
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,000
Don't be so mean.

415
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,070
The unemployment talk was just a joke.

416
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:16,900
I just don't want him to drag down the whole industry.

417
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,600
Hasn't he always been so radical?

418
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,590
But that's too much even by his standards.

419
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,950
What do you think we should do?

420
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,370
Why... would I have come to you if I knew what to do?

421
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,530
You think I came all the way here to give you that book?

422
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,940
The sun is setting.

423
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,010
I should go home and prepare dinner.

424
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,250
Wait a second.

425
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,490
He's been making trouble since he came back.

426
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,480
This gives me a bad feeling.

427
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,410
Don't overthink it.

428
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,610
Come on. You'll be the judge.

429
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,090
I was showing respect for my colleague.

430
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,810
What did I do wrong?

431
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,453
Tell me.

432
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,270
You've got some complaint, too?

433
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,970
Are you hungry?

434
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,173
I'm hungry, too.

435
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:15,510
Listen.

436
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,300
You should try Steamed Fish by Aunt Qi,

437
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,610
Braised Beef with Potatoes by Aunt Peng,

438
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,820
Steamed Lotus Root Stuffed with Sweet Sticky Rice by Uncle Zhao,

439
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:29,000
Dongshan Mutton by Aunt Wang and Wenchang Chicken by Uncle Qin.

440
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,690
My mouth is watering.

441
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,560
Wangwang,

442
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,060
come and have some meat.

443
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,370
- Picky?
- You don't want to try it?

444
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,970
Then I'll have it.

445
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,580
- I'm going to eat it.
- Come on.

446
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,880
Come on. Try it.

447
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,160
Good.

448
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
You're so fussy.

449
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,000
It's dinner time. Wow.

450
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,870
The girl working on that show with you is so soft-spoken

451
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,000
and considerate.

452
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,310
Does she have a boyfriend?

453
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,330
I don't think so.

454
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,760
She's great.

455
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,730
She's sweet and cultured.

456
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,130
You two have been getting along well, right?

457
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,430
Mom, the other day I told you about a type of tube used for plastic star folding.

458
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,530
Did you get it for me?

459
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,580
I've been running a small shop for over 10 years;

460
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,780
I know where to get anything.

461
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,750
I've already placed an order for you.

462
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,383
Thank you, Mom.

463
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,350
But you must promise me that you'll give your handcraft to that girl.

464
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,580
Otherwise, I'll cancel the order.

465
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,330
I was planning to give it to her as a gesture of apology.

466
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,390
What happened between you two?

467
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,820
I was a naughty boy at the time, and I accidentally broke her jar of plastic stars.

468
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,940
So you two were childhood sweethearts?

469
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,100
Wonderful.

470
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,500
Uncle, is the fish ready?

471
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,650
It'll be ready in a minute.

472
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,580
Forget about the fish.

473
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,500
I saw him putting the fish in the pan when I came out.

474
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,860
Hurry. Go back to work when you've finished.

475
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,210
I skipped work today.

476
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,143
You did?

477
00:29:09,143 --> 00:29:13,640
What about your next episode then?

478
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:20,380
Mom, did you listen to the program simply to support me?

479
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,520
Get over yourself.

Back then your father exerted himself so much.

481
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:30,580
Do you think he did that just for the sake of his neighbors?

482
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,190
To be honest, I've little education,

483
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,020
but I'm a sensible woman.

Your program can help many people.

485
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,270
Yes.

486
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,060
We wanted to help others.

487
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,230
But our radio station hasn't got a large audience.

488
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,890
I guess our neighbors are our only audience.

489
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:54,350
Do as much as your strength permits.

490

Everyone is important in their own way.

00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,683
Hurry.

493
00:30:02,683 --> 00:30:03,980
Eat while the food is warm.

Did you invite Qian Kaiyi here?

You're right. I should have invited Qian Kaiyi as well.

Mr. Ye.

Jiahui, it's just a simple meal, not a formal one.

530
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,841
It's all right. The wine was a gift from another friend.

531
00:31:57,841 --> 00:32:00,060
I might as well share it with you guys since I don't usually drink wine.

Chopped green onions, cilantro, and some chili.

this wine has been

decanted perfectly, right?

566
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,920
It tastes faintly fruity

567
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,260
and smoky.

568
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,270
Perfect.

00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,850
Help her upstairs.

647
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,750
I'll clean the mess.

648
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:27,200
Thank you.

649
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,660
- We're going upstairs.
- I want to vomit.

650
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,420
- Can you manage it on your own?
- Sure. Don't worry.

651
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,660
Sorry that I stepped on your toe.

652
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,393
It's all right.

653
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:26,440
♫  Listen to the melody of the wind  ♫

654
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,220
Who the heck are you?

655
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,660
Didn't anyone tell you not to meddle with other people's stuff?

656
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,470
It's yours?

657
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,180
Did you write the lyrics?

658
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,230
It's none of your business.

659
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,330
I'm trying to help you.

660
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,600
Hurry, Xiao Yuan.

661
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,370
I knew something was going on, what with your furtive behavior recently.

662
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,520
Guys, wonderful news from Kang Ziyuan.

663
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,590
He beat all the other boys in our class in getting a token for love.

664
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,140
♫  That melancholic but beautiful rainy season  ♫

665
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,140
♫  That parting despite the attachment which has to be faced  ♫

666
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:10,620
♫  Those bits and pieces, those memories  ♫

667
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:15,040
♫  That pen I borrowed from you but didn't return  ♫

668
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:20,640
♫  Those questions whose answers I pretend to know  ♫

669
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,000
♫  That sigh I saw inadvertently  ♫

670
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,840
♫  Those bits and pieces, those memories  ♫

671
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:37,160
♫  Listen to the melody of the wind  ♫

672
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:43,380
♫  Slowly blowing off leaves from the trees  ♫

673
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:48,100
♫  Look at the clear sunshine  ♫

674
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:54,340
♫  Hurried brushing passed your figure  ♫

675
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:58,760
♫  That little secret deep in my heart  ♫

676
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,965
♫  That melancholic but beautiful rainy season  ♫

677
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,203
Who is it?

678
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,753
I'm coming.

679
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,670
I'm coming.

680
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,430
I hope I didn't disturb you, Auntie.

681
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,370
Of course not.

682
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:34,700
I'm just an idle old lady who has nothing to do at home. Is something the matter?

683
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,390
It's about time you got your second acupuncture for your feet.

684
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,120
I didn't call you beforehand for fear that you'd kindly refuse it.

685
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,180
I hope you're not angry with me for having not contacted you beforehand?

686
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,290
No. Of course not.

687
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,570
So why don't you come in?

688
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,830
Come on in.

689
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,140
I brought you some fruit.

690
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,570
Don't go to this expense next time you come here, child.

691
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:05,280
You'll need to spend your money elsewhere later.

692
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,320
I've got everything at home. There's no need to buy anything for me.

693
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,180
Come on. Take a seat.

694
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,100
Auntie, let me close the door for you.

695
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,967

♫  of a beautiful love  ♫
