[Transference and Counter-transference]
Let's first talk about what counter-transference is.

55
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:16,530
In a broad sense, counter-transference encompasses the emotional responses

56
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,000
of all counselors to their visitors.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,539
Any conflict related to their family experiences,

58
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:24,230
gender roles, parenting roles and unmet needs

59
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,600
is likely to lead to counter-transference.

60
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,449
A visitor wants the counselor to give him

61
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,909
the attention and affirmation that he didn't get from his father.

62
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:38,439
And the counselor also wants to show his importance

63
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,479
through a dependent relationship.

64
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,209
So the counselor is highly likely to accept the visitor's dependence unconsciously.

It's you to blame. You always put him out for no good reason.

158
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,439
He Dun, you've always been a person with professional ethics in my eyes.

He Dun, shall we play Rock-Paper-Scissors?

One round will do, come to have your photo taken if you lose.

162
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:35,310
If you don't reply, don't blame me for calling the shots for you.

163
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,390
Stop sending me messages. Do whatever you like.

164
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,690
Brother Kaiyi, you see, it's such a late hour

165
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,060
and you still don't let me off work.

166
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,340
All right. Go home first.

167
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,820
- Leave the laptop with me.

170
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,440
Instead of sleeping in the middle of the night, what are you coming to my place for?

171
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,029
Lili, He Dun's been giving me the cold shoulder for two days.

172
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:20,230
Did I do anything wrong to cause misunderstanding on her part?

173
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,840
There's something off about you lately.

174
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,909
In what way?

175
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:24,540
Are you not sleeping in the middle of the night and coming to my place

176
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,640
just because she's giving you the cold shoulder?

177
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,110
No, I'm worrying if I've done anything wrong to make her unhappy.

178
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,040
Well…

179
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,150
No problem.

180
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,550
You are not sleeping and coming to my place instead.

181

This is not like what an ordinary colleague would do.

182
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,299
Whether as her friend or colleague or in whatever capacity,

183
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:43,770
I just don't want her to be unhappy.

184
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,110
All right, I'll help you once more.

He Dun.

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,250
Why are you crying?

190
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,000
Tell me. What happened?

191
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,900
What happened?

- Can I have a word with you?
- I don't want to talk now.

- Are you feeling unwell?
- No.

198

I only have a few words to say.

199
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,400
I don't want to listen.

200

If I make you unhappy, you can hit me or curse me.

201
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:02,439
You can do whatever you like to me. But don't be unhappy, all right?

202
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,599
It has nothing to do with you. It's already in the past, all right?

Let's not bring it up again.

204
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:10,870
If it has nothing to do with me, then to whom?

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,200
He Dun… Jun Jun!

206
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:17,790
Can you stop calling me Jun Jun?

207
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,690
What's wrong?

208
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,060
Jun Jun is not my pet name at all.

209
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,770
Why does auntie also call you Jun Jun?

210
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,670
Jun Jun used to be my younger brother's name.

211
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,650
My younger brother died when he was eight.

212
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,550
Jun Jun!

213
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,050
I'm sorry.

214
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,660
I just got to know you had a younger brother.

215
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,330
I didn't mean to.

216
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,730
I know you didn't.

217
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,419
Otherwise I wouldn't be here to explain so much to you.

218
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,290
I would have left long ago.

219
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,870
I just hope after telling you so much,

220
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,179
you'll stop doing things that bug me.

221
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,289
Do you know what is the most common thing in this city?

222
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,190
It's sand.

223
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,100
There used to be a time when I especially enjoyed seeing the sea.

224
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,159
Actually, I was not seeing the sea.

225
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:58,920
I just liked poking a few holes on the beach,

226
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,710
because it wouldn't be long

227
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,960
before the waves smoothed out the holes.

228
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,159
Then I would guess how many waves it took

229
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:11,130
to smooth out the holes completely.

230
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,329
If I guess right, I'd treat myself to a big meal.

231
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,310
Thank you for your comfort.

232
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:26,219
But I don't think there is such a word as empathy in this world.

233
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:29,519
Maybe not being able to empathize is a kind of luck instead.

234
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,590
He Dun,

235
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,259
if you need a special listener one day, just turn around.

236
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:46,040
I'm sure I'll be there.

237
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,110
Jun Jun should be your pet name.

238
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,560
I'll call you by that name from now on.

239
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,960
- Jun Jun—
- Can you stay away from me? Please.

240
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:20,680
Sorry, He Dun.

241
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,459
Did I do anything wrong?

242
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:26,360
- If it's because—
- The safety distance between people is 1.2 meters.

243
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,030
Once you pass beyond it, I'd think you are threatening me.

244
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,069
Let me know if I've done anything wrong, I'll apologize to you.

245
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:33,950
The problem lies with me.

246
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,399
If I make you unhappy, you can hit me or curse me.

247
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:47,829
You can do whatever you like to me, But don't be unhappy, all right?

248
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:50,459
It has nothing to do with you, It was the past, all right?

249
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:52,440
Let's not bring it up again.

250
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,110
Thank you for your comfort.

251
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,739
But I don't think there is such a word as empathy in this world.

252
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,789
Maybe not being able to empathize is a kind of luck instead.

253
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,930
Hello.

254
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,410
Please come on in.

255
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,720
Go.

256
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,740
I'll be waiting here.

257
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,509
Jiang Jing, has your health been any better these days?

258
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:04,210
I'm all right.

259
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,230
I'm used to it.

260
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,609
It's all right. Next, we are going to have a formal counseling session.

261
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:15,950
I'm going to ask you a simple question.

262
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,899
If you don't want to answer,

263
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:20,130
- you can—
- Can I?

264
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,819
Sure.

265
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:27,939
Choose a way you are comfortable with and make yourself at home.

266
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,760
When I'm at home,

267
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,640
I just don't make myself at home.

268
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,810
Can you really cure me?

269
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,509
I'll choose the best way to cure you and stay with you.

270
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:46,590
Believe me.

271
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,260
Next, we are going to play a game.

272
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,689
Human subconsciousness is prone to escapism and likes to play hide-and-seek.

273
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:56,999
Now let's leave your choice to your subconsciousness.

274
00:21:56,999 --> 00:22:01,089
Pick a picture based on your intuition and answer accordingly.

275
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:02,470
Do I pick myself?

276
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,919
Sure.

277
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,759
Jiang Jing, your current biggest problems are rampant bulimia and making yourself vomit, right?

278
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,779
Imagine what kind of scenario

279
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:16,099
would be the most likely to make you overeat and make yourself vomit?

280
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,699
I don't know.

281
00:22:18,699 --> 00:22:21,350
Maybe I like eating a lot.

282
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,280
But I'm afraid of becoming fat.

283
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,520
I can't control myself.

284
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,039
Well done. Based on how you are feeling now, you can pick.

285
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,570
It's just like me.

286
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,209
Let's relax first.

287
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:00,009
Follow me to perform a few moves.

288
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:02,140
Let's breathe in.

289
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,350
Breathe out.

290
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,040
Close your eyes slowly.

291
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,419
Then imagine one of your favorite scenes.

292
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,119
Next, you are going to hear me counting down three to one.

293
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:20,090
When the countdown is over, let's open our eyes.

294
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,680
Three.

295
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,430
Two.

296
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,010
One.

297
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
What does your ideal state of life look like?

298
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,140
Very free.

299
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,399
Now which one of these cards can best describe you?

300
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,920
I'm always wrong and she's always right.

301
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,040
But she would hold my hand.

302
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:26,409
Under what circumstances do you think your mother would hold your hand?

303
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:29,200
She's never let go of my hand.

304
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,699
It doesn't matter. We'll skip it if you don't know.

305
00:24:33,699 --> 00:24:37,339
Now based on how you are feeling, pick two more cards again.

306
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,880
What do you feel when you see this card?

307
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,310
This heart

308
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,350
shouldn't be here.

309
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,910
In order to examine whether it is healthy or intact,

310
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,710
it is taken out for people to play with and watch.

311
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:20,270
When it is uncovered and shown to people, it will die.

312
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,030
[You have beautiful smile.]

313
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:43,450
- Please. Please.
- Jing Jing, you are back.

314
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,830
Come on, come on, come on, look.

315
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,930
All my close friends are here. Sit for a while. Come on.

316
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,960
What a nice-looking girl!

317
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,960
Put your schoolbag down.

318
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,109
- You see, nowadays children are having such a hard time.
- Indeed.

319
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:55,899
- How heavy her schoolbag is!
- Yes.

320
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,670
Why?

321
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,120
Don't read it.

322
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,160
Let me have a read.

323
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:23,179
So your mother still got to read what you wrote back then?

324
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:24,780
Yes.

325
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
What did you write back then?

326
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,680
I said

327
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,860
"Mom, there is someone I take a fancy to."

328
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,980
How did you feel at that time?

329
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,610
I don't know.

330
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,290
Did you feel upset?

331
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,690
Were you afraid?

332
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,500
Yes.

333
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,950
Very.

334
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,979
What happened later? Did your mother do anything?

335
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:54,780
She did nothing.

336
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,350
I'm…going to the bathroom.

337
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,470
All right, okay, go.

338
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,350
Her husband is making money abroad.

339
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,000
Her daughter wins one prize after another in piano competitions.

340
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,619
Look at her. Who knows what her husband is up to outside?

341
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:19,269
The mother and daughter are abandoned. They have to have some fun by playing the piano.

342
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:23,039
The daughter is no good either. Look at her precocious face.

343
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,319
When she was young, she was pampered and courted.

344
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,419
But when she gets old, can't she even hold onto a man?

345
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:32,969
Let's see what's written in there that makes her so angry.

346
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,670
The figure here is just like me.

347
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,830
Actually, it's the same with all of us.

348
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,810
We are just a puppet.

349
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:07,200
Our lives have been chosen and arranged.

350
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,960
They never belong to us.

351
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,530
Have you ever watched a puppet show?

352
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,560
I am my mother's puppet.

353
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,040
Have you talked about this with her?

354
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,690
Can you communicate with your mother?

355
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,609
What attempts have you made to break through these dilemmas?

356
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,659
One.

357
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:39,079
Two.

358
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:41,520
Three. Four.

359
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,120
Did you tell me you were going out?

360
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,050
Who let you play the drum?

361
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,280
You are a piece of flesh from my body.

362
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,600
Whatever you do, you must tell me. Do you know?

363
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,059
Look at the people around you. All dressed in weird costumes.

364
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:44,070
With their hair hanging loose. What the hell do they look like?

365
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,560
Do you know?

366
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,830
Should anything happen to you, how can I live?

367
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,330
Go with me!

368
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,920
Mom!

369
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,760
I…

370
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,029
Jiang Jing. Jiang Jing.

371
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,830
I don't want to talk. Let's call it a day today.

372
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,809
Come to think of it, Brother Qian. I've talked to Zhang Miao.

373
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:03,839
We plan to do more on-the-spot interviews and accumulate more realistic materials.

374
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,490
What do you think?

375
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,280
Dong.

376
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,299
Let's say if someone has lost a person very important to her,

377
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:27,680
how should such agony be healed?

378
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,940
I'm not talking about myself.

379
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:42,190
Well, the famous psychologist Carl Rogers said:

380
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:47,639
"Empathy is the ability to experience the spiritual world of others."

381
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:49,900
Just as if…

382
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,979
As if… As if…

383
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:57,780
You… were that person.

384
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,299
You mean I have strong empathy.

385
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:03,040
No, no, no.

386
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,280
What I'm saying is

387
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,690
empathy is an advocateof love.

388
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,020
- You said it on purpose, didn't you?
- I was joking. Why do you get excited?

389
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,829
- Today's food is good.
- But you are right.

390
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,609
What's up? Frustrated?

391
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:37,639
In such a tranquil world and peaceful time, what frustrations can I get?

392
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:40,789
Let me guess. Wang Zhuo? He made trouble for you again, didn't he?

393
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:41,920
A man like him?

394
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,990
I tell you what, Night Talk to Your Heart has been on the trending topic list a few times.

395
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,950
The audience rating is off the charts.

396
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,059
When the audience rating becomes No.1,

397
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:52,500
I'll make him cry and give Time Interview back to me.

398
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,209
For Night Talk to Your Heart's popularity, the credit goes to He Dun.

399
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:59,419
What you said is not music to my ears. Do I take no credit at all?

400
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:03,530
In terms of the show, yes, He Dun's expertise is admittedly important.

401
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:07,050
But my personal charm is also indispensable.

402
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,230
Do you know what this is called?

403
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:12,129
It's called clear division of labor, neither can be dispensed with.

404
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:15,000
Do you know why hasn't the show become No.1 in audience rating?

405
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,040
Why?

406
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,910
Because there's little interaction between you guys.

407
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,760
What do audience like doing most nowadays?

408
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,950
Doing what?

409
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,839
- Being a shipper.
- Being a shipper.

410
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:26,219
Bicker often, praise each other occasionally.

411
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:30,139
Seemingly fall for each other, only to tantalize the audience.

412
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,870
Simple interactions can no longer meet the audience's need.

413
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,459
You guys must build on this to reinforce your persona as a couple.

414
00:34:36,459 --> 00:34:40,530
As long as you guys start to talk, there must be bubbles of love.

415
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,249
I tell you what, Xiao Yuan, It takes real skills to run a show.

416
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,019
As long as a show's content is of good quality,

417
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:48,750
and can really bring some psychological comfort to the audience,

418
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,050
it wouldn't have a bad rating.

419
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:52,899
What's more,

420
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:56,429
this is also He Dun's original intention when she promised to run the show with me.

421
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,059
Mentor Kaiyi, are you about to change your nature?

422
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:01,689
You used to be a host who believes topic is king.

423
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:04,509
Why? Is it because Miss He Dun used her psychology expertise

424
00:35:04,509 --> 00:35:06,359
to set things right for you and help you find your conscience again?

425
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,970
Stop dissing me.

426
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,419
Once there is sea change in a man,

427
00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:14,590
in all probability it's because of woman.

428
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,860
But He Dun won't fall for you.

429
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,140
Because she falls for me.

430
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,729
Why can't she fall for me? Why does she fall for you?

431
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,259
After seeing you only a few times, she falls for you?

432
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:31,710
Kang Ziyuan, this is not properly done.

433
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,320
Are you still my buddy or not?

434
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,079
Are you still… Are you still my buddy or not?

435
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,039
I'm telling the truth. I'm not saying it to play devil's advocate.

436
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:42,700
She… She's He Dun.

437
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,040
Yes. He Dun.

438
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,829
On the day of the wedding reception, our classmates told me that.

439
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:54,670
If they didn't tell me, I wouldn't remember it was her.

440
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,470
Let me give you more hints.

441
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,770
Senior high school, broadcasting room,

442
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,470
the song she wrote to confess her love to me.

443
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:08,059
The one you publicly executed in front of everybody at school.

444
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:14,649
Today, I'd like to present you with a song about first love.

445
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:15,910
Who are you?

446
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:19,120
Has nobody told you not to touch others' stuff?

447
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,050
Did you write the lyrics?

448
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,950
It's none of your business!

449
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,950
I'm helping you.

450
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,770
Xiao Yuan, she likes you.

451
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,419
- Hello.
- He Dun,

452
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:52,950
You are just like what your name suggests.

453
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,629
You are so slow in picking up my call.
(T/N:"chi dun" in Chinese)

454
00:36:55,629 --> 00:36:56,910
Is there anything you are calling me about?

455
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,849
Yes. Are you in the office?

456
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,809
I'm going out in a minute. Why?

457
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:02,659
Going out? Where are you going?

458
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:06,070
I'm going for now if you have nothing else to say. I'll talk to you later.

459
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,390
Are you ready to go on a date with me?

460
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,239
No.2? No way.

461
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:32,529
It's good enough to be No.2. It's not your first day at the radio station.

462
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:34,520
Do you want to be No.1 right from the beginning?

463
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,390
We can't compare with the stragglers.

464
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:40,189
Night Talk to Your Heart has just gained momentum, we must seize the momentum to be the top performer.

465
00:37:40,189 --> 00:37:42,360
I'll go and talk to Director Pan about its publicity.

466
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,520
Hold on, hold on.

467
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,610
You are going to see Director Pan? Haven't you just screwed up the poster shooting?

468
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,320
You are going to see her again?

469
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,799
- Is your EQ negative?
- Right.

470
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:52,610
I'll explain to her then.

471
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,630
Actually… Actually there's another way.

472
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,630
Since I've been negotiating on business partnerships these days.

473
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:00,320
Whenever possible, I can try to figure out how to link up with the businesses.

474
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,509
But if I manage to make a deal, be sure to make no more mistakes again.

475
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,340
What are you busy with?

476
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,250
All right. I'll be waiting for the good news from you, Qiao.

477
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,850
Go on with your work. I'm going…I'm going to make a phone call.

478
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,950
[Qian Kaiyi]

479
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,630
Hi.

480
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,230
Lili, this is Qian Kaiyi.

481
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,949
I know it's you. Want to speak to He Dun?

482
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:27,859
Yes, yes, yes. Where's He Dun? Where's she gone?

483
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:30,899
Sorry, no comment. I'll hang up if you've finished.

484
00:38:30,899 --> 00:38:33,529
Don't hang up for now. Can you not do what He Dun does?

485
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:36,130
How can you not let people finish what they are saying?

486
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,450
If you feel uncomfortable with her, feel free to have a new partner.

487
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:44,460
Maybe the next one will be more obedient, considerate, and clingy?

488
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,710
Lili, I know you are sticking up for He Dun.

489
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,521
I also know why He Dun is angry.

490
00:38:49,521 --> 00:38:50,799
I understand it fully well.

491
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,109
But as to the relationship between me and Fang Yuxuan, it's really a misunderstanding.

492
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:55,769
She was just proclaiming one-sidedly that I fall for her.

493
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:57,990
Just ask people of our radio station if you don't believe me. They all know.

494
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,760
And I've explained to He Dun about this.

495
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,750
Let me just ask you one thing.

496
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:08,490
Now, are you being so nice to He Dun just because she's your partner?

497
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,820
She's my partner. Of course, I should be nice to her.

498
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:17,980
But I'm not being as nice to each and every partner.

499
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,749
All right, Qian. Let me give you a word of advice.

500
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:25,019
If a man can be forced to accept others' love, it shows he's not committed enough.

501
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:27,289
You must know He Dun is also an eligible bachelorette.

502
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:30,280
She could be taken any day.

503
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,560
You should shape up or ship out.

504
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,269
Okay, fine, all right. Can you tell me now? Where on earth is she?

505
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:37,420
I have something important to see her about.

506
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:42,660
She seems to be on the way of being taken.

507
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,050
On the way of being taken?

508
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,080
Is she going out with Ye Jiahui?

509
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,080
Thanks.

510
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,189
The first stop of our date. I'm going to take you to see my friends.

511
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,740
Well, Lili. Be quick to tell me where they are going.

512
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,960
I'm not gonna tell you they are going to have a romantic dinner.

513
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,290
A romantic dinner?

514
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,670
Where are they going to have it?

515
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,129
I really have no idea.

516
00:40:26,129 --> 00:40:29,559
All right, Lili. I'll treat you to a hearty dinner later.

517
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,560
Then I'll not bother to refuse…

518
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,360
He's too insincere.

519
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,660
Aren't we here to see your friends?

520
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,889
They are all my friends. I work here.

521
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:48,939
You work here?

522
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:52,629
I'm a health consultant. Providing both physical and mental care.

523
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,360
This is the nursing home where my grandma is staying.

524
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,910
Dr. Ye.

525
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,360
Grandma?

526
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,409
You've seen her. Last time at my house.

527
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,120
Well, why didn't you tell me beforehand?

528
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,529
If you did, I'd have prepared something in advance.

529
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:09,939
Now I come here empty-handed. It's really embarrassing.

530
00:41:09,939 --> 00:41:13,850
It's fine. Grandma doesn't care about this.

531
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:17,519
Grandma told me she wanted to spend her twilight years with these elderly people.

532
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:20,530
But I knew she actually didn't want to be a burden to me.

533
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:26,429
I couldn't talk her around it but didn't want her to have her way, so I applied for a job here.

534
00:41:26,429 --> 00:41:29,320
It's quite a bliss for your grandma to have you with her.

535
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,910
I am the lucky one.

536
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,900
Actually, Grandma Yun and I are not blood relations,

537
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,870
but closer than blood relations.

538
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,230
When I was a child, my parents were always not at home. Grandma Yun was taking care of me.

539
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:49,050
Every day after school, I went to her place for dinner.

540
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:52,490
Later on, even if my parents were at home, I didn't want to go home.

541
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,000
I just wanted to stay with grandma.

542
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,600
I'm really sorry today.

543
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,940
I've taken the liberty of taking you here for a date.

544
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,190
We are going in after a while to sit with grandma for a while and have a chat.

545
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,460
If you find it boring,

546
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,209
just put your hand on mine, and I'll get you out.

547
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:41,900
Get out. Shoo, shoo, shoo. Get out, get out, get out!

548
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:46,300
Mr. Ke, why is your chicken running to my place?

549
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,810
