18
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,070
Director, isn't my report detailed enough?

19
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,700
We need to hear from both sides to draw the right conclusion.

20
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,000
We're also in a pickle.

21
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,200
From both sides?

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,700
Then do you mean I'm lying?

23
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,960
No.

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,120
Definitely not.

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,170
It's because this matter is so sensitive.

26
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,700
It'll cause terrible effects

27
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,900
if it's dealt with inappropriately.

28
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,700
Terrible effects?

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,070
Isn't this thing terrible enough?

30
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,400
Aren't you afraid that our school's long-established reputation will be ruined because of your inaction?

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,450
How can you allow that brute to continue teaching here?

32
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,300
Do you want to see more and more victims like me?

33
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,940
And then it can be called terrible?

34
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,720
Yao Kexin, our school is investigating this matter.

35
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,020
Nowadays, public opinion is devastating.

36
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,610
It's tricky for us to deal with it. But please rest assured.

37
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:00,190
If Professor Ji really makes a mistake, we will never

38
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,940
protect him.

39
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:09,020
So, how about holding a public hearing?

40
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,880
If he can prove there is something wrong with my thesis, I'll take the initiative to drop out.

41
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,890
But if he can't, he has to apologize to me in front of the press.

42
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,530
Student Yao Kexin, calm down.

43
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,970
I'll help you meet your needs.

44
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,790
But it takes time to prepare for the hearing.

45
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,730
We'll inform you when the hearing is scheduled.

46
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,060
Then please keep your promise.

47
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,470
Even if you don't hold the hearing,

48
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,560
I'll seek help from the police and society.

49
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,250
I've informed the press.

50
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,183
Next Friday.

51
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,190
Tang Lili, why did you scare me?

52
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,310
Did I act well?

53
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,043
I'll show you…

54
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,970
I'm so sleepy.

55
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,910
Go ahead.

56
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,740
Are you two…

57
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,890
You're annoying!

58
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,540
Fine, I'm waiting for your official notice.

59
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,030
Where is Qian Kaiyi?

60
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,470
He has something to handle in the station. So I asked him to go.

61
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,350
Well, he's so impolite. He didn't even say goodbye to me.

62
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,440
I wanted to hitch a ride.

63
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,470
Where are you going?

64
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,910
The base of the enemy.

65
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,440
Wait!

66
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,750
I'll go with you.

67
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,420
Why?

68
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,620
To go deeper into our party.

69
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,900
All right, this lesson is very important.

70
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,540
Please take notes.

71
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,940
Now let's begin the roll call.

72
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,300
Student, which class do you belong to?

73
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,740
Sir, I'm from the School of Economics and Management.

74
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,870
I've long known about you. I really want to take your class.

75
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,580
Don't be late again.

76
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,670
Thanks.

77
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,860
All right, everyone, let's start the roll call.

78
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,860
Once called, put up your hands and say, "yes".

79
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,900
- Xu Hua.
- Yes.

80
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,330
- Liu Qingfeng.
- Yes.

81
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,400
Zhang Jun.

82
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,860
- Li Yunfeng.
- Yes.

83
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,120
- Xu Xinghai.
- Yes.

84
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,310
I also like the clothes of this brand. This one is that brand.

85
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,530
You like buying clothes on vip.com?

86
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,860
Me too.

87
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,340
It'll offer a huge discount sometimes.

88
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,090
Yeah, it's very cost-effective.

89
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,110
I know one suit is suitable for you.

90
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,771
- I added it to my favorites before.
- It looks good.

91
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:20,930
It matches your skin, right?

92
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,050
- Can you share its link to me?
- No problem.

93
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,340
- Can you add my contract on WeChat?
- Okay.

94
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,840
Yes.

95
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,220
Okay, Yao…

96
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,200
Let's resume our class.

97
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,810
- Please…
- Do you know Yao Kexin?

98
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,700
Not really.

99
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,400
You have five minutes to scan the content.

100
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,550
Why are so many people asking about her recently?

101
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,940
Are you a reporter?

102
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,240
Of course not.

103
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,840
I'm a student of the School of Economics and Management.

104
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Do you think I look like a reporter?

105
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,450
Does she also owe you money?

106
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,160
What do you mean?

107
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,030
In fact, we're not acquaintances.

108
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,800
But, she borrowed money from me before.

109
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,810
I refused.

110
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,380
Later on, I received a dunning call for her.

111
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,530
Can you give the phone number to me?

112
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,290
Did she borrow a lot from you?

113
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,490
No.

114
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,223
All right.

115
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,690
I'll take a photo.

116
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,970
This one.

117
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,803
Thanks.

118
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,940
I'm much relieved that Professor Ji has a nice student like you who cares about him.

119
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,820
Don't you also care about him? You've been supporting him for so many years.

120
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,750
Over the past decades of my teaching career, I've never seen anyone stricter than Professor Ji.

121
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,420
Obviously, it's a lie.

122
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,710
Professor Zhang, I've read Yao Kexin's thesis.

123
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,190
It's pretty excellent, beyond the capacity of average students.

124
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,970
I've heard from Professor Ji that his issues aren't that simple.

125
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:14,240
So this time, I'd like to ask you about my mentor.

126
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,960
You're the one who knows him best over the past years.

127
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,930
Can you tell me something about him? This way, I can help him.

128
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,970
Just ask.

129
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,960
In this matter, he always said, "just wait". But I'm really anxious.

130
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,470
Does he have any solution that you know of?

131
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,760
He also stalled me off in this way.

132
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,560
Enough, don't persuade me anymore.

133
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,680
I have some thoughts in my mind.

134
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,390
But it isn't time to tell you.

135
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,200
He said he had some thoughts. I believe him.

136
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,240
He's also a shrewd man.

137
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,250
So you don't need to be so worried..

138
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,020
I know why he hides it from you.

139
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,200
He doesn't want to cause trouble for you. After all, it's sensitive.

140
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,500
You're also a public figure. He does this for your own good.

141
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,410
But we can't let this matter go his way anymore.

142
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,510
Professor, do you know Yao Kexin?

143
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,710
She looks well-behaved.

144
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,040
But I also don't know why she made this scene.

145
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,930
Did my mentor offend anyone?

146
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,370
How could a student make a big deal out of this?

147
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,050
Everything is arranged well.

148
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,110
She can quickly answer all questions.

149
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,910
Looks like all this is planned.

150
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,030
Xiao He, you're really smart.

151
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,660
I can only give you this answer.

152
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,660
Just believe your mentor.

153
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,170
If he's unwilling to say it, he must have some reason.

154
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,000
Then can we just sit idle and wait now?

155
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,200
Yao Kexin's hearing has been scheduled.

156
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,340
Then everything will be clear.

157
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,640
Let's wait and see.

158
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,610
When is it?

159
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,850
Tomorrow.

160
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,683
Tomorrow?

161
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,470
I've reached the crossroads. What should I do now?

162
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,080
Turn right and raise your head.

163
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,710
Sir, where are you?

164
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,590
I don't see you.

165
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,423
Go straight.

166
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,760
Sir, I haven't found any doors ahead.

167
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,300
Shall I go further ahead?

168
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,870
Yes. Straight ahead.

169
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,660
Hello.

170
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,510
How much do you want to borrow?

171
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,080
- 8,000.
- It's too little.

172
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,430
Please, sir.

173
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,590
My boyfriend's birthday is coming soon. I want to buy him a gift.

174
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,540
Can you do me this favor?

175
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,150
Who introduced you here?

176
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,983
Yao Kexin.

177
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,780
Go back.

178
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,000
Why?

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,270
I won't lend anything.

180
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,560
No. Sir, I really this money.

181
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,920
My… My boyfriend wants to break up with me.

182
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,080
I want to buy him a gift. Please!

183
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,280
How much did you say you want to borrow?

184
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,083
20,000.

185
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,030
All right. Let's sign a contract later.

186
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,610
Then I'll transfer the money to you this evening.

187
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,560
This contract expires in a month.

188
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,640
Then, if you haven't paid off the money, you'll have to sign a contract for an extension.

189
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,950
Got it?

190
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:42,200
It means if I haven't paid off the money on time, the interest will add up, right?

191
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,950
Yes. You've borrowed money before?

192
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,860
So you're quite rich.

193
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,470
Yes. Sir, may I ask another question.

194
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,240
If… If I can't pay off the debt in a month…

195
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,120
That's just an assumption.

196
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,340
Can you give me a few more days?

197
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,310
No way!

198
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,050
Your referrer… What's her name?

199
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,000
Yao Kexin.

200
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,100
Yes. She owed us money for months.

201
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,710
She said she would pay off the debt the day after tomorrow.

202
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,690
The interest of these two days will still add up.

203
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,880
There is no delay.

204
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,290
A Lannister always pays his debts. So should you.
(T/N: Someone who is trusted to pay their debts)

205
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,180
If you can't, pay the interest.

206
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,470
There is no room for negotiation.

207
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,850
What do you think?

208
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,370
Give it to me.

209
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,370
What?

210
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,000
Your student card.

211
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,030
Student card?

212
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,240
Can I give you my ID card?

213
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,140
Yes. Hurry up.

214
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,920
All right.

215
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,270
Where is my ID card?

216
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,803
Hello.

217
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,390
It's a piece of cake.

218
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,170
Just tell him the society is ruled by law.

219
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,820
Our way of collecting debts is legal.

220
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,883
Sister.

221
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,830
Hello, He Dun. When is Yao Kexin's hearing you mentioned?

222
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,023
Here.

223
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,740
Sorry. I just finished an interview. So I'm late.

224
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,680
It's all right. I'm glad that you can agree to the interview with me.

225
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,023
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

226
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,930
This is my business card.

227
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,663
Thanks.

228
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,300
Would you like something to drink?

229
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,710
No, thanks.

230
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,080
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,760
I have another appointment to attend after finishing this.

232
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,870
So I can only give you ten minutes.

233
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,633
Sorry.

234
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,780
Mr. Kang. Mr. Kang.

235
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,900
You have 9 minutes and 53 seconds left.

236
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:12,810
What's was the relationship between you and Ji Mingcong before this matter?

237
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,560
Were you close? How well did you know him?

238
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,540
He was just my professor. Not very close.

239
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,460
But he's very famous.

240
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,470
All students majoring in psychology in our school know him.

241
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,320
But as far as I know, early this year, he retired from your school.

242
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,590
And he hasn't taught graduate students for a long time.

243
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,640
I know.

244
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,830
But in the past two years as a graduate student,

245
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,710
I never missed a lecture of his.

246
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:46,200
I once asked him a question alone after a lecture.

247
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,170
I think he paid attention to me from then on.

248
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,220
What was the question about?

249
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,390
It was about bipolar disorder.

250
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,080
As far as I know, there was a controversial article about this question.

251
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:13,140
Then did he tell you why he stopped you from publishing your thesis?

252
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,030
No.

253
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,020
I think he just wanted to get me to his house.

254
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,910
Incorrect. I told you, you have to stick to your persona.

255
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,760
You're a good student who is passionate about psychology.

256
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,100
Ji Mingcong used his identity to harass you.

257
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,680
This way, others will be angrier

258
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,980
and sympathetic to you, as well as support and believe you.

259
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,370
Then… How should I answer it?

260
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,410
Like this.

261
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,510
I…

262
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:00,490
I tried to ask him in public many times,

263
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,010
but he didn't give a direct answer.

264
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,890
Until that day.

265
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,930
Ji Mingcong looked drunk.

266
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,460
He called me

267
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,640
over to his house.

268
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,023
Thanks.

269
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,870
Then I won't ask for any details about the case.

270
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,200
But my next question may be a little offensive.

271
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,120
I did ask a professional to read your thesis.

272
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,000
It's well-argued, well-structured, and high-quality.

273
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,890
But as a graduate student, how did you collect such a huge amount of data in such a short time?

274
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,810
Did you really collect the data by yourself?

275
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,770
What did you mean by that?

276
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,030
Are you doubting my professionalism?

277
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:02,390
You may say I can't give proof of sexual harassment,

278
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,750
but no one is allowed to slander my professionalism.

279
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:11,580
Each word and sentence in that thesis is all from my studies of many years.

280
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,560
If you suspect me of falsifying data, please prove it.

281
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,533
Please calm down. No offense.

282
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,880
It seems that you like your major very much.

283
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,620
I thought

284
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:32,290
it was nice and simple to do research.

285
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:37,890
I often sat in front of the table for a whole day reading my study materials.

286
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,850
I could devote myself to study.

287
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,950
I thought Ji Mingcong was such a person.

288
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:53,640
He's strict and knowledgeable.

289
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,740
I really don't know

290
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,300
why he did that.

291
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,230
You're much better.

292
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,230
But some people will perhaps ask questions irrelevant to the case.

293
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,680
Just remember these.

294
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,270
First, you love psychology.

295
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,030
Second, you're disappointed about Ji Mingcong and hate him.

296
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,663
Got it?

297
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,770
All right, let's continue the next question.

298
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,800
Ji Mingcong is the president of the Psychological Association in City H.

299
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,290
Why did you,

300
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,630
an ordinary female student, make this scene?

301
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,660
Why?

302
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,980
How could you ask that?

303
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,800
That bastard completely destroyed me, but now he's just hiding somewhere.

304
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,680
What do you think my purpose is?

305
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,560
A person like him should go to hell.

306
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,940
Are you so confident that you can pull him down?

307
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,623
No.

308
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,940
But I got to have a try.

309
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,850
Mr. Kang, do you have any other questions?

310
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,830
What do you hope to accomplish by going public?

311
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,460
You seem to be different from those people I saw before.

312
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,110
You are more suspicious of my purpose.

313
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,410
But you also agreed to the interview with me, didn't you?

314
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:48,540
All this is to let Ji Mingcong get what he deserves.

315
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,010
Then here is another question.

316
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,313
Do you know his student Li Yun?

317
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,840
A genius in psychology.

318
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,110
Unfortunately, just like her teacher, she's always doing immoral things.

319
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,120
To be frank, this article is my work.

320
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:22,430
You need to know, that I can help you better only if I know the truth, which is beneficial to both of us.

321
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,840
Li Yun just lost her license.

322
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,600
This punishment is so light for him.

323
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,861
- You mean…
- Now that he did this to me, even if

324
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:45,880
he's a bigwig in psychology, I'll pull him down

325
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,990
and ruin his reputation so that he will never bounce back.

326
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,910
I got it.

327
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,320
I'm deeply sympathetic to your suffering.

328
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,260
Please be assured that we will help you.

329
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,720
Thanks. Sorry to trouble you.

330
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,410
Then that's it for today's interview.

331
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,820
I need to go back to figure out a plan.

332
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,840
Feel free to contact me if you have any needs.

333
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,160
Then wish us a happy cooperation in advance.

334
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,233
Miss Yao,

335
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,680
I have a personal question for you.

336
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,313
Say it.

337
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,600
As far as I know,

338
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,630
the relevant authority hasn't revealed Li Yun's punishment to the public yet.

339
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,850
How did you know her license was revoked?

340
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,143
It's…

341
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,913
It's my guess.

342
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,990
It's a well-known fact that Li Yun fell for her visitor.

343
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,710
Even if the authorities haven't revealed the revocation of her license,

344
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,950
I think that that can be the only possibility.

345
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,110
Otherwise, her penalty won't be accepted by the public.

346
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,900
- You…
- Looks like I thought too much.

347
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,893
I thought you had a channel for inside information.

348
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,660
[Unknown number]

349
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,010
[Unknown number]

350
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,700
If you want this matter to be more severe,

351
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,290
Li Yun would be the best catalyst.

352
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,710
Excuse me, I need to go to the toilet.

353
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,800
Hello.

354
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,500
What should I do now?

355
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,500
That person seems to suspect me.

356
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,800
Shall I just sneak away?

357
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,400
Calm down.

358
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,700
Do as I say.

359
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,400
Mr. Kang.

360
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,500
Miss Yao.

361
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,300
I thought you had left.

362
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,900
Of course not.

363
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,580
Did you think I'd run away?

364
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,100
We have 27 seconds before the end of this interview.

365
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,290
I'll answer your last question again.

366
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:52,100
Li Yun's situation has nothing to do with me.

367
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,400
And I don't need any catalyst for my case.

368
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,400
It's Ji Mingcong who made the fault.

369
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,400
The person who you should suspect and attack is him, instead of me.

370
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,150
Time is up. I have another appointment.

371
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,520
- Hello.
- Are you Miss Tang?

372
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,960
- Yes.
- This is the snacks you ordered on LYFEN.

373
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,500
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

374
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,130
Aren't you Mr. Policeman Jin?

375
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,000
- Tang Lili?
- Yes.

376
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,400
It's really you.

377
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,100
Do you have anything to do with campus loan?

378
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,900
We're finding dens for lending around the university.

379
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,100
Why is your phone number in Mr. Li's call records?

380
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,900
I didn't…

381
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,930
- Oh, I dialed it by accident.
- Really?

382
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,520
Don't have anything to do with them.

383
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,000
Otherwise, you'll find it difficult to get rid of it. Got it?

384
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,000
Just tell me if you have difficulties. Don't contact them again.

385
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,500
Are you clear?

386
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,600
Why do you always get into this mess?

387
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,010
How about I give you my phone number?

388
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,900
Okay. Thanks, Sir.

389
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,820
I didn't bring my phone. Why not come in and have a drink?

390
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,940
[Jinghui Tea House]

391
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,160
The production of ARMS therapeutic apparatus has been put on the agenda by Director Ye.

392
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,270
As for the promotion in the medical market, I have my own thoughts.

393
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,340
What we need now is the help of you commissioners.

394
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,700
A crucial time for re-election is coming soon.

395
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,300
I believe all of you will make the best choice.

396
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,600
I'd like to propose a toast.

397
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,600
Director Ye. why don't you say something?

398
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
I said what I wanted to say last time.

399
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,600
So I'm just a listener this time.

400
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,000
If I have to say something,

401
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,140
I'll wish our President Wen

402
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,910
can realize her ambition on the behalf of all commissioners.

403
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,660
There must be a mastermind behind Yao Kexin's matter.

404
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,730
Lili and I also found something today.

405
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:45,900
Yao Kexin is not only debt-ridden, but also she promised the lender to pay off the debt after the hearing.

406
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,400
So someone perhaps wants to ask her to attack Professor Ji by using her weakness.

407
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,500
It's not perhaps, but definitely.

408
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Who has Professor Ji offended?

409
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,930
His social connections are quite simple.

410
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,500
One of them is about the Psychological Association.

411
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,600
It should be the mastermind.

412
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,000
You just said someone manipulated this thing.

413
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,330
How did you know that?

414
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,480
When I talked with her, she always answered well

415
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,900
in terms of the questions about Professor Ji and the thesis.

416
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,320
I couldn't find any flaw.

417
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,200
But when I set a trap and asked about Li Yun, she was totally panicked.

418
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,500
It's my guess.

419
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,430
It's a well-known fact that Li Yun fell for her visitor.

420
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,950
Even if the authorities haven't revealed the revocation of her license,

421
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,200
I think that that can be the only possibility.

422
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,110
She then said she'd like to go to the toilet. When she came back, she became very calm.

423
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:42,700
Li Yun's situation has nothing to do with me.

424
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,500
And I don't need any catalyst for my case.

425
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,600
It's Ji Mingcong who made the fault.

426
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,100
The person who you should suspect and attack is him, instead of me.

427
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,400
Did you go to Yao Kexin?

428
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:01,100
I'm engaged in the press. Is there any problem?

429
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,200
Thank you, Mr. Press.

430
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,820
Anyway, it seems that everything is going as planned.

431
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,560
If there is a mastermind behind all this, he must

432
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,710
bear deep resentment against Professor Ji or seeking interests.

433
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,270
Whoever it is, he has painstakingly done so much.

434
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:24,200
Then the hearing must be an important part of his plan.

435
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,800
He'll definitely attend the hearing.

436
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,900
Who goes there?

437
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,100
Continue playing on your phone.

438
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,400
Anyway, we have to find him at the hearing.

439
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,800
Anyway, we have to find him at the hearing.

440
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,100
This is our workplace.

441
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,900
- Director Pan.
- What you need has been approved.

442
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,300
This is Qian Kaiyi, the host of the Night Talk to Your Heart.

443
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,360
This is Miss Wen, a psychologist.

444
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,600
She'll attend the episode of the Time Interview about campus sexual assault as a guest this time.

445
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,240
I'm Wen He.

446
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,500
- I'm Qian Kaiyi. You're also a psychological counselor?
- Yes.

447
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,100
Yes. Nice to meet you.

448
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,710
- Miss Wen.
- Miss He.

449
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,110
You know each other?

450
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,200
She's the younger sister of my supervisor Wen Liang.

451
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,080
She's also an outstanding psychological counselor.

452
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,000
What a coincidence! Two ace programs.

453
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,200
And two outstanding female psychological counselors.

454
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,600
Now that you're here, why not show me around?

455
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,600
Then please show Miss Wen around, Miss He. I have something else to deal with.

456
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,500
Thanks, Director Pan.

457
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:52,200
Miss Wen, I'll lead you to our broadcasting room first.

458
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,800
This way.

459
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,840
Brother Dong.

460
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,500
I saw Miss He just now.

461
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,900
Who is the woman beside her?

462
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,980
You don't know her?

463
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,120
The psychological counselor invited by the Time Interview.

464
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,530
It's said that she has a strong background in psychology.

465
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,900
Is their circle so small?

466
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,220
In every walk of life, there are only a few elites.

467
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,800
The psychological counselor invited by Wang Zhuo knows Miss He.

468
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,200
What does it mean?

469
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,380
I've read the plan given by Dong.

470
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,600
- I can't do it.
- Why?

471
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,910
I don't want to be stuck in this real-time hot spot.

472
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,000
Elites?

473
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,500
Dong,

474
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,100
help me investigate Wen He's backgrounds.

475
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,520
All right.

476
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,380
Li, the theme of our next episode is listeners' Q&A.

477
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:53,890
Qian, I saw them working on a campus sexual assault plan when walking by the Time Interview.

478
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,600
The truth of this case is still unknown.

479
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,900
So let's avoid it for now.

480
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,100
Rest assured. I'll definitely bring your money back.

481
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,100
Thanks.

482
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,400
Why are you here again?

483
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,100
What's up?

484
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,200
I'm here to return your pen.

485
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,200
Take this pen.

486
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,150
And to apply for a new ID card by the way.

487
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,290
How did you lose your ID card?

488
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,500
Did you pledge it to borrow money?

489
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,100
What kind of person do you think I am?

490
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,500
I… I'm actually doing something good.

491
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,480
What's it?

492
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,500
It's a long story.

493
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,700
I'll tell you later.

494
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,890
You can apply for a new ID card online.

495
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,260
You don't need to come here personally.

496
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,300
Besides, this police station isn't in charge of this service.

497
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,300
Then I came here in vain.

498
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,380
You… Why are you always confused every time I see you?

499
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,010
I thought I just needed to be present.

500
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,100
Didn't I record my fingerprint last time?

501
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,550
You aren't a criminal.

502
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,900
But since you're here, you can have your one-inch photo taken

503
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,310
with the machine over there, which can be used for your new ID card.

504
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,200
All right.

505
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:37,230
They came to me through the Psychological Association, asking me to do a program.

506
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,890
Did Director Pan come to you?

507
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:43,600
No, it was Wang Zhuo. I'm here to talk about the misconduct issue of Professor Ji.

508
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,500
Don't mind it.

509
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,500
Although he's in trouble, there is no conclusion yet.

510
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,200
Thanks.

511
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:05,470
In fact, some colleagues were transferred from the 'Night Talk to Your Heart' to the 'Time Interview'.

512
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,100
They're all nice and conscientious.

513
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,700
I know. I've seen them.

514
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,200
Don't see me off. I can go down alone.

515
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,190
Qian Kaiyi, I know Director Pan must have put pressure on you.

516
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,890
Otherwise, she wouldn't have agreed to invite Miss Wen to the episode of the Time Interview

517
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,480
about campus sexual assault.

518
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,500
In fact, we can also

519
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,100
do this episode.

520
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,700
It's true. I don't want your…

521
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,900
I don't want our program to be affected because of me.

522
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,700
What are you talking about?

523
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,400
Our program isn't affected.

524
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,550
Let me ask you, what's your first thought

525
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:15,460
when it comes to Haifeng Radio International and the program of psychological counseling?

526
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,300
Night Talk to Your Heart.

527
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,840
Yeah. Then everything is all right.

528
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,540
The Night Talk to Your Heart is a professional program of psychological counseling.

529
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,990
The combination of a host and a psychological counselor is the biggest advantage of our program.

530
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:27,850
But the Time Interview is a professional program of interviewing celebrities.

531
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:31,130
Any program should stick to its feature if it wants to live on.

532
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:35,100
They'll just gain temporary benefits by copying our model.

533
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,650
Besides, their psychologist is less excellent than you.

534
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,200
Is it right?

535
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,070
No.

536
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,200
She's better than me.

537
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,800
In my eyes, you're the best.

538
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,200
By the way, just now, I just shook hands with her.

539
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,900
Oh, thanks for reminding me of that.

540
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,800
I'm joking.

541
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,600
I know it.

542
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,500
But as for the episode theme, I was serious.

543
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,780
Here you are.

544
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,200
Thanks.

545
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,900
It looks good.

546
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,500
Do you think so?

547
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,200
If you don't leave, you'll commit the crime of disrupting public service.

548
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,700
I just asked you one question. Why are you so fierce?

549
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,000
Xiao Jin, Xiao Zhao, we got a mission. Follow me.

550
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,800
Take your photos.

551
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,800
Sorry. Please hold on.

552
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,903
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

553
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,300
What are you doing, Miss?

554
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,190
I'm here with them.

555
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,130
There is a hearing inside. You aren't allowed to enter without licenses.

556
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,700
I have. I'm a student of this school.

557
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,800
An undergraduate?

558
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,570
Didn't you see the notice board?

559
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,880
This hearing isn't open to the students of this school.

560
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,740
Sir, can you make an exception?

561
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,980
Professor Ji is my teacher.

562
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,600
This thing is important to me.

563
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,950
I have to go in and help him.

564
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,100
Whoever it is, without a license, he can't go in.

565
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,670
Sir, this is my colleague.

566
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,270
Yao Kexin invited too many reporters today.

567
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,210
She didn't know it. So she thought it was a secret mission.

568
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:06,360
Why do you reporters have to be so mysterious?

569
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,500
- I'm sorry. Thanks.
- Thanks.

570
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,600
[Yao Kexin's Thesis]

571
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:16,610
The above mentioned is the content of my research report.

572
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:23,151
Student Yao, although I'm not a psychology major, I can see your thesis

573
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:27,030
is really high-quality, even far better than many young teachers'.

574
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:34,300
How did you manage to write such a thesis while taking all classes?

575
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,000
I've started to prepare for this thesis and read many books since my undergraduate studies.

576
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,700
It took me half a year to translate the references.

577
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,990
All this is the preparation for this thesis.

578
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:51,600
How couldn't I write such a high-quality thesis?

579
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:56,880
She's completely dodging the question.

580
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,700
No results will be delivered if it goes on like this.

581
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,400
Profession Ji really won't come?

582
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,300
Let's wait for a while longer.

583
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,920
My passion for psychology is well grounded.

584
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,430
I believe all the present teachers have seen my efforts.

585
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:21,270
I wrote this thesis with the passion for psychology and the admiration for Ji Mingcong.

586
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:24,410
Unexpectedly, what crushed me

587
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:28,260
happened to be him who I regarded as the beacon for my academic path.

588
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,700
Yao Kexin,

589
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:35,200
this hearing is being held to resolve the doubts in your thesis.

590
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,000
I hope you can put emphasis on your thesis.

591
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,550
One's morality is above his competence.

592
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:47,500
Director, which one do you think is more important?

593
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,700
Today, I've plucked up great courage to stand here.

594
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,500
I chose to attend the hearing not only to prove

595
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:07,900
my innocence in my thesis, but also tell that matter to you in detail,

596
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,100
in order to let more people see Ji Mingcong's true colors

597
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,400
and prevent girls from getting into danger.

598
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,200
If Professor Ji doesn't show up, even white will be called black.

599
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,200
[Ji Mingcong, Professor]

600
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm sorry for being late.

601
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,700
Something unpleasant has happened recently.

602
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,700
But I believe rumors stop at the wise man.

603
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:05,170
Today I attend to this hearing

604
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:10,200
just to tell you why I stopped her, Ji Mingcong Professor, from publishing this thesis.

605
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,200
Why?

606
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,161
Just because of your evil thoughts.

607
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,100
There is only one reason.

608
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,500
Because you aren't the writer of this thesis.

609
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:29,000
- Its references…
- Do you want to say Ji Mingcong Professor

610
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,890
the data cited in this thesis is falsified?

611
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:35,900
Do you want to say I can't explain the details of using the data

612
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,800
and how I ensure if the data is valid?

613
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,400
Is that right?

614
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,600
Miss Huang, please hand out the prepared documents.

615
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,840
Everyone, please have a look.

616
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,700
This document can answer every doubt about the data in my thesis.

617
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,510
Did you find anything wrong?

618
