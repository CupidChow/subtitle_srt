00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,500
No, one of my friends gave it to me.

But I only know his name.

No.

00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:32,479
If my memory serves me correctly, it was during our third counseling

105
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,270
that I started to take the medicine.

106

I've given up the medicine,

in fact,

120
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,509
after meeting the doctor, I should have come to apologize to you face to face.

121

But such a thing happened.

122

I'm so ashamed to face you.

In fact, I didn't blame you long ago.

127
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,779
The fact that you can embrace your life

128
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:35,579
and live so happily is also a kind of support for my work.

There is no assumption.

Don't worry, I'm fine.

146
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:33,209
If I were in trouble, I wouldn't have come to you for that theme.

Right, Qian Kaiyi, enough already.

148
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,000
If you continue to be so sad, both of us need to comfort you.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,889
No way.

150
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,519
If so, I'll be a troublemaker.

151
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,200
Let's get down to business.

152
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,430
I have something to discuss with you.

153
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,249
Guess who just came here.

154
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,299
Who was it?

155
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,379
- Xiao Mo.
- Xiao Mo?

156
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:51,569

To apologize to me.

158
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,939
Isn't it already too late?

159
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,450
Isn't that so insincere?

160
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,379
There's a reason why he didn't come earlier.

161
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,550
But that doesn't matter.

162
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,839
What matters is that he said he attacked me because of the influence of medicine.

163
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,519
What? He attacked you?

164
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,030
That man attacked you?

165
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,689
Why didn't you tell me?

166
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,519
I'll explain it to you later.

167
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,130
Wait. Medicine?

168
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,549
Psychological counselors can't prescribe medicine for patients, can they?

169
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:17,099
It wasn't me.

170
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,520
You mean he got the medicine from another person?

171
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,639
Yes.

172
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,180
He said it was one of his friends.

173
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,279
But he isn't familiar with him.

174
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,439
What's the most important, he took the medicine right during my counseling with him.

175
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:34,539
So I guess someone interfered in my work.

176
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,809
Then does he have anything to do with Yao Kexin's matter?

177
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,439
I don't know.

178
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:43,060
But for now, all the news is against me.

179
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,229
So the person behind Yao Kexin might target more than Professor Ji.

180
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:50,899
Xiao Mo and Professor Ji have connections with you in your life.

181
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:54,300
Who else gets involved among your acquaintances?

182
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,059
You mean my senior is in a relationship with her visitor?

183
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:03,029
A veteran psychologist like her can't make such a mistake.

184
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:06,879
At the hearing, she admitted all the charges against her.

185
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,080
It's my fault.

186
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,410
I'm willing to bear all the consequences.

187
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,350
My senior, Li Yun.

188
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,550
She fell for one of her visitors.

189
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,679
In order to protect him, she didn't mention the thing between them.

190
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:22,400
In the end, her license was withdrawn.

191
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,660
Do you have a good relationship with her?

192
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,840
Yes.

193
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,419
And I have a lot of respect for her.

194
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,310
She's also one of my teacher's best students.

195
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,579
Some of them are close to you, and some to Professor Ji.

196
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:39,649
But the mastermind who targets you is perhaps one of your acquaintances, right?

197
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,350
Yes.

198
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,000
But I don't know who it is yet.

199
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,080
What's wrong with you, Professor?

200
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,660
- Where is your medicine?
- Where is your medicine?

201
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,760
What's up?

202
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,570
I thought of one person.

203
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,329
But I don't know whether to say it.

204
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,550
Who's it in your mind?

205
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,520
But I don't have any hard evidence.

206
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,419
Qian, we can't let go of any clues.

207
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:18,600
By the way, we can find the evidence together.

208
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,960
Ye Jiahui.

209
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,380
At Yao Kexin's hearing,

210
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,250
I saw him.

211
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,200
Jiahui. Jiahui!

212
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,470
Ye Jiahui.

213
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,789
Ye Jiahui, come out.

214
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:50,010
We need to talk to you.

215
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,750
Forget it. I don't think he's home. Let's go.

216
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,800
Let's talk to him when he returns.

217
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,550
Wait.

218
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,340
Where are you going?

219
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,180
I've got an idea.

220
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,120
Don't…

221
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,860
Welcome.

222
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,499
Qian Kaiyi, it's the first time I've thought you're so handsome since I knew you long ago.

223
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,840
He isn't here.

224
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,229
Wait.

225
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:55,960
The back of this cabinet is empty.

226
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,740
What did you hear, He?

227
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,370
The sound of the ventilation system.

228
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,819
Ventilation systems are installed at the back of enclosed spaces, especially in basements.

229
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:06,129
Then why didn't you hear it when you came here before?

230
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:08,570
Then, I didn't notice it.

231
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,610
It can be heard only in a quiet place.

232
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,010
It's indeed empty.

233
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,550
How shall we open the door?

234
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,900
Could there be a cog?

235
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,670
Wait.

236
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,320
What's up?

237
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,160
Dust.

238
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,960
Ye Jiahui is a clean freak.

239
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,230
There is no dust in the whole shelf.

240
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,280
Only a few areas are dotted with little dust.

241
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,620
It's very thin, but I can still feel it.

242
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,520
What if there is dust?

243
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,200
Static electricity.

244
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,010
A certain amount of dust will gather together in static electricity.

245
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,710
There is definitely a cog nearby.

246
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,650
It opened.

247
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,860
Let's go.

248
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,750
Could Ye Jiahui be down there?

249
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,410
Yeah.

250
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,880
He Dun.

251
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,890
Let's go.

252
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,400
Wait.

253
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,730
What's wrong again?

254
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,670
Turn on a torch.

255
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,640
To be honest, I'm a bit tempted to break up.

256
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,350
I'm with you.

257
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,840
Hurry up!

258
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,410
Why is it so dark here?

259
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,979
What is this?

260
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,040
Is it graffiti?

261
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,860
Watch the stairs!

262
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,150
Will he come back after a while?

263
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,280
He's outnumbered.

264
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,960
Why are you afraid?

265
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,890
Qian Kaiyi, why are you trembling?

266
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,860
Let me give you a sense of security.

267
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,899
It's okay. It's okay.

268
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:34,470
It's just a doll. Don't be scared.

269
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,650
Qian Kaiyi.

270
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,430
Why are you hiding here?

271
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,840
Well, let's go upstairs for now, He Dun.

272
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,470
I'm sweating.

273
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,870
Go upstairs?

274
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,029
You... Are you a man?

275
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:52,790
Come here!

276
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,130
Come here!

277
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,930
Let go of my arm.

278
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,550
In there.

279
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,359
If I'd been a bit late, you could have been killed.

280
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,490
We're being bugged.

281
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,490
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

282
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,410
I'm fine.

283
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,960
Come over here.

284
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,939
The patient drank heavily after being sedated, which led to respiration disorders.

285
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:04,609
- He is now in shock.
- I'm Ye Jiahui.

286
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:07,500
What a coincidence. I never thought we'd be neighbors.

287
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,949
Have you ever met such a case?

288
00:18:09,949 --> 00:18:13,579
No. My mentor knows something about it.

289
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:15,929
My senior is in a relationship with her visitor?

290
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,929
This person is very high-functioning.

291
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,529
I'll introduce my teacher to you one day.

292
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,769
My senior thought this file was in my hands.
[F's client file 99-00]

293
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,530
I'm now handing over this file to you.

294
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,390
Keep it well.

295
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,799
Keep the information about visitors strictly confidential.

296
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,779
Jiahui knew everything about me through all my visitors and friends.

297
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,209
He even disturbed my life and work.

298
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,679
I've been wondering why a gifted and self-restricted

299
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:16,640
psychological counselor fell for her visitor.

300
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,370
Now I finally know who that visitor is.

301
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,230
It's Ye Jiahui.

302
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,940
He made such a careful plan for one purpose.

303

[Interview with renowned professor of psychology]

304
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,210
You rat!

305
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,589
What are you doing? Stop!

306
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:02,150
Can't you have a good talk?

307
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,860
Stop!

308
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,300
Are you all right? Get up.

309
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,809
Stop! Stop!

310
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:20,859
Are you all right?

311
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,140
Ye Jiahui, let me ask you. Why did you do this to me?

312
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,590
Why did you do this to Professor Ji?

313
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,350
You approach and get close to me on purpose, right?

314
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,520
You never treated us as your friends, right?

315
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,259
Ye Jiahui. If you're a man, just admit what you have done.

316
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:36,939
Say something! Are you mute?

317
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,530
Your behavior is illegally sneaking into others' houses.

318
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,610
According to Article 40 of the Regulations

319
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,269
of the People's Republic of China on Punishments in Public Order and Security Administration,

323

It has nothing to do with them.

324
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,900
You're the judge?

325
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,279
They're accomplices, and you're the main culprit.

326

Fortunately, your friend doesn't press charges.

00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,000
Mr. Qian, don't be impulsive.

329
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,620
Intentionally hitting others can constitute the crime of intentional injury or provoking troubles.

330
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,580
Sir, he won't do it again.

331
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,490
This lady,

332
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,550
why do I see you everywhere?

333
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,169
Are you trying to meet me by every means?

334
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,729
Sir, if I say it's a coincidence, will you believe me?

335
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,309
Sir… Sir, may I ask

336
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:39,639
how long he will be detained?

337
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:41,970
It depends on the severity of the consequences of wiretapping.

338
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,940
We'll search the scene later for evidence.

339
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,919
If it's minor, and you're willing to mediate, it won't be too long.

340
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,849
But you have to go back with us to give a statement.

341
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,570
All right.

342
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,860
Okay.

343
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,450
Let's go.

344
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,890
You're spineless.

345
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,360
Mr. Ye, your conduct doesn't constitute a criminal offence.

346
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,659
But according to the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishments

347
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:13,499
in Public Order and Security Administration,

348
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,499
peeping, filming, eavesdropping and disseminating others' privacy are serious.

349
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:21,149
You shall be detained for not less than 5 days but not more than 10 days.

350
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,480
Mr. Ye, did you hear me?

351
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,760
Whatever.

352
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,720
This is my house.

353
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,740
Are you hungry?

354
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,209
Yes, a little.

355
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,820
Let me defrost some dumplings and then cook them for you.

356
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,300
- Make yourself at home.
- Okay.

357
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,510
So this is yours…

358
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,610
This is your water.

359
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,080
It's cute.

360
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,070
Wait a moment.

361
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,700
What are you doing?

362
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,860
These are your parents?

363
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,230
They're a perfect match.

364
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,470
The elders in the Wenchang Street said the same thing.

365
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,900
Have a seat.

366
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,460
They must love each other so much.

367
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,710
They were a model couple in the Wenchang Street.

368
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,739
I remember when I was a child, my mom cooked dinner every night and waited for my dad.

369
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:19,869
No matter how late he returned and how tired he was,

370
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:22,130
he would have a bowl of soup cooked by my mom,

371
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,589
as if he couldn't sleep without it.

372
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,809
It seems your mother is a good cook.

373
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,470
My mom's cooking skill…

374
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,040
But my dad thought it was good.

375
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,009
So sometimes, I thought if his taste buds had changed after he married my mom.

376
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:38,040
That's because he loves your mom.

377
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,810
Idiot!

378
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,280
So...

379
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,270
Are you feeling better?

380
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,419
Today, I asked Ye Jiahui why he framed Professor Ji and me.

381
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:55,390
He didn't answer it.

382
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,900
We were strangers before.

383
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,630
I really don't know why he did that.

384
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,390
But the result is that he hurt you.

385
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,390
That's unforgivable.

386
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,800
In fact, I've always known little about him.

387
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,349
He isn't talkative, looking quite incomprehensible.

388
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:20,390
But when he was in the Wenchang Street, he talked with the elders…

389
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,409
I major in medicine.

390
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,800
Are you a doctor?

391
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,660
He cooked and played chess with them,

392
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,430
and played games with children.

393
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,519
I could tell his smile was sincere.

394
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,620
He was really happy.

395
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,119
Sometimes, I think a person's characteristics

396
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:43,140
can determine if he's good or evil and whom he likes.

397
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,600
I really want to have a chance to talk with him.

398
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,190
What's wrong?

399
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,450
All right, but I have to be present.

400
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,760
Okay, Mr. Aloha shirt.

401
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,289
Forget it.

402
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,619
Anyway, Ye Jiahui's matter has been handled.

403
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,079
- Then I'll tell you about the next thing.
- What is it?

404
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,910
But you have to promise me not to get angry.

405
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,319
I must hear what it is before deciding whether to get angry or not.

406
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:17,510
I want to do an episode about psychological counseling.

407
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:22,640
If we get more listeners than they do, they won't be allowed to snatch our men.

408
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,590
What if you lose?

409
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:28,190
Then I'll have many things to do.

410
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,660
For example, I can sell coffee in the garden house.

411
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,109
I can also serve as your assistant in your counseling office.

412
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:35,300
You can also open a shop for aloha shirts.

413
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,489
- I can't believe you have that idea.
- What's up?

414
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:39,900
But I support your idea.

415
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,359
In fact, I'm not afraid of others' comments on me.

416
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,399
In my heart, sadness is overtaken by worries that the public will misunderstand the profession

417
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:53,769
as psychological counselors because of Professor Ji and me.

418
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:58,809
If we can really do an episode to tell them what this profession is all about,

419
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:03,009
let them know about me and clear up some of their misconceptions about the profession,

420
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:05,919
I think it's a good thing. Don't you think so?

421
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:15,139
My sweetheart always cares about the public no matter when it is.

422
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,880
♫ Listen to the melody of the wind ♫

423
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,720
♫ Slowly blowing off leaves from the trees ♫

424
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,940
♫ Look at the clear sunshine ♫

425
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:54,240
♫ Hurriedly brushing past your figure ♫

426
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,289
You always bring me food.

427
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,070
I don't know what I should give you.

428
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,990
So I chose

429
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:20,449
a brand-name lipstick. Look.

430
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,880
Then I'll take it.

431
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,429
I saw you always bought on vip.com, so I also bought it there.

432
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:29,070
Thanks.

433
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,380
Why did you give me a ride home?

434
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,799
I saw Qian Kaiyi took He Dun home.

435
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:38,870
So I was worried about you returning alone.

436
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,489
I did it deliberately to create an opportunity for them.

437
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:44,159
I've been down this road many times. You know that.

438
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,460
But thank you anyway.

439
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,970
You're a girl. You'd better be more cautious if you're alone.

440
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,220
Isn't Ye Jiahui your friend?

441
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,040
Yes, you're right.

442
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:02,129
In fact, many people who go astray aren't absolutely bad guys.

443
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:04,140
Take the old man we met as an example.

444
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,659
He went to others' houses at midnight.

445
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,549
He didn't steal anything valuable, but some plastic bottles

446
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,499
and abandoned cardboard boxes to sell them.

447
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,990
He did this just to buy food for his starving grandchildren.

448
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,100
So many things need to be balanced by law.

449
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,740
- What I can do…
- …is just to uphold social justice.

450
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,979
In fact, I think you and Dun He are quite similar.

451
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,209
The difference is that you deal with the people

452
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,450
whose behaviors go wrong,

453
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,380
and she deals with those whose mind goes wrong.

454
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,930
Yes, I'm increasingly aware that many people who make mistakes

455
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,800
have an unhealthy mind.

456
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,180
So your work is very important.

457
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:04,800
Sir, before leaving, can you teach me a few self-defense skills?

458
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,299
I just thought what you said was reasonable.

459
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:09,000
Girls should learn some skills

460
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,790
to protect themselves.

461
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,000
Take it as a thank-you for the food I brought you.

462
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,289
For the sake of your just-so-so food,

463
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,020
I'll teach you some.

464
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,430
All right, thanks then!

465
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,400
Look.

466
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,930
When you're in danger,

467
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,280
you need to guard.

468
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,860
Use the hand for fending off the blow to grasp your enemy's hand.

469
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,449
Grasp, dig, and elbow.

470
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,320
- Elbow.
- Yes.

471
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,310
Grasp, dig, and elbow.

472
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,390
Hit me.

473
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,610
Are you sure?

474
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,530
Yes, have a try.

475
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,250
You're a quick learner.

476
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,520
Sir, may I ask you a question?

477
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,670
Don't turn around.

478
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,130
Say it.

479
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,360
Can you be my boyfriend?

480
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,050
Can I be your girlfriend?

481
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,430
It's fine,

482
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,230
good night.

483
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,130
How about helping me finish it?

484
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,110
How do you feel about me?

485
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,210
Well…

486
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,570
You…

487
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,510
You're here. I'm leaving now.

488
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,140
Good night.

489
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,450
You haven't answered me yet.

490
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,590
Good night.

491
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,979
What do you think of Professor Ji's reaction when he saw the letter at the hearing?

492
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:10,729
It wasn't anger, but panic.

493
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:12,510
He has never been so panicked.

494
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:16,939
- Because that letter can't be read out.
- Have you forgotten it?

495
00:33:16,939 --> 00:33:19,760
He wanted to stop this farce not for himself.

496
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,940
Yes.

497
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,850
It's for the owner of that letter.

498
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,090
He wanted to protect that person.

499
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,330
So who is that person?

500
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,330
His love.

501
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,900
Otherwise, he couldn't have hurt your mentor.

502
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:39,610
If Ye Jiahui's target is Professor Ji, why has he lurked around me for so long?

503
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:43,090
Because you have what he wants.

504
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,820
This F is my senior's visitor?

505
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,090
He Dun,

506
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,372
keep this file for me.

507
00:33:51,372 --> 00:33:52,379
[F's client file 99-00]

508
00:33:52,379 --> 00:33:55,430
No, he's my visitor.

509
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,760
- I'm already in love with him.
- F.

510
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,300
He's always been mine.

511
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,680
Have you seen our mentor's File on F?

512
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,540
File on F?

513
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,200
Li Yun's F is Ye Jiahui.

514
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,019
So the F who Ye Jiahui is looking for is the real owner of this letter.

515
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,309
- Hello.
- Senior.

516
00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:28,490
How are you doing overseas? Is everything all right?

517
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,320
Yes.

518
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,770
He Dun, thanks for caring about me.

519
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,500
How about you?

520
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,740
Senior, I need your help.

521
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,530
Something happened to me recently.

522
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,620
Our mentor is sick.

523
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:46,329
One of my friends may be detained for a few days.

524
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:48,440
You also know him.

525
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,600
Ye Jiahui.

526
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,429
What happened to him?

527
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:54,910
He… Where is he?

528
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,560
He should be home in a couple of days.

529
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,290
You don't need to worry about him.

530
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:01,000
Senior, only you can help us now.

531
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,020
Sorry, I can't.

532
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,700
Senior, how much do you know about Ye Jiahui?

533
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,950
And what has he been looking for?

534
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,910
I'm really at my wit's end.

535
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,240
I need your help.

536
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,730
His matter isn't that simple.

537
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:23,130
There must be a great scheme hidden behind it.

538
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,959
You must pay attention to your safety. Got it?

539
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,659
A long time ago, our mentor gave me an address and asked me to help.

540
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:35,989
But I was so busy that I didn't pay attention to it.

541
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:40,429
But in retrospect, I think there might be the answer you're looking for.

542
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,640
Auntie, may I ask what soup can restore energy?

543
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,260
Cinnamon, red dates and American ginseng

544
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,710
are all good for girls.

545
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,430
I didn't say it was for a girl.

546
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,050
Who else do you have except for He Dun?

547
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:06,749
By the way, I have a secret recipe for nourishing during pregnancy. I'll tell it to you.

548
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:08,500
Auntie, you're thinking too much.

549
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,990
Don't you want to restore energy?

550
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,670
I'm afraid that He Dun will lack energy because of talking too much.

551
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,320
That secret recipe can also restore energy.

552
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,200
All right, I'll write them down.

553
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,940
Thanks, Auntie.

554
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,000
Why did you get up so early?

555
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,220
You also up?

556
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,879
It was because of you that I had trouble sleeping yesterday.

557
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:43,560
I saw you slept well last night.

558
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,849
- Have a taste.
- Did you make it?

559
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,630
It's a little hot.

560
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,020
What do you think?

561
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,460
Then I'll get a bowl for you.

562
00:37:07,698 --> 00:37:10,078
Thank you, Qian Kaiyi.

563
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:12,829
Don't be foolish!

564
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,760
I'm going to meet a person later.

565
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,140
Who is it?

566
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,610
F.

567
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,600
This way.

568
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,699
Ran fast?

569
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:33,140
Sit down.

570
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,110
Keep an eye on him.

571
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,670
Hello.

572
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,709
I came just at the right time. They've all gone to lunch.

573
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,620
Why are you here again? You're addicted to bringing me food?

574
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,380
You don't like it?

575
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,860
Then I'll bring another dish tomorrow.

576
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,320
What's it?

577
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,050
You're looking forward to it.

578
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,220
Don't behave like this all the time. This is my workplace. It's improper.

579
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,700
What's wrong with it?

580
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,499
You can order takeaway food in the workplace.

581
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:37,330
Food deliverers can come, so can I.

582
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:40,810
So, you got a part-time job as a food deliverer.

583
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,729
Policemen should be healthy when serving the people.

584
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:45,870
I'm making contribution to the people.

585
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,530
You're really good at flattering yourself.

586
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,720
What do you mean?

587
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,050
Be decent.

588
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,290
Don't cause trouble for me.

589
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,740
I didn't.

590
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,809
Did I kill or cheat others or set fire?

591
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:02,500
If you talk nonsense again, I'll have you arrested!

592
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:07,759
Go ahead. I can be here every day and watch you.

593
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,810
Sis, I'm wrong.

594
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,970
Can you save my face?

595
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,200
Can we have a serious talk?

596
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,210
Here's a truce for a minute.

597
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,420
Well, are you still in touch with Ye Jiahui?

598
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,839
Why did you suddenly ask that?

599
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,249
It's my duty to care about the follow-up of the case.

600
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:34,599
Fine.

601
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,900
I'm fine. Rest assured.

602
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,189
But I have to warn you.

603
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:41,540
You, who lives with other girls, still need to pay attention to the security of your house.

604
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,559
Tomorrow, I'll have someone check out my house, including every room and every corner.

605
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:46,519
Is that fine?

606
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,780
You have a good sense of precaution.

607
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,840
It's because you're a good teacher.

608
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,200
Anyway, thanks for your food.

609
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,909
I have to work now.

610
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,559
Got it. I'm leaving now.

611
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:03,730
- Bye.
- Bye.

612
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,430
Wait a minute.

613
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,429
It's been washed.

614
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,600
Don't buy new lunchboxes anymore.

615
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,460
Yes, Sir.

616
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,910
I'm off then.

617
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,360
Bye.

618
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:52,130
Brother, you look so happy.

619
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,470
You're sensible.

620
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:58,959
Brother Qian, I saw a few interns on 58.com and talked with them.

621
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,740
They're all excellent.

622
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,850
In particular, this one, Cheng Weizi.

623
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:05,080
She's outstanding in all aspects.

624
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,739
All right. Then arrange a video interview.

625
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:09,900
I'll definitely get the job done.

626
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,919
- Have you read the program outline?
- Yes.

627
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:16,189
What do you think?

628
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,899
Do you have any confidence in tomorrow's program?

629
00:41:18,899 --> 00:41:20,090
Yes.

630
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,910
Definitely.

631
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,370
Come here.

632
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,389
What's up?

633
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:28,759
Just now, Sister Qiao asked me for the program outline.

634
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,119
I gave it to her.

635
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,089
I have to warn you.

636
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:33,230
She didn't look happy.

637
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,020
All right.

638
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,710
I know what to do.

639
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,610
Wow.

640
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,090
- Good morning, Sister Qiao.
- Good morning, Sister Qiao.

641
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,020
Kaiyi, go in and have a word with me.

642
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,570
Okay.

643
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,030
Don't worry, Brother. We're all confident.

644
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,100
Focus on writing your articles.

645
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,600
Come in.

646
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,900
My Gosh!

647
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,050
Sister, you need to control your expressions.

648
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,190
You're prone to wrinkles.

649
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,430
I'm not as relaxed as you are.

650
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,670
Do you know what you're doing?

651
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,599
I know you care about me.

652
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,369
But what's done is done.

653
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:28,980
Then let's do it.

654
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,430
Let's do the best we can tomorrow.

655
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,420
Do you know what's this behavior?

656
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,180
Competing.

657
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,120
Why do you have to compete with Wang Zhuo?

658
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,770
Did Director Pan say there would definitely be a personnel change?

659
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,099
Even if it's true, Director Fei and I will help you.

660
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:51,180
Sister, in your eyes, am I really that useless?

661
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,020
I didn't mean that.

662
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,759
Then don't worry.

663
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,049
I'm telling you, I have figured out a perfect plan.

664
00:42:58,049 --> 00:43:00,600
Fine, you're the smartest.

665
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:05,619
But you must know, if you lose, your team will be demoralized.

666
00:43:08,307 --> 00:43:10,247
Are you ready for it?

667
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:14,200
In this case, we had a meeting.

668
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,810
And we all agreed.

669
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:19,680
It's imperative for us to get the program done.

670
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,170
Tell me the truth.

671
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:26,610
Do you do this to protect He Dun?

672
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,480
Yes.

673
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,369
But if it were Dong, Qing, Li or you,

674
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:34,580
I would make the same decision.

675
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,810
