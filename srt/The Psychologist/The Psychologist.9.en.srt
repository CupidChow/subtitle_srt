18
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,990
Did I buy such a big thing?

19
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,440
Are you okay?

20
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,070
I think I just twisted my ankle.

21
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,379
Come to my place. I'll give you an acupuncture. You'll heal sooner.

22
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,059
It's okay. I guess it will get back to normal at night.

23
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:15,309
If you don't treat it in time, you'll have a swollen ankle by night.

24
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:17,009
It won't be better in two weeks.

25
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:19,180
Is it so serious?

26
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,270
Thanks.

27

Slowly.

28
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,030
Why is there such a big puddle on the ground?

29
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,390
It wasn't there a few minutes ago.

30
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,210
Tell me what's going on.

31
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,120
It seems that this wedding ceremony combining Chinese and Western elements

32
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,960
isn't such a good compromise like they expected.

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,240
The bride always wanted a Western-style wedding.

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,259
But Yuan's family just wouldn't agree.

35
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:45,630
Xiao Yuan didn't know what to do.

36
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,650
In desperation, he thought of a way which he thought would satisfy both sides, hence what you see now.

37
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,590
Did the groom discuss his plan with the bride in advance?

38
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,930
He did discuss it with her.

39
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,459
But that idiot gave her a "surprise" only at the night before the wedding.

40
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,870
So the couple has been quarreling since last night.

41
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,059
She remained silent when he went to her house to pick her up to the reception.

42
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:05,529
And now she's having a mental breakdown.

43
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:07,059
Xiao Yuan has a gift of the gab.

44
00:03:07,059 --> 00:03:08,670
I can never beat him in a debate.

45
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,910
So the bride must be unable to outspeak him.

46
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,959
Take your friend away in a while. I'll talk with the bride in private.

47
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,430
Okay.

48
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,600

00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,830
She still refuses to come out of the dressing room.

52
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,259
This is my friend He Dun, who is a psychological counselor.

I told all of them to go away.

Now I am the only one standing outside. Don't worry.

We women always have a tough life.

63
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,149
I have been in these boots the whole morning and my feet hurt like hell.

64
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,260
Your dress must be a lot to take, too.

65
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,759
I say, everything that happened this morning was such a mess.

66
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,230
Yet you've been the bigger person.

67

Men, you know what they're like.

69
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,110
Obviously, they are the ones who did the wrong thing.

70
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,899
How can they so confident and make it seem like we are the unreasonable ones?

71
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,720
Right?

72
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,129

How about this?

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,619
I've been standing by your door for so long that my feet are killing me.

83
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:19,969
Can I borrow a pair of slippers and just let me go in and talk to you for a second, okay?

84
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,770
I'm coming in.

85
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,060
Hello, Shasha.

86
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,310
Can I sit over there?

87
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,010
Thank you.

88
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,449
You drew these pictures? Can I open them and take a look?

89
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,420
This is well drawn.

90
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,340
I heard that you are an artist.

91
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,170
It's not that fancy.

92
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,830
I just draw some stuff to scrape a living.

93
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,920
What do you usually draw?

94
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,170
Some figure paintings and whatnot.

95
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,600
Sketches.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,639
Today is your wedding day. I see that you still brought pens and paper with you.

97
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,450
Do you want to draw today?

98
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,510
Yes, just draw casually.

99
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,700
Can I borrow them to draw something?

100
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,500
Thanks.

101
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,540
You know, we all have subconsciousness.

102
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,509
It's just that sometimes we don't know how to express it intuitively.

103
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,570
You see, what can you tell from my drawing?

104
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,410
Your drawing is too rough now.

105
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,050
I don't know what you want to express.

106
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,490
Then I will add one more thing.

107
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,070
How about now?

108
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,509
The circle is on top. The straight line represents the ground.

109
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:37,849
So the cycle above is the sun, which represents warmth.

110
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:39,890
You long for warmth.

111
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,510
Very good.

112
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,940
Maybe this is my underlying consciousness.

113
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,200
I project it in my drawing.

114
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,070
In psychology, there is this analysis called psychological projection drawing.

115
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,860
It's also called the House, Tree and Person test.

116
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,450
So, we will draw a house, trees, and a person or persons on a piece of paper.

117
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,679
And the psychoanalysts will analyze our subconsciousness and cognition through the drawing.

118
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:12,400
Shasha, I can understand why you've never shared your feelings with Xiao Yuan.

119
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,920
Maybe it's difficult for you to do so.

120
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,429
But we can try to tell him through this way of drawing.

121
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,580
Would you like to try?

122
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,570
What if he doesn't understand?

123
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,000
I am a psychological counselor.

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,600
My job is to help you guys better understand

125
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,070
what you want to say to each other.

126
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,689
What do you think? Did Shasha agree to come out?

127
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,030
Can I ask you a question?

128
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,350
Sure.

129
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,230
In the past when you quarreled with Shasha,

130
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,339
did she always shut herself in the room and draw paintings there?

131
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,760
Come on. Try it.

132
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,639
You don't need to paint well. Just draw whatever you want to draw.

133
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,640
This is painted by Shasha.

134
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,419
She placed the paper horizontally, which projects that subconsciously this person tends to play it safe in life.

135
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:17,249
House.

136
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:19,590
The first thing she drew was the house,

137
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,050
which shows that her family is her first priority.

138
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,760
Stable internal structure. So she has a strong sense of defense.

139
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,640
Double defense, means that she feels insecure.

140
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,790
But she still drew windows and a door.

141
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,150
So she has a desire to communicate with others.

142
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,009
Family conflicts are very serious and about to break out soon.

143
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:41,299
The door is locked, but the windows are still left open.

144
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:43,579
It means that she doesn't want to communicate with others,

145
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:46,180
but she hopes others can take the initiative to communicate with her.

146
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,671
So it seems that their conflicts came from

147
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:54,499
family relations which are represented by the house.

148
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,249
Look. This will be our master bedroom.

149
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:02,100
It has a bay window which you like.

150
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,710
Let's put a big-screen TV here.

151
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,080
Eighty-five inches!

152
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,749
When we turn off the light at night, it'll look like a movie theater.

153
00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:15,420
How cool is that?

154
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,130
What did I do wrong?

155
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,030
Cheers, baby.

156
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,490
Come on.

157
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,980
I think we need to buy a dishwasher.

158
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,589
This way you won't beat me up because I don't do the dishes.

159
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:54,280
Right?

160
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,720
Kang Ziyuan.

161
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,890
Have you ever considered what I want?

00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,740
Shasha.

163
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,960
People normally project their self-awareness

164
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,549
and interpersonal interactive mode in their drawings.

165
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:12,400
Let's look at these figures now.

166
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,550
This is Shasha's self-portrait. Can you see that?

167
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,590
She drew her mouth as a line.

168
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,089
So subconsciously, there are many things in her heart

169
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:22,940
but she doesn't know how to express them.

170
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,079
And Mr. Kang.

171
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,770
This is you. You are standing opposite her.

172
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,819
So you two care about each other but you can't understand each other.

173
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:32,750
How about these people.

174
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,270
A woman and a few men.

175
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,149
This woman is standing close to Mr. Kang with her arms slightly open.

176
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:52,440
And she is also standing opposite Shasha.

177
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,840
Her attention focuses on Mr. Kang.

178
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,699
Did you find out that she used strong lines when she drew this woman?

179
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:05,549
It shows that Shasha has strong fluctuations of emotion towards her.

180
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:07,050
Her arms are slightly open.

181
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,190
So in Shasha's opinion, this woman is trying to influence Mr. Kang.

182
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,780
The rest are, without exception, without ears.

183
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,150
So listening is absent.

184
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,069
I think what Shasha wants to say is in this drawing.

185
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:32,149
She already relieved her feelings with this drawing as a medium.

186
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,929
Godmother. I have an urgent matter which needs your help.

187
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,230
Come on!

188
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,440
I mean, what is that?

189
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,449
I know. I'll talk to Xiao Yuan when we go back.

190
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:01,849
You've been working hard for the wedding, but it didn't work out as you wanted.

191
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:04,720
You just want this wedding to be lively and festive.

192
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,839
Kaiyi. That's exactly what I mean!

193
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,630
I worked hard for the wedding wholeheartedly. Why did I become the bad guy here?

194
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,479
Godmother, don't worry. I know you must feel hurt.

195
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:15,570
Thank God you still remember that I am your godmother.

196
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,860
Me and Xiao Yuan have been friends since childhood.

197
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,499
You always made dumplings for me when I was young.

198
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:25,529
And you remember the dumplings. You are a cute boy.

199
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:28,620
Dad, sorry.

200
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,210
We'll be a family from now on.

201
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,060
So relax.

202
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,130
I know my daughter's temper well.

203
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,859
I was busy at work so I didn't have much time to accompany her when she was young.

204
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,690
For that I always felt I owed her.

205
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,000
So I never disciplined her

206
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,320
no matter what she did wrong.

207
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,250
So she is spoiled.

208
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,139
I hope you can tolerate that.

209
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:05,149
It's not Shasha's fault. It is my fault.

210
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:07,230
I really love Shasha.

211
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,840
But I don't know what I can do to make her believe it.

212
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,009
Godmother, thirty years have passed since then.

213
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:17,690
You still love to take care of everything yourself.

214
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,399
Sometimes you want to have everything under your control.

215
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,590
I'm old now.

216
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,109
This is the last job I can do for him before he gets married, yet I blew it.

217
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:30,059
When the wedding is over, you should go out to travel when you have time.

218
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:34,399
The young couple is having their honeymoon trip. It's not decent for me to tag along.

219
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,589
Godmother. You are very open-minded.

220
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:39,099
So you'll understand that sometimes you should just let go.

221
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:42,829
Let go? But I'm the only one who will take care of things for them!

222
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:44,380
Yuan.

223
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,030
Remember.

224
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:52,659
No matter what family conflict you two will have in the future, you must communicate.

225
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,440
Don't just keep them to yourselves.

226
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,710
Shasha is a little spoiled.

227
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,080
But she is not an unreasonable girl.

228
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,750
Dad, trust me.

229
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,800
I promise you that such a situation won't happen again.

230
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,120
And I will also handle the trouble today well.

231
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,400
I won't let Shasha suffer such a grievance again.

232
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,330
They are both pushing their thirties. They have to learn to take care of themselves.

233
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,100
They can't depend on you for everything.

234
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,379
If they never learn how to deal with their own problems,

235
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,919
maybe they'll have to count on you on how to raise their children.

236
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,590
If I don't take care of things for them, do you want me to just watch them lead a miserable life?

237
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,300
Parents will always worry about their children.

238
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,380
If your dad were still alive, he would have found a wife for you.

239
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,860
Kaiyi.

240
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,910
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

241
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,499
It's okay. I understand.

242
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,699
Godmother. I know you've been doing a lot for him.

243
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:53,640
You've been taking care of everything for Xiao Yuan.

244
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,710
Now he is leaving you to start his own family,

245
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,110
it's only natural that you can't trust him on his own at first.

246
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,719
But then again, Xiao Yuan has to grow up so that he will be able to take care of you when you get older.

247
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,350
Right?

248
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,080
Go.

249
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,000
Talk with her. You don't need to swear to me.

250
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,230
After all, it'll be the two of you to spend your lives together.

251
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,050
Shasha.

252
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,840
It's me.

253
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,350
How are you feeling? Tired?

254
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,150
I always asked you if you felt happy.

255
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,230
But I didn't think of it until today that

256
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,900
I should have paid more attention to your feelings.

257
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:17,610
I always thought I could make you happy

258
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,010
as long as I arranged everything properly for you.

259
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,129
Who are you getting married with? Me or your mom?

260
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:25,690
Of course, it's you and me.

261
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,660
But my mom is just doing what's good for us.

262
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,949
- And my mom said—
- Your mom said, your mom said…

263
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:34,520
You listen to your mom every time. Why can't you listen to me for once?

264
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,829
I always felt this nasty wedding was the only source of your stress.

265
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,999
I always thought we could go through the crisis as long as it was over.

266
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:44,920
Higher, higher.

267
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,420
Higher.

268
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,800
Are you all right, baby?

269
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,880
I am not all right!

270
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,380
- Don't you know that I'm afraid of water?
- Sorry.

271
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,530
Don't touch me!

272
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,350
I thought wedding was just a formality. It was held for our parents' sake.

273
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,029
Let's put a big-screen TV here. Eighty-five inches!

274
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:07,640
I was wrong.

275
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,760
I was wrong from the beginning.

276
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,870
I thought I had been seeing things from your perspective.

277
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,269
I thought what I did had been considering your feelings.

278
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:21,210
But I really didn't expect that I would be such a lousy spouse.

279
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,459
Sorry. I'm sorry, Shasha.

280
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:27,630
I thought I was fully prepared to start a family with you.

281
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,490
But I just understand today what family means.

282
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,470
What family means…

283
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,759
I can feel that Xiao Yuan and his mom's ways to

284
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:44,429
deal with your wedding have been making you very upset and distressed.

285
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:48,779
And these emotions stop you from seeing things from Xiao Yuan and his mom's perspectives.

286
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:53,699
But I believe that you love Xiao Yuan since you've been together so long.

287
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,750
Shasha, can you give it a try?

288
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,330
Imagine you are him.

289
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,800
What does Xiao Yuan feel at this moment?

290
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,229
Does he, just like you, feel that no one understands what he's going through?

291
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:09,059
His mom who raised him and loves him is working hard for a perfect wedding.

292
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,350
But his wife can't appreciate it.

293
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,650
What would that make you feel if it were you?

294
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,309
All right. Let it go since you are reflecting on yourself.

295
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:46,140
But don't bully me again.

296
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,460
When I tell you what I'm thinking, you need to pay attention.

297
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,399
And you're so eloquent. You always have the final word!

298
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:58,989
I always want to prove I am right. I am sorry.

299
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,430
I will never try to outspeak you.

300
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,060
I will change.

301
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,110
Don't cry.

302
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,000
I already have swollen eyes.

303
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,040
You can't have swollen eyes, too.

304
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,370
I miss you.

305
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,019
Sorry, Xiao Yuan. I'm too stubborn.

306
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:36,220
I should have appreciated you and your mother's efforts.

307
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,620
It's okay.

308
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,800
They're out.

309
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,300
They came out.

310
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,510
Miss He.

311
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,560
Thank you so much.

312
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,139
You actually found a way to let Xiao Yuan stop trying to resort to reasoning.

313
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:21,290
Actually, I can't take all the credit.

314
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,050
It's all right. You guys should go refresh yourselves. I'm still waiting for your reception.

315
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,009
Miss He. Your T-shirt is wet.

316
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:35,009
There is a spare dress in my dressing room. Do you want to get changed?

317
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:35,989
It's okay. No need for the trouble.

318
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:38,449
At least go to blow it dry. It's uncomfortable to wear a wet T-shirt.

319
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:40,300
Yeah, go to blow it dry.

320
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,680
Or go get changed.

321
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,560
Yes, Miss He.

322
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,030
Go.

323
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,300
I'll do it myself.

324
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,120
Sure.

325
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,690
- Let's go.
- Let's go to the reception now.

326
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,229
Relatives and friends are waiting for us. Okay.

327
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,810
[We sincerely invite Fang Yuxuan and Liu Chengrong to our wedding.]

328
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,030
[9:51 am]

329
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,999
Very good. No reception, and no phone.

330
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:02,159
- Throw it to me Shasha!
- To the middle.

331
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,170
One…

332
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,230
Okay!

333
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,320
The bouquet in the bride's hands is a symbol of happiness and love.

334
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,359
Today Shasha tossed the bouquet to her best girlfriend.

335
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,650
Let us wish her find the love of her life…

336
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,330
Hello, everyone. I'm Shasha's best friend.

337
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,830
My name is Fang Yuxuan.

338
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,739
I have always believed that love is not obtained by the blessing of others.

339
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:46,110
You have to fight for it yourself.

340
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:56,210
Qian Kaiyi, did you hear it?

341
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:02,499
Today I want to take up the courage to say something to you.

342
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:11,170
I kept thinking of the days we worked together after I left the radio station.

343
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,860
- You taught me carefully
- What is she doing?

344
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,450
- I don't know.
- how to do radio shows.

345
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,509
You took care of me when I was sick.

346
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:24,640
I remember everything about how you took care of me.

347
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,210
Fang Yuxuan! What nonsense are you talking about?

348
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,000
I know you don't want to admit these.

349
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,980
But it's all right.

350
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,179
Actually, I thought I had moved on before I came here.

351
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:40,780
But when I saw you today, I realized that

352
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,000
I still love you.

353
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:51,659
Qian Kaiyi, don't leave! Why are you avoiding me?

354
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,390
You don't have the guts to admit that you still love me?

355
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,590
Or did you fall in love with He Dun?

356
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,779
Why her? You only worked together for a few days!

357
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:09,909
You forgot what I did for you. I made you a lunchbox every day.

358
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,480
- I need to go over.
L - I would wait for you to get off work, even in the rain!

359
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,310
I would say up late to keep you company. You've forgotten everything?

360
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:17,179
Yuxuan. What are you doing?

361
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,450
What is gone is gone. Why would you bring it up?

362
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,400
Kaiyi.

363
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,350
Would you accept me again

364
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,760
if I can put my head down to ask you?

365
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,189
Today is Shasha and Xiao Yuan's wedding day. Can you stop being a drama queen?

366
00:25:35,189 --> 00:25:36,269
I'm not being a drama queen.

367
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:40,719
I just want to ask you if we can get back together.

368
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:46,779
Yuxuan. Maybe you can talk with Kaiyi in private later.

369
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,719
Shasha's wedding is not over yet.

370
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,779
That's right.

371
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:53,579
Yes, Yuxuan. Today is Shasha's wedding day.

372
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:55,179
It's not appropriate for you to bring this up now.

373
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,350
Yes.

374
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,300
Auntie. I don't think so.

375
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,019
Shasha got drunk and complained to me last night that Xiao Yuan is a mommy's boy.

376
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,459
She also said you're being nosy.

377
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:05,729
What are you talking about?

378
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:07,560
I-I didn't think so.

379
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,650
Why would you make a fuss if you don't think so?

380
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,249
Auntie, can you really trust your daughter to marry into such a family?

381
00:26:14,249 --> 00:26:16,280
- You…
- Hey! Watch your mouth!

382
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,729
What about it? I'm just being honest.

383
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,380
You asked me if I can accept you, right?

384
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,939
No, I won't. So can you stop making a scene?

385
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:26,369
Why?

386
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:28,980
Shasha told me that you don't have a girlfriend now.

387
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,960
He has.

388
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,489
♫  We are destined to break through a mental wall  ♫

389
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:42,659
Calmness, objectiveness, keenness, and salvation.

390
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,070
This is the mission of a psychological counselor.

391
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,579
Be clear about what to love or hate and the belief of tit-for-tat.

392
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,510
This is me. He Dun.

393
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,709
♫  They will build up into roads that enable me to climb high and see far  ♫

394
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:57,410

398
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:13,790
♫  Tough it out, that's what I'm all about  ♫

399
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,160
Qian Kaiyi, tell everyone.

400
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,410
This is my girlfriend, He Dun.

401
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,940
- Romantic relationship is about first come, first serve.
- He Dun. Don't listen to her bullsh*t.

402
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,579
But don't you already have a boyfriend?

403
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:36,830
What do you mean that you came first in this relationship?

404
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,510
When did I have a boyfriend?

405
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:43,359
Shasha, you know how much I've done for Kaiyi, right?

406
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,450
When did you say that?

407
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,970
[Liu Chengrong]

408
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,530
It was from your boyfriend, right?

409
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,939
I'm turning off my phone. How could you know it's from my boyfriend?

410
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,459
[Liu Chengrong]
Shasha.

411
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:08,190
Shasha's cell phone is kept by her mother.

412
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,479
When your boyfriend can't reach you, he'll definitely call Shasha.

413
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:14,959
Since someone tries to call me, it's natural he wants to call Shasha later.

414
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,659
There are two names on your wedding invitation.

415
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:19,880
It's you and your boyfriend.
[We sincerely invite Fang Yuxuan and Liu Chengrong to our wedding.]

416
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,559
But your boyfriend never received his invitation.

417
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,950
I think he must find it very strange now

418
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,080
why he, as your boyfriend, isn't invited to

419
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,470
your best friend's wedding.

420
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,000
Have you decided?

421
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,200
Do you want someone who loves you to know what you just did?

422
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,289
Or have you decided to stop making trouble and leave now?

423
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:42,190
Just go.

424
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,759
Let's go. Don't make a scene here.

425
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:46,980
Come on.

426
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,890
Let's go. Stop making trouble here.

427
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,441
You are nuts!

428
00:28:50,441 --> 00:28:52,010
Hurry up, let's go.

429
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,280
Let her go.

430
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,080
Hello, everyone.

431
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,849
Kaiyi and I are very happy today to be invited to this wedding.

432
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:13,920
I think this is a wedding that'll make people remember for the rest of their lives.

433
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,359
From the unique decoration you can tell that

434
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:20,050
the newly-wed couple on stage is from families

435
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,369
of two different backgrounds.

436
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:26,599
Even their temperaments and tempers can be totally different.

437
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:30,400
But they are here today because of love.

438
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,889
Just now we all knew that Shasha and Xiao Yuan had a little fight.

439
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:38,859
I think a lot of couples have this kind of fight in their lives.

440
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:42,300
They just left their parents' families which they had lived for more than twenty years

441
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,820
and are about to start their new small family.

442
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:51,579
I think this is a new change for their family members.

443
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:53,420
And it's also an upgrade.

444
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,989
There may be quarrels, misunderstandings, and grievances in the process.

445
00:29:57,989 --> 00:30:00,950
But I believe that all the fights are also efforts

446
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,699
the two families make for their better life in the future.

447
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:09,259
It also shows how Shasha and Xiao Yuan want to live happily together forever.

448
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:12,180
I think love makes people grow.

449
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:17,779
This experience today will make Shasha and Xiao Yuan become better persons.

450
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,089
Congratulations to you two, too.

451
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:24,310
You didn't give up a better life for you two

452
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,479
because of this bumpy ride which was born of love.

453
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:30,350
Finally, let us all wish this couple

454
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,539
a happy life and a lot of love!

455
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:37,130
Well said!

456
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,640
Okay. Now thank you again for your coming.

457
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,209
The bride and the groom, give us a romantic kiss, will you?

458
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,830
What do you say, guys?

459
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,950
Sure!

460
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,430
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

461
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:58,130
♫  I see your eyes as bright as a star
 ♫

462
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:07,310
♫  They warm my smile and listen to my true voice  ♫

463
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:12,450
♫  Giving me the gentlest response  ♫

464
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,470
♫  I see the sudden arrival  ♫

465
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,759
He Dun, I can explain. There's nothing going on between us.

466
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:22,689
You don't need to explain anything to me. We are just colleagues.

467
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:25,330
But I hope you can manage your private life well next time.

468
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,060
Don't let your ex-girlfriend ruin other people's life.

469
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,559
- Hello?
- Is it He Dun?

470
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,849
I am the security of your residential complex. Ms. Zhao just accidentally fell and got hurt.

471
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:39,879
- You need to come home. 
- My mother fell?

472
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:42,250
W-what happened?

473
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,010
I knew it.

474
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,310
This looks like it.

475
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,400
Yes.

476
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,499
- Mom.
- Dun Dun.

477
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,160
Thank you.

478
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,229
What happened? You fell?

479
00:32:02,229 --> 00:32:05,150
Yes, I fell again.

480
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,189
- Let me see.
- It's okay.

481
00:32:07,189 --> 00:32:09,820
- Does it hurt?
- No.

482
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,880
Wait here. I'll get you an ice pack.

483
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,760
Jun Jun.

484
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,539
How could you run so fast in high heels?

485
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:18,760
Jun Jun.

486
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,110
Why are you wearing a dress?

487
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,430
So beautiful.

488
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,230
That hurts.

489
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,560
Relax. It doesn't hurt.

490
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,680
I will finish it soon.

491
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,000
Relax. I will acupuncture you at four acupuncture points.

492
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,590
Four?

493
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,560
It won't hurt at all.

494
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,250
Jiexi.
(T/N: alleviates pain)

495
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,260
Sanyinjiao.
(T/N: to strengthen the spleen restoring balance to the Yin and to the blood)

496
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,880
Taixi.
(T/N: activated cognitive-related brain areas)

497
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,470
Zhaohai.
(T/N: Calms the spirit)

498
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,160
It doesn't hurt, right?

499
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,659
It's okay. It doesn't hurt much.

500
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:10,560
I just feel a little sore and swelling.

501
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,730
I'll send you a few matters needing attention.

502
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,880
Okay.

503
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,760
Thank you so much. I'll treat you to dinner another day.

504
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,050
Don't "another day". Just today.

505
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,400
Call He Dun to have dinner together.

506
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,279
You don't try to hide it at all. I know your target is her.

507
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:31,999
But not today. She went to a wedding.

508
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,880
Why didn't you tell me when you pulled out the needles?

509
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,370
It's easier when you put your guard down.

510
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,450
What are you looking at? You look so serious.

511
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:55,090
This woman embarrassed He Dun at someone else's wedding.

512
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:58,299
So He Dun went to the wedding as Qian Kaiyi's plus one?

513
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,210
You are pretty smart.

514
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,289
I'll give you a friendly reminder to show my gratitude.

515
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,810
You can't underestimate Qian Kaiyi.

516
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,819
Suddenly the power went out when I was doing chores.

517
00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:26,000
I got scared so I hurried to the property office to ask what was going on.

518
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,190
I fell on my way there because I was in a hurry.

519
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:33,179
Fortunately this Mr. Liu helped me and got me here to move my ankle.

520
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,980
- I feel much better.
- Thank you, Mr. Liu.

521
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,019
- It's okay. Auntie Zhao, have some water.
- Okay, thanks.

522
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:40,069
Auntie Zhao is always very kind to us. I remember your address.

523
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:41,820
Rest assured. I used to be an armed policeman.

524
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,820
I'll be there in a few minutes if anything happens.

525
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,200
You can call me a Super Boy.

526
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,689
Thank you. Let's share each other's WeChat.

527
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:50,599
Just contact me directly if you have anything that needs help.

528
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:53,959
Okay, thanks. Auntie Zhao, good night. I need to go back on patrol.

529
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,320
- Thanks.
- Okay.

530
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,220
Let's talk later.

531
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,040
Who is this?

532
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,169
I have introduced you two. I forgot. Qian Kaiyi, my colleague.

533
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:04,559
Auntie Zhao. My name is Qian Kaiyi.

534
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:06,801
- You can call me Xiao Qian if you like.
- Xiao Qian.

535
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:09,139
How do you feel now? Do you want to go to the hospital?

536
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:12,550
No need. It's a minor sprain. It's okay.

537
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:16,069
He called both of you back over a little injury of mine.

538
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:19,759
- You guys are busy. Sorry that you had to come back for me.
- It's nothing.

539
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:22,319
I know treating illnesses and saving people can be a lot to take. I know.

540
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:25,429
Mom. Your health always comes first.

541
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:27,660
Besides, he's not a psychological counselor.

542
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,390
He is a host of the radio station.

543
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:33,239
What? He's a host?

544
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,840
how do you feel now?

545
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,749
It doesn't seem to hurt that much. Thank you, Jiahui.

546
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:51,209
Don't mention it. You can come to me anytime if you have any problems.

547
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:54,189
I will. Yes, by all means.

548
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,509
Okay, it's getting late. I have to go.

549
00:35:57,509 --> 00:35:59,660
Let me walk you home.

550
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,670
- Slowly, Mom.
- Okay.

551
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,070
- Be careful.
- Young man, come in. Come on in.

552
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,910
This is my apartment.

553
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:08,790
- Be careful, Auntie Zhao.
- Okay.

554
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,949
- Who is he?
- My friend.

555
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:12,810
- What kind of friend?
- Just a friend.

556
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,080
Great!

557
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,710
Come on, young man.

558
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,390
You might want to sit down.

559
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,320
Let me tell you…

560
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,739
Let him check the switch first.

561
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:23,300
- Okay.
- The switch is here.

562
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,319
By the switchboard.

563
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:25,820
You can't just ask him to check it alone. He might get electrocuted.

564
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,470
- I got it, Mom!
- Be careful. Be careful.

565
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,350
Don't worry, Auntie.

566
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,600
- Okay, all right.
- Hold the flashlight.

567
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,050
- Good.
- Don't fall again.

568
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,649
- You need to be careful, too.
- I'll give...

569
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,190
You...

570
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,450
Do you know what you're doing?

571
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,399
Electricity tripped by short circuit. Not a big problem.

572
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:45,460
But I need to find out which fuse blew out.

573
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,520
What should we do? So you can't fix it today?

574
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
I didn't say that.

575
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,940
Come on. Give me a hand.

576
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,330
See it?

577
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,599
- Are you ready?
- Ready for what?

578
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,349
- It's fixed, Mom.
- So soon?

579
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,080
You're good.

580
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,910
Auntie, it's fixed. It's a minor problem.

581
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,670
That's amazing. Look at you.

582
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,049
You fixed it so soon. Take a seat.

583
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:39,470
Sit down.

584
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,300
Look.

585
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,859
Dun Dun, I like a young man like him. You know.

586
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:47,280
A talented and handsome man.

587
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,159
The important thing is, he's a good amateur electrician.

588
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:52,819
This kind of person is reliable. Get it?

589
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:54,000
Mom, it's enough.

590
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,330
- You know what I mean?
- I do. You can stop now. Enough.

591
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,630
You need to figure it out.

592
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,659
Auntie Zhao. I'll leave you a maintenance hot line number.

593
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:04,569
Sure. Qian Kaiyi.

594
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:05,669
That's me.

595
00:38:05,669 --> 00:38:07,750
- It is your number? Your name is Qian Kaiyi.
- Right.

596
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,440
This is great.

597
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,870
Just call me when you have any trouble at home.

598
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,150
I'll come over and fix it for you anytime.

599
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,800
Okay. Okay.

600
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,270
It's not a problem for me. Auntie Zhao, I know my way around the house.

601
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,560
My dad taught me everything when I was a boy.

602
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,299
I'm especially good at making a toy windmill with electric welding.

603
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:25,499
Did you hear that, Dun Dun?

604
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:29,159
Hey. Don't give us such a deadpan expression.

605
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:31,909
Do you know what electric welding is? It's quite amazing.

606
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:35,000
- Few young men nowadays have this skillset.
- Making windmills with electric welding?

607
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,180
What kind of skillset is this?

608
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,220
Mom, if the switch trips again, just call me.

609
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,191
- Don't bother other people, okay?
- I won't call you.

610
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:46,879
Why would I call you since I have his phone number now?

611
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:51,040
Can you be like Auntie Mei next door?

612
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,560
Enjoy your retirement life. You think you are still young? You have a daughter to rely on.

613
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,199
I am young. I am tell you, I will always stay young.

614
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:01,989
I have no right to get old as long as my daughter is not married.

615
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:04,320
I'm truly happy to meet you today.

616
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,600
Because Dun Dun has never brought her boyfriend home.

617
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,450
Let me tell you, do you think mom is getting old since I accidentally fell?

618
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,289
Mom actually… Let me put it this way,

619
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:17,969
the square dance team asked me to join them but I said no!

620
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:21,000
- Auntie Zhao.
- If I were to go, I would become the top dancer.

621
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,840
Look at your high spirit!

622
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,080
Look at the graceful temperament.

623
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,660
You look like a dance teacher to me.

624
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,150
You're flattering me.

625
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,220
I am not a dance professional.

626
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,360
I dance as a hobby.

627
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,290
Actually, I was a Chinese teacher.

628
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,269
Mom. Look at that perfect body shape.

629
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:40,119
You're the queen of square dance.

630
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:42,730
No problem at all! You are a dance artist. Come on, sit down.

631
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,840
I won't sit down.

632
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,249
She's clearly mocking me. I'm not bragging myself.

633
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:49,081
Qian, they're lucky that I didn't join them.

634
00:39:49,081 --> 00:39:52,290
- If I go, I would steal their thunder.
- All of them.

635
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,800
- But I really…
-Mom, you can sit down now.

636
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,570
- And I taught her mandarin.
- Yes, right.

637
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,050
Although I have an accent myself.

638
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,559
It's okay. Mom, are you going to sleep?

639
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:02,609
Yan…

640
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:05,339
- Mr. Qian, what's your name again?
- Qian Kaiyi.

641
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:08,399
Which school were you in? You look so familiar.

642
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:10,979
Did you two go to the same school?

643
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:12,080
I…

644
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,339
Qian Kaiyi. Don't you have something to attend to tomorrow? You need to go home early.

645
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:17,020
No, I don't have anything to do tomorrow.

646
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,049
Mom, he has something to do tomorrow.

647
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:21,120
Auntie Zhao, I'm totally available tomorrow. Auntie, I really don't have…

648
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,339
- Qian Kaiyi!
- I'm free.

649
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:26,620
You need to go to work tomorrow?

650
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,010
Maybe I need to go to work.

651
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,170
I see. Sure. Listen to the girl.

652
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,660
- Mom, he has to go.
- I'll listen to you, Auntie Zhao.

653
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,380
Auntie Zhao, good night.

654
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,000
Listen to Dun Dun.

655
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,539
Just call me if you need to fix something. I'll come to fix it for you anytime.

656
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,630
- Certainly.
- I will fix everything for you!

657
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,800
Auntie Zhao, I'll come to visit you next time.

658
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,160
Okay.

659
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,900
Yes!

660
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,050
Qian Kaiyi,.

661
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:00,299
Qian Kaiyi! You grabbed my hand and wouldn't let go!

662
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:02,999
It's all your saliva on my palm! Disgusting!

663
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:06,040
You're thin, but you are pretty strong.

664
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,000
Because you refused to go.

665
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,040
You really want me to go?

666
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,049
What else do you want to do? Chat with my mom till dawn?

667
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:16,289
I'm okay with that. But it's so late now. She might not want to continue to chat.

668
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:19,520
Even if she wants to chat, you don't have a part in it, okay? Just go home.

669
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,969
Not necessarily. You saw how much she likes me.

670
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:23,870
So how can I let her down?

671
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,570
My mom is not the only one who likes you, right?

672
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,660
He Dun, what do you mean?

673
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,430
Wait.

674
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,890
Are you still angry about what happened at the wedding?

675
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:44,000
You really got mad because of me?

676
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:48,559
That's right! I am angry.

677
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:50,630
I must formally clear my name.

678
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,730
There's nothing going on between Fang Yuxuan and me.

679
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,549
Zero! You have to believe me.

680
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:59,559
I didn't have time to refute her because you suddenly said that you were my girlfriend.

681
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,450
Wait a moment.

682
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,739
I'm not your girlfriend.

683
00:42:02,739 --> 00:42:05,579
I just said I was your girlfriend because there was no other way.

684
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:07,620
Do you understand?

685
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,190
I know.

686
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:12,000
You did it to save Xiao Yuan and Shasha's wedding.

687
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,280
I'm glad you understand.

688
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,159
Anyway, Qian Kaiyi, let me tell you, this matter is over.

689
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,180
So don't mention it ever again.

690
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,170
There's nothing going on between you and me. Am I clear?

691
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,760
But you were jealous for me just now.

692
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,649
- When was I jealous?
- You just said you were angry.

693
00:42:23,649 --> 00:42:26,009
- I was angry!
- You were angry because you were jealous.

694
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:27,810
Fine. The elevator is here. Just go!

695
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,950
Don't be angry with me.

696
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:34,160
I'm not angry anymore. I'm not jealous anymore, okay.

697
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,860
Your attitude is not sincere.

698
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,709
What kind of attitude do you want? You…

699
00:42:38,709 --> 00:42:40,700
I'll go find someone who's support me.

700
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,099
Bro, you beat me. I'm not angry and I'm not jealous. Just go home, okay?

701
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:45,579
- Then I'll take it seriously.
- Bye-Bye.

702
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:47,820
Don't be mad at me. Bye-Bye.

703
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,810
So you really are not angry?

704
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,260
Don't be angry. I'm really going.

705
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,370
What kind of person did I meet?

706
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,460
Go away!

707
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,490
Welcome back.

708
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:24,710
This is Haiyang Live Show I am your host Haiyang.

709
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,840
An audience member Xiaoyu sent a message.

710
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,759
He said me and my girl used to fight

711
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:34,870
and we broke up once.

712
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:40,850
But thank God that we met again later.

713
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,769
If there is one regret in my life,

714
00:43:42,769 --> 00:43:47,800
I think it would be I met her too late.

715
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,080
This message gives me a lot to think about.

716
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,129
Maybe life is a journey

717
00:43:56,129 --> 00:44:00,310
full of infinite possibilities and the unknown.

718
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:04,600
We can't be sure where fate will take us.

719
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,900
We can't figure out which one will come first, either.

720
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,910
Tomorrow? Or unexpected accidents?

721
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,080
Who will come into your life at the next stop

722
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,190
and who will leave your life at this stop?

723
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,000
But we still have to believe that

724
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,819
although we are humble, we still have infinite possibilities granted by time.

725
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:25,149
We will definitely have some unexpected beauty and good luck in our lives.

726
00:44:25,149 --> 00:44:30,149
Xiaoyu also sent a picture of their love token, which is a golden music box.

727
00:44:30,149 --> 00:44:33,739
I hope your love can be like a music box.

728
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:39,039
Sweet sounds of love are conveyed through the vague music.

729
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,270
