18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,990
I also hope

19
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,970
you can spend more time with me.

20
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,780
Let's get along like this in the days to come.

21
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,670
Would it be nice?

22
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,230
You are a big girl. Don't cry.

23
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,700
The practice we did just now is called communication practice.

24
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,560
In fact, in your daily conflict, the most destructive thing

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,840
is not the problem itself, but the destructive way in which you are trying to communicate.

26
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,060
Back and forth with your blames, you've long forgotten what the problem is.

27
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,770
This is what you need to pay attention to in your daily life afterwards.

28
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,100
I just can't stop once I start talking.

29
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:07,133
Old Song, I'm sorry for a lot of things I did in the past.

30
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:13,600
In this stage of your marriage, the fear of losing each other paralyzes the relationship between you.

31
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,740
Actually, a rational, healthy family relation entails an independent space for each of you.

32
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,870
But I always can't control myself.

33
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,590
I keep thinking nonsense.

34
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:32,880
Now recall the time when you first started dating, did you also have the feelings of fear and anxiety?

35
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,420
I was young at that time.

36
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,260
I was also quite a looker.

37
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,740
I had a good job and got on with people well.

38
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,930
Back then, he was only too happy to take me as the apple of his eye.

39
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,680
So what was there to panic about?

40
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,290
Believe in the possibility of being independent from your partner

41
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,910
so that you'll have a clearer idea of the goal of your growth.

42
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,470
I believe you've already had an answer in your mind now.

43
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,210
Miss He,

44
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,010
I've figured it out.

45
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,783
You are right.

46
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:07,390
I can't always be dependent on him.

47
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,670
I must have my own life.

48
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,800
No, no. I don't want a divorce.

49
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,130
Did I say I'm going to divorce you?

50
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,130
Sister Tang. Sister Tang.

51
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,830
All right, Sister Tang. Don't pretend to be asleep.

52
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,120
We are not going to the counseling room today.

53
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,730
- Really?
- Yes.

54
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,720
Our hospital has introduced a batch of new apparatus for treating mental symptoms.

55
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,583
It has a similar effect to Valium.

56
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:13,050
I thought you hate going to the counseling room most, so I moved it here for you first.

57
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,890
This apparatus cost our hospital a hefty sum.

58
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,100
Then…

59
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:23,170
Then I don't have to go to the counseling room from now on?

60
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,171
Right. You can be treated in the room.

61
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:27,710
But you still have to take the medicine.

62
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,883
Here, Sister Tang.

63
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,590
Let's try the apparatus.

64
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,560
Sister Tang, if we use this, we don't have to go to the counseling room later on.

65
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,273
Here.

66
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:11,063
Try it.

68
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,340
This is the switch.

69
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,580
And you can press a few times to adjust the duration.

70
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,270
The one below is for the modes of massage.

71
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,053
You can adjust it to whatever massage mode you want.

72
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,250
Let me know anytime if it makes you feel uncomfortable.

73

Let go of me. I'm not doing it.

Let go of me. I'm not doing it.

77

Put up with it, or I'll have to give you an injection and it'll give you pain.

78

Tell them I'm not doing this, OK?

81
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,630
Please.

82
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,213
Rest easy.

83
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:21,180
This is the best private hospital I can find for you.

84
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,250
I don't want to do it.

85
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,120
I don't want to do it.

86

Be good.

After this treatment, those unhappy things will slip your mind.

88
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,333
All right?

89
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,470
I'm not doing it! Let go of me! I'm not doing it…

90
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,960
You'll get better after this, all right?

91
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,600
I don't want it.

92
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,660
Jicheng, let go of your hold.

93
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,470
Can you let go of your hold?

94
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,000
- Go ahead.
- Let go of me.

95
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,330
Don't go.

96
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,400
Ye Jicheng, you are abusing your power.

97
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,310
The hospital said I don't need such treatment.

98
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,270
Please.

99
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,790
I'm not doing it!

100
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,230
What's wrong, Fu Tang?

101
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,180
Calm down, calm down. Calm down, calm down.

00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,170
Are you feeling any better?

106
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,933
It's all right.

107
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,063
I'm sorry.

108
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,580
I'm late.

109
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,540
I'll get you out of here now.

110
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,670
We've given the patient a shot of tranquilizer.

111
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,310
She'll be sleeping for a while.

112
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,840
How is the patient doing now?

113
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,250
According to the nurse who gave her the treatment today,

114
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,990
about five minutes into using the therapeutic apparatus, the patient began to have a stress reaction,

115
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,290
showing symptoms of convulsion and difficult breathing.

116
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,980
The nurse was in a panic back then, since the therapeutic apparatus has the effect of soothing emotions.

117
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,130
Such a problem shouldn't have occurred.

118
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:38,240
Before using this therapeutic apparatus, have you done a health assessment on Auntie Fu?

119
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,640
Yes, you reminded us repeatedly before.

120
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,440
We must take it seriously.

121
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,610
What's more, the patient was in a very stable condition overall.

122
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,910
We don't know why this happened.

123
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,750
Is Auntie Fu the only one who's had this symptom?

124
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,811
To be frank, after this incident happened today, I learned that

125
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:59,480
similar incidents actually happened a few days ago.

126
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,970
Just that the symptoms of headache and dizziness that other patients had

127
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,720
are their normal conditions, so we didn't pay much attention.

128
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,720
This was indeed negligence of duty on our part.

129
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,720
I hereby apologize to you on behalf of our staff.

130
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,650
No, no. I understand. It was not entirely your fault.

131
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,983
That's to say that whatsit therapeutic apparatus is out of order?

132
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:22,430
That's very likely.

133
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:27,080
We've already sent a complaint report to the apparatus provider and asked them to give us an explanation.

134
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:32,050
Before we find out the truth of this incident, we will not use the apparatus on other patients again.

135
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,550
What venal businessmen they are!

136
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,180
They've even messed with medical devices.

137
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,160
Could you show us the apparatus?

138
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,110
I'll go with you.

139
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,340
Here it is. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Device.

140
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,740
Also known as aRMS.

141
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,170
This is the manual.

142
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,310
Could such a tiny contraption do so much harm?

143
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,720
Is this a new device?

144
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,110
Yes, it's new.

145
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,230
We used another provider's before.

146
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,020
Some time ago, our sanatorium needed to purchase a batch of new devices.

147
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:12,770
They happened to be doing promotions and their devices have complete functions, so we ordered a batch of them.

148
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,290
Are such therapeutic apparatus used only in sanatoriums?

149
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,250
If approved, they could also be promoted in specialized and general hospitals.

150
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,900
Are you sure?

151
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:27,940
In principle, therapeutic apparatus of such specifications have a very high level of safety

152
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,230
with endorsement of the Psychological Society.

153
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,260
How could such a thing happen?

154
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,893
- Unless…
- Unless what?

155
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,010
That's not possible.

156
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,980
The Society couldn't have possibly approved such a substandard product.

157
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,340
This won't do. I must turn to someone for verification.

158
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,710
- Thanks.
- No problem.

159
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,350
Professor Ji is no longer with the Society.

160
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,210
Who are you going to turn to for verification?

161
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:54,371
Approval of such psychotherapy devices is supposed to be done by the EEG Technology Committee.

162
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:55,910
I know who to turn to.

163
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,243
- Who?
- Who?

164
00:13:58,243 --> 00:13:59,890
You know this person as well.

165
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,200
The new president Wen Liang.

166
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,980
What are you doing?

167
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,510
Get out of here. Mom.

168
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,820
Lili. Lili.

169
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,520
What are you doing in broad daylight?

170
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,020
Your daughter is here.

171
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,611
You are dressed to kill. You don't look like you are short of cash.

172
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:29,840
It seems you can pay the money back anyway today, right?

173
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,320
You choose to be a thug instead of a good man.

174
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,640
Does your mother know about this?

175
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,910
Who are you cursing?

176
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,860
Are you justified in owing money?

177
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,250
I tell you what, don't touch me!

178
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,620
I'm going to call the police. Don't you believe me?

179
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,653
Go ahead.

180
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:43,040
This girl is so pretty when she gets angry.

181
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,980
My cup of tea.

182
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,620
It is me who owes you money. It has nothing to do with my daughter.

183
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,910
You guys mustn't touch my daughter!

184
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,690
What are you talking about?

185
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,800
Can you pay it back?

186
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,810
Why didn't I see you show such spunk just now?

187
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,343
Why?

188
00:14:56,343 --> 00:14:57,990
Are you emboldened by your daughter's presence?

189
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,410
I tell you what, she's your senior after all.

190
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,160
Haven't your mother taught you to respect the old and care for the young?

191
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,640
I'm going to call the police if you come any closer. Don't you believe me?

192
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,073
Go ahead.

193
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,100
Feel free to do so. Are you stupid or something?

194
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,000
Your mother is the debtor who owes me money and I'm the creditor who comes to collect my debt.

195
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,890
If you have no money, you should kneel down to beg me.

196
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,110
Shouldn't this be the attitude of paying back a debt?

197
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,330
For the sake of your pretty face, I can give you a grace period of a few days.

198
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,080
Don't be so unappreciative.

199
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,700
Even ready to call the police?

200
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,690
I tell you what, it's not good for anyone if you piss us off.

201
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,670
Figure it out yourself.

202
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,443
Mom, how much did you borrow?

203
00:15:37,443 --> 00:15:39,760
I… I didn't borrow much.

204
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,840
My store keeps losing money, so I just borrowed no more than a hundred thousand yuan

205
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,350
as working capital and I'll pay it back later.

206
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,860
Who knows… You were playing mahjong again, weren't you?

207
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,540
I…I…

208
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,150
You've started talking?

209
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,910
I see you and your daughter are having a hard time.

210
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,243
Here.

211
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:02,450
Put your thumb print on here and I'll give you a grace period.

212
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,800
Don't dilly-dally.

213
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,650
The interest rate is higher, but you are given more time.

214
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,740
You can save your life first and make money later.

215
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,200
I'm helping you because of your pretty face.

216
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,670
Don't touch me! Go away!

217
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,750
Let me teach you a lesson today.

218
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,183
Stop!

219
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,210
I squeeze…

220
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,610
What the hell! What the hell!

221
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,990
Let's go. He's a cop.

222
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,183
Piss off!

223
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,511
Well, I… I'll go and call the police.

224
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:01,083
Are you all right?

225
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,900
What happened to you?

226
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,660
I…I'm all right. A minor injury.

227
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,733
Thank you.

228
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,373
You can go.

229
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,261
I'm not going. They've just left. I'm worried.

230
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,660
Just cry if you want to.

231
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,620
I'm here with you.

232
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,150
Go. I don't want to see you.

233
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,791
I just got here. Why do you ask me to go?

234
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,550
I don't want you to see me end up like this.

235
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,330
You look good like this. I don't mind.

236
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,460
I do!

237
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,083
Lili, I've done some serious soul-searching.

238
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,260
I will always stay by your side to protect you.

239
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,260
You can't drive me away.

240
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,520
You are the one I'm sure to marry.

241
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,600
Did I say I'm going to marry you?

242
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,860
Miss Wen, please have a cup of coffee.

243
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,320
Thanks.

244
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,810
It must be very interesting experience working in such an environment.

245
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,231
Not bad. At first, I felt a bit like a fish out of water.

246
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:43,490
But I'm doing much better now.

247
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,210
I've listened to your show.

248
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:51,000
The episode on ethical relations of psychological counselors struck home with me.

249
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,970
Thank you for liking my show.

250
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,640
Miss Wen, I asked you over this time since I have a very serious question to ask you.

251
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,040
If there is something wrong with the aRMS therapeutic apparatus

252
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,420
approved by the Ethics Accreditation of the Psychological Society,

253
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,200
can we ask the Psychological Society to publicize the security data of the apparatus?

254
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,310
- Is there something wrong?
- Yes.

255
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:15,340
One of my patients showed strong stress reaction after using it.

256
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,160
And as far as I know, this has happened to more than one patient.

257
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,880
The clinical trials of the aRMS therapeutic apparatus showed nothing wrong.

258
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,160
I can see the occurrence of such incidents makes you skeptical of the safety of the apparatus.

259
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,700
But there are many possibilities that could lead to a patient's stress reaction.

260
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,561
And as to whether a patient's health status meets the conditions

261
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:36,580
for using the apparatus, I think this should be the...

262
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,840
focus of your investigation.

263
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,900
Miss Wen, I've double-checked this scenario.

264
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,750
I've basically ruled out the patient's own health problem.

265
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,390
Besides, such kind of therapeutic apparatus currently available on the market is very safe.

266
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,470
Such stress reaction is not commonplace.

267
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,960
And I've found quite a few cases like this in such a small scope,

268
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,780
so this is not an emergency.

269
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,510
Have you found out more about the specific circumstances of other patients in the sanatorium?

270
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:12,070
What I know is after their first usage, they didn't feel very pleasant,

271
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,500
so they refused to use it for a second time.

272
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,780
All right then.

273
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,171
I'll go back and check if there are any problems with the technical indicators.

274
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:20,920
But the possibility is low.

275
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,690
Once there is a problem, I'll certainly take up the matter myself.

276
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,700
Thank you, Miss Wen. I hope it won't give you trouble.

277
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,410
Thank you for coming to me first.

278
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,590
I'm off for now.

279
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,180
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your coffee.

280
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,850
How was the conversation?

281
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,180
Did you say the aRMS therapeutic apparatus is only used in sanatoriums?

282
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,170
No.

283
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,530
Specialized hospitals and relevant treatment facilities are promoting and using it as well.

284
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,410
Ye Jiahui said it.

285
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,780
But it's so weird.

286
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,990
Why did she take it for granted that my patient is from a sanatorium?

287
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,930
Lili, slow down.

288
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,781
If you make me injured again, I'm going to extort money from you.

289
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,370
Let go of me. Let go of me.

290
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,330
Let me have a word with you.

291
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,780
Why did you disappear into thin air?

292
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,680
Where have you been?

293
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,200
Why did you get injured like this?

294
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,040
I was on a mission.

295
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,873
What mission?

296
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,700
My work unit asks us to keep it secret.

297
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,910
Can't you say a few more words?

298
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,253
Yes.

299
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,470
I missed you so much.

300
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,150
Did you miss me?

301
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,260
I don't know.

302
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,570
How could you not know?

303
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,660
Are you a fool?

304
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,380
I also think I've become a fool since I started dating you.

305
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,303
Does it hurt?

306
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,793
Lili,

307
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,373
I'm sorry.

308
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,920
So you missed me as well, right?

309
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,020
Can you stop asking me such a silly question?

310
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,500
How did you find my mother's store?

311
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,490
Don't you have the slightest clue? You've been to the police station so many times.

312
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,780
You are already our key object of protection.

313
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,750
[Flower Coffee House]

314
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,000
What goodies are these?

315
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,240
Mageline. Qing Qing gave them to me.

316
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,810
She says they are good for my scalp.

317
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,210
Ask her to give some of these goodies to me too.

318
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,360
No.

319
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,830
Qing Qing specially gave them to me.

320
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,190
Do you want some too?

321
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,560
- This month's hot review.
- I'm on it.

322
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,990
- Topic selection.
- I'll do it.

323
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,820
- Hotline.
- I'm on it.

324
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,380
Work a graveyard shift for me tonight.

325
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,713
OK.

326
00:23:49,713 --> 00:23:51,373
Keep them safe.

327
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,810
Let's get a move on. In case we disturb Boss.

328
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,533
Yes.

329
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,210
I can see the occurrence of such incidents

330
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,160
makes you skeptical of the safety of the apparatus.

331
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,770
But there are many possibilities that could lead to a patient's stress reaction.

332
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,561
And as to whether a patient's health status meets the conditions

333
00:24:16,561 --> 00:24:20,680
for using the apparatus, I think this should be the...

334
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,280
focus of your investigation.

335
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,010
You've been absent-minded for quite a while.

336
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,110
What are you thinking?

337
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,790
Something is not right.

338
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,560
What is not right?

339
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,160
Are you talking about Wen Liang?

340
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,831
Thank you both. I'll support you guys forever.

341
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,030
Mr. Qian, you… you are too close to me.

342
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,180
I refuse to be tied with you. Don't ride on my coattails for popularity.

343
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,780
Miss He, my relationship with you is open and aboveboard.

344
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,880
I'm not afraid of gossips.

345
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,400
I'll stop teasing you.

346
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,560
So do you mean Wen Liang blurted out

347
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,340
and asked you whether other patients in the sanatorium had any reactions?

348
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,340
When she said the word sanatorium, she said it unambiguously and she was even quite convinced.

349
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,431
So you suspect she knew what you were doing in the sanatorium?

350
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,210
It is fair to say so.

351
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,520
If now you are asked to say a name of a café…

352
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,630
Flower Garden. What's wrong?

353
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,960
Don't you think so?

354
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,130
It's easier for us to blurt out names of places that we often hear, see and go to.

355
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,830
She must go to the sanatorium often.

356
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,370
That's why she knew your patient is in the sanatorium.

357
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,940
The "you guys" as she mentioned refers to us.

358
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,690
What you guys and us?

359
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,860
What do you mean?

360
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,040
When she was saying "you guys", she shifted her eyes to another direction.

361
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,840
She was looking at you.

362
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,360
So she thought we were caring for a patient in the sanatorium.

363
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,500
So what?

364
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,230
Unless she has really seen us in the sanatorium.

365
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,110
Otherwise according to her logical analysis, a psychological counselor

366
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,850
could not possibly take her friend with her to engage with a patient.

367
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,463
Mr. Ye.

368
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,120
These are a dozen complaint reports we've received.

369
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,020
The feedback for this batch of apparatus is not very good.

370
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,260
A machine is a machine after all.

371
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,920
Machines will have to break down.

372
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,290
Send people of the technical department to have a look.

373
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:01,110
Recall a product where a recall is due. Give compensation where a compensation is due.

374
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,180
They've been there. The other side does not accept a compensation.

375
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,891
That's because your compensation is not big enough!

376
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,003
Get out.

377
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,263
Miss Wen?

378
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,760
I heard some bad news these past few days.

379
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,060
I hastened to come and talk about it with you.

380
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,530
These days, quite a few patients have started using the apparatus.

381
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:36,300
They showed symptoms of stress later on and some of the patients began to resist using it.

382
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,170
I wonder if the first batch of apparatus has any safety problems.

383
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,040
You are not talking about safety problems.

384
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,290
You are talking about customer feedback.

385
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,850
Since it is feedback, it's bound to be a mixture of good and bad.

386
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,140
Besides, our customers… are somewhat special.

387
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,330
What do you say?

388
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,530
We should lose no time to recall and test the first batch of apparatus

389
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,430
and do a systematic safety assessment.

390
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:05,480
You are an expert in psychological counseling and I'm an expert in technological invention.

391
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,500
As to whether the apparatus is good or not,

392
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,820
it is not up to you to have the final say, nor the customers.

393
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,100
It is up to the quality inspection report.

394
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,660
Something has gone wrong already so far.

395
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,810
I signed my name on the approval document.

396
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,260
I take full responsibility.

397
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,450
Otherwise, why do you think

398
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,400
I put you in that position?

399
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,790
Are you not afraid you'll shoot yourself in the foot?

400
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,880
In the sanatorium He Dun visits, there has already been something wrong with the apparatus.

401
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,810
Ji Mingcong certainly will not sit back.

402
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,650
You've found Fu Tang?

403
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,310
I'd like to sit on the balcony.

404
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:17,100
All right. I'll take you there after I take your blood pressure, okay?

405
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
Relax.

406
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,180
Excuse me, could you tell me which floor the Inpatient Department is on?

407
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,450
It's on the 13th floor.

408
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,083
Thanks a lot.

409
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,220
[Visitor Information Center]

410
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,143
Hello.

411
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:14,650
Hello, Sir.

412
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,060
Could you please tell me which room is Ms. Fu Tang staying in?

413
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,210
Could you please let me know who you are?

414
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,920
I'm her family member.

415
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,050
Sir, the visiting hours have passed.

416
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,350
Please come earlier next time.

417
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,260
I'm busy most of the time. Could you make an exception?

418
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,070
Sir, the visiting hours have passed.

419
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,720
Please come earlier next time.

420
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,520
It's like this. She's my wife.

421
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,810
- You see…
- Sir, the visiting hours have passed.

422
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,010
Please come earlier next time.

423
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,870
Sir, it's the end of our working hours.

424
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:51,011
Please contact the patient you'd like to visit yourself.

425
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,350
It's a nice day today.

426
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,350
Would you like to go out for a walk?

427
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,510
Mom, where are you going?

428
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,700
Did you have a row with dad again?

429
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,450
Get out of the way.

430
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,090
Go away!

431
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,580
Go away. Don't hold me. Go away.

432
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,210
Get out of the way!

433
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,380
Where are you going?

434
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,900
It's raining outside.

435
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,410
You haven't had dinner yet.

436
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,860
How does this sound?

437
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,910
When the weather clears up tomorrow, our son and I will hang out with you, all right?

438
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,310
- All right?
- Okay.

439
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,040
- Where are we going?
- To the zoo.

440
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,540
- To the zoo? What are you gonna look at in the zoo?
- Monkeys.

441
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,351
Look at monkeys? Are you a little monkey?

442
00:32:41,351 --> 00:32:43,741
I'm a monkey. I'm a little monkey. I'm gonna climb a tree.

443
00:32:43,741 --> 00:32:45,850
You are going to climb a tree?

444
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,960
Do you love him a lot?

445
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,763
I love you too.

446
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,100
But it's such a pity

447
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,920
that he is Ji Mingcong's child.

448
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,310
I was telling the truth.

449
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,250
Dad, is mom leaving us?

450
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,463
You've woken up.

451
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,330
I don't know how it started.

452
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:54,380
I just fell asleep while sitting in the wheelchair.

453
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,880
Maybe the sea breeze was so comfy.

454
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,263
Look here.

455
00:35:00,263 --> 00:35:04,591
Not only is the sand soft, its shell is also quite special.

456
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:14,200
Mom, look at the shell I've picked up.

457
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,393
Fei Fei.

458
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,390
I knew it's you.

459
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,813
Mom.

460
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,200
Why do you like the seaside?

461
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,910
I've always liked the sea very much.

462
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,870
I like the place where life began.

463
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,250
I like everything about the sea.

464
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:13,810
When I'm in the sanatorium, I think of the sea countless times.

465
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,693
I imagine

466
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,620
I was right here.

467
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:28,660
I heard that people who like the sea are all lovers of freedom.

468
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,770
Sounds plausible.

469
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:35,490
If you like being here, I'll take you here every day in the coming days.

470
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,840
I want to go and sit there.

471
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,670
All right, let me wheel you over.

472
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,840
This wheel got stuck in the sand.

473
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,630
Let's walk there.

474
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,660
Let me carry you on my back.

475
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,080
Can you do that?

476
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,680
I'll try and see if I can. Come on.

477
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,813
Come up here.

478
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,820
We are getting up.

479
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,363
Mom.

480
00:37:48,363 --> 00:37:50,690
Can you tell me something about Ji Mingcong?

481
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,360
I had very tradition-minded parents.

482
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,060
They couldn't quite understand me.

483
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,571
In their eyes, I'd always been a somewhat abnormal person.

484
00:38:07,571 --> 00:38:12,870
And I also thought I needed treatment and I was abnormal.

485
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,280
It wasn't until Ji Mingcong's appearance

486
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:25,000
that I came to realize some people could be eccentric.

487
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,330
Hello.

488
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,220
I am Ji Mingcong.

489
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:33,210
Just like some people enjoy the smell of gasoline,

490
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,180
some people like lining up candies in a row

491
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,400
and eat them one by one by color,

492
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,290
and some people can understand the sound of seabirds.

493
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:49,390
What is real and what is fake.

494
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,000
What you can't feel doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

495
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,140
And what you can feel doesn't mean it exists.

496
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,913
It's for you.

497
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,360
Thanks.

498
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,350
"There is no better gift in the Jiangnan region, I send a plum blossom as a herald of spring."

499
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,913
Some people

500
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:12,110
always talk about conforming to this world

501
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,390
and changing oneself.

502
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:18,920
But what is the standard for judging

503
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,320
whether someone is normal or not?

504
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:26,010
Have you ever loved Ji Mingcong?

505
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,520
It was because of love that I left.

506
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,010
What about Ye Jicheng?

507
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,560
I'm indebted to him after all.

508
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,690
Part of his devilish madness comes down to his obsessiveness about me.

509
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,500
That's why he is so keen to find me.

510
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,860
How did you know he's looking for you?

511
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:01,620
Because my eyes are watching all the time.

512

519
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,063
Feifei,

520
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,220
do you know?

521
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:48,000
Although I created your life, you don't belong to me.

522
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,350
You belong to yourself.

523
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,050
You can…

524
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,760
get rid of all the depressions and bondages

525
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,280
to create your own world,

526
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,450
a world that you want.

527
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,200
This is what I most want to give you,

528
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,110
freedom I've craved for all my life.

529
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,770
I really hope you can be the man you want to be,

530
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:27,020
be a man as free as the heaven and the sea.

531
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,703
This is

532
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,420
the only thing I can give you.

533
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,420
Do you get it?

534
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,873
Yes.

535
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,630
Mom, I love you so much.

536
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:10,230
Mommy loves you so much too.

537
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,810
I seem to have put in soy sauce three times.

538
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,120
It's OK. It's very tasty.

539
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,920
Please try it too.

540
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,810
Your son is handsome, so anything looks good on him.

541
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:25,190
How could there be a mother who doesn't love her child?

542
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,311
Speaking of which, I have a craving for candies.

543
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,720
What shall we do?

544
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,360
You can't eat that many candies now.

545
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,150
Now you've even started to disobey me?

546
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,313
All right.

547
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,190
Wait for me here. I'll go and buy some for you.

548
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,330
Why are you in tears?

549
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:26,280
I'm going. Wait for me.

550
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,403
Mom!

551
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:32,533
Mom!

552
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:43,073
Mom! Mom!

553
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,050
Thank goodness, you are all right.

554
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:16,200
I had a hard time finding you.

555
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,440
Don't ever leave me again.

556
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,110
For the whole of her life, she's been freewheeling and unrestrained

557
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:27,940
while going through so much suffering.

558
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:31,280
She had no qualms about receiving the wrong treatment again and again

559
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,390
just because love is the only thing that ties her down in her heart.

560
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:41,010
I hope she can have a new lease of life from her reunion with Jiahui this time.

561
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,443
Many visitors come with the same question: Why?

562
00:46:49,443 --> 00:46:53,340
Why them? Why so?

563
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:56,103
They are confused, upset,

564
00:46:56,103 --> 00:47:00,660
angry, fearful, and resentful.

565
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,330
They are powerless and helpless.

566
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:09,870
During this past period of time, I've become more aware of what I am here for.

567
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:15,280
As a psychological counselor, I can't give an exact answer to their question.

568
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,430
I must accompany them to look for the answer,

569
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:21,390
helping them to see themselves, understand themselves,

570
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:24,530
accept themselves and change themselves.

571
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:29,780
I hope all of us can have the courage to face our inner heart head-on.

572
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,110
Thank you, Miss He.

573
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:34,310
I feel much more comfortable at heart.

574
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:37,530
Miss He, thank you for helping me.

575
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,560
Miss He, thank you for helping me find my courage again.

576
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,520
Miss He, upon hearing what you said, I'm full of fighting spirit now.

577
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,053
Miss He, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

578
00:47:48,053 --> 00:47:50,320
Thank you, Miss He.

579
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,351
Your support really matters a lot to me.

580
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,710
I am He Dun, a psychological counselor.

581
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:07,590
If you have any emotional problems in the future, feel free to come to me.

582
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:12,580
Feeling blue? Let's talk.

583
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:16,080
[This is just the beginning of He Dun's story.]
