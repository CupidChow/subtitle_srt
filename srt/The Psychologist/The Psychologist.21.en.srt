00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,590
Qian Kaiyi?

19
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,169
What brings you here?

20
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:55,580
Something's going to happen if I don't come. Don't even ask what brings me here.

21
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,950
What were you doing?

22
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,769
I was helping him put a strong adhesive bandage on.

23
00:01:58,769 --> 00:01:59,950
What strong adhesive bandage?

24
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,899
No, it's a bandaid.

25
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:03,930
You got injured?

26
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,970
He got injured.

27
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,600
Here, let me have a look.

28
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,490
This… This is so serious.

29
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,809
This might be fatal.

30
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:20,470
What do you mean, Qian Kaiyi?

31
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,010
Come on, Bro. Let me paste it on you.

32
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,530
Come on.

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,720
Come on, come on, come on.

34
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,850
No need.

35
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,900
Don't be courteous.

36
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,730
- Well, Qian Kaiyi, what are you doing?
- Qian Kaiyi.

37
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,590
Here, let me paste it on you.

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,370
Qian Kaiyi.

39
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,490
What are you doing?

40
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,989
Lili is not at home and you are surrounded by tigers and wolves.

41
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:52,440
I'm afraid it'll be dangerous for you to stay alone,

42
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,619
so I'm here to stay with you for a couple of days.

43
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:58,960
Did Lili go to see you?

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,440
Yes.

45
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,470
Actually, Lili cares about you a lot.

46
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,130
She was just in one of her moods these days.

47
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,820
She'll be back in a couple of days.

48
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,100
So I will be your protector over the next couple of days.

49
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,520
Protect me against what?

50
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,339
Don't you have the slightest awareness of precaution?

51
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:19,819
How dangerous it… it is around here!

52
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,520
To me, you are the biggest danger.

53
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,260
Don't fuss around. Go home, all right?

54
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,470
I'm going to bed.

55
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,670
Go in and sleep. Don't bother about me.

56
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,320
Suit yourself.

57
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,150
What are you doing?

58
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,660
I'm going to take off my clothes.

59
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,620
Pervert.

60
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,179
- Bravo!
- Great!

61
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:37,700
Bravo!

62
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,190
That's it. Thank you, guys. Thank you, guys.

63
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,840
Thank you, guys.

64
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,100
Bro, why are you piling up?

65
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,629
I think this is where I belong.

66
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:10,510
I've put my soul in it.

67
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,050
Return your soul to the sea?

68
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,550
I can tell it's in the shape of a fish.

69
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,550
You got it?

70
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,040
I think the sea will take me away when the tide comes in.

71
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,009
The sea is mine.

72
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:29,490
I have the magic cudgel to stabilize the sea.

73
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,670
I can also do somersaults on the waves.

74
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,070
- Can you?
- No.

75
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,140
Then how can the sea take you away?

76
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,790
You can't even swim, can you?

77
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,650
No.

78
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,980
So I placed a swimming ring nearby.

79
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,490
Bro, I'll be waiting for you.

80
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,980
I'll see you in the sea.

81
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,920
Cheers.

82
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,880
Bro, let's have a memento.

83
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,440
Come on, let's take a photo.

84
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,980
So that we'll find each other in the sea.

85
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,920
Here, one.

86
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,600
All right.

87
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,320
Bro, take out your cellphone.

88
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,920
Let's be friends on WeChat so that I can send the photos to you, okay?

89
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,110
Here, scan my QR code.

90
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,200
Okay.

91
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,169
All right. 250 photos in total for 500 yuan.

92
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:25,030
I'll send them to you right away.

93
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,040
Fish. Swimming ring.

94
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,700
Bro, how old are you?

95
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,870
All right, all right. Since we are done,

96
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,700
I… I'm off for now.

97
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,770
- I helped you so much before.
- Drink it quickly.

98
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,950
- Eat it, drink it.
- Eat it. Want more?

99
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,640
As long as you make yourself strong,

100
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,979
you won't need validation from others to live as well as they do.

101
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,600
250 photos in total for 500 yuan.

102
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,170
Bro, how old are you?

103
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:04,230
There's a fight.

104
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,329
- Never mind.
- Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.

105
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,320
- Come on.
- Cellphone, cellphone!

106
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,160
Never mind, never mind.

107
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,970
Never mind, Bro. Never mind.

108
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,830
Never mind.

109
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,040
Never mind.

110
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,650
Control yourself. Control yourself.

111
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,169
Just in of local news.

112
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:06,010
According to clues contributed by citizens, on the afternoon of the 22nd,

113
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,199
a fistfight incident happened on the coast of the Little West Sea.

114
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,569
The man in the footage was the protagonist of this fistfight.

115
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:16,379
With a golden cudgel in his hand, the man kept beating

116
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:19,419
an unidentified man who was dressed as the cartoon character Monkey King.

117
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:21,440
- Hello.
- Sir, do you go to GreenTree Inn?

118
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,500
Yes. Let's go.

119
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,510
- Sir, what are you watching?
- I'm watching a fight.

120
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,440
Let's find out more.

121
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,189
He had a nickname which was Cuttlefish because he cried a lot.

122
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:32,949
At that time, everybody laughed at him and pushed him aside.

123
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:37,389
Whenever someone passed by him quickly, he would cover his head with his hands.

124
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:38,810
He got bullied a lot.

125
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,880
He was also being isolated.

126
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,860
Ask him to watch it and see if it's him.

127
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,401
Is it him? Why did he beat people so badly?

128
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:53,970
What did Monkey King do to offend him?

129
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,650
None of my damn business.

130
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,119
- None of your damn business.
- None of your damn business.

131
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:09,400
- None of your damn business.
- None of your damn business.

132
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,590
What are you guys doing?

133
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,380
Xiao Mo.

134
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,520
When you are done going through the entries of the year-long framework agreement…

135
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,059
None of your damn business.

136
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:18,230
…be quick to give it to me.

137
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,500
None of your damn business.

138
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,330
I beg your pardon?

139
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,941
Mo Yu, do you really think you are the big boss here?

140
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,710
- None of your damn business.
- None of your damn business.

141
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,300
- Are you pulling a long face to me?
- I can't make you move your ass.

142
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,770
- None of your damn business.
- None of your damn business!

143
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,220
Xiao Lu, take over the work from him in the afternoon and ask HR to pay off his salary.

144
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,949
I don't want to see him again here when I'm back!

145
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:41,910
- None of your damn business!
- None of your damn business!

146
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,489
Psychologically, an affected individual

147
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:48,490
is likely to show social aggressive behavior

148
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,200
or social withdrawal behavior or no behavior

149
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,599
with only the individual's moods and feelings affected psychologically.

150
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,470
How are you feeling today? Is there anything you'd like to talk to me about?

151
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,200
Since the last counseling session,

152
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,099
I think some changes have happened to me.

153
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:15,520
Now when I have a bout of anxiety,

154
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,850
I tell myself first to calm down.

155
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,739
And then in the way you ask me questions,

156
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:26,230
I try to ask myself why.

157
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,609
When I figure it out, I don't seem to have anxiety anymore.

158
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:34,670
Well done. You've found a way to regulate your mood.

159
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,550
Actually, you can also try,

160
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,270
for example, reading, exercising, and yoga, which are good ways as well.

161
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,280
All right. I'll try back at home.

162
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,280
But…

163
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,099
I'm still being troubled by insomnia.

164
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:53,739
When did your insomnia begin?

165
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:58,690
A lot of problems have come up since I gave birth to Yezi.

166
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,929
During the first three years, for a very long time

167
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:05,129
I was stricken with anxiety and grievances and wanted to cry.

168
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:10,699
I was obviously burned out, but I couldn't fall asleep when I was lying in bed.

169
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:14,839
If I made the slightest mistake in taking care of my child,

170
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,910
I blamed myself a lot

171
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,150
and thought I was a useless mother.

172
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,489
After your first birth of Yezi,

173
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:25,369
were there any changes in your life

174
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:28,099
that made you feel dejected and upset?

175
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:33,420
Actually, there were a lot of things that had a great impact on me.

176
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,110
We've all been through this.

177
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,791
- Don't women all give birth like this?
- Yes.

178
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,421
- Don't think too much.
- Take a good rest.

179
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:40,590
Don't think too much.

180
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,640
Take a good rest for a few days and you'll be fine.

181
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,280
- We've all been through this.
- All been through this.

182
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,420
At that time,

183
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,590
I was wondering if I was being too fussy.

184
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,880
Why didn't others have the problem but only me?

185
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,400
When you spoke your mind, you were not met with

186
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,659
comfort and support, so you wanted to repress your feelings,

187
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:07,470
and your depression got even worse.

188
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,759
Since then,

189
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,739
I actually didn't get along very well

190
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:17,320
with my family.

191
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,700
What's up with you?

192
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,860
I… I'm going to the bathroom.

193
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,080
That night,

194
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,000
I didn't seem to know myself.

195
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,810
Standing in front of the mirror, I looked at my belly.

196
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,550
Was that me?

197
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,280
Why am I so ugly?

198
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,249
Giving birth is a big deal.

199
00:12:58,249 --> 00:13:02,550
After childbirth, your physiological needs to changed

200
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,110
and the role of parents affected your relationship with your husband.

201
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,110
You thought your body was getting flabby

202
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,150
and your husband's reaction upset you.

203
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,180
You felt like you were becoming worthless over time, right?

204
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,520
Yes.

205
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,200
Back then,

206
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,320
I was often asking myself why my life had ended up like this.

207
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,880
After giving birth to Yezi,

208
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,840
I started to quarrel with my mother-in-law.

209
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,250
You and your mother-in-law were raised in different environments,

210
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,310
so there was a great clash of views between you over how to educate the child.

211
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,370
My mother-in-law relied on her past experience to take care of the child.

212
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,080
If that was correct, I certainly wouldn't say a thing.

213
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,440
But obviously, my way was more science-based and hygienic.

214
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,550
I was keen to give all my love to Yezi.

215
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,900
I was doing a very responsible thing, but they just thought I was asking for trouble

216
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,350
and I was a fussy mother who was creating family conflicts for no reason.

217
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,960
Especially my husband.

218
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,010
It's all right if that was what my mother-in-law thought. That was what he thought too.

219
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,810
Is he not a parent of the child? Am I the only parent of the child?

220
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,810
No!

221
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,910
I know very well how you feel at the moment.

222
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,200
You expected your husband to support you, but he let you down as well.

223
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,910
He couldn't possibly support me.

224
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,519
Not just that.

225
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,739
My work at that time also brought me tons and tons of problems.

226
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:13,780
[Mom]

227
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,960
Editor-in-chief, I'm sorry I'm late.

228
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,590
Look how haggard you are.

229
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,130
It must be a hard job to work while taking care of your child.

230
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,931
No. My child is very good.

231
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,850
And my mother-in-law can help me with childcare.

232
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,960
I used to be a newbie dad myself.

233
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,880
Even if the grandma is good at taking care of the child,

234
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,500
[Mom]
it's still not as reassuring as taking care of the child yourself.

235
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,760
As you know, a new round of review cycle of our publishing house is just around the corner.

236
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,669
To say nothing of how you are doing now,

237
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:45,810
even the young newcomers find it somewhat challenging.

238
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,150
[Mom]

239
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,590
Well, Editor-in-chief, I… I'm doing very well.

240
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,030
I'm very confident about the new round of review cycle.

241
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:08,160
And I also don't want to miss the promotional opportunity you mentioned.

242
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,910
It's good to have confidence.

243
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,659
But do you know how many mistakes have you made

244
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:15,440
over the past few days since your return?

245
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,930
What do you mean?

246
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,270
Answer it.

247
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,590
Excuse me.

248
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,150
Hi, Mom.

249
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,150
I'm in the middle of work.

250
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,230
I'll call you back right away.

251
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,960
Right away.

252
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,550
In fact, it's good to be a stay-at-home mom.

253
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,380
At least you can put your heart into accompanying your child's growth.

254
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,980
Don't you think so?

255
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,280
Sometimes I wondered

256
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,440
if a woman didn't deserve a job after childbirth.

257
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,350
I was really rather helpless.

258
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,110
But once I thought of what the editor-in-chief said, he was right.

259
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,400
By doing two things at the same time, how could you do your job well?

260
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,710
In order to take care of Yezi, I really couldn't have more energy and time to spare.

261
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:18,520
At the end of the day, it was my own incompetence to blame.

262
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,030
You thought you were going through a rough patch at that time

263
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,181
and the whole family should support you and care about you.

264
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:27,929
In the end, they all let you down. Nobody was staying by your side,

265
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:32,230
which made you feel wronged and in a bad mood, right?

266
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,940
Miss He,

267
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,440
can I change myself?

268
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,030
Any ideas?

269
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,520
I can't always live for others.

270
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,350
I've lost the career I love.

271
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,350
In the eyes of outsides,

272
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,230
I have two children. I must…

273
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,200
I must be very happy.

274
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,670
But once it occurs to me

275
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,130
they will grow up and leave me one day,

276
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,040
my life just becomes directionless.

277
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,590
Don't cry. Don't cry. No cry for Mommy.

278
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,410
Don't cry.

279
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,530
But I know

280
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:17,110
I can't place my hope of life on my children alone.

281
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,430
I must count on myself to live a happy life

282
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,550
and make my life worth living.

283
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,950
I'm rather perplexed.

284
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,500
I don't know who I am.

285
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,430
I don't know what I need.

286
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,110
As to "who I am",

287
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,070
I think this is a question that is worth exploring for everybody.

288
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,560
But today, I'd like to talk to you about your life timeline.

289
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,950
Starting from your life timeline, let's look at your present self,

290
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,310
look back on your past self, and imagine your future self.

291
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:52,890
Zhan Lu, would you like to come with me to have a look?

292
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:11,810
Ms. Zhan, this is what you are like now.

293
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,590
Now you can close your eyes and think

294
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,710
which episode you want to go back to most

295
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,260
if you are allowed to go back to the past.

296
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,590
- I'm here to see my grandson.
- How many times…

297
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,290
Don't mess with your younger brother!

298
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,540
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

299
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,700
Is that him? The man who beat up Monkey King.

300
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,520
He also beat his superior the other day.

301
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,680
I heard he had a nickname Cuttlefish.

302
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,880
I heard he got bullied at school when he was young and started to go weird.

303
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,660
Could it be that some people are doomed to be disliked by others in this world?

304
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,000
- Could it be that I shouldn't be liked by others?
- I helped you so much before.

305
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,530
She can't cure you.

306
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,590
Otherwise why is your mood still unstable after so many counseling sessions?

307
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,430
When you are done going through be quick to give it to me.

308
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,740
None of your damn business.

309
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,830
I beg your pardon?

310
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,430
There are things that are different from what you see.

311
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,140
Not everybody in this world needs to get on well with others.

312
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,780
Look at me.

313
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,450
I'm used to being a lone wolf.

314
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,860
Don't I live just as well?

315
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,109
As long as you make yourself strong,

316
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:31,480
you won't need validation from others to live as well as they do.

317
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,590
What are you doing?

318
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,650
I'll help you.

319
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,230
[Brother Fei]

320

[Brother Fei]
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

323
00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:56,270
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

324
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,470
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

325
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,009
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

328
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,520
I got paid for the novel I sent to a magazine.

329
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,309
Girls should be practical.

330
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:32,000
Girls should study finance or accounting to find a good job in the future.

331
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,610
Xiao Lu, don't blame your dad for nagging.

332
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,249
He just wants to remind you.

333
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:38,880
Interest is interest.

334
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,710
When you have a job later, you must have practical ideas.

335
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,290
She hasn't even started college yet. You are such a worrywart.

336
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,579
This was when I was 18.

337
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,300
Back then, I was in my third year of high school.

338
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,799
I set my heart on becoming a novelist,

339
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,260
so I chose to major in Literature at college.

340
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:04,180
After graduation, I started working with a publishing house while writing novels.

341
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,690
But before I made a name for myself, I got married.

342
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,460
[Double Happiness]

343
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,920
This was the day of my wedding when I was 26.

344
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,800
Lu Lu, straighten up your hair in a while.

345
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,820
Let the fully blessed women put on your headdress for you

346
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,040
and start the ancestor worship ceremony.

347
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,040
When Zhijian comes to pick you up,

348
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,660
you guys can start to serve tea, perform the rituals and cross the brazier.

349
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,110
Do remember nothing must go wrong.

350
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:37,350
Mom, you told me quite a few times last night.

351
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,020
I'm nagging because I'm happy in my heart.

352
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,780
It's the auspicious hour.

353
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,900
I'm going to ask the fully blessed women to put your headdress on for you.

354
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,950
Mom.

355
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,860
I want you to put it on for me, so I can stay with you a little longer.

356
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,850
All right.

357
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,730
You are about to marry into others' family.

358
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,760
When you were a child, your hair used to tangle a lot.

359
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,820
When I combed it even so gently, you kept screaming in pain.

360
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,459
Things are good now.

361
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:23,400
You are such a beautiful young woman from head to toe.

362
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,530
You've grown up in a blink of an eye.

363
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,560
I'm happy in my heart.

364
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,430
Mom, don't say that.

365
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,470
It's not that I'll leave and never be back.

366
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,950
I know.

367
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,040
But Lu Lu,

368
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,010
when you marry into others' family, you are a member of that family.

369
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,519
You should be sensible,

370
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:51,020
do what your parents-in-law say and don't embarrass your maiden family.

371
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,190
When you have children,

372
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,230
you should assist your husband and educate your children and be a good mother.

373
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,920
Do you understand?

374
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:14,350
Even if I was married, I could go on writing novels.

375
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,950
But once I was really married, I found it to be such a naïve idea.

376
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,920
Why do you say so?

377
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,210
Every day, there were all sorts of trivial matters to see to.

378
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:27,190
I didn't have time to knuckle down and get on with writing.

379
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,880
This seems to be the time when you just had your baby girl, right?

380
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,160
Yes. Actually, I didn't want to have children so early.

381
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,760
But at that time, I was already 28.

382
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,460
My family was pushing, so I had to have one.

383
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,400
The life after childbirth was unimaginable to myself.

384
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,939
Be good, be good, be good. No cry, no cry.

385
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:47,729
You seemed to be doing pretty well at this time.

386
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:50,430
I was indeed doing well when the child was quiet.

387
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,310
By then, I had been worn smooth with no edges.

388
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,630
My only thought was to take good care of the child

389
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,620
and I dared not think about anything else at all.

390
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,590
Do you have anything to say after looking back on your past?

391
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,590
I think time is a pretty scary thing.

392
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,060
After living for a long time, people forget what they wanted in the first place.

393
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,779
What did you want in the first place?

394
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:17,000
Miss He, I think I know what I want.

395
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,560
In the days to come, I want to take good care of my daughter and my son.

396
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,420
And then I'll find a new job which I love,

397
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,730
make money by myself and spend money for myself, also for my family.

398
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,470
I also want to go on with novel writing.

399
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,970
Miss He, do you know?

400
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,780
This hobby is something I really can't give up.

401
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,580
But I want to remind you that stay-at-home mom is actually also

402
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,550
an identity that deserves to be respected, cared and loved.

403
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,080
It's also a highly precious career.

404
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,090
If you want to change yourself, you don't have to base it on denying your past self.

405
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:53,400
We can find some ideas and solutions from how you are doing now.

406
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,470
Maybe doing so can help you get out of the predicament.

407
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,810
Can you change them?

408
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,690
- Don't think too much.
- Take a good rest for a few days and you'll be fine.

409
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,520
That's what all women think.

410
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,350
No.

411
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,760
I can't change others, nor can I change you.

412
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,630
Only you can change yourself.

413
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:17,440
Sometimes, there are more than one vantage point to see things.

414
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,820
When people are depressed, more often than not they can't see

415
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,720
the warmth around them and even misunderstand what is actually going on.

416
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,080
Here, here, here. Let me hold the baby.

417
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,250
If you only lie in your mom's arms, you'll tire your mom out.

418
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,430
What are we gonna do?

419
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,089
Baby, daddy is back.

420
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:39,730
Watch football with daddy and let mommy take a break, all right?

421
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,460
Lu Lu, are you too tired to think straight?

422
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,640
Here. Look what I've bought you.

423
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,129
Your favorite food.

424
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,700
I don't quite know how to cook this dish, so you'll have to cook it yourself.

425
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,330
Here, lie in grandma's arms. Here, here, here.

426
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,320
Mom. The smell is so good that it makes me hungry.

427
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,229
You don't cook yourself. All you know is eating.

428
00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:03,520
Lu Lu, is dinner ready?

429
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,100
Almost. It'll be just ready when you are back from picking up Yezi.

430
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,430
All right. Give me ten minutes. I'm going right after the match.

431
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,350
In the past, I was always my mother's daughter,

432
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,880
my husband's wife, my mother-in-law's daughter-in-law,

433
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,010
and my children's mother.

434
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,900
In the future,

435
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,720
I want to be myself.

436
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,580
Being yourself is something everyone needs to explore in the course of their life.

437
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,680
I believe you have found yourself by now.

438
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,880
You know the roles you are playing in your life

439
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,520
and the confusion brought by the roles,

440
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,190
but still, you don't want to get lost.

441
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,279
In the future, I hope you'll have more time

442
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,050
to explore who you are.

443
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,560
But before becoming your better self in the future,

444
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,329
we still have to come back to our present self.

445
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:53,540
- My present self?
- Exactly.

446
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,000
Now you are still your mother-in-law's daughter-in-law,

447
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,110
your husband's wife, and your children's mother.

448
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,740
These are all your current roles.

449
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,419
But please don't worry.

450
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:11,369
You already have enough energy to face these.

451
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:14,680
Because you've just found a direction for your future.

452
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,280
Believe in yourself. You'll do very well.

453
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,830
Well, what should I do then?

454
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,730
Did you tell your husband back at home about your visits to me for counseling?

455
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,590
Before now I told him about my visits here for psychological counseling.

456
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,020
What was your husband's reaction?

457
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,000
He looked indifferent.

458
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:50,230
Postpartum depression actually needs the whole family's support and companionship.

459
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,900
In particular, your husband's support and love are especially important.

460
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,230
In fact, I suggest that when you are back at home,

461
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,530
you have a face-to-face, heart-to-heart talk with him

462
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:02,230
about the marriage problems that you guys have run into

463
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,950
and your takeaway from the counseling sessions.

464
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,939
If it's possible, you can consider inviting him

465
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:12,000
to have couple therapy or family therapy with you.

466
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,320
I can recommend counselors to you.

467
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,949
Will he go with me?

468
00:28:17,949 --> 00:28:21,860
You should believe in yourself and believe in your husband.

469
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,190
Actually, in a family,

470
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:28,920
the physical and mental health of both husband and wife is easily overlooked.

471
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:34,350
Maybe at this time, he's also trying to find a way to improve your marriage quality.

472
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,710
All right.

473
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:38,230
I… I'll try when I'm back.

474
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,530
Try to talk to him.

475
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,189
By the way, Miss He,

476
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:49,020
I… I found your place through your radio show.

477
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,950
Actually,

478
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:56,880
I called you guys before, but I didn't admit it back then.

479
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,770
Were you guys scared by the child's cry on the phone?

480
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,760
Hello, Haifeng Radio International.

481
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,070
Hello, little one.

482
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:13,070
- I'm kind of…
- Kind of what?

483
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,040
- I'm scared.
- Qian Kaiyi.

484
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,950
Are you kidding me in the middle of the night?

485
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,000
You don't believe me, do you?

486
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,310
- Dare you make a bet?
- What bet?

487
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,800
Let's call back.

488
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,160
If it's fake, I'll eat this poem.

489
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,260
If it's true, you'll have the poem mounted.

490
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,480
I'd rather watch you eating paper.

491
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,660
Radio station? Did you make a mistake?

492
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,950
I didn't call.

493
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,110
I'm sorry.

494
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,990
You almost scared one of my colleagues to death.

495
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,460
- I'm sorry.
- Just kidding.

496
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,760
The same old swagger.

497
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,070
Like an empress going out of the palace.

498
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,400
If I had such a strong background…

499
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Hello, Director Tang.

500
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,110
Hello.

501
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,680
Chen Qian.

502
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,350
- Chen Qian.
- D-Director Tang.

503
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,820
Give the technical evaluation of this due diligence report to Director Wu as soon as possible for confirmation.

504
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,480
Director Tang, the boss' wife would like to see you in her office.

505
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,630
You are here.

506
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,330
By the way, let me introduce someone to you. She is my…

507
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,350
Hello.

508
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,880
I'm Tong Yao, Fang Zhongyi's wife.

509
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,040
Also the company's secondary shareholder.

510
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,275
I don't know how to reply to He Dun.
[Lili, someone named Tong Yao came to see you today. Is she your friend?]

511
00:30:37,275 --> 00:30:41,100
- What did she say?
- She said someone named Tong Yao came to see me

512
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,470
and asked if she was my friend.

513
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,110
Do you know?

514
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,110
Nobody has ever been so nice to me.

515
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:01,590
Not until the moment I met you did I want to settle down and be with you.

516
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,790
I'm glad I've met you.

517
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,080
I'll certainly give you the best wedding, one that you'll like the best.

518
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,000
You know very well a young girl's mind.

519
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,789
Did you often sweet talk people before?

520
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:16,960
I thought you wouldn't be curious about others' past.

521
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,770
Hello, I'm Tang Lili.

522
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:42,970
I asked you to come because I heard from Zhongyi that he had hired a new secretary.

523
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,080
I read your resume and have a few questions I'd like to ask you.

524
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,950
Please go ahead.

525
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,939
First, going by the procedure, a candidate needs to take

526
00:31:55,939 --> 00:31:59,610
two rounds of interviews conducted by the HR Department and VP to enter the company,

527
00:32:00,381 --> 00:32:03,260
but it seems you didn't take any.

528
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,930
Well then, she didn't submit her resume for an interview.

529
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,859
She was introduced by one of my good friends.

530
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,970
- And my friend is quite reliable—
- All right.

531
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:13,780
The second question,

532
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,950
on the 20th day of last month,

533
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,810
a vendor's meeting was scheduled with Company W,

534
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,070
but Zhongyi was suddenly absent.

535
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,310
As his secretary, you didn't remind your boss in time

536
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,829
and inflicted a huge loss on the company.

537
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:32,780
And that same day, you also disappeared from the company.

538
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,990
I just want to know where you were that day.

539
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:45,460
T-That day I sent her to Jianxing to…to negotiate a contract.

540
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:55,130
I saw from your dashcam that she was in your apartment at Clear Water Bay.

541
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:14,190
Tang Lili, 29 years old.

542
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:17,570
Major, Flight Attendance.

543
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,630
Graduated from: Northern School of Economics.

544
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:23,490
GPA, 2.7.

545
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:27,230
Home address, No.239 Honghua Village,

546
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,790
Ningsha District, Haining City, Nanshan Province.

547
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,920
In your previous jobs, you were only a small-time office clerk.

548
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,680
Since you entered Shengyu,

549
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,040
by a sudden metamorphosis, you changed from secretary to the general manager.

550
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,520
And the same with Shifeng and Yunjin.

551
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,430
You really had meteoric promotions.

552
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,800
As to what happened during your time there, needless to say…

553
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,220
What happened…

554
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,710
You are quite stubborn.

555
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,070
Well done, Zhongyi.

556
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,790
This is your new taste this time.

557
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,100
Instead of being a domestic hen, you want to fly high and become a phoenix?

558
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,069
You are very lucky.

559
00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:25,409
It's a pity that you just don't have the fate.

560
00:34:30,893 --> 00:34:34,063
Some people would rather choose a domestic hen

561
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:45,520
than a hairless old phoenix like you.

562
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,320
- Tang Lili, you dare diss me.
- Don't touch me!

563
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,870
- You domestic hen!
- You vixen!

564
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,600
You beat me.

565
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,910
Psycho!

566
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,090
- Say it again.
- Old woman!

567
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,320
Go to hell!

568
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,970
Stinking b*tch!

569
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,480
Get back to work!

570
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,280
Enough!

571
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:27,860
Mom, you are the most awesome mom in the world.

572
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,520
Why did she go to bed so early?

573
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,230
She was tired.

574
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,760
Lu Lu. Lu Lu, I promise you.

575
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,430
If I make you angry again in the future, you can just kick me, kick me hard.

576
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,560
You can even kick me to the hospital.

577
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,560
I'm not going to kick you.

578
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,229
If you ended up in the hospital, wouldn't it cost money to pay for your medical bill?

579
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:06,430
As long as it could stop my dear wife's anger, it would be money well spent.

580
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,230
When I find a new job, you have to give me a hand with household chores,

581
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,280
especially spending more time with Yezi.

582
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,560
No problem.

583
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,270
H-How are you getting on with your job hunting?

584
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,950
Any suitable companies?

585
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,600
I submitted my resume on 58.com,

586
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,560
and there are many jobs that suit me.

587
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,710
Some companies have already invited me for an interview.

588
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,610
Our family can't rely on you alone,

589
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,290
I must give you a hand too, right?

590
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,830
[11:30 AM]

591
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,500
[Enter Meeting Room]

592
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,659
Hello, Zhan Lu.

593
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:00,870
Hello, Sir.

594
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,870
I've read your story. It's quite original.

595
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:06,520
Could you tell me about the general conception of your story?

596
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,710
I wrote about a future world

597
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,660
where AI robots are gradually...

598
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,150
gradually replacing basic jobs human beings are doing.

599
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,950
I think in the future, people should rely on

600
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:24,229
more creative and technical jobs to earn a living.

601
00:38:24,229 --> 00:38:27,280
It's like this. Our platform is supporting authors focusing on sensibility topics.

602
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,040
Your article is very original.

603
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,910
But what we need is an author who can work regularly on a full-time and long-term basis.

604
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:37,049
I've read your resume. The recent eight years is gap.

605
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:40,150
Could you tell me what you've been doing during the eight years?

606
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,470
During the eight years,

607
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:53,810
I… I've been a full-time housewife.

608
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,909
How can you guarantee there will be no clash

609
00:38:56,909 --> 00:39:00,040
between your family and your work when you return to the workplace?

610
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,530
As to the problem you've just mentioned, I've actually thought about it before.

611
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,570
To be frank,

612
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:15,320
I can't guarantee. I don't think a family should be a burden.

613
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,320
Especially for content creators,

614
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,940
home environment provides irreplaceable nourishment.

615
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,129
Only people who have actually married

616
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:28,360
can write good stories of daily trivialities in life.

617
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,370
Since I got married, I've been living with my mother-in-law.

618
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:35,910
Having children, working and leaving my job,

619
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,950
these events that are enough to change a woman's life,

620
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,220
I've gone through them all.

621
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,699
So I don't think I should abandon my family behind

622
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:47,700
when I start working again.

623
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:53,320
Surely during the eight years, I've thought a lot as well.

624
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,289
From the beginning when I was forced to quit my job

625
00:39:56,289 --> 00:39:59,660
and awaiting delivery at home to the later stage of my pregnancy

626
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,219
when my belly was getting bigger and bigger

627
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:04,800
and I had to sit in bed to sleep every day.

628
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,760
During the years after my daughter's birth,

629
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,280
I thought I was needed for so many things in my family.

630
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,220
I kept thinking why I had to get married

631
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,390
and why I had to give birth to her.

632
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,800
But when I looked into her eyes, I knew it… it was not her fault.

633
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,950
It is me who chose to give birth to her.

634
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:33,330
Sir, I know I'm not the only one who's been plagued

635
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,179
by the difficulties I talked about just now.

636
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:38,910
But I think we should have strict requirements for

637
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:42,520
women's professional competence in the workplace,

638
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:47,020
and we should avoid passing too harsh judgment on the identity of people like me

639
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,390
in the family as a married woman and a mother.

640
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:53,140
If I'm given this job,

641
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,720
I'm sure I'll work very hard.

642
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,089
Over the past eight years,

643
00:41:01,089 --> 00:41:03,050
I've recorded very carefully

644
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,590
all the details of my life.

645
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,900
Getting married.

646
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,900
Having children.

647
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,471
Watching my children grow up gradually day by day.

648
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,520
Mom.

649
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,080
If I take care of you, can you not grow old?

650
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,040
If you go on being a good girl, mommy will not grow old.

651
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,230
To me these are highly valuable

652
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,430
materials for my creation.

653
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:49,119
I hope I can pick up again

654
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,320
the pen I put down eight years ago

655
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:03,210
and start my life again.

656
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,040
All right. Well, Zhan Lu, do you have any questions for me?

657
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,360
If you don't, we'll contact you again if there's any follow-up later on, okay?

658
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,130
Thank you very much for giving me the chance for the interview today.

659
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,230
Thank you.

660
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,470
You are welcome. Goodbye.

661
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,050
Goodbye.

662
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,159
Are you done with the interview?

663
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,229
Mom.

664
00:42:33,229 --> 00:42:34,979
Go and lie in mommy's arms.

665
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:37,200
Here, give him to me.

666
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,660
Here, Dou Dou.

667
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,560
How's it going?

668
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,059
Lu Lu, let me tell you,

669
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:46,599
there's no rush to find a job. Take your time.

670
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:49,390
If you can't make it on your first try, then try twice or three times.

671
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,259
Now Dou Dou is weaned.

672
00:42:51,259 --> 00:42:52,950
I can also help you take care of him.

673
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,950
We've got plenty of time.

674
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,800
Why worry about not getting a good job?

675
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,730
