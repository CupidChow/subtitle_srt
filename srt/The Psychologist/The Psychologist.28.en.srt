18
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,310
I don't think we are so close.

19
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,870
We just crossed paths with each other

20
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,670
when we were young and didn't know better.

21
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,930
I heard that your EEG Technology Committee is having an internal voting.

22
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,160
Count me in.

23
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,720
- I am not welcome?
- Of course, you're welcome.

24
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,830
Since an old friend is here, then I'll offer you a cup of tea.

25
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,370
A full cup of tea suggests that the guest is not welcome.

26
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,620
Mr. Ye, I understand what you mean.

27
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,360
I just don't know

28
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
if you're speaking for everyone present.

29
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,630
Director, this is the plan for the next radio show.

30
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,230
Call me if you have any questions.

31
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,420
Stay. Come on.

32
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,320
Judging by your pale face, you didn't sleep much last night?

33
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,490
- I'm going to go if you don't have any questions.
- I do! Come back.

34
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,730
Come on.

35
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,460
You remind me of my son, Hao,

36
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,390
when I see you.

37
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,260
Do you remember

38
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,960
when my ex-wife and I were going through the divorce?

39
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,010
I was also devastated.

40
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,950
At that time, Hao was just a kid.

41
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,230
But this mature kid would pat me

42
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,370
on the shoulder and say, "Dad, it's okay.

43
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,150
Mom doesn't want to be with you, but I do."

44
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,920
This is kind of creepy that you suddenly brought this up.

45
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,680
Can you just say what you wan to say?

46
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,170
There are some people who are just passers-by in your life.

47
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,930
You know what I mean? You think they are important to you now.

48
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,960
But they are not worth mentioning when you tide over the difficult phase.

49
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,100
But you still haven't tided over your difficult phase, right?

50
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,180
I'm still trying.

51
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,310
All right, Director, I know what you mean.

52
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,840
It was just that Miao left so suddenly.

53
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,390
But I have moved on now.

54
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,400
You have?

55
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,580
Really? Believe me.

56
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,220
Actually, the reason I didn't want Miao to leave

57
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,200
was mainly for the sake of the team.

58
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,480
But as a leader, I can accept what has happened. Life is a long process.

59
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,910
I am glad that you've moved on.

60
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,860
Cheer up at work.

61
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,560
Keep your chin up!

62
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,040
Besides, we can't control the transfer of personnel.

63
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,030
We?

64
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,080
So even you weren't notified of Miao's transfer?

65
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,620
Young man, you are smarter than anyone else, you know that?

66
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,170
Your Night Talk to Your Heart ranked first in audience rate.

67
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,670
Director Pan was a hundred percent satisfied with you.

68
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,780
But you got all cocky when you just made a little achievement.

69
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,100
What were you thinking?

70
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,880
It's okay that you didn't answer my calls.

71
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,710
But he's senior management.

72
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,670
You didn't show him respect.

73
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,590
I would have been mad at you too if I were the boss.

74
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,180
So you mean...

75
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,030
Director Pan's acquiescence in Wang Zhuo's poaching from me

76
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,500
was trying to teach me a lesson?

77
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,170
Let's go with Plan B.

78
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,040
Plan B it is.

79
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,460
Why not Plan A?

80
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,950
But I think Plan B is better.

81
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,200
Let's put Miao's things away.

82
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,830
Clean up his stuff.

83
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,780
Right.

84
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,970
What are you talking about? Where's Qian Kaiyi?

85
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,550
You don't know yet, Sister?

86
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,350
Zhang Miao went to Time Interview.

87
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,540
Qian Kaiyi told me.

88
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,600
Although Qian acted as if he didn't care,

89
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,550
Miao has been working with him for years.

90
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,320
He must feel frustrated in his heart.

91
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,050
Brother Qian is stubborn.

92
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,010
He's reluctant to tell us no matter how sad it makes him.

93
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,340
We were talking about

94
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,350
maybe there's something we can do to soothe his wounded heart.

95
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,940
What are you going to do then?

96
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,780
According to our plan,

97
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,820
a thorough cleanup.

98
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,270
That's professional.

99
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,120
Leave Qian Kaiyi to me.

100
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,400
I won't need this.

101
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,390
- Go.
- Let's go.

102
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,740
Am I late?

103
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,810
No. We came early.

104
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,890
- What are you guys doing?
- A thorough cleanup.

105
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,840
No one notified me.

106
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,890
Good morning, Qian Kaiyi.

107
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,010
Thank you, He Dun.

108
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,380
Have you had breakfast yet?

109
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,140
Have some.

110
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,340
Let's eat breakfast together.

111
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,950
Brother Qian, I think it's nice to keep this cubicle vacant.

112
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,300
We can store files that we don't use often here.

113
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,620
Sorry.

114
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,380
What for?

115
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,210
I've moved on.

116
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,740
Miao has the right to make decisions on his own.

117
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,880
I shouldn't have interfered, nor do I have the right to interfere.

118
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,510
Anyway, let's all go hand in hand

119
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,410
Qian, I don't know if you have really moved on

120
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,230
or you just pretend that you have.

121
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,140
But while Miss He is here today,

122
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,050
I want to tell you guys what I think.

123
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,570
What I value most is you, Qian Kaiyi,

124
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,690
and your serious and responsible attitude towards radio shows.

125
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,920

whether it's Time Interview or Night Talk to Your Heart,

127

just do whatever show you want, and I'll be always following you.

128
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,950
- Me too.
- Me too.

129
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,230
I also support Night Talk to Your Heart.

130
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,690
Go get it!

131
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,550

Thank you for supporting me.

Okay. There's one less person now, so everyone's workload will definitely increase.

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,470
Thank you.

163
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,760
[Li Wei, an broker at an investment company]

164
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,180
Do you know what the differences between psychiatry and psychology are?

165
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,840
Psychology belongs to science and psychiatry belongs to medicine.

166
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,220
Psychology is an inter-discipline of social science and natural science.

167
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,860
Psychiatry is a natural science discipline.

168
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,210
Yes. Anything else?

169
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,160
Patients will go to a psychological counselor if their psychological disorder is minor.

170
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,020
But if there is a serious psychological problem, they need to see a psychiatrist.

171
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,190
Right?

172
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,980
This is a rough distinction.

173
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,730
More precisely, interventions of psychiatrists are mainly medication.

174
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,580
So do you know what the common biological basis of psychology and psychiatry is?

175
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,570
- Neuroscience.
- That's right.

176
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,440
Everyone, look at the blackboard.

177
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,590
I drew two circles.

178
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,520
The first circle

179
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,960
is neurology.

180
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,900
The second circle represents psychology.

181
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,340
What does the intersection represent?

182
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,630
Where they intersect is neuropsychology.

183
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,400
When we have a bicker with someone,

184
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,950
we would often say he's a psycho with a problem with his nerves.

185
00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:00,040
So does this "problem with his nerves" really refer to neuropathy?

186
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,270
- No, right?
- No.

187
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,130
We're actually saying there is a psychological problem with him, right?

188
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,950
Yes.

189
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:11,720
But now the phrase "psycho" has become more like a pet name.

190
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,800
Have you noticed that when I was talking about psychological problems, I covered my chest?

191
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,080
The "heart" we talk about is here.

192
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,500
But what about the "heart" in psychology?

193
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,230
Where is it?

194
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,790
That lady sitting in the last row,

195
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,520
what do you think?

196
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,440
In our brain.

197
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,580
Li Wei.

198
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,170
Li Wei?

199
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,740
Li Wei!

200
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,430
Are you all right? Are you okay? Li Wei?

201
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,900
Have some water.

202
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,470
Are you okay?

203
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,330
I saw you that you seemed to be very anxious.

204
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,250
I'm fine.

205
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,650
Excuse me. Can I smoke here?

206
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,840
Sorry.

207
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,710
Smoking is not allowed in the counseling room.

208
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,200
But we can go outside if you want.

209
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,390
Never mind then.

210
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,280
What happened to you just now?

211
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,910
I think the restaurant we went today deserves to be put in my favorite links.

212
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,240
Sister Wei?

213
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,490
What are you doing here?

214
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,170
Look at me, so clumsy.

215
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,260
I spilled the coffee.

216
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,480
Sister Wei, we tried to ask you to have lunch together.

217
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,760
Why didn't you reply to our WeChat messages?

218
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,250
- Right.
- Why?

219
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,710
Were you having a secret lunch-break date?

220
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,840
Sorry, Sister Wei.

221
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,510
I forgot you are ticklish.

222
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,690
Sister Wei, are you okay?

223
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,490
Excuse me.

224
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,180
Are you all right?

225
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,620
I'm fine.

226
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,910
I'll leave you gals to chat.

227
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,480
Xiaoxiao, did you read that post online?

228
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,170
Have you finished it?

229
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,260
Oh, that.

230
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,000
I just got to the part at the drinking party.

231
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,000
Now that you mention it, I have goose bumps all over when I think of it.

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,460
[He assaulted when I was drunk and scared. Couldn't move to resist. Will anyone believe me?]`

233
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,520
What should I do? I made an appointment with a client to talk business over dinner this evening.

234
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,860
Now it creeps me out that I don't want to go.

235
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,470
Don't be so paranoid.

236
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,470
Director Zheng is quite a gentleman.

237
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,840
But he does like to ask others to drink.

238
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,320
Just a little bit.

239
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,230
I am not as lucky as you.

240
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,100
My client Director Wang is all hands and so horny when we drink together

241
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,980
as if he hasn't seen a woman before in his life!

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,300
Aren't you scared?

243
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,450
He can only take some advantage of me.

244
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,250
He doesn't have the guts to do anything.

245
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,550
And he is a henpecked husband.

246
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,710
He'll stop every time I mention his wife.

247
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,170
If you ask me, this girl in the post was so weak.

248
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,550
So she only dared post an anonymous post online.

249
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,110
If it were me, I would drag that bastard down with me by ruining his life.

250
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,240
Me, too!

251
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,910
But if it were me who met such a thing, I don't think I would have the courage to speak out.

252
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,280
Hey, girl, don't lose sleep over it.

253
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,720
Anyway, this kind of thing won't happen to girls like us.

254
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,450
It won't happen to girls like us.

255
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,580
Girls like us.

256
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,420
What kind of girls do you think will meet such a thing then?

257
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,340
What kind of girls?!

258
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,570
What's going on?

259
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,840
What kind of girls do you think

260
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
they said would meet such a thing?

261
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,520
What do you think?

262
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,060
They can laugh at me and insult me.

263
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,350
I can live with that.

264
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:44,400
But it was their indifference that hurt me deeply.

265
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,200
This is not even the saddest part.

266
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,430
The saddest part is that I realized

267
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,620
I was actually one of them.

268
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,970
Judging others condescendingly. What have I become now?

269
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,190
Damaged goods. An indecent woman.

270
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:10,260
A lunatic who will flip over this topic at any time!

271
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,350
Because I used to agree with those statements as they did, this is my karma.

272
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,930
I deserve it.

273
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,180
Li Wei, do you still remember what we talked about last time?

274
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,160
The one and only reason for a rape

275
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,530
is the rapist.

276
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,210
I thought you agreed with it, too.

277
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,300
No, I deserve it.

278
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,390
I don't deserve sympathy from anyone.

279
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,170
I see that you seem to be always belittling yourself.

280
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,310
Are you doing this to punish yourself?

281
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,420
No one will understand me.

282
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,710
I shouldn't have spoken out.

283
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,590
I shouldn't have even thought about speaking out.

284
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,400
I should have taken it to the grave.

285
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,400
Is it really her?

286
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,290
Have you ever talked to others about it except me?

287
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,410
Did you get very negative feedback?

288
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,340
[Shameless, this woman wants to use her 15 minutes of fame.]

289
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,470
- It's promiscuous.
- Don't play the victim.

290
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,300
Didn't you enjoy it that night?

291
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,910
If you are really so innocent,

292
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,000
why would you go to the party in such a showy dress?

293
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,590
Anyway no one will understand me even if I speak out.

294
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,180
Li Wei.

295
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,480
You know, you are very brave.

296
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,390
You are the bravest and most driving among my visitors.

297
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,230
You didn't make any mistakes.

298
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,860
It wasn't your fault, at all.

299
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:24,220
Of course, if those voices in your head are disturbing you now, let's shield them.

300
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,540
Let's talk about something else now.

301
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,080
All right?

302
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,530
It won't work.

303
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,660
No one will sympathize with me.

304
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,330
Thank you, Sister Ling. I'm off.

305
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,780
Wait.

306
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,290
You haven't slept well recently, have you?

307
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,460
You always look lifeless.

308
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,500
Sorry. Sister Ling, did I make a mistake at work?

309
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,420
Our department has a place for expatriate study.

310
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,790
I recommended you to the management.

311
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,030
I thought you would give priority to other people.

312
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,390
I noticed what you've been through recently.

313
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,800
You were recruited to our company under my watch.

314
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,850
But there's nothing you can do.

315
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,890
I don't want to watch an excellent young employee

316
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,180
crushed by an unpleasant incident.

317
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,400
This is a good opportunity for you.

318
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,190
You can take the opportunity to leave town and adjust your mental state.

319
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:29,100
Sister Ling, what happened is just an unpleasant incident?

320
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,800
Xiao Wei,

321
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,540
I did it for your good.

322
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,200
We're both women.

323
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,300
I know how you must feel.

324
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:47,010
But what can we do if we experience this kind of thing?

325
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,980
I thought we liked each other.

326
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,590
But after what he's done to me,

327
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,410
you want me to pretend like nothing happened?

328
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,700
Silly girl.

329
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,480
You can go to the police or go to court to sue him if you have evidence.

330
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,670
But now you have nothing to go against him.

331
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,970
What's the point of ripping your wound open on the Internet over and over again

332
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,680
and tarnishing your reputation?

333
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:20,310
Xiao Wei, I want that scumbag to pay like you do.

334
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,710
But reputation is the most important thing for girls.

335
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:29,910
Remaining silent is the best way to protect yourself.

336
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,190
Li Wei.

337
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,970
Li Wei?

338
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,040
Li Wei.

339
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,850
I know it's hard for you.

340
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,320
But you are already very brave.

341
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,850
Do you think the only way for them to understand me a little bit

342
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,750
is for them to experience the same thing?

343
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,000
I know it's vicious to think so.

344
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,340
But I can't control myself.

345
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,520
I can't help it. I want to curse them.

346
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,500
I cursed them to experience the same thing as me.

347
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,000
Li Wei, if you really don't want to stand out to fight, you can choose an easier way.

348
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,130
Actually standing out and remaining silent are just two options.

349
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,460
There is no right or wrong in essence.

350
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,520
But you need to figure out what you really want.

351
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,230
I have no idea.

352
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,830
I don't know what to do and what choice to make.

353
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,750
It's too hard for me.

354
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,380
I don't know how I am supposed to carry on with my life.

355
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:59,920
If your colleagues tell you that they want to help you, will it make you feel better?

356
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,760
If this society tells you that they can understand you,

357
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,420
will you be able to speak out with more courage?

358
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,730
If I say that I will support you,

359
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,630
will it bring you more strength?

360
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,950
You mean

361
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,290
you will support me?

362
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:10,040
Certainly. I will definitely support you if you need it.

363
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,160
Thank you, Miss He.

364
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,660
But I might need some more time to think about it.

365
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,570
I understand.

366
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,510
Maybe what I just said has complicated your judgments.

367
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,420
Don't let what I just said sway your decision making.

368
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,400
You're the one to decide what to do in the end.

369
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,550
Miss He, your support means a lot to me.

370
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,930
I will think about it with clarity of thought.

371
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,780
I see.

372
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,820
Li Wei,

373
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,230
no matter what your decision is and whether other people will support you or not,

374
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,900
you'll be the one to live with all the consequences.

375
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,200
You need to keep it in mind.

376
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,720
Take your time. You can go back and think about it.

377
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,280
We can talk about this topic next time, okay?

378
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,570
Hello. Sister Xi, this is Lili.

379
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,970
We haven't talked for a long time.

380
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,590
I want to ask you a favor.

381
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,580
Do you remember a Director Qi who

382
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,800
dined with us on Yunjin financing cocktail party the other day?

383
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,970
No, nothing important.

384
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,800
I think I accidentally offended him last time.

385
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,000
I want to apologize.

386
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,210
Can you give me his contact information?

387
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,860
Thank you.

388
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,280
Old Ji.

389
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,510
What a pity that I wasn't there to witness the great show.

390
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:23,960
I heard that Ye Jicheng was defeated by you disgracefully again.

391
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,390
You're a well-informed source.

392
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,760
I can't hide anything from you.

393
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,260
I really admire you from the bottom of my heart.

394
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,060
Tell me the truth.

395
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:38,550
Did you know about Wen Liang and Ye Jicheng's trick a long time ago?

396
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,330
His name is Ye Niantang now.

397
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,510
I am just a hillbilly.

398
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,850
It's not like I am omniscient.

399
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,070
Ye Jicheng...

400
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,420
Interesting.

401
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,330
He changed his name as soon as he came back.

402
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,020
He is obviously targeting you.

403
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,720
Don't say that I didn't warn you.

404
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,760
As soon as Ye Jicheng came back, he changed his name and tried to interfere in the Society's affairs.

405
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,880
There must be something shady behind everything.

406
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,710
He's a businessman and everything he does is for his interests.

407
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:24,810
That's his own business whether he still has a bottom line.

408
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,400
None of us can control it.

409
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,350
I can hear your strategy of going with the flow and counter measure for measure.

410
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,110
But I think it might be better if we strike first to gain the initiative.

411
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:42,620
It's the perfect timing to get rid of the cancer in the Society.

412
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:48,460
I heard that your EEG Technology Committee is having an internal voting.

413
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,010
Count me in.

414
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,200
So it seems that

415
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,310
what you said about Wen Liang proved to be true.

416
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,130
What did I say?

417
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:13,620
You said that she is too ambitious so it's easy for her to go astray.

418
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,990
I can't remember it.

419
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:20,180
Aren't you tired of storing so much information in your head?

420
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,330
My memory is partitioned.

421
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,920
This sector is academic stuff and this is gossip only.

422
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,600
Good for you.

423
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,960
I need to ask you something.

424
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,060
What are you going to do with Wen Liang?

425
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,920
If you let her stay in the Society,

426
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,870
you are not afraid that Ye Jicheng will continue to use her to make more trouble?

427
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,520
When weed grows with vegetable,

428
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,310
it will affect the growth of vegetable.

429
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,260
But if you just scythe and leave it aside,

430
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,700
it will rot in the soil

431
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,530
and become the nutrition of vegetable.

432
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,370
There are silver linings

433
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,140
in life everywhere.

434
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:11,060
Sacrifice is needed whether it's for the academic study's sake or her ambition.

435
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,660
It depends on whether she has figured out what she really wants.

436
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,600
Director Qi, I have not seen you for a long time.

437
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,070
What is the project that makes you want to see me in a hurry?

438
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,610
Take a look.

439
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,040
[Catering Investment Project]

440
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,220
I remember that two years ago Tianqi invited Yunjin to work together

441
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,510
to invest five hundred million yuan for its catering retail technology project.

442
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,380
The project brought Yunjin 10% return on investment the next year.

443
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,420
I remember you said that food technology projects would keep booming in the next five years.

444
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:35,870
So I am very confident that this project will create another miracle with your support.

445
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,410
I just don't know if

446
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:43,960
Director Qi is willing to give me this chance.

447
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,210
Lili.

448
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,500
I remember that after you quit Cao Wanli's company,

449
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,610
you changed career to real estate, right?

450
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,890
That's a real money maker.

451
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,580
So why did you suddenly come to me for a small order like this?

452
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:24,830
To be honest with you, actually I got into a little trouble recently.

453
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,760
Oh, about Fang Zhongyi.

454
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,170
Don't get me wrong.

455
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:36,630
As you know, it's a small circle.

456
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,840
- I…
- Thank you,

457
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,410
I heard something about you two.

458
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:45,520
To tell you the truth, I just wanted to fall in love with someone. Simple as that.

459
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,280
I didn't expect things to turn out to be so complicated.

460
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,010
He bought my mom a shopfront.

461
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,260
Well, he did it voluntarily.

462
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,860
But later his wife would send someone to ask me for the money back on a regular basis.

463
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,050
I already pawned that shop.

464
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,310
I don't have the money to pay her back.

465
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,800
I wanted to sit in the office to make some money, too.

466
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,940
But I was desperate so I had to come out to get some extra money.

467
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,530
Lili, it will be pass over.

468
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,210
Everything will be fine.

469
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,460
But you should reflect on yourself.

470
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,480
Why would you date a guy who can't keep his wife under control?

471
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,730
It must be a lot for you to take.

472
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,810
Director Qi. Actually, you don't have to comfort me.

473
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,690
I've already thought it through.

474
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,540
This is life.

475
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,110
You have to rely on yourself for everything.

476
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,150
You can't rely on other people.

477
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,420
Only when you have money can you have the power.

478
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,960
Right?

479
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,430
I wanted to do this project when I was in Yunjin.

480
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,870
So I came to you this time.

481
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,220
[Catering Investment Project]

482
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,600
Director Qi, what are you doing?

483
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,760
I thought you came to me because you have made up your mind.

484
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:34,470
I think we should talk about business first.

485
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,540
Sure.

486
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,600
Your project plan is quite nice.

487
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,530
But you don't think I will invest

488
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,620
just with a few pieces of paper, right?

489
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,340
Of course, I know.

490
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:01,200
But Director Qi, I'm sure you understand

491
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,140
the things I've been through.

492
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,560
I'm just worried that I might cause you trouble.

493
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,230
Men.

494
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,380
So it's about men in the end.

495
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:18,170
Men are just like this project, or your job.

496
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:22,800
Replace him with someone else if you don't want him anymore.

497
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,720
You won't regret sleeping with me.

498
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,550
I don't have a wife.

499
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:35,270
And I'm more discreet than Fang Zhongyi.

500
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,760
In the past you had Yunjin behind your back.

501
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,080
But you work alone now.

502
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:50,340
If you don't give me something in return, why should I spend money on you?

503
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,970
Lili,

504
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,390
you are a smart girl.

505
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,150
You should know what the best thing

506
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,290
a woman can give

507
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,170
a man is.

508
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:12,250
Director Qi, you told Li Wei the same thing, right?

509
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,380
Didn't you abandon her after you got what you wanted?

510
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,370
Please don't be mad.

511
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:29,230
I just need to find out your bottom line since you like me.

512
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,880
You have to understand that I want more information.

513
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,390
After all, I don't want to be the second Li Wei.

514
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,500
Don't worry.

515
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,000
Be a good girl, and you don't have to worry about what happened to her.

516
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,360
Don't you worry that it might backfire on you when you escalated it on Internet?

517
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,800
Why would I worry that

518
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,020
it might backfire on me?

519
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,810
Li Wei said I forced her to have sex with her.

520
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,380
Who does she think she is?

521
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,700
She should feel honored that I wanted to sleep with her.

522
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:20,620
But that ungrateful girl bit me.

523
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,090
What's the result for her?

524
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,910
She got broken teeth.

525
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,230
Lili,

526
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:30,900
if you are determined to be my mistress,

527
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,560
you can't do as she did, you know?

528
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,710
Certainly.

529
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,140
Director Qi, can I take the liberty to ask

530
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,870
was it you who posted those photos on the Internet?

531
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,960
Yes.

532
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,040
I don't want to make things so complicated.

533
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,760
I like a lot of women.

534
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,510
There were a lot of them who didn't want to do it at first.

535
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:06,660
But I always had ways to make them submissive and obedient.

536
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,940
Li Wei was the only one who didn't appreciate my kindness.

537
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,000
So what's waiting for her is having her life ruined.

538
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,230
Okay, let's not talk about her.

539
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:23,830
Let's study your project thoroughly.

540
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,400
- Director Qi, Director Qi!
- Come on.

541
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,080
Director Qi, Director Qi, don't!

542
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,910
Director Qi, calm down.

543
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,330
Do you want to wash your car, sir?

544
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,870
No, I don't.

545
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,600
Thirty yuan each time. I'll make sure it's spotless.

546
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,760
Okay, fine! This is one hundred yuan. Get lost!

547
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,720
- Director Qi.
- That won't work.

548
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,000
Since you are busy, see you next time!

549
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,940
Lili! Come on!

550
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,700
I need to wash your car six times since you gave me one hundred yuan.

551
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,760
Out of my way!

552
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,110
How about a membership card?

553
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,490
Out of my way!

554
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,830
Out of my way!

555
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,400
Lili, Lili!

556
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,540
- I'm starting to wipe the car, sir.
- Lili!

557
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,330
- Thanks.
- Lili, you...

558
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,840
What the...

559
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:42,330
Director Qi, can I take the liberty to ask

560
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,960
was it you who posted those photos on the Internet?

561
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,270
Yes.

562
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:50,260
I don't want to make things so complicated.

563
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,380
I like a lot of women.

564
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,030
There were a lot of them who didn't want to do it in the beginning.

565
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:01,440
But I always had ways to make them submissive and obedient.

566
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,530
Li Wei was the only one who didn't appreciate my kindness.

567
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:08,720
So what's waiting for her is having her life ruined.

568
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,990
I didn't know that you have the potential to be a spy.

569
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,760
Where's the gear I want?

570
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,680
Think it through. It will be very dangerous for you.

571
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,230
Don't worry. Besides, I have you as my backup.

572
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,680
Lili, play it by ear after you go in his car.

573
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,760
And get out as soon as you get what you want.

574
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,120
I'll kick his ass if he really wants to do anything to me.

575
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,030
Your priority is to keep yourself safe.

576
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,120
Okay.

577
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,080
You have something to ask me?

578
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,560
It's okay, just say it.

579
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,670
Li Wei and you are not relatives or friends.

580
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,600
Why are you helping her like this?

581
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,950
Actually, I am not doing it for her.

582
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,140
I am doing it for myself.

583
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,560
I escaped without getting hurt when I met that scumbag.

584
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,120
I thought this thing would just go away.

585
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,970
But I've been thinking about it recently.

586
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:23,490
Had I taught him a lesson hard back then,

587
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:27,440
maybe those girls wouldn't be hurt by him that much.

588
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,840
Why are you laughing?

589
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,670
I think you have the potential of being a swordswoman in martial arts novels.

590
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,770
Then you are a swordsman.

591
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:47,420
It's called swordsman.

592
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,660
Greetings, swordsman.

593
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,600
Swordswoman.

594
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,800
The night is still young with cool breeze.

595
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,450
Coming up is Night Talk to Your Heart.

596
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,400
Welcome back. This is Night Talk to Your Heart

597
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:07,030
Miss He, one of the most-talked-about topics on the Internet recently is about imperfect victims.

598
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:12,290
From your personal point of view, what does the idea of imperfect victim mean?

599
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:15,600
I want to quote a musician who I like very much.

600
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,110
Leonard Cohen sang in Anthem,

601
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:23,180
"There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in."

602
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,230
Yes, indeed.

603
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:28,680
If you deliberately examine people with a magnifying glass,

604
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,070
there will be some blemish on everyone in a certain degree.

605
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,630
There is nothing perfect in the world.

606
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:38,000
We should accept the imperfections in us and other people instead of nit-picking.

607
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,570
Yes, there are many victims who feel ashamed because of their perceived imperfections within themselves.

608
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:46,370
So they can't bring themselves to ask for help.

609
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,420
Indeed.

610
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,190
In our opinion, when you are hurt,

611
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,680
instead of worrying about what other people might think of you,

612
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,040
you should send a message for help first time.

613
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,870
We want to protect our safety and safeguard our rights.

614
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:06,180
Yes, instead of calling them imperfect victims, I prefer to call them brave survivors.

615
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:11,770
In the face of a sudden danger, normally most people won't know what to do at first.

616
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,260
The psychological counseling cases in this TV series are artistically stylized for visual presentation purposes. Please seek help from professional psychological counseling institutions if you encounter similar cases or have other psychological distress.
