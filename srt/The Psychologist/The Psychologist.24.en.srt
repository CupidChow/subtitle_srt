19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,000
Li, it's all right with me.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,379
You can go and ask for Miss He's opinion.

21
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,530
All right, Brother Qian. Brother Qian, this is for you.

22
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,100
This is a list we've sorted out of messages left by people with needs of psychological counseling.

23
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,380
And these are the profiles of counselors who have signed up to be Heart Messengers.

24
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,720
And we've sorted them by visitors and counselors.

25
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,080
Great.

26
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,059
Then can we start matching?

27
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:11,429
Yes, but now the problem is each counselor

28
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:13,450
has a specialization of problems they are good at handling.

29
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,750
And each visitor has their own problems.

30
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,300
Now we are thinking about how to match those problems in a more effective way.

31
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,260
That's right. Besides, the visitors are not being specific about their demands in the written documents.

32
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,270
The bigger difficulty is we have no idea

33
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,550
what exactly the visitors' problems are

34
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,189
from the perspective of psychological counselors,

35
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:31,219
therefore, we dare not recommend counselors indiscriminately.

36
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,339
We must be responsible for our listeners.

37
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:34,979
Yes, look at this message.

38
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:36,929
She says "I'm burned out every day.

39
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:39,929
I'm not interested in anything and just want to sleep.

40
00:02:39,929 --> 00:02:43,749
I feel every day is a torture, but I can't figure out why."

41
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:44,980
"I have no sense of security.

42
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,979
Even if he shows me all the messages on his cellphone, it still doesn't work.

43
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:51,320
As soon as he's gone out, I stay at home shaking my legs.

44
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,930
I'm on pins and needles and can't fall asleep."

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,419
Many people don't know what their problems are,

46
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,289
so, they can only express their feelings,

47
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:02,920
which is enough to show they need professional psychological counselors

48
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,240
to clear their confusions for them.

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,940
Xiao Li, please bring the record of all the visitors to me to have a look.

50
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,499
All right, Brother Qian.

52

53
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:15,340
Okay.

54
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,010
We don't know what their problems are…

55
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,600
But we can pinpoint the sources of their problems.

56
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,360
- Brother, they've been printed.
- All right.

57
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,290
When we are choosing psychological counselors,

58
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,319
we must have a good grasp of the divisions.

59
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,490
Let's try to classify them.

60
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,500
"Whenever I have an exam coming up, I get stomach upsets.

61
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,160
When I go to the hospital, doctors say there's nothing wrong with my stomach.

62
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,910
I don't know if it is caused by too much nervousness."

School.

64
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,189
When we are choosing psychological counselors, we must have a good grasp of the divisions.

65
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,499
Here's one.

66
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:54,470
Wang Wenyu, Master of Psychology from Jingbei Normal University,

67
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,890
a certified psychological counselor.

68

I'm back again.

72
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,970
It was my fault.

73
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,330
I shouldn't have stopped you from pursuing your true love.

74
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,200
You were right, He Dun.

75
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,470
What… What happened to your face?

76
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,450
Are you a victim of domestic violence?

77
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,980
Let's go and report to the police.

78
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,150
What are you doing?

79
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,770
Are you still going put up with him on such an occasion?

80
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,270
He didn't do it.

81
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,210
Who did it then?

82
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,940
His wife.

83
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,520
By the way, let me introduce someone to you. She is my…

84
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,370
Hello.

85
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,370
I'm Tong Yao, Fang Zhongyi's wife.

86
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,000
Instead of being a domestic hen,

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,930
you want to fly high and become a phoenix?

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,350
- Stinky prostitute!
- You are very lucky.

89
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,820
It's a pity that you just don't have the fate.

90
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,210
Will I hold you up for receiving visitors?

91
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,020
No. I'll be closed for a few days.

92
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,810
Why?

93
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,410
I'm burned out. I want to take a few days off and stay with my mom.

94
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,870
Take a good rest over the next few days.

95
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,220
Why don't you scold me?

96
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,350
You've been conned as well.

97
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,830
That scumbag is the one to blame.

98
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,500
But I still feel so bad.

99
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,550
All right. Let's have an analysis.

100
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,830
What's good about him that makes you feel so bad?

101
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,430
- What do you like about him? In what way is he good?
- He's nice to me.

102
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,200
- And?
- He's rich.

103
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,740
All right. Are you the only one he's being nice to?

104
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,990
Can you guarantee he'll be nice to you forever?

105
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,990
Is his money yours?

106
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,970
Don't you have the money he spent on you?

107
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,370
So, what the hell do you feel bad about?

108
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,070
- To hell with the scumbag.
- To hell with the scumbag.

109
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,030
To hell with the scumbag!

110
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,420
My garden finally becomes alive.

111
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,490
Just take my home as your own home from now on.

112
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,080
Tell me what you want to eat, and then I'll make it for you.

113
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:46,600
Young people should eat more meat.

114
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,070
How old are you, Jiahui?

115
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,150
I was born in 1991.

116
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,320
In the Year of the Goat?

117
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,650
Yes.

118
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,750
So, you are a year older than He Dun?

119
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,180
Yes.

120
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,959
This is my Telesphorus.

121
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,870
I remember when I was a child, I once fell ill and my mother gave this to me.

122
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,440
I slept with it in my arms and recovered straight away.

123
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,090
Since then, it has become my patron saint.

124
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,210
Now I give it to you.

125
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,379
It means so much to you, yet you are giving it to me?

126
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:19,030
I hope you can get better soon.

127
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,220
I dropped everything and left.

128
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,590
This is a mistake I have to bear for the rest of my life.

129
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,780
I left the child to you

130
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,710
because you had always loved him

131
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,830
and I hope you could go on protecting him

132
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,830
and give him a stable life.

133
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,180
Your mother wouldn't end up like this

134
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,250
if it weren't for Ji Mingcong.

135
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,420
After being her tutor for a long time,

136
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,860
I see her as my own child.

137
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,700
Have you ever fallen in love with someone?

138
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,290
No.

139
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,540
Tang Lili, you are so badly injured.

140
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,190
How are you going to do boxing?

141
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,600
He Dun, I know you closed your practice for a few days to keep me company.

142
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,670
But if our big-name psychological counselor Miss He is really not available,

143
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,510
who knows how many people would get lost with no way to return?

144
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,060
So, I've decided to do something for their benefit.

145
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,169
I'm going to do boxing to vent out my anger.

146
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:41,750
Our life has to go on, doesn't it?

147
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,559
But the thing is, I don't know how to do boxing.

148
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,950
It's all right. Someone does.

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,030
Qian Kaiyi?

150
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,399
What brings you here?

151
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,130
Let me set the record straight. I didn't offer to come myself.

152
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,270
It is Lili who asked me to come.

153
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,950
Have you recovered from your injuries?

154
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,710
They are nothing but bruises and scratches. Don't worry.

155
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,370
He Dun, I need your help.

156
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,080
How are you?

157
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,689
Jab-jab-straight is the basic move of boxing.

158
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:31,690
Have you heard of it?

159
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,060
It's often used in actual combat.

160

an antidepressant called Prozac which can only be taken under the guidance of a doctor,

which is to say no to such a mechanical and tedious life.

Because she said over the past 20 years,

300
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,980
her neighbors have been addressing her as Mrs. Wang.

The moment she got her driver's license

and saw her name on the license, she was overwhelmed with emotions.

303

At that moment, she thought she was no longer Mrs. Wang or her children's mother.

304
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,990
She was just herself.

She had her own name other than the label of housewife.

I've begun to have some new ideas about a lot of things.

00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:29,090
I found that all our listeners talked about their families.

310
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,900
I found that when we were talking about how to say no and why we dare not

311
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,180
say no to others, quite a few listeners…

stem from one's past growth and experiences,

there will be a spontaneous change in their behavior.

00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,240
That's to say when you find a change in your heart, the same change

320
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,079
can be found in your behavior correspondingly.

321
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,170
In fact, the formation of character in each of us

322
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,660
may have something to do with family atmosphere

323
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,020
and growth environment, but please believe that

324
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,350
you can use your strength to change and have a new lease of life.

325
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,260
Miss He, I have a question.

326
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,350
When our personal growth and choice clash with

327
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:26,100
our family's expectations, how should we make a choice and trade-off?

328
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,110
I think not just family members,

329
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:33,090
when our personal choice clashes with anybody's expectations,

330
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,189
we should all understand each other and show mutual support and honesty.

331
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,330
We've seen such kind of people in our lives.

332
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,540
They respond to standards set by others.

333
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,180
They cater to others and please others.

334
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,710
They are deeply mired in the obstinate obsession that I must do well,

335
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:57,210
I must be kind and I must not let down people who care about me.

336
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,660
Over time, they speak words that are not from their heart,

337
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,060
but their mind and body have been suffering.

338
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,060
By doing so, they are abandoning individualized development

339
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,000
while hindering establishment of genuine relationships.

340
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,030
All right. Stay with us for more after a commercial.

341
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,350
It's raining hard.

342
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,800
Yes.

343
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,310
Thank you, Mr. Liu. I'd certainly get wet in the rain if it weren't for you.

344
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,209
It's nothing. I happened to be heading in the same direction.

345
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:33,190
- All right. I'm going home then.
- Take this umbrella with you.

346
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,539
This umbrella… Is it my mother's?

347
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:40,410
Yes. I borrowed it from Auntie during the day today.

348
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,570
- How are you going home then? Take it.
- It's all right, it's okay.

349
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,720
It's a light rain. I usually don't carry an umbrella.

350
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,000
- Thanks.
- All right. Please go.

351
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,880
Mom.

352
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,640
Mom.

353
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,470
Mom! Mom, are you inside?

354
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,060
Mom!

355
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,890
This is the third time you've pretended to be dead.

356
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,260
It's not funny at all.

357
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,950
Mom, is it not stuffy in the bedroom?

358
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,240
Don't forget your daughter is a student of psychology.

359
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,540
Come out.

360
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,990
[10:35]

361
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,420
The umbrella with which the security guard Mr. Liu escorted me home is yours.

362
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,990
He said you lent it to him during the day.

363
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,990
But it didn't rain during the day at all.

364
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,630
The TV set is still warm, which shows you turned it off no more than 10 minutes ago.

365
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,950
The rain started 15 minutes before I came home.

366
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,250
And the raindrops on the windowsill show that you've just closed the window.

367
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,460
When you saw me coming home from a distance,

368
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,889
you spilled the fake blood you prepared onto the floor.

369
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,260
Meanwhile, you spilled some on the doorknob as well.

370
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,480
The blood stain on the doorknob

371
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,180
shows you entered the room from the outside.

372
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,260
Mom, I tell you what,

373
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,450
you've really scared me this time, do you know?

374
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,110
I'm not going to come home if you do this again.

375
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,020
I'm really pissed off.

376
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,810
I'm leaving.

377
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,880
Jun Jun…

378
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,850
Jun Jun!

379
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,760
You have blood all over your face.

380
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,300
Like the face of a calico cat.

381
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,009
Don't do this again next time.

382
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:29,390
You scared the hell out of me.

383
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,590
I really didn't mean to scare you.

384
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,060
The last couple of days I was watching… No touch.

385
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,140
Look, this is a mixture of lipstick and red wine.

386
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,680
Doesn't it look like real blood?

387
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,410
Yes.

388
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,970
Let me wipe it off for you.

389
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,630
You can smack me if you are angry with me.

390
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,830
Why don't you smack me?

391
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,740
- No.
- Do it.

392
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,150
I just don't want you to weep secretly.

393
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,730
And bottle up everything in your heart.

394
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,380
I didn't.

395
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,269
Just now I… Just now I was just scared,

396
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:57,060
so I cried a little.

397
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,360
I'm all right now. Really.

398
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,400
Are you really not angry?

399
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,160
I'm not going to caress you then.

400
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,020
What a nuisance!

401
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,660
What's up?

402
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,660
Didn't you smell…

403
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,139
Something seems to be burned, doesn't it?

404
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:20,590
Yes, I made another mistake.

405
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,990
I was cooking pork tripe and chicken with Chinese pepper for you.

406
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,660
It must be burnt.

407
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,900
Why do I keep making the same mistake?

408
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,810
I'm sorry.

409
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,029
What mood are you expressing with that look on your face?

410
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,240
Being in love?

411
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,850
Being conned?

412
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,730
Had an argument?

413
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,980
With such a sharp tongue, you are not supposed to lose an argument.

414
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,620
Why are you standing in my vegetable plot?

415
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,320
Such a big chunk of you is sticking here, blocking the sunshine

416
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,450
and taking away the nutrition of my cabbage.

417
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,730
You are getting shrewd now.

418
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,660
You've learned to cheat your teacher who's giving you emotional therapy by way of a sting.

419
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,060
I've finished my apprenticeship.

420
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,870
Have I taught this?

421
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,060
I didn't cry.

422
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,370
You even blame me?

423
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,950
The cabbage is helpless and ends up as a dish for people in the world.

424
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:50,110
While you have no worries about food and clothing,

425
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,960
you are doing things you like, have quite a few friends and such a good mother,

426
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,830
and you want to compete against the cabbage?

427
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,670
Do you think that once a mistake is made,

428
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,260
there will be no way to fix it?

429
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,690
It's just like a ditch which is always there.

430
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:16,230
No matter how hard you try, toiling and moiling throughout a dozen years.

431
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,330
You thought time could fill everything up,

432
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:25,230
only to find it's covered with fallen leaves.

433
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,430
Since you couldn't see it,

434
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,420
you thought it was not there.

435
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,770
Actually, it's been there all the time.

436
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,469
This doesn't sound quite like what a psychological counselor would say.

437
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,750
Now I'm just a lost daughter.

438
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,629
My mom asked me to come home for dinner yesterday.

439
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,670
When I was back, I found she was locking herself in the room

440
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,770
and the doorknob was covered with blood.

441
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,340
It turned out to be a mischief.

442
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,510
She painted it with lipstick.

443
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,340
An old kid's mischief.

444
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,180
How interesting that was!

445
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,450
She started calling me Jun Jun again.

446
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,480
She was doing it unconsciously before.

447
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,180
But now I'm not sure.

448
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,360
What do you think?

449
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,210
It's raining again.

450
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,760
What are you smiling at?

451
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,610
You've given me a conundrum.

452
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,260
Shall I answer it as your teacher, your friend or a psychological counselor?

453
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,970
As a psychological counselor,

454
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:09,680
the first two identities are an impediment.

455
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,380
As a friend, I'm not good at comforting people.

456
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,459
As your teacher, what I'm going to say is even harsher.

457
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,630
Go ahead.

458
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,780
First, I have to criticize you.

459
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,280
Troubles start with solicitude.

460
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,590
You ignored the simplest question in your narrative of the matter.

461
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:39,159
Let's first set aside the assumption that she's blaming you intentionally.

462
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:43,260
What does your mother's fake death mean?

463
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,750
Excessive attention to death.

464
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,249
Because of my younger brother.

465
00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:52,850
You are actually not to blame.

466
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:59,319
As her daughter, you can't make an object analysis of the matter indeed.

467
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:01,830
Compared with your brother's death back then,

468
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,440
for people of my age,

469
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:10,710
when we get old, nobody can avoid the common failing of human nature.

470
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,920
It is not death that we fear.

471
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:18,710
It is... separation from our loved ones.

472
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,770
She's probably being more concerned…

473
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,780
about her own death.

474
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,100
Miss Xiao Wen.

475
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Ms. Zhao. Come in please.

476
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,640
Okay.

477
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,410
Sorry.

478
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,660
Has your visitor just left?

479
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,430
Why did you come early today?

480
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,850
It's like this.

481
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,040
Thanks. I like your tea very much.

482
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,129
It's like this.

483
00:35:37,129 --> 00:35:40,480
At the end of our last counseling session, you said something about…

484
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,340
about… about post-traumatic…

485
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,080
- Post-traumatic stress disorder.
- Yes, yes, yes. That's the one.

486
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,370
I thought about it back at home.

487
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,280
I suddenly thought of something today

488
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,959
and wondered if it could be related to this thing.

489
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,130
Tell me more.

490
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:58,240
Ever since my younger brother was washed away by a flood,

491
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:04,210
I had been blind for a long time.

492
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,380
My mother thought I might have fallen into the river

493
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,460
or bumped into a stone, so she took me

494
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,479
for a checkup in several big hospitals, but nothing was found.

495
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:22,299
For a very long time, I liked going to our balcony and sitting there

496
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:28,030
to feel the warmth of the sun as if I was fearful of cold and damp places.

497
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,650
Mom,

498
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,990
what are you doing there?

499
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,470
How long did your blindness last?

500
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,720
For about…

501
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,210
half a year.

502
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,230
How did you recover from it later on?

503
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,270
It was… It was a miracle.

504
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,100
Nobody would believe it.

505
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,890
Later on, I lost hope about recovery.

506
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,340
And I just felt my way

507
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,570
up and down the stairs every day.

508
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:30,029
One day, I was feeling my way along the stairs as usual.

509
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:33,439
My hand suddenly slipped, and I rolled down to the bottom of the stairs.

510
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:35,550
When I got up from the bottom of the stairs,

511
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,860
I suddenly saw everything.

512
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,470
And then there has been no relapse.

513
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:45,090
Up to this day. my eyesight has been good.

514
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:50,370
Sounds like your blindness back then was not caused by an organic problem.

515
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:54,050
Both your blindness and recovery

516
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,950
which is similar to conversion disorders.

517
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,260
Of course, when people suffer a strong mental shock,

518
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,120
it's possible for them to show symptoms of visual dysfunction.

519
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,009
Some people also show symptoms of loss of speech, loss of hearing or paralysis.

520
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:12,600
So, do you mean my trauma and blindness are interrelated?

521
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,620
There is such a possibility.

522
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,270
When people suffer a strong mental shock,

523
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,750
they tend to show a strong emotional response.

524
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:23,310
When their emotions are not given a normal outlet, the brain will resort to

525
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:26,740
a variety of somatic disorders to eliminate or mitigate such a response.

526
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:32,150
If such a response is gone, can it show I've fully recovered?

527
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:35,620
Not necessarily. Associations or reliving your emotions

528
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,180
at the time of the first episode are very likely to lead to a relapse.

529
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,690
And the relapse is very likely to be caused by suggestions or auto-suggestions.

530
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,660
Miss Xiao Wen,

531
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,000
will I be blind again

532
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,900
or be blind forever?

533
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,789
You don't have to worry about this.

534
00:38:56,789 --> 00:39:00,370
Conversion disorder is not an imperative problem for us to solve at the moment.

535
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:04,420
If there was no relapse back then, the probability of a relapse is not high.

536
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,580
Just that in the upcoming exposure therapy,

537
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,710
we need to take such a risk into account

538
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,270
and have a good grasp of the progress of exposure,

539
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,430
and there's not going to be a problem.

540
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,960
- Next, let's come back to PTSD we talked about last time.
- Okay.

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,670
Please tell me more about your symptoms.
