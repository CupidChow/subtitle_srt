He moved his stuff?

19
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,670
Everything.

20
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,350
Where's Dong?

21
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,110
Brother Dong went to help Brother Miao move his things.

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,860
You guys go ahead.

23
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,760
You are always like this.

24
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,120
You get dates through work and you use your dates to help you in work.

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,270
If this continues, can you still tell if you really mean it by what you say?

26

He Dun, the last Say No Special Show ranks first in audience rate.

It ranks first among all shows of my station and shows of that time slot.

29
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,860
This is great. We did it!

30
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,550
He Dun, thank you.

31
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,150
What for?

32
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,760
I am very happy to do Night Talk to Your Heart with you.

33
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,170
Are you okay? You look so absent-minded.

34
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,829
I got a WeChat message and I thought someone sent me a message.

35
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:04,170
It was just an ad push.

36
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,420
Are you waiting for someone's call?

37
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,630
I'm not, okay?

38
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,150
Who do you think you're lying to? I know you better than anyone else in the world.

39
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,860
Talk to me, while I don't have work to do now.

40
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,460
What's going on?

41
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,040
I guess I can tell you.

42
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,250
Since you're here, help me analyze the situation.

43
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,750
I am all ears.

44
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,470
Qian Kaiyi hasn't contacted me for a day which never happened to him before.

45
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,090
What does this mean?

46
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,849
Oh my God.

47
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:39,580
Dear, you already start to worry about if you'll lose him, you know?

48
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,960
Qian Kaiyi is good.

49
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,140
He's now playing hard to get!

50
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,290
What do you mean?

51
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,140
Let me analyze it for you.

52
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,770
Usually, if it were me meeting such a guy who wouldn't reply to my WeChat messages,

53
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,010
I would just pay him a visit without hesitation.

54
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,549
Then I would ignore him when he comes back to hit on me.

55
00:04:55,549 --> 00:04:57,620
This is called tit for tat.

56
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,820
But from my personal experiences, guys who would do so are all assholes.

57
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,220
Qian Kaiyi is definitely not an asshole.

58
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,590
So there must be a reason.

59
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,540
As for what the reason is...

60
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,820
Can it be that he's in danger?

61
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,640
He's not in a car accident, right?

62
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,260
No, no. I didn't mean to jinx it. But you might want to call him. Really.

63
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,389
You are right. Maybe he is in danger.

64
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:20,420
Yes.

65
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,250
I need to ask him what's going on.

66
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,890
Hello?

67
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,900
Qian Kaiyi,

68
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,350
Yes.

69
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,870
Are you busy now?

70
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,750
What's up?

71
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,450
N-N-Nothing important.

72
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,129
You, you... Is this a bad time to call you?

73
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:56,210
I just called to ask how you are doing today.

74
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,900
I'm fine.

75
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,390
Then I won't disturb you.

76
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,940
What, what's that supposed to mean?

77
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,879
I felt like he was very indifferent when I called him.

78
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,000
And he didn't want me to go to see him.

79
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,350
Let me tell you, this is typical men behavior. They're all changeable.

80
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,500
It's okay, baby. We don't need him since he's ignoring you.

81
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,760
I am always here for you, okay?

82
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,859
But I have a feeling that he actually needs me deep down.

83
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:36,939
He is not in a good mood right now. I need to go check on him.

84
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,440
So you want to take the initiative to woo him?

85
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,750
Am I really that obvious?

86
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,650
Very.

87
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,550
But it doesn't matter. If you want to go, just go.

88
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,089
You are right. I have to go.

89
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,920
Maybe this is love.

90
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,529
Professor Ji, what does the Psychological Society usually do?

91
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,600
There are serious factions in the Society.

92
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,419
The old guys have found themselves incompetent and the young people are ambitious.

93
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,750
How time flies.

94
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:19,550
What was I thinking back then that I thought I could make some difference by myself?

95
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,000
But I believe you must have made some difference when you were younger.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,350
Don't flatter me.

97
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,050
I was just an ordinary man.

98
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,349
So many years have passed and the old problems are still there.

99
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:38,209
I'm happy enough if I could always mend my way and do my own things right.

100
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,640
You play chess, too?

101
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,750
Yes, but just occasionally.

102
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,390
Play a game with me.

103
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,910
Sure.

104
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,370
Let's have a bet.

105
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,940
Whoever wins can get an item from the lost one.

106
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,440
Okay.

107
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,950
The younger one can go first.

108
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,290
So it's a handicap game.

109
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,100
Professor Ji, how did you grow into a habit of playing chess?

110
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,830
I'm getting older.

111
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,230
I need to have a hobby to force my brain to work.

112
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,830
Let's start.

113
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,710
You're good.

114
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,050
Few people play chess among my students.

115
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,250
He Dun is a lousy player.

116
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,650
I know.

117
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,750
He Dun doesn't like playing games.

118
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,610
You know a lot about her.

119
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,410
So did you have a talk with her?

120
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,200
I asked her out

121
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
but she turned me down.

122
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,490
You are an excellent man.

123
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,080

I was one step too late.

126
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,300
Professor Ji, how about you?

127
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,760
How did you win your wife's heart?

128
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,090
Me?

129
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,250
I never got married.

130
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,360
I saw a purple bracelet at your house last time.

131
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,640
I thought it was Mrs. Ji's.

132
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,740
A friend gave it to me.

133
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,840
Just a friend?

It's so unique.

137
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,760
You made it?

138
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,090
Yes.

139
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,249
I like making handicrafts, It's just a hobby of mine.

140
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,969
Handicraft art such as carving can be trifling and humble,

141
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:33,100
but they have paid a price others find it hard to understand to master this art.

Why didn't you choose to drop Night Talk to Your Heart?

00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,709
- Look at this.
- What happened to your face?

164
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:31,339
I fell on my way.

165
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:32,659
It's okay. It's just a minor injury.

166
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:35,560
Look at this news peg, Look at these photos.

167
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,540
Let's get started!

168
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,939
Aloha Shirt, what's the fun of drinking alone?

169
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,830
So Dong told you?

170
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,290
Two glasses of draft beer. Thanks.

171
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,140
Hello, this is your beer.

172
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,630
Thank you.

173
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,300
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Enjoy.

174
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,500
In fact, no matter when I was doing Time Interview before

175
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,511
or when I'm doing Night Talk to Your Heart now,

176
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:55,470
I always feel that

177
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,530
I should seize the opportunity, and I do want to seize it.

178
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,190
Can I ask you a question?

179
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,080
Did you quit Time Interview because of me?

180
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,569
He Dun, you're just being paranoid.

181
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:13,710
- About it...
- I'm not being paranoid because

182
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,290
I know you did it because of me.

183
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,860
To be honest,

184
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,760
I accepted to do this show

185
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,240
because of you, too.

186
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,279
Because the value and significance of Night Talk to Your Heart are far more than

187
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,270
the significance of the two of us doing it together.

188
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,190
So will you still want this show to continue

189
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,130
even if one day we won't partner anymore?

190
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,530
Certainly.

191
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,940
And I will pray that the show can become better and better.

192
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,220
There are so many listeners who need it.

193
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,990
I see.

194
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,749
I don't know why you chose to leave Time Interview.

195
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:12,899
But I believe that whatever decision you make will prove to be right in the end.

196
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,100
You will always have my support.

197
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,890
Actually, when we were doing Time Interview,

198
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,100
it had a topic every time and it was quite much-talked-about.

199
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,720
But these topics were always about top intellectuals or celebrities.

200
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,180
But for me,

201
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,199
giving a platform for more audience to say what they want to say

202
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:50,789
is much more important than letting one person to talk about his or her opinions.

203
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:52,630
Besides, so many people

204
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,540
have become happier or braver through our show.

205
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,339
They found ways to relieve the distress they have in life through our show.

206
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,579
So I will not give up Night Talk to Your Heart easily.

207
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,640
This choice is no longer mine and mine alone.

208
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,849
I can see you're sad because Zhang Miao left. Right?

209
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,040
Everyone is entitled to make a choice.

210
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,570
We will part ways sooner or later.

211
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,650
Life is a long process.

212
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,300
But there are still many people with you at this period, including me.

213
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,490
You can really drink, Aloha Shirt.

Look.

218
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,240
I had a makeover

219
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,460
and I also bought some new clothes.

220
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,380
I thought I wouldn't like this kind of

221
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,510
girlish color.

222
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:45,630
But this color does seem to make people's mood brighter.

223
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,270
I also tried to focus on other things.

224

Things are changing for the better for me, right?

225

Yes.

I can see that you are more energetic than before.

227

You're also trying to make changes, which is a good thing.

That man came to me again.

232
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,370
He dragged me to a corner and threatened me.

233
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,229
Even though I cried and accused him for

234
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:25,120
everything he did to me,

235
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,310
he had the nerve to say that we both wanted it to happen.

236
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,160
He had my consent and we liked each other.

237
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,620
But you know that it's not true.

238
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,140
I know.

239
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,629
That's not what happened. You were forced by him.

240
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:41,199
But he just sounded as if he didn't do anything wrong.

241
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,040
It makes me feel like I'm completely screwed.

Tell me,

243

I've changed so much, so why can't he leave me alone?

244

Why would he still want to hurt me?

245
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,470
Why is he pestering me?

246
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,199
Li Wei, have you tried to talk to anyone about what happened?

247
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:05,610
No, you know, it'll ruin me!

248
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,160
And like he said,

249
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,560
no one would believe it

Did something happen that made you so sure?

Actually, you already said no to him.

You just rejected him in a way as if it wasn't a big deal.

You didn't allow him to have further body touch.

325
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,260
so it would become my blemish

326
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,240
and everyone will keep dwelling on it.

327
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,490
They will point fingers and judge me.

328
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:43,489
You asked for it. You deserve it!

329
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,960
Miss He,

330
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,640
do you think

331
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,210
maybe everything happened is really all my fault?

332
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,180
Of course not.

333
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,779
The rapist is the one who did the wrong thing.

334
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:07,140
You didn't do anything wrong.

335
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,110
Maybe.

336
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,040
But some people won't care.

337
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,970
They will only say,

338
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,089
"I heard she was so desperate to climb up the ladder as soon as she joined the company.

339
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:23,879
She isn't some innocent girl."

340
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:27,349
I heard that she and the new client are having an affair.

341
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,830
Sister Li Wei.

342
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,389
"It's promiscuous for a woman to drink so much wine at night."

343
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:40,250
Do you think Director Qi seems to be interested in Li Wei?

344
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,840
Come on!

345
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,900
Director Qi is so rich.

346
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,909
She's the one who gets herself a sweet deal if he's really into her.

347
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:49,570
You're right.

348
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,070
Don't play the victim.

349
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,380
If you are really so innocent, why would you go to the party in such a showy dress?

350
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,030
Li Wei.

351
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,640
Li Wei!

352
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,060
Miss He, you see,

353
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,640
I haven't said anything yet,

354
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,930
and they already have so many things that they can accuse me of.

355
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,970
Because I want to climb up the ladder.

356
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,690
Because I didn't cover every inch of my skin.

357
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,701
Because I'm not that kind of good girl they want.

358
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:45,950
So...

359
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:51,230
Actually there won't be any difference whether I tell the truth or not.

360
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,470
I asked for everything that happened to me.

361
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,659
Okay. Now let's suppose

362
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,579
if you weren't in a revealing dress

363
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:05,739
the night it happened and you had acted like the good girl they said,

364
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:07,940
what do you think would happen?

365
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,580
Beautiful, cheers.

366
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,400
I'm sorry, Director Qi.

367
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,060
I really have a low tolerance.

368
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,980
You can't drink?

369
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,840
How are we going to talk business without alcohol?

370
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,920
Director Qi, don't be angry.

371
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,190
What's going on?

372
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,360
Let me tell you,

373
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,970
if you don't drink this glass of wine, you're not showing me respect.

374
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,190
That's not true, Director Qi.

375
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,940
Director Qi, allow me to make a toast to you.

376
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,950
Drink more.

377
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,249
How nice. Now we can talk business since you can drink, right?

378
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:22,009
I like you.

379
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:25,100
Li Wei, right?

380
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,860
Come on.

381
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,670
I'll make another toast to you.

382
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,949
So No matter how much you want to climb up the corporate ladder,

383
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:37,330
no matter how much clothes you put on to cover your body,

384
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,499
or how much you turn yourself into the perfect girl, you are still you.

385
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:43,790
You still can't change what the perpetrator thinks.

386
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,539
You can think you are not perfect.

387
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:49,059
But you can't think this is your fault.

388
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:50,249
You know?

389
00:28:50,249 --> 00:28:53,839
The occurrence of a rape has one and only one reason.

390
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,780
That's the rapist.

391
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,651
Now let's take a look at these three cards again.

392
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:01,880
Desire,

393
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,659
frivolous, I'm not perfect

394
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,680
You wrote these three cards.

395
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,420
I think you can tear them up now.

396
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,119
These words are very likely to become

397
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,190
three daggers that others use to stab you in the future.

398
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:34,119
They may also become excuses for the rapist to hurt you.

399
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,280
Very good.

400
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:43,170
Nobody can deny the pain you experienced before.

401
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,420
Also, no one can deny you for it.

402
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,420
How's it going with the order?

403
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,160
Not done yet...

404
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,610
Director Qi, hello.

405
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:33,169
Xiao Wei is here, too. Long time no see.

406
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,470
By the way, I need to ask you something.

407
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,820
I read the investment plan you gave to me.

408
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,120
But there is one thing I am not so sure.

409
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,159
Why does your department want to spend 20% of my investment on the technology sector

410
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,390
instead of the Internet sector like we agreed?

411
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,820
Director Qi,

412
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,550
it's a complicated question that I can't explain briefly.

413
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,020
I'll ask my director to talk to you later.

414
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,949
Director Qi. Sorry.

415
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:23,400
I didn't hit you, did I?

Stop pretending.

432

Didn't you enjoy it that night?

You make me sick.

434
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,330
Li Wei,

435
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,400
I thought we like each other.

436
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,590
What did I do wrong?

437
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,420
I can do better.

438
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,820
Really.

439
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,970
I spent countless nights

440
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,950
struggling before I typed the first word.

441
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,600
I also thought maybe

442
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,330
I should let the wound rot in my heart over time.

443
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,180
But the scars always remind me that

444
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:33,330
the compromise is the biggest harm to myself.

445
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,170
Maybe I won't get understanding or support

446
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,650
after I speak out what happened to me.

447
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,760
But I still want more people to know

448
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,050
what a monster did to me.

449
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,760
I was raped.

450
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,000
He raped me when I was drunk.

451
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,710
I was so afraid that I couldn't move

452
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,420
and I couldn't resist.

453
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:13,630
I don't know why, but I do know

454
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,450
it was against my will.

455
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:22,529
Maybe no one will believe me even after I tell the truth.

456
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:25,720
But I think I have to say it.

457
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:33,509
Why the rapist would still act so condescendingly and pretend as if nothing happened?

458
00:34:33,509 --> 00:34:36,330
On the contrary the victim

459
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,780
had to act so cautiously

460
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,770
and even blamed herself for it?

It's just because I know…

You need to know it's not your fault.

465

Nobody can deny the pain you experienced before.

466

Also, no one can deny you for it.

489
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:44,271
Let's not talk about this topic today.

490
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,520
Today's topic is to recommend a newcomer to the society.

491
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,970
You have such a big heart and so magnanimous.

492
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:57,030
I've heard of Wen Liang.

493
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,430
She's very young and promising.

494
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,550
She's not really a newcomer.

495
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:05,829
But after all, she hasn't officially debuted in the circle so she has less prestige.

496
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:11,020
If this society wants to develop, it needs new blood.

497
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,230
It's a good thing that Wen Liang has what it takes.

498
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,930
We can add momentum to her.

499
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:20,120
It's just that Ji Mingcong...

500
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,520
You only need to worry about the voting.

501
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,400
I'll take care of the rest.

502
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,710
Then we can be rest assured since you've given your words.

503
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,160
If it weren't for your research,

504
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:40,220
we all preferred you to be our leader.

505
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,860
I didn't hear what you said quite clearly.

506
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,870
But I get what you mean.

507
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:48,140
We don't want someone who's too aggressive.

508
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:53,919
If she always insists on her own ideas, it won't be a good thing.

509
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:59,010
If the hand holding the fair mug is too weak, it might not be steady,

510
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,410
which will lead to an unfair distribution of tea.

511
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:06,469
Since we hope everyone can have a full cup of tea and a full pocket,

512
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:10,740
of course we need to share the tea equally, which is in our interest in long run.

513
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,410
Nice to meet you.

514
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,230
I'd like to make a toast

515
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,250
to everyone with this cup of tea.

517
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:56,150
Since we've enjoyed the tea, let's get down to business.

518
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:02,939
Director Ye, actually, we have no problem with your proposal

519
00:40:02,939 --> 00:40:06,290
as long as your old friend

520
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,400
is okay with it.

521
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,770
Yes. Yes.

522
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,130
Then let's vote

523
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,190
since you are all okay with it.

524
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,790
Come on.

525
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,430
Me.

526
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,520
Me.

527
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,120
Me, too.

528
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,890
Why didn't you tell a lonely old guy like me you're having a merry tea party?

529
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,640
You guys think I am too old to keep up with you?

530
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,770
I'm suprised.

531
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,830
It surprised me that I would meet you here.

532
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,110
We go way back.

533
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,180
I don't think we are so close.

534
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,650
We just crossed paths each other

535
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:44,460
when we were young and didn't know better.
