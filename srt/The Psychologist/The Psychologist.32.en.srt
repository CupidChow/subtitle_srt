Can you tell anything from it?

20
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,340
There is a transparent and complete data collection process.

And the authorization of the patient and

22

So you mean she predicted all our previous predictions.

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,010
There isn't any data fraud in the thesis.

28
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,910
I'm not questioning the authenticity of the data.

29
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,620
Because all the clinical data in this thesis

30
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,720
was personally recorded by me when I gave

31

I provided so much evidence.

35
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,880
Do you have evidence to back you up?

36
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,750
You said that I stole your data but you can't prove it.

37
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,770
People will all think it's ridiculous.

38
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,980
Ji Mingcong, why are you still denying it?

39
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,169
During the sixth session,

40
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:06,160
the visitor's emotional self-rating scale showed a smaller fluctuation.

41
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,530
According to your analysis, this change was the result of

42
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,649
the Family Solution Focused Therapy.

43
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:16,830
But you didn't take the change in the therapeutic alliance into consideration.

44
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,220
In this thesis, there is only a lot of so-called clinical data.

45
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,720
But the visitor's self-evaluation on the visitor-counsellor relationship is absent in it.

46
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,719
I just chose to write it from a different angle.

47
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,439
This can't explain anything.

48
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,910
Is it because you chose a different angle

49
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,669
or you didn't know anything from this angle?

50
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,900
I obtained this set of data

51
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,200
on the foundation that I had ruled out possibilities

52
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,549
such as anxiety disorder and substance abuse

53
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,910
from the comorbidity diagnosis on the subject.

54
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,980
But in your thesis you didn't mention the related screening process.

55
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,220
This is enough to prove that you didn't participate in the experiment.

56
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,930
And with current clinical experience, you're not capable of handling a case

57
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,980
as complicated as a bipolar disorder type-I.

58
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,130
Really?

59
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,139
How can you be so sure I am not capable of handling it?

they agreed to let me participate in this project.

64
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,380

But I'm sure that she went to visit me in this red dress.

106
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,759
Then there is plagiarism in your thesis in which

107
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,760
you stole the clinical data of another person.

108
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,819
And I will say this again. Do you have any proof?

109
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:22,050
My proof is in that video you just played.

110
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,099
This is ridiculous.

111

Don't deny it so soon.

Everybody knows that your eyes can deceive you sometimes.

Or you can turn a city into another one.

However, sounds are not so easy to disguise.

126

But few people can tell the characteristics

How about this time?

138
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,909
Did you hear anything?

139
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,650
- Some buzzing sound on and off.
- I cannot hear it clearly.

140
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,439
That's right, buzzing sound.

141
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:01,910
Listen. Is this what you heard?

142
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,440
Yes, that's the sound!

143
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,419
Then have you guessed what this sound is?

144
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:10,909
It's pigeon flute.

145
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,840
That's right. It's the sound of a pigeon flute.

146
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,759
Miss Yao,

147
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,650
judging from your reaction, you don't seem to know what a pigeon flute is.

148
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,640
So what?

149
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,650
Is this the proof you said you have?

150
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,860
Pigeon flute is a kind of whistle tied to a pigeon's tail.

151
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,709
It will make sounds as the pigeon flies.

152
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,770
And you're most likely to hear this kind of sound in Jingbei City.

153
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,380
Of course, many people who have never lived in Jingbei won't even hear this sound in their lives.

154
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,230
But there are fewer and fewer people keeping pigeons as pets in the past few years.

155
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,230
This kind of sounds have become scarce even in Jingbei.

156
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,790
Miss Yao. I want to ask you,

157
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,000
since you said that this video was filmed in City H last year,

158
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,030
why are there sounds made by a pigeon flute in the video?

159
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,760
What? People in City H are not allowed to keep pigeons?

160
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,280
Okay. Just for argument's sake, let's say I agree with it.

161
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:06,280
But why was the soundtrack of the pigeon flute divided into two sections in the video?

162
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,350
As soon as you spoke, the sound of the pigeon flute would disappear.

163
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,490
Even when the visitor mentioned the word "Yao", which is your last name,

164
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,280
there was an obvious break of the pigeon flute sound.

165
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,330
Can you explain why?

166
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,050
Yao Kexin, as you know, the result of this hearing can affect your future career and reputation.

167
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,540
Can you give us an answer to this question?

168
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,110
Or you can provide the contact information of this patient

169
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,549
and ask her to testify for you.

170
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,669
Yes.

171
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,590
I think the only explanation is that Miss Yao's voice was added to the video.

172
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,030
If you don't believe it, you can find a professional to check the authenticity of the audio track.

173
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,100
Today's hearing has come to an end.

174
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,690
The school will continue to verify the credibility of the experimental data after the hearing.

175
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,099
We will make every effort to find out the truth.

176
00:11:58,099 --> 00:11:59,219
He Dun.

177
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,250
We are both women. How could you do this to me?

178
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,840
Just because he was your mentor that you would help that demon to hurt me?

179
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,900
Miss Yao. Please don't try to obfuscate the issue.

180
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,840
You can't give an explanation for the question she raised.

181
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,539
What do I need to explain?

182
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:11,860
You want me to explain why you tried

183
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,439
to approach me again and again saying that you were a reporter?

184
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,611
Or you want me to explain for the question she raised.

185
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,230
How Ji Mingcong and his student fabricated false evidence to frame me?

186
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,079
Yao Kexin, any accusation needs evidence.

187
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,150
So can you answer my questions about your thesis?

188
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,250
Can you submit your experiment subject's contact information?

189
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,400
As long as you submit it, it'll be stronger evidence than anything you say here.

190
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,350
You want me to provide the contact information of the subject of my experiment?

191
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,249
What about him?

192
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:38,220
Can he provide the contact information of the "visitor" he claimed?

193
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,110
Since you can't do it, what's your ground to ask me to do so?

194
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,739
You are quibbling.

195
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:46,570
Since the school has agreed to look into it to find out the truth,

196
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,050
- my suggestion is…
- I can't do it.

197
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,340
I promised my visitor that

198
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,639
I would keep her identity strictly confidential.

199
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,610
The data of this thesis I made public today is related to her.

200
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:07,750
To some extent, I've already violated our visitor-counsellor confidentiality.

201
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,540
Miss Yao,

202
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,030
I don't know where you got the information,

203
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:19,670
but I will never provide any further information about my visitor again.

204
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,910
I also hope you can stop slandering me.

205
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,740
Don't expose any information about the visitor.

206
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,639
Let this farce stop here.

207
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,339
I did everything I should.

208
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,330
The conclusion is for you guys to decide.

209
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,281
Ji Mingcong, you think you can just leave like this?

210
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,350
You think there's no evidence to prove what you did to me?

211
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,530
Do you want evidence?

212
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,480
I have plenty!

213
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,840
[Don't be afraid, she's bluffing. He Dun is Ji Mingcong's student. No one will believe her. Proceed as planned.]

214
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,400
Everything that happened yesterday was the biggest mistake I ever made in my life.

215
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,960
I've violated the basic ethics of a psychology practitioner.

216
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,760
I didn't live up to my identity or my profession.

217
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,770
And I let your parents down who used to trust me.

218
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,589
I have to live with my baseness and impudence.

219
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,859
But ever since I met you,

220
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,440
I've been imaging the scene where we will hug with love countless times in my mind.

221
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,800
I didn't realize how much I want to be with you until now…

222
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,670
Where did you get that? Who gave it to you?

223
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,890
Shut up!

224
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,010
This is the letter of repentance you wrote to me. Did you forget?

225
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,120
- Ji Mingcong, you're a despicable and shameless old pervet!
- Professor!

226
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,659
He Dun, take a good look!

227
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:42,440
Do you have the nerve to say this isn't Ji Mingcong's handwriting?

228
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,450
How much longer are you going to defend him?

229
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,910
Professor, what happened? Professor, are you okay?

230
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,860
Where is your medicine? Where is the medicine?

231
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,840
Qian Kaiyi, come and help!

232
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,109
Are you all right? Professor,

233
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,470
Professor, have some water.

234
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,610
Let's go to the hospital.

235
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,050
I am fine.

236
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,220
I just came short of breath all of sudden.

237
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,130
I'll be fine after some antihypertensive pills.

238
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,100
Do you want to take it now?

239
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,500
Do you have anything to ask me?

240
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,500
I want to know what's with the letter at the hearing.

241
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,440
So you realized the real problem, too.

242
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,080
This hearing is just a cover.

243
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,230
Yao Kexin is just a pawn.

244
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,380
What they want is not only that.

245
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,960
So you knew from the beginning that there's someone behind her.

246
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,350
This is also why you didn't let me get involved.

247
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,440
It's the result of the grudges and grievances of my past.

248
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,470
I didn't want you to get involved because I didn't want you to be part of this deep trouble.

249
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,350
But you never do as I told you.

250
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,870
So this hearing was just the beginning of something bigger.

251
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,390
It's their way to fight back.

252
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,510
Professor, so did you see any pattern or do you have any theories

253
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,210
on what they're up to?

254
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,610
I know that you must have a lot of questions.

255
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,800
But I promised someone that

256
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,710
I would never mention anything about her again.

257
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,280
Even when things are going against me now,

258
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,880
I still don't want to drag her into these deep troubles.

259
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,969
Who is she?

260
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:48,570
She's the lady mentioned in this letter?

261
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,679
Professor, I have seen this letter before.

262
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,660
The handwriting… Was it really written by you?

263
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,680
Now that you already have the answer,

264
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,190
why bother to ask me?

265
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,940
Everything that happened yesterday was the biggest mistake I ever made in my life.

266
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,950
- I've violated the basic ethics...
- Where did you get it?

267
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,680
- Shut up!
- I want to be with you as a man…

268
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,190
Your mother wouldn't have suffered

269
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,039
if it weren't for Ji Mingcong.

270
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,429
I saw a purple box at your house last time.

271
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,009
I thought it was Mrs. Ji's.

272
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:38,589
A friend gave it to me.

273
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,069
Just a friend?

274
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:42,680
Promotion.

275
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,830
What can I get from this move?

276
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,420
What are you doing?

277
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,539
Professor Ji is asleep.

278
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:10,879
Are you going home?

279
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,330
Stay with me for a big longer.

280
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,579
I watched him taking his medication.

281
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:16,129
I think he'll be fine.

282
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:17,760
Don't worry.

283
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,940
What's wrong? You look absent-minded.

284
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,849
He doesn't tell me anything.

285
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:26,950
I can't help him even if I want to.

286
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,800
I don't know if it's because he has his own arrangements or the whole thing is true.

287
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,370
If it's true,

288
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,800
I don't know… I don't know what to think right now.

289
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,820
Do you know what he told me when I went into his room?

290
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,209
What?

291
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:43,470
He asked me to take good care of you.

292
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,659
Professor Ji cares about you very much.

293
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:51,640
It's just that you guys are not on the same page on this right now.

294
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,949
He knows you are worried about him.

295
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,930
Maybe he doesn't want you to get involved

296
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,800
because he thinks it might have a deleterious effect on your life.

297
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,709
But I can't just look away.

298
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:05,860
Other than my family and friends, Professor Ji is the closest to me in this world.

299
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,850
Of course, now I also have you.

300
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,560
But seriously, do you really think that Professor Ji has fallen in love with Yao Kexin?

301
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,280
I don't think Professor Ji is someone who would violate professional ethics to date someone he shouldn't.

302
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,050
I don't believe that letter was written to Yao Kexin from him.

303
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,760
But still, he may write to one of his visitors as a psychological counselor.

304
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,040
Actually, I think that letter sounds more like a love letter.

305
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,280
Impossible. He has been highly sensitive to the visitor-counselor relationship.

306
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,000
He won't do this kind of thing or make such a mistake.

307
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,760
Do you remember the first two sentences of the letter?

308
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,350
I've violated the basic ethics of a psychology practitioner.

309
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,090
I didn't live up to my identity or my profession.

310
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,900
And I let your parents down who used to trust me.

311
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,160
That letter, while expressing his penitence, was also confessing his love.

312
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,000
I can feel the pain and struggle Professor Ji had when he was writing that letter.

313
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,610
So you mean that letter proves that he did make an irrevocable mistake.

314
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,159
He Dun, you can't see it that way.

315
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,779
No human is perfect.

316
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:14,060
It's not fair not allowing someone to make mistakes just because you trust him.

317
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,290
He must have some reasons for what he did wrong and why.

318
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:22,190
You can't ask someone to be perfect just because you choose to believe in him.

319
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,470
It'll be a heavy weight on his shoulders.

320
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,189
I think you have a lot on your shoulders right now.

321
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,680
How about I give you a massage?

322
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,559
What?

323
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,850
You okay?

324
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,639
It hurts so much.

325
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,541
- Quit it. I didn't pinch you hard.
- You did!

326
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,521
You don't know what you can do to help Professor Ji

327
00:21:43,521 --> 00:21:45,820
and you take your frustration out on me!

328
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,411
Let me see. Let me see which part gets hurt.

329
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,170
Take a look.

330
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,999
If you have frustration, at least vent it out.

331
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:00,189
There's nothing wrong with it.

332
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,880
Come on, a boxing bag for my girlfriend only. Come on.

333
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,679
I decline.

334
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,520
All right.

335
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,380
I was just giving some assumption to prepare you for the worst.

336
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,560
There must be something hidden behind everything.

337
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,639
But Professor Ji is stubborn on this matter.

338
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,069
That's his business.

339
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,190
If you really can't trust him to deal with it alone, I'll accompany you to investigate.

340
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,120
We won't stop until we find out the truth.

341
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,190
What?

342
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,470
Why are you looking at me with worship in your eyes?

343
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,590
You are silly, which is pretty cute.

344
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,850
Qian Kaiyi.

345
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,280
Thank you for spending so much time and trying hard to make me feel better.

346
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,060
I'm your boyfriend. It's my job to make you feel better.

347
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,560
Let's go. Let's go home.

348
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,110
Let's go home.

349
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,850
You're back.

350
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,450
You look so angry.

351
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,040
Have some tea.

352
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,210
Isn't the video tape enough?

353
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,410
Why did you even give her the letter?

354
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,399
Since the curtain has been drawn,

355
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:20,330
- of course the show is the bigger the better.
- I thought our purpose was the same.

356
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,510
You regret it now?

357
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:25,099
Is there a difference between the letter and the video in nature?

358
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:28,459
Don't forget that there are more important things for us.

359
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,110
[1999 0 B7263 - 2]

360
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,710
Besides, Ji Mingcong has He Dun to help him.

361
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,659
If it weren't for that letter today, Ji Mingcong would have escaped.

362
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:50,860
But your letter was as good as exposing her to the public.

363
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:17,199
When you find Fu Tang, you can ask her face-to-face

364
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,260
why she chose to abandon you.

365
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,660
I'm telling you,

366
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,300
I just want to find my mother.

367
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,520
I am not interested in anything else.

368
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,140
In the future, let's not stay in contact if it's not really necessary.

369
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,100
Most often once you start,

370
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,260
there's no turning back for you.

371
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,880
I am telling you now,

372
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,590
today, I quit.

373
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,570
You will regret it.

374
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,829
Professor, are you all right?

375
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,639
Professor, where's the medicine?

376
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,849
Qian Kaiyi!

377
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:13,270
Qian Kaiyi, come and help.

378
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,580
Hey.

379
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,609
Why did you still come back so late at night? You could have told me.

380
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,930
Mom.

381
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,010
I miss you.

382
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,089
Didn't you just come back the day before yesterday?

383
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:32,280
Why? You already miss me?

384
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,789
What? I came back the day before yesterday so I can't come back home and I can't miss you today?

385
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:37,350
I need to be with my mom to replenish energy.

386
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,670
Of course, you can. You can miss me and replenish energy every day.

387
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,160
What do you want to eat? I'll cook.

388
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,570
It's okay, Mom.

389
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,879
My dearest mom.

390
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,429
I heard you watch the news.

391
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,309
Don't worry about me.

392
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,180
You have superpower?

393
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,500
What superpower?

394
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,229
Your door was still ajar so

395
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,290
I heard it at the door.

396
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,969
It's even hard trying to ignore it.

397
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:02,330
I am really old.

398
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,760
I even forgot to close the door. I'm getting older.

399
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,500
Mom, what do you think of Professor Ji's scandal?

400
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,299
Didn't many people say that he was framed by that girl?

401
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,029
But many people also said they wouldn't trust him.

402
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:22,859
And I think he's keeping some secret from me on this matter.

403
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,810
He is?

404
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,350
Qian Kaiyi told me today that sometimes you want to trust someone very much.

405
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,659
But it doesn't mean that this person won't make any mistake.

406
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:34,829
I think he had a point.

407
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,410
So I'm feeling a little frustrated.

408
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:43,509
Should I try to investigate and help Professor Ji or should I leave it?

409
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,810
It depends on what you want in your heart.

410
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,050
Those closely involved cannot see clearly.

411
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,660
I still want to ask about your opinion.

412
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,630
Let me ask you this.

413
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:02,210
You get frustrated because he really did something he shouldn't, or

414
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:05,000
because he's hiding something from you?

415
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,050
This is very important.

416
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:13,079
As his student, I hope that my teacher can be of noble character.

417
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:17,769
And much of the time I actually see him as my family.

418
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,700
I don't want to see an ethical weakness on him.

419
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,129
In other words, you are afraid that he might let you down.

420
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:27,219
All your admiration and worship for him in the past might collapse one day.

421
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:29,170
Am I right?

422
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,150
And I don't think he trusts me.

423
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,509
I always think that everything he did was on purpose to reduce himself to a passive position.

424
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:39,349
It was as if he wanted to be punished.

425
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,539
What really happened then?

426
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:43,720
Actually, I don't know yet.

427
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,599
Dun Dun, I don't think you should force other people to confess everything to you.

428
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:51,819
Their emotions, moods, and all the other important things.

429
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:54,210
They don't have this obligation to do so.

430
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,899
I don't really know Professor Ji.

431
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:04,609
But anyway, remember, I will always take your side.

432
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:08,000
I will support you no matter what your decision is.

433
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,520
I knew it.

434
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,429
Compared to a boyfriend, mom is the one who nails it when it comes to comforting.

435
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:18,459
You both said similar things, but you just sounded different.

436
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,519
What did you just say?

437
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,610
Boyfriend?

438
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,310
Who is it?

439
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,420
Who's the boy?

440
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,359
That's why I came back tonight. To break the news to you.

441
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,010
Let me guess.

442
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,940
The boy named Qian...

443
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,879
Qian Kaiyi?

444
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,220
Yes.

445
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,780
This is great!

446
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,310
What do you think?

447
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,900
Tang Lili, are you all right?

448
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,399
You dress like this because you're traumatized?

449
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,959
Do I look well-behaved, clever, capable, and fresh?

450
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,760
It's true though.

451
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,629
You look like a different person in this outfit of mine.

452
00:29:47,629 --> 00:29:49,210
Really?

453
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,849
Don't snigger.

454
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:54,000
Are you trying to hit on someone?

455
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,609
That's right.

456
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:02,310
I want to become a good citizen in the future.

457
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,040
What? You weren't a good citizen before?

458
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,619
Do you remember I was taken to the police station after that fight last time?

459
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,999
Isn't this the police officer who received us?

460
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:20,949
That's him.

461
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,179
An upright and loyal police officer?

462
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:24,229
I like him.

463
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,880
He Dun, let me tell you this. I've come round to the idea now.

464
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,439
I was bound by the fetters of my complex for too long.

465
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:32,479
I don't want to attach myself to the things and persons I was afraid I might lose anymore.

466
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:34,930
I want to pursue guys I truly like.

467
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,360
I've been trying to brainwash you for so many years.

468
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,780
But in the end a guy you like changed you. But congratulations.

469
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,899
That's not true.

470
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:47,700
Let me tell you,

471
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,740
if it weren't for your teaching and enlightening, I wouldn't have suddenly come round.

472
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,180
I've decided that I will do all the chores for the coming week

473
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,639
to thank you for your advice on my outfit.

474
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:00,091
- What do you think?
- I don't believe you.

475
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,560
[I've arrived. I'm at the door.]
[Okay.]

476
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,010
Oh my.

477
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,340
Going out with Qian Kaiyi?

478
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,409
You're so clingy. Clingy girl.

479
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:12,559
- All right, all right.
- Off you go!

480
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,520
I'll clean the table.

481
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,460
Qian Kaiyi, I've decided.

482
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,069
About what?

483
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,980
I want to do a special show about Yao Kexin.

484
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,359
Watch the road!

485
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:30,589
Yao Kexin is not some demon or beast.

486
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,189
There's nothing to be scared of.

487
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,949
But He Dun, I don't think this is a good idea.

488
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,449
I know you will worry about me. But don't worry.

489
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:41,530
I've thought it through. I must do this topic justice.

490
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,909
But there is an old saying, "The tongue breaks the bone."

491
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:47,480
Especially we who are in the field of media are more sensitive in this regard.

492
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,760
At that time all the public opinion will be focused on you and there'll be no escaping for you.

493
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,590
But it has happened.

494
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:58,339
What we need to do is to provide more angles for the public to see it, right?

495
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:00,730
Give them a channel to take a holistic approach to this issue.

496
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,999
This is what we should do in the field of media.

497
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,519
I understand.

498
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,799
But once you make a voice,

499
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,169
instead of what you say, the audience will care more about who you are.

500
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:11,679
Do you understand what I mean?

501
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,350
I've made up my mind anyway. Don't worry.

502
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,140
This special show will be a great one.

503
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,520
And Night Talk to Your Heart is also my show.

504
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,879
I don't want Xiao Li and Dong to have a hard time in the radio station.

505
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:28,409
Don't tell me you want to do it for me.

506
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,200
It's from the swordswoman's mom, try it.

507
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,929
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

508
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:53,130
Hello, how can I help?

509
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,500
Hi.

510
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,480
What are you doing here?

511
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,460
To run an errand.

512
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,129
You don't look like you have an errand to run.

513
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,659
Lady, is there anything I can do for you?

514
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:22,210
Yes.

515
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,400
You can help me eat it.

516
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,519
- Eat…
- I specially came here during lunch time.

517
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,270
I brought you coffee, too.

518
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,570
If you are sleepy because of the full the afternoon, you can drink the coffee.

519
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,760
Try it.

520
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,949
I'm a public official and this is my office.

521
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,759
Are you trying to bribe me?

522
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,039
Come on, Officer!

523
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,240
It's just lunch!

524
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,430
You don't need to give me such a serious charge.

525
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,039
We're not close.

526
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,260
So this is accepting bribes for me.

527
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:59,710
So you mean you can eat the lunch if we're close?

528
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,940
Come on!

529
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,610
You sound like a different character every time I meet you.

530
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,960
What do you think of me?

531
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,229
If you don't leave, you'll be hindering official duties.

532
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:20,810
I'm leaving.

533
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,919
I'll leave after you eat the food.

534
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:26,530
I said I won't eat it!

535
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,760
Wasting food is a crime.

536
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,690
All right then.

537
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,229
I'll leave it here anyway.

538
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,290
It's up to you whether to eat it.

539
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,630
I shall leave you to do your job, Officer.

540
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,630
Bye-Bye.

541
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,290
I can't commit a crime.

542
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,909
Hello, everyone.

543
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,220
Welcome to l today's Time Interview.

544
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,519
I'm your old friend Wang Zhuo.

545
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,899
Recently psychological problems become the topic that concern people very much.

546
00:35:39,899 --> 00:35:42,570
The Psychology Society appears on hot searches frequently.

547
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:46,729
I'm honored to have a special guest with us in today's Time Interview.

548
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:51,460
Let's talk about the professional nature of psychological counselor and sexual assault in campus.

549
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,660
Hello, Wen He.

550
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,079
Hello, Wang Zhuo.

551
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,759
Miss Wen, can you say hello to our audience first?

552
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:59,900
Hello everyone, I am Wen He.

553
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,369
I heard that after a counselling relationship ends, there is a "three-year" rule which means that

554
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:07,159
the visitor and the counsellor cannot develop any close relationship within three years.

555
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:10,229
Is this ethical requirement a strict mandatory requirement?

556
00:36:10,229 --> 00:36:12,530
This is a rule, yes.

557
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:17,169
But it's more like a code of professional ethics for all psychological counsellors to follow.

558
00:36:17,169 --> 00:36:18,840
What will happen after three years?

559
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:22,219
If the three-year period is over, can they develop a close relationship?

560
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:24,319
The three-year period is just like a buffer.

561
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,329
As a professional psychological counselor, they need to avoid the dual relationship in the counselling.

562
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:30,999
After the treatment ends, they should also be mentally prepared

563
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,119
that they won't build a relationship of any sorts with the visitors.

564
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:37,889
So if they build an intimate relationship even after three years,

565
00:36:37,889 --> 00:36:40,709
we should look into the nature of the relationship

566
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:45,519
and the professionalism of this psychological counselor.

567
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,529
I didn't expect there is such a double-dealer in this world!

568
00:36:53,529 --> 00:36:56,361
- But someone like her actually defended Li Wei.
- I don't know who He Dun is.

569
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:58,169
I kind of liked her when I watched the show about Li Wei.

570
00:36:58,169 --> 00:36:59,670
I feel sorry for both Li Wei and Yao Kexin.

571
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:02,349
I just hope that the female announcer can stop her behavior of news hijacking.

572
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:04,000
Probably she did it for the show's ratings.

573
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:06,019
She has double standards. This kind of person is disgusting.

574
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:09,559
If Ji Mingcong weren't her mentor, would she still defend him?

575
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:12,660
We support you, Kexin.

576
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,630
Lili, have you eaten breakfast yet?

577
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,000
Tang Lili?

578
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,430
What's wrong?

579
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,050
What are you hiding?

580
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,800
[Kexin, good luck!]

581
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,600
Nothing.

582
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,189
He Dun.

583
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,469
These people are creating something out of nothing.

584
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,920
They didn't think straight before they made comments. Don't listen to them.

585
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,669
Everyone who knows you will trust you.

586
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,790
People who don't know you? Their opinions don't matter at all.

587
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:47,730
Don't worry. No matter how many rumors there are, we will all be on your side.

588
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,469
He Dun, vent your frustration out.

589
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,539
You can cry if you want to. I'm here with you.

590
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,460
Suppressing your feelings isn't good for you.

591
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,940
Something doesn't add up.

592
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,000
The hearing just ended and someone already

593
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:04,449
used my relationship with Professor Ji to go against us.

594
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,980
This is an obvious dirty trick.

595
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,560
Oh, that's what you're thinking about.

596
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,399
The people targeting Professors Ji didn't give up.

597
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:14,770
They just turn to target me now.

598
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,629
But you are just a student of Professor Ji.

599
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,039
W-W-Why would they want to target you?

600
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,369
I am the only one who can stand up for Professor Ji now.

601
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:32,079
If I am defeated, it'll be a big blow to him and

602
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,840
this is exactly what the other party wants to see.

603
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,599
This is so despicable!

604
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,869
Then we can't just sit and watch!

605
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,699
They used the media to "set the record straight". So can we!

606
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:42,180
I'll call Qian Kaiyi now.

607
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,270
You can't go to the media.

608
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,290
The more we try to clear professor's name, the worse his reputation will become.

609
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,220
All we can do now is to just watch and

610
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,100
wait for them to reveal their conspiracy.

611
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,330
Jiahui.

612
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:21,380
I didn't know why you liked to live in seclusion.

613
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,550
I just understand now

614
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:28,150
that you want to live like a coward here.

615
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,140
Excuse me. Can I use the bathroom?

616
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,710
Sure. Go down to the end of the house.

617
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,120
You took the videotape.

618
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,970
I just used a little trick.

619
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,000
Didn't you do the same thing

620
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,089
by using your two loving students as a cover for File in F?

621
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:51,100
Who are you really?

622
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,500
File on F was really hard to find.

623
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,000
I almost gave up, but I didn't.

624
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,150
So...

625
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,929
Otherwise, how could I see Professor Ji defeated so miserably?

626
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,820
Jiahui.

627
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,600
You are a good boy.

628
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,660
Just take revenge on me

629
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,040
if you have any grievance.

630
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,850
Don't hurt her.

631
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,670
Where is she?

632
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,410
I won't tell you.

633
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,130
She is emotionally unstable now.

634
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,630
She needs a quiet recuperation.

635
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,350
God, did you hear that?

636
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,830
Have you heard it?

637
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,999
What's up? God is dead? God is dead indeed.

638
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:08,830
I have a bad feeling.

639
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:11,719
I just passed the water fountain when I overheard conversation between Wang Zhuo and Wen He.

640
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:16,210
Wang Zhuo said that they did a great show last time and the audience all loved Wen He.

641
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,999
What does it have to do with us?

642
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,429
Wang Zhuo said he wanted to do more episodes about

643
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,920
Psychological counseling and he wanted to have her as a regular guest.

644
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,160
- What the hell?
- Isn't this the same as our show?

645
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,779
- This is plagiarism.
- I know, right?

646
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:29,699
The more annoying part is that Wang Zhuo said Wen He has a better sense of media.

647
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:33,989
He said Director Pan intends replace Miss He with Wen He.

648
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,970
Wang Zhuo said that?

649
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,219
- It's over.
-It's over.

650
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:51,709
They can ask questions about legal issues and the audience...

651
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,620
Why did you want to fire He Dun?

652
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,649
Kaiyi, Wang Zhuo and I are in the middle of something.

653
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:02,069
Director Pan. I'll leave you two alone.

654
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:04,100
You stay.

655
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,929
You approved his application so he got Zhang Miao.

656
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:08,590
Now there's just a few of us working on Night Talk.

657
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,490
Finally, we made it to keep Night Talk to Your Heart going.

658
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,520
For a long time, we made changes and adjusted ourselves to build teamwork. Now you want to get a new guest?

659
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,220
The station hasn't made the final decision yet.

660
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,549
Mr. Qian, Director Pan did this for the sake of the show.

661
00:42:17,549 --> 00:42:19,430
You are making it hard for her by rushing in and questioning her like this.

662
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,619
I was just afraid her judgment might be clouded by some rat's rhetoric.

663
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,930
Qian Kaiyi! What do you want?

664
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,920
I should be the one asking you! What do you want?

665
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,109
You found a psychological counselor as your special guest. That's fine.

666
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:34,600
But now even the topic selection of your show is exactly like us.

667
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,229
Since you like Night Talk to Your Heart so much,

668
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,860
why don't you come to work for me?

669
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,010
I heard that you turned down the proposal of doing a campus sexual assault special show,

670
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,210
- so I picked up this idea.
- Really?

671
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,559
Have you heard I proposed to Director Pan again later?

672
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:48,449
Kaiyi, I told Wang Zhuo to do this show.

673
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:51,399
I know you are capable with a lot of your own opinions.

674
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:53,699
But you need to think about what's more important.

675
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,429
Your opinion or the station's opinion?

676
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,869
And it turns out that my decision is right.

677
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,389
Don't ask me why I wanted to fire He Dun.

678
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,949
Ask yourself.

679
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,630
Did you cherish the chance I gave you?

680
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,550
It's proved by facts that the success of your show is thanks to the right pattern Night Talk adopted.

681
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:14,380
But it can't prove which one of the two psychological counselors is more popular among the audience, right?

682
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,359
If we both make a show with the same form and the same topic, we will know which one is better.

683
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:20,730
Then do you dare have a face-off with me?

684
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,399
Let's make a show respectively and see whose audience rate is higher.

685
00:43:24,399 --> 00:43:27,229
Qian Kaiyi, don't be so ridiculous!

686
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,460
- This is breaking news!
- What did you hear?

687
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,119
Oh my goodness.

688
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,390
Come on, let's go!

689
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:36,850
Let's have a face-off then.

690
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,390
