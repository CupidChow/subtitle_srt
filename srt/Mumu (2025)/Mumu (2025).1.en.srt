1
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,500
Can you tell me what happened that day?

2
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:02,960
The store's surveillance

3
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,670
footage clearly shows you stealing money.

4
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,420
I guess she has nothing else to say.

5
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Let me out.

6
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,750
My father is waiting for me.

7
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,960
You have to explain things clearly before we can let you go.

8
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,460
Still unwilling to talk?

9
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,789
We brought in a sign language interpreter,

10
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,830
but she refuses to communicate

11
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,830
so we haven't been able to get any answers.

12
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,250
Enough for today.

13
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,250
Can you uncuff her?

14
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,210
It will be easier for her to speak.

15
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:56,539
If you still refuse to talk...

16
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,420
you know that theft is a serous crime, right?

17
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Will I go to jail?

18
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,710
Burglary

19
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,040
can be punished by up to three years.

20
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,880
That money was mine.

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,920
I just took my own wages.

22
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,670
The boss didn't pay me.

23
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,420
What proof do you have that he owes you wages?

24
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,040
I didn't want to work there anymore.

25
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
He didn't pay me my final wages.

26
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,790
I didn't steal anything.

27
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,710
I would never do something like that.

28
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,670
We've already asked the hotpot manager.

29
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,630
He said she never quit,

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,710
but instead just took the money and ran away.

31
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,750
He's not a good person.

32
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,790
He is very bad.

33
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,829
You really can't be kind to people nowadays.

34
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,829
At first, I felt sorry for her,

35
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,290
so I hired her as a vegetable cutter.

36
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,040
She caused me so much trouble

37
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,500
wasting a lot of food,

38
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,330
but I never deducted her pay.

39
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,170
And now, she dares to accuse me?

40
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,080
Take it easy.

41
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,540
We will definitely investigate

42
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,170
and figure things out. Okay?

43
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,080
You know what,

44
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,170
I don't blame someone

45
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,290
for having prejudices against deaf people.

46
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,830
How do you usually communicate with her?

47
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,210
Sign language interpreter.

48
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,079
Usually,

49
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,040
I don't know sign language either. We just typing.

50
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,670
Why aren't there any chat records

51
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,130
with the boss on your phone?

52
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,670
He forced me to delete them.

53
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,960
He forced you to delete them?

54
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:41,920
Why?

55
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,710
What did you two send?

56
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,710
Look, I took the money,

57
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,329
and I don't want my salary anymore.

58
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,079
I just want to sign and go.

59
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,420
You really think so?

60
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,710
Nope.

61
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,960
Once you've admitted to a crime, your life is ruined.

62
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,209
I'll help you.

63
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,790
I'll help you find a lawyer.

64
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,330
I'll also go to court with you.

65
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,080
Okay?

66
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,960
Lawyers are expensive.

67
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,330
You don't know me. Why help me?

68
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,330
I think the deaf girl is innocent,

69
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,750
and you should help her out.

70
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,420
I've always been curious,

71
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,540
you're so young

72
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,670
and you didn't major in sign language,

73
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,580
how come you know so much about deaf people?

74
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,460
And you care so much.

75
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,000
Is this the girl's father?

76
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:02,920
How did you know?

77
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,170
He's deaf too.

78
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,960
He comes here every day and waits.

79
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,500
No matter what I say, he doesn't leave.

80
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,830
Do you know how to recognize a deaf person at a glance?

81
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,830
How?

82
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,790
I've lived with deaf people since I was a child.

83
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,670
The way they look

84
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,960
accompanied me throughout my childhood.

85
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,920
Their quiet way of expressing love

86
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,080
is easily overlooked in this noisy world.

87
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,710
But in my heart,

88
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,250
it's worth more than a thousand words.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,630
Just a hundred.

90
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,380
If you're going to do it, do it,

91
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,420
if not, then get out of here.

92
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,500
I said a hundred, so it's a hundred.

93
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,750
If you gonna do it, do it, or just leave.

94
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,040
It's a hundred now,

95
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,920
it'll be eighty in a bit.

96
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,170
I'll do it for fifty.

97
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,630
You do it?

98
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,380
My dad will.

99
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,750
Where's your dad?

100
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,500
This is my dad.

101
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,290
My dad can fix anything.

102
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,630
He can fix air conditioners, refrigerators too,

103
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,500
anything electrical.

104
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,750
You can do it for fifty?

105
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,250
Next time, make sure you ask clearly,

106
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,250
central air conditioning

107
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,630
is different from home air conditioning.

108
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,630
You said if there is money in it, we do it.

109
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,920
Hurry up.

110
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,920
Mumu's back.

111
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,460
What's wrong?

112
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,710
You're not in good condition, you shouldn't smoke.

113
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,250
Sorry.

114
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,960
Thank you.

115
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:56,630
You're welcome.

116
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,080
This is delicious.

117
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,210
It's so sweet.

118
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
What can you do with such bad luck?

119
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,130
Go, go, go. Go busy yourself.

120
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,710
Go study in the room.

121
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,330
Just let her play for a bit. It's fine.

122
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,580
No.

123
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,330
You guys play, her studies are important.

124
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,460
I don't want to. I don't want to.

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,080
Xiao Ma is so hard, being both a mother and a father.

126
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,080
Language section: Appreciation of Ancient Poems.

127
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,130
Hey kiddo, what do you see in the picture?

128
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,130
Please try pressing the right one.

129
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,130
Be careful of cavities.

130
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,880
Wild grass on the distant plain.

131
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,210
It withers and grows every year.

132
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,960
Though scorched by wild fire,

133
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,790
the spring breeze revives it again.

134
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,920
Come on, they play mahjong again.

135
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,630
It's their house.

136
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,540
They play mahjong every day. It's so noisy.

137
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,330
What are you doing, cheating?

138
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,460
Look.

139
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,630
Don't fight. Don't fight.

140
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,960
Pay me for my Pure Straight.

141
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,330
What Pure Straight?

142
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,630
My dad has a motorcycle that he never washes.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,540
Stop it! Stop it!

144
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,540
What are you playing?

145
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,330
Mumu's here.

146
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,960
Stop fighting you guys.

147
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,290
Since Mumu's here, I'll let you off this time.

148
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,790
We'll talk about it later. Let's dance first.

149
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,830
You really need to control them.

150
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,170
Officer, it's the same day and night.

151
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,830
My son's grades have dropped significantly.

152
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,290
Hello, Officer.

153
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,420
Hello.

154
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,670
We received a complaint about your illegal mahjong business.

155
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,670
It's too noisy.

156
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,040
It's seriously disturbing the peace.

157
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,670
Officer, this is my home.

158
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,920
These are all my dad's friends.

159
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,170
They're deaf and can't hear.

160
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,460
If you need anything, just ask me.

161
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,040
Where's your dad then?

162
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,920
Are you her dad?

163
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,920
Why haven't I seen you guys before?

164
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,830
Uncle Four-eyes let's us stay in the house.

165
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,580
Don't think I don't know

166
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,630
what you're usually up to.

167
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,920
Gather-gambling is illegal,
Gather-gambling is illegal, you know that, right?

168
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,130
I can't hear you.

169
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,130
He said you were gambling.

170
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,170
No, we were practicing calligraphy.

171
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,380
Don't treat me like a fool.

172
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,630
Hey kiddo.

173
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:17,880
Where's your mom?

174
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,290
My mom went to work in another city.

175
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,790
So where do you go to school?

176
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,420
Why don't you go to school?

177
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,420
What did he say?

178
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,790
He asked me why I don't go to school.

179
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,960
Excuse me. Sorry.

180
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,670
You're finally back.

181
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,460
I've caused you trouble.

182
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,540
What's going on?

183
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,420
How many times have you said this?

184
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,540
It's a cultural activity.

185
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,670
Does saying sorry solve the problem?

186
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,790
Okay, okay. This is the last time.

187
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,290
Stop saying "this is last time."

188
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,540
You've said that more than once.

189
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,630
It's been taken care of. It's been taken care of.

190
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,420
Don't worry.
Sorry.

191
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,960
Aren't you going to sleep?

192
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,710
When will mom come back?

193
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,210
I don't know.

194
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:23,080
Mom hasn't called me.

195
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,080
When you start going to school,

196
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,710
mom will call you.

197
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:38,710
Next week, we'll try to apply to a school.

198
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,460
Schools have already started,

199
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,460
they always kick us out.

200
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,330
I'm not going.

201
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,330
I didn't know you had to sign up for school ahead of time.

202
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,830
Why do I have to go to school? I'm busy.

203
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,080
Without me,

204
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,790
you can't hear or make money.

205
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,960
But studying is more important.

206
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,580
When you start working,

207
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,210
you can be a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher.

208
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,920
You can be anyone. You get it?

209
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,040
Sooner or later,

210
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,170
you have to integrate into the world of hearing people.

211
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,880
Why?

212
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,670
Because mom is a hearing person?

213
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,630
Because you are a hearing person.

214
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,750
I've almost forgotten what mom looks like.

215
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,790
Do I look like her?

216
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,000
No, no, no. You look like me.

217
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,290
You're lying.

218
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,250
Your nose is big and your eyebrows are thick.

219
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,710
And you're hunchbacked.

220
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,290
I have the face of a movie star!

221
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,960
Mumu.

222
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,040
You've worked hard raising Mumu alone all these years.

223
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:46,750
Thank you also for

224
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,580
not telling her about our divorce.

225
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,580
I'm back this time,

226
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,380
to discuss Mumu's education with you.

227
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,250
She's seven years old.

228
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,880
I want to take her away

229
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,210
and give her a normal life.

230
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Can you understand that?

231
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,960
Give Mumu to you?

232
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes. To me. Yes.

233
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,960
I am Mumu's mother.

234
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,460
You've remarried. You have another child.

235
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,460
Girls need their mothers as they grow up.

236
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,210
-Mumu is a girl.
Mumu can't suffer with you.

237
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,580
Her future...
She... She needs...

238
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,250
What do you think?
Write it down.

239
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,830
Write it down. Write it down.

240
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,330
Five years ago, you left.

241
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,330
I left.

242
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,000
I've taken care of Mumu for five years.

243
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,790
because I didn't want Mumu to
end up like us.

244
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,500
Without money.

245
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,000
Without dignity.

246
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,880
Without a future.

247
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,040
Excuse me,

248
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:50,920
please enjoy your drink.

249
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,960
This is the money I earned working abroad.

250
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,000
It's all here

251
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,630
for Mumu.

252
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:03,960
What do you mean?

253
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,579
It's living expenses for Mumu.

254
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,880
Are you trying to buy Mumu with money?

255
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,579
No, it's the money I earned from working.

256
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,630
You're buying Mumu with money?

257
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,290
All the money I earned is here.

258
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,460
I want to give it to Mumu.

259
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,500
You're using this to buy Mumu.

260
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,630
I'm giving Mumu money for living expenses.

261
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,460
Here's money.

262
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,079
So you do want to buy Mumu with money.

263
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,250
I can give Mumu a better life.

264
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,079
Can you?

265
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,710
You let the child live in a mahjong parlor.

266
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,710
That's not acceptable.

267
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Are you crazy?
I want her to have a better life.

268
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,460
I want her to have a good...

269
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,880
You look down on me.

270
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,330
You are still like this.

271
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,710
You never want to communicate with me properly.

272
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,880
You treat Mumu as your personal property.

273
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,710
You two sign to each other all day long.

274
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,880
You have your own way of communicating.

275
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,710
I want to talk with you two as well.

276
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,080
Why don't you understand me?

277
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,380
I want to…

278
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,460
I want to talk to you properly.

279
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,080
You force me to sue you.

280
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,710
I get it.

281
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,130
The court will assess the income

282
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,040
and property status of both parents

283
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,380
to ensure the child

284
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,750
can grow up in a stable and comfortable environment.

285
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:40,000
The mom is still more attentive to the child.

286
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,250
No, no, he's pretty good.

287
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,500
He's taken care of Mumu for five years.

288
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,130
Isn't Mumu doing well?

289
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,670
But when Mumu goes to school,

290
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,790
we can't teach her.

291
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,750
Everyone here likes Mumu, we can all take care of her.

292
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,830
Your ex-wife is going to sue you.

293
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,000
What can you do?

294
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,630
Yeah, where's the money coming from?

295
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,380
Aren't we trying to find a solution right now?

296
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,000
You don't want Mumu to go with her mom, do you?

297
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,880
So you're determined to go to court, huh?

298
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,540
Do you know any lawyers?

299
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,380
Do you?

300
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,380
I do.

301
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,130
Didn't Mr. Zhao come?

302
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
What would he come for?

303
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
He can't translate anyway.

304
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,170
Carry this.

305
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
I've already done my part,

306
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,250
and you still expect me to drive?

307
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,130
Wait a minute.

308
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,500
You drive.

309
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,040
I know

310
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,500
hearing aids are useless for you.

311
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,000
Just put on a show for the police.

312
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,170
Didn't they say

313
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,880
you get the driver's license quite early?

314
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,000
Your driving is terrible.

315
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,000
Speed up.

316
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,380
Custody was awarded to Mr. Ma during the divorce.

317
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,330
In principle,

318
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,710
it's quite difficult to overturn that now.

319
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,830
Because the child is under eight years old,

320
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,000
the court won't give too much weight to

321
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,210
her opinion.

322
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:26,880
In other words,

323
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
even if she expresses a desire to live with you,

324
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,210
the court may not listen.

325
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,710
So there's really no other way?

326
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,710
Don't worry too much.

327
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,580
As long as no child abuse has taken place,

328
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,250
the court usually won't change the ruling.

329
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,000
I see.

330
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,380
So things aren't that bad, right?

331
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,080
No.

332
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,080
Okay, I'll pass that on.

333
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,330
The lawyer said it will be difficult

334
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,210
for you to win the case.

335
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,750
Why?

336
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,130
Mumu and I are very happy together.

337
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,080
What's the point of that?

338
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,710
You two sleep in a mahjong parlor.

339
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,250
You don't have any stable income either.

340
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,000
Mumu isn't going to school.

341
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,130
Compared to her mother… you're definitely going to lose.

342
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,580
If the parent who lives with the child

343
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,710
has a serious illness

344
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,290
or is unable to continue to raise the child

345
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:17,830
due to disability,

346
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,210
or abuses the child

347
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,170
and causes serious harm to the child's physical

348
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,710
or mental health,

349
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,130
the court will support a change in the ruling.

350
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,210
No.

351
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,330
I'll work hard.

352
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,460
I'll give Mumu the best.

353
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,000
I'll make money to send Mumu to school.

354
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,330
How are you going to make money in such a short time?

355
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,330
I'll try my best. I can do it, really.

356
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,960
What did he say?
Why is he looking at me like that?

357
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,960
Just cooperate with me and nod slightly.

358
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,420
Attorney Chen agrees to help you.

359
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,380
He's good at this type of case.

360
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,460
Really?

361
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
Thank you so much.

362
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,960
But the reality is

363
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,250
Mr. Ma hasn't been sending his daughter to school,

364
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,460
and their living environment is quite poor.

365
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,080
We can figure something out here.

366
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:08,460
Of course,

367
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,710
if we go down this road, it's going to be hurtful.

368
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,830
You need to be prepared for that.

369
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,460
Tell him

370
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,960
that he absolutely cannot

371
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,250
live in the mahjong parlor anymore.

372
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,330
Tell him to find a stable job as soon as possible.

373
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,710
And then send his daughter to school right away.

374
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,210
Thank you, Attorney Chen. Thank you.

375
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,330
Attorney Chen has agreed to help you but expensive.

376
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,630
Can you afford it?

377
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,130
How much is it?

378
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:50,790
(Hong Jie, can you ask about hotel work?)

379
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,920
(Sending to Hong Jie)

380
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,920
(Hong Jie: Positions available, benefits are good. Bring Mumu over here!)

381
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,210
The two of you,

382
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,710
I can only choose one?

383
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,580
Can't I have both a mom and a dad?

384
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,710
I'll behave. Can't I have both of your if I go to school?

385
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,960
Mom…

386
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,960
why doesn't she want us anymore?

387
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,830
It's not like that. She always wants you.

388
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,750
She…

389
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,130
She just doesn't want me anymore.

390
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,920
You want me to pretend to be your wife?

391
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,710
What are you thinking?

392
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,580
Not my wife. Mumu's mom.

393
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,880
Help me.

394
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,880
Please.

395
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,080
Please, help me.

396
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,000
You're the only translator I know.

397
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,460
It's too much trouble. I don't do this.

398
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,710
I don't like kids.

399
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,080
I can pay you.

400
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,750
I don't want your money. Get out.

401
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,000
My dad has a motorcycle that he never washes.

402
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,960
I taught her ancient poems.

403
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,130
He goes looking for job

404
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,790
with lots of balloons tied to his back.

405
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,420
He just runs around, not understanding anything.

406
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,290
He still has to rely on my wits to solve big problems.

407
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,250
Is that okay?

408
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,460
Mumu,

409
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,380
what's three plus two?

410
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,830
We can do addition and subtraction within a hundred.

411
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,210
Mumu,

412
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,210
do you like drawing whales?

413
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,380
Who taught you to draw?

414
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,250
Probably got it from me.

415
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,080
Yes, she seems to have artistic talent.

416
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,790
Mumu,

417
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,750
can you answer my question?

418
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,130
Mumu,

419
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,250
let's recite a poem for the teacher.

420
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
My daughter is very smart.

421
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,000
She can recite more than ten poems.

422
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,580
Just recite the one you're best at.

423
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,580
Hurry up.

424
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,380
Doesn't she speak a little...

425
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,380
She has no problem speaking.

426
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,580
She's like a little chatterbox at home.

427
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,710
She talks a lot.

428
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,540
She's probably just a little nervous today.

429
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,580
But if she doesn't speak at all,

430
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,880
we can't really make a determination.

431
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,630
Maybe you should try another school.

432
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,750
I'm sorry,

433
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,380
I have to get ready for class.

434
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,580
What happened?
She didn't speak.

435
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,130
Teacher,

436
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,580
all these years...

437
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,000
All these years he's been raising the child alone.

438
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
It's been quite difficult.

439
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,330
As you know, he's deaf.

440
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,710
He hasn't had much formal schooling,

441
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,670
but he hopes his daughter can have an education,

442
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,330
and grow up like a normal child.

443
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,960
He can't hear Mumu's voice,

444
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,880
so he can only memorize

445
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,790
every poem, the mouth shape of every word.

446
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,630
And then he checks one by one.

447
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,380
He even records Mumu reciting poems

448
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,540
and asks others to listen to them

449
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,540
and tell him if she recited them correctly.

450
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,080
Get the recording pen.

451
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,580
Wild grass on the distant plain.

452
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,330
It withers and grows every year.

453
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,080
Though scorched by wild fire,

454
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,500
the spring breeze revives it again.

455
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,880
Sweet fragrance invades the ancient road.

456
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,130
Fresh green meets the ruined city.

457
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,460
Another farewell to a noble youth,

458
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,630
the grass grows thick with parting sorrow.

459
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,830
How much can you earn from your new job?

460
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,960
Attorney Chen is waiting.

461
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,830
Soon, just wait a little longer.

462
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,000
Hurry up.

463
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,250
The court doesn't wait for you.

464
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,170
What's a lawsuit?

465
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,790
There is a judge

466
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:38,830
who decides whether you live with me or mom.

467
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,210
I don't want others to decide who I'm with.

468
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,000
I don't want others to decide either.

469
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,830
Are you happy living with me?

470
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,580
Unhappy?

471
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,750
I'm happy.

472
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,250
Even though you have a lot of flaws,

473
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,960
you're a good dad.

474
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,210
If we have to go to court,

475
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,830
I'll tell the judge

476
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,960
I want to live with you.

477
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,210
Really?

478
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,710
If I go back on my word, I'm a piglet.

479
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,380
Pig, pig, pig.

480
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,000
Pig, pig, pig.

481
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,830
This is for when she goes to school.

482
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,630
This is to keep her healthy.

483
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,290
You must study hard.

484
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,830
Listen to your dad. I love you.

485
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,630
You must study well.

486
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,920
Don't bring Mumu back again.

487
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,000
Live well and remember us.

488
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,580
Remember us.

489
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,500
Have a safe journey.

490
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,710
Is this your car?

491
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,920
It's cool, huh?

492
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,250
Did you buy it yourself? Where did you get the money?

493
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,290
It's a used car.

494
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,420
Mr. Zhao gave it to me.

495
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,080
We're going to do big business together.

496
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,630
We're partners.

497
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,330
Come down.

498
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,290
Mumu.

499
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,250
You've grown taller. You're so pretty now.

500
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:56,000
You still can't afford a cochlear implant?

501
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,670
I'm getting old so it's harder to make money now.

502
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,670
Mumu can't run around.

503
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,380
She can't. Remember that.

504
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,250
I'll remember.

505
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,830
You went to sleep late last night,

506
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,290
you're going to be late now, aren't you?

507
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,460
You didn't get up early either.

508
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,210
Don't sign at school. Remember?

509
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
Mumu.

510
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,460
Come here, come here.

511
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,830
It's your first day of school.
Are you nervous?

512
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,790
A gift for starting school.

513
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,670
It's for you. Do you like it?

514
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,670
Come on.

515
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,290
Let's give a warm welcome

516
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,040
to our new classmate!

517
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,580
Hello everyone, my name is Mumu.

518
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,170
Today, I'd like to introduce a new colleague, Xiao Ma.

519
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,210
He's a bit special.

520
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,920
He is a person with a hearing impairment.

521
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,250
I'm Xiao Ma.

522
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,960
I'm very happy to meet everyone.

523
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,630
So, what do you like to do, Mumu?

524
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,330
I like...

525
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,380
I like...

526
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,250
I like looking out the window.

527
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:30,040
I also like helping my dad count money.

528
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,290
I also like playing mahjong.

529
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,080
Welcome.

530
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,960
Happy.

531
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,670
Good friend.

532
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,580
Handsome.

533
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,460
You have to remember,
to knock a lot.

534
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,080
Anyone who has seen the ocean, please raise your hands.

535
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,290
So many of you have seen it!

536
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,290
Okay.
Put your hands down.

537
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,330
The little pigeon is talking.

538
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,040
I didn't ask you to clean the room.

539
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,920
Can you teach me sign language?

540
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,880
This is "Okay."

541
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,170
"Pretty."

542
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:02,920
Sorry,

543
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,330
I'm late.

544
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,670
Say goodbye to your classmates.

545
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,960
Bye-bye.

546
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,830
Hong Jie.

547
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,500
We used to work together.

548
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,790
I was bullied.

549
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,790
So many people were watching,

550
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,580
but only he stood up for me.

551
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,830
He fought with someone,

552
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,040
and got a scar from it.

553
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,170
He was good to me.

554
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,290
And he could always make me laugh.

555
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,380
I just wanted to be with him.

556
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,580
I didn't think

557
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,000
that being deaf and mute was a problem.

558
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,500
I could learn sign language.

559
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,330
Right.

560
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,540
But Mumu is a healthy child.

561
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,080
After Mumu was born, she never talked.

562
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,580
Xiao Ma always signed to her,

563
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,380
so she talked less and less.

564
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,630
I was really anxious.

565
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,380
So later on, I purposely didn't sign.

566
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,460
And I didn't let Mumu sign either,

567
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,080
I only allowed her to speak.

568
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,130
Xiao Ma and I would argue. I would argue with him too.

569
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,960
When I got home.

570
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,790
No one talked to me.

571
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:43,750
Never mind.

572
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,580
Anyway, we agreed when we got divorced

573
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,380
that I would take care of Mumu when she started school.

574
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,580
I have the ability now.

575
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,630
I also want to

576
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,000
give her the best life.

577
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:04,580
Hong Jie,

578
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,630
I don't want to go to court.

579
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,670
I really don't.

580
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,830
Where to?

581
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,580
Mumu is still waiting for me.

582
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,630
Look over there.

583
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,750
Four-eyes.

584
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,380
Stop.

585
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,420
Stop the car.
There's been a car accident over there.

586
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,330
Did you see it clearly?

587
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,580
See what?

588
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,210
Didn't you promise me before?

589
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,750
That you would do whatever I said.

590
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,080
Do what?

591
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,130
Cause a car accident?

592
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,880
You won't be held responsible if you crash.

593
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,830
The car has insurance.

594
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,960
You just need to make the angle of the crash look natural.

595
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,830
Has Four-eyes always been doing this for you?

596
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,790
If you agree.

597
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,710
I'll help you pay the lawyer's fees.

598
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,960
Are you okay?

599
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,210
Take it.

600
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:37,080
Is this what you meant by big business?

601
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,210
Is this what you've been doing?

602
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,290
It's okay, it's okay.

603
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,500
He's my friend.

604
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,250
Hurry up.

605
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,830
Who doesn't want to live a good life?

606
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,540
Do you understand?

607
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,540
I want to live better than a normal person.

608
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,920
How many times have you been late or left early?

609
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,880
How many part-time jobs do you have anyway?

610
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,830
(I'm in trouble, short of money)

611
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,080
I need money too, you know.

612
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,790
How many complaints do you get every month?

613
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,380
And

614
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,540
I've been taking good care of you.

615
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,710
You're living in the dormitory with your daughter.

616
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,710
I knew,
but didn't say anything.

617
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,330
Find a place to live this month, and do it quickly.

618
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,250
Don't let your daughter have nowhere to sleep.

619
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,540
Do you understand?

620
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,920
You're a father too.

621
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,580
Please help me. It's hard for me to find a job.

622
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,210
Please.
No, don't gesture like that.

623
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,710
No. There's no need to write, no need to write.

624
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,960
I can't understand what you're saying.

625
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,460
And you can't hear what I'm saying either.

626
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,630
I have a boss too.

627
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,830
There's no way. Okay?

628
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,250
Car accidents are still dangerous.

629
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,460
Be careful not to get hurt.

630
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:38,630
How much?

631
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,380
Two thousand.

632
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,420
Have you seen my dad?

633
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,750
Isn't he at work?

634
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,380
Have you seen my dad?

635
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,420
Where did you go?

636
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,170
Did you have a bad dream?

637
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:51,170
What did you dream about?

638
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,540
I dreamt that you didn't want me anymore.

639
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,790
No.

640
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,790
Little fool.

641
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,710
Whose is this? I haven't seen you wear it before.

642
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:15,170
I bought you a hamburger.

643
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:24,710
Go upstairs.

644
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,040
Here.

645
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,670
Xiao Ma is here. Sit down.

646
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,460
Attorney Chen, you know him.

647
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,000
Lao Liu, you've met him.

648
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,080
From the insurance company.

649
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,790
Come here and sit down.

650
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,580
I want to learn sign language too.

651
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,040
But I'm too clumsy and can't remember the signs.

652
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,500
But it doesn't affect our communication.

653
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,170
Attorney Chen,

654
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,710
I specially invited him here today.

655
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:10,080
He said he wants to file a custody lawsuit for you.

656
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,250
We know you're a good father.

657
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,580
We were all very moved by your story.

658
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,540
Can I win the lawsuit?

659
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,290
Well...

660
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,920
Mr. Chen is our old friend.

661
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,710
I know what he's capable of very well.

662
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:31,710
He will definitely win the lawsuit for you.

663
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,710
No rush, no rush.

664
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,790
Attorney Chen said,

665
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,710
the court needs you to provide a proof of assets.

666
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:45,460
What is a proof of assets?

667
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,210
It's to prove that

668
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,710
you have the money to support your daughter.

669
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:51,540
How much money?

670
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,830
Probably about five hundred thousand.

671
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:55,540
Five hundred thousand is about right.

672
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,920
Five hundred thousand.

673
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:58,170
I'll take care of the money.

674
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,170
I can transfer a car to you.

675
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,670
To prove it's your property.

676
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:05,670
Why are you helping me?

677
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,040
We're in this together,

678
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:12,170
your business is my business.

679
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,580
As long as we make money together

680
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,540
and work together, that's all that matters.

681
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,130
It's that easy.

682
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:31,040
Come on.

683
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:35,580
I can tell you

684
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,960
just how much I can make from your last car accident.

685
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:39,920
Six figures.

686
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:43,580
For a classic luxury car like that

687
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:44,790
parts are very hard to find.

688
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,710
The insurance company will value it high.

689
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,130
Send it to our factory

690
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,750
and replace some parts with cheaper ones,

691
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:51,630
we'll make a profit off the difference.

692
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,330
Do you understand?

693
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,040
Business is hard these days,

694
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:01,790
and I have so many brothers to support,

695
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,500
so I have to come up with something.

696
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:06,830
When we make money, we'll split it.

697
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,170
I promise.

698
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:10,710
It won't take long,

699
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:14,500
before your proof of assets is real.

700
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,710
Should we keep doing this?

701
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:25,710
Yes.

702
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,380
Are the drivers you hire all deaf?

703
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,830
Not necessarily.

704
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,130
But deaf people have a natural advantage,

705
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,750
no one cares how you drive a car.

706
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,210
No need to translate the last sentence.

707
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,630
Aren't we breaking the law by doing this?

708
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,670
Due to me, everyone has been fine, right?

709
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,380
Be careful.

710
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,380
They said you didn't crash hard enough this time.

711
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,960
It won't be easy to claim the insurance.

712
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:18,710
I need to make money.

713
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:21,210
Give me another car.

714
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,460
Dad's been sleeping a lot recently.

715
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:21,380
Does he work at night?

716
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:22,750
No.

717
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,960
He's already very tired during the day.

718
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,130
You fell asleep again.

719
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,960
What are you doing at night?

720
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:13,330
This is the sound of you sleeping.

721
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,330
Does it sound bad?

722
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:27,000
Sounds good.

723
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,960
Sounds

724
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,380
good.

725
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,380
Sounds good.

726
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,380
Sounds

727
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,380
good.

728
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:47,830
What kind of sound sounds good?

729
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,250
As sweet as ice cream.

730
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,330
Like a summer breeze.

731
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:58,580
Breeze.

732
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,210
What is this?

733
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,460
This is a gift from Linlin.

734
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:26,380
It can make whale sounds.

735
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:32,710
I saw on TV that whales don't make sounds.

736
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,500
Its good friends can hear it.

737
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:42,830
You blow, then I can hear you.

738
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:53,580
I'll be with you.

739
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,710
My biggest regret

740
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:03,960
is that I can't hear Mumu's voice.

741
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:12,580
Mumu's voice must be the most beautiful in the world.

742
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,210
Sounds

743
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,580
good.

744
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:34,330
Sounds good.

745
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,130
Xiao Ma.

746
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:11,000
Where's my money? Give it to me.

747
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:11,960
What's wrong?

748
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,710
Where's my money? Give it to me.

749
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,830
The deposit certificate is very important.

750
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,210
Isn't there still three days left?

751
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:21,750
Let's finish the job first.

752
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:23,830
What's the rush?

753
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,170
Wait a little longer.

754
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:26,580
There is only three days left till court.

755
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:32,290
Don't worry.

756
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,380
My daughter is very important to me.

757
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,630
Tell him,

758
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,880
don't drag his feet this time.

759
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,710
Make sure to trash the car in one go.

760
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:40,750
That way we won't be noticed.

761
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,500
Help me translate, what is he saying?

762
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:44,960
He wants to get the deposit certificate.

763
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,080
Do I need to teach you that?

764
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:51,380
You tell him.

765
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,250
As long as he crashes this car,

766
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,210
we'll definitely give him the deposit certificate.

767
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,420
You've softened.

768
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:16,630
If you want the deposit certificate,

769
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,750
go all the way with this crash.

770
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:32,290
Xiao Ma!

771
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:34,540
Get out of the way, Xiao Ma!

772
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:08,000
Have you treated her?

773
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,250
Calm down, calm down.

774
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,630
Is there a translator?

775
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:16,460
A family member who can speak.

776
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:18,540
A family member who can speak.

777
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,000
A family member who can speak.

778
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:09,130
Doctor, I'm the child's mother.

779
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,290
How is Mumu doing now?

780
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,000
All the necessary tests have been completed.

781
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,540
The child has no obvious external injuries.

782
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,380
She just won't speak.

783
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,290
She won't speak.

784
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,500
She should be able to speak.

785
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,130
She has always been able to speak.

786
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,380
She may have been temporarily speechless due to the shock.

787
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,130
But we can't be sure yet.

788
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:28,000
Go back and continue observation.

789
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:36,420
Mumu.

790
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,750
It's okay. Don't worry.
Mumu, come here.

791
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,880
Does it hurt anywhere?

792
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:50,330
Doctor,

793
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:52,290
are there any other tests to be done now?

794
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,290
If she doesn't feel any discomfort,

795
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,460
you can go home.

796
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:58,130
Come back anytime if there are any changes.

797
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,500
Okay, thank you.

798
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:05,750
Is she okay?

799
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:06,500
Don't touch me!

800
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:10,040
I'll take her home.

801
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:11,420
You...

802
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,630
See you in court.

803
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:26,000
This is Mumu's

804
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,500
previous living environment at her father's house.

805
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,880
We can see that it is extremely terrible.

806
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:39,040
She should not be raised by such an irresponsible father.

807
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,380
It's best that the mother takes care of her.

808
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,000
What does the defendant have to say?

809
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,630
He's asking to see Mumu.

810
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:05,630
I don't agree.

811
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,500
He is currently unable to protect my daughter.

812
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,500
I think meeting Mumu now

813
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,290
will only cause more harm to the child.

814
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,920
Defendant, what is your purpose in seeing Mumu?

815
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,750
He wants to see what Mumu says.

816
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,790
Mumu isn't speaking now.

817
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,000
Mumu can't speak now.

818
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,790
Don't you know who caused this?

819
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,500
Plaintiff, please get a hold of yourself.

820
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:42,750
I believe that

821
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:44,170
the defendant would not intentionally

822
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:45,790
harm Mumu.

823
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,330
Given the defendant's special circumstances,

824
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:49,960
the court can arrange for

825
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,460
both parties to be present

826
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:52,750
to see Mumu.

827
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:54,790
However, the defendant needs to understand that

828
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:57,130
since Mumu is currently under eight years old,

829
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:59,080
her personal wishes

830
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:01,210
will generally not affect the custody ruling.

831
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,540
Child, do you want to live with your mother?

832
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:22,500
Or do you want to live with your father?

833
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:03,210
Are you sure?

834
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:07,250
Why is it raining so hard?

835
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:08,880
It was fine when we got here.

836
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,290
When are you going to New Zealand?

837
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,130
We're leaving next week.

838
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,130
Let's have a dinner party before you leave.

839
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,670
Okay, see you at weekend.

840
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,420
Let's go, Mumu, let's go.

841
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:21,500
It's raining hard, get in the car quickly.

842
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,420
Let's go.

843
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,000
Zou Jie, let me show Mr. Wang around.

844
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,000
Feel free to look around.

845
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,330
She only bought the furniture a few years ago.

846
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,290
Basically, they've been abroad for the past few years,

847
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:35,420
so they haven't seen much use.

848
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:37,080
Actually, you can keep them all.

849
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:39,000
She's very generous.

850
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:40,670
When they leave, she'll leave everything to you.

851
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:52,790
How is it? Is New Zealand beautiful?

852
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,330
Mother. Her mother.

853
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,080
Mumu.

854
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:11,880
We're going to move abroad soon.

855
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:14,420
Your little brother went to say goodbye to Grandpa.

856
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,250
You'll stay in your little brother's room for now.

857
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:22,130
Your little brother is uncle's child.

858
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,750
We'll be a family from now on.

859
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:27,830
But Mumu,

860
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:32,170
you're my only child.

861
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:46,710
(Sender Xiao Ma: Is Mumu okay? Has she spoken?)

862
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:53,540
Mumu.

863
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:56,290
Can you say something?

864
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:58,960
I'm very worried.

865
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:21,790
I'm still a little worried.

866
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:24,000
Mumu still won't speak.

867
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:25,750
How's she going to go to school there?

868
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:28,040
Our main priority now

869
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:30,170
is to give her a good environment.

870
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,830
She needs to interact with kids her age.

871
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:09,750
When I grow up, I'll protect you.

872
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:51,880
What are you blowing?

873
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:02,250
I can hear.

874
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:08,250
I can really hear.

875
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:12,130
I hear Mumu's voice.

876
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:13,500
Sounds good.

877
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,750
It's true, believe me.

878
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:19,330
Are you possessed?

879
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:20,130
Are you?

880
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:21,880
I was wrong.

881
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:26,500
After I see Mumu tomorrow,

882
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:31,000
I'll turn myself in.

883
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:34,420
You're crazy.

884
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:40,250
If you want to die, don't drag me.

885
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:44,170
You ungrateful jerk.

886
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,210
Mumu has already left the school.

887
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:31,830
Don't you know?

888
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:34,420
The flight is this afternoon.

889
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:40,290
Mumu, Mumu.

890
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,000
Mumu.

891
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:45,580
Come here.

892
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:47,880
Okay. Don't yell. Your sister is here.

893
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:16,710
Hanhan, slow down.

894
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,750
Xiao Ma.
Mumu.

895
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:01,630
Daddy, I'm sorry.

896
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,500
I don't abandon you.

897
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,170
Don't be angry with me.

898
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,170
No, I was wrong.

899
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,250
I let you down.

900
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:12,250
I don't want to go abroad.

901
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:14,670
I want to be with you forever.

902
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:21,250
No, you have to go abroad. It's for your future.

903
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:23,380
I'm happy this is happening.

904
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:30,250
Listen to your mother. Be careful.

905
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:34,250
When I'm gone, don't make money like that.

906
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,500
Don't drive anymore.

907
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:39,540
Don't worry about me, you silly.

908
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:40,670
I want to meet.

909
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:43,540
That door. Meet there.

910
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:53,880
Cheer up.

911
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,250
Xiaojing, don't let her go over.

912
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:56,670
It's almost time to board.

913
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:03,380
It's cold there. Do you have any thick clothes?

914
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:20,880
That's him.
Stop, stop!

915
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:26,750
Mumu.

916
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:33,290
Mumu.

917
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:41,920
Mumu.

918
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:43,540
Mumu.

919
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:47,500
Mumu.

920
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:51,420
Let my dad go.

921
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:54,670
Let my dad go.

922
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:56,960
Let go of my dad.

923
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:58,630
Let go.

924
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,630
Let go of my dad.

925
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,790
Let go of my dad.

926
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:08,540
Let go.

927
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,790
Let go of my dad.

928
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:14,540
My dad is a good person.

929
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:19,040
My dad is the best dad in the world.

930
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:22,210
Let go of my dad.

931
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:25,040
Let go of my dad.

932
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,420
Our city has apprehended a

933
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:30,040
criminal gang involved in insurance fraud.

934
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,580
According to the confession,

935
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:33,080
in order to turn a profit on high insurance premiums,

936
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:34,670
the drivers would wear protective suits

937
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:36,210
or wrap themselves in quilts,

938
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:38,290
and drive a vehicle prepared in advance.

939
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:39,290
They would deliberately cause single

940
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:40,330
or double-vehicle accidents,

941
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,540
and then claim compensation from the insurance company,

942
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:44,460
profiting from it.

943
01:19:44,830 --> 01:19:47,170
Profits could reach hundreds of thousands of yuan each time.

944
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:48,330
This fraud gang

945
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,290
even formed a complete industrial chain.

946
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,380
In this insurance fraud case,

947
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:53,920
there are also deaf people involved.

948
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,670
During the police arrest,

949
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:56,920
one police officer was injured.

950
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:57,880
Their behavior was heinous.

951
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,920
If I stay with him,

952
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:09,790
he will die.

953
01:20:15,170 --> 01:20:18,170
He got into this mess all because of me.

954
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,960
It would be better if I weren't here.

955
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:31,540
It's not like that.

956
01:20:33,790 --> 01:20:34,540
Baby.

957
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:38,540
Baby.

958
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:40,170
It's not like that.

959
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,330
Xiao Ma.

960
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:41,500
Xiao Ma.

961
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:44,170
Xiao Ma.

962
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,420
The case was completed

963
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,920
by the Wanping District PSB, Yujiang Municipality.

964
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,920
The defendants Ma Da,

965
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:02,710
Zhao Liang,
Li Mei,

966
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:04,540
Chen Zhicheng,
Zhou Sixi,

967
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:06,170
Liu Shenghan,
and Xiao Tongrong

968
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:08,960
are suspected of insurance fraud.

969
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:19,080
Do you have any objections to the accusations?

970
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:35,790
The defendant has something to say.

971
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:46,170
He said he pleads guilty.

972
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:48,500
At that time,

973
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,920
my mom found a very good lawyer for my dad.

974
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:53,250
I was young.

975
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:55,540
They were afraid I'd never see my dad again,

976
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,880
so the court specially allowed me to attend the hearing.

977
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:01,460
I thought my dad would be fine.

978
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,830
But there were many crimes. He didn't do them,

979
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:06,670
yet he confessed.

980
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:08,710
Why?

981
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:37,420
I want to see a lawyer.

982
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:38,170
Don't move.
I didn't commit any crimes.

983
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,420
I want to see a lawyer.
Don't move.

984
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,130
I want to see a lawyer.

985
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:41,670
Don't move.

986
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:44,210
Confess to all the crimes.

987
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:48,540
Otherwise, you'll never see your daughter again.

988
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:53,670
What are you doing? Don't move.

989
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:58,460
My brothers outside know your daughter.

990
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,460
He said he did it all by himself.

991
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,460
No, no.

992
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,080
Order in the court!

993
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,080
It has nothing to do with others.

994
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:19,920
Quiet.

995
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,670
Quiet. Sit down.

996
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:24,380
The judicial panel will question each defendant separately.

997
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:27,040
Defendant Ma Da,

998
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,130
all the vehicles you used to fake traffic accidents

999
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:29,000
and commit insurance fraud

1000
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,790
came from the Xitian Auto Shop.

1001
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:32,790
Do you have any objections?

1002
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:34,750
No objections.

1003
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:36,380
Was it the car shop owner, Zhao Liang,

1004
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:37,290
instructed you?

1005
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,080
No.

1006
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,170
Are you sure?

1007
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:47,540
When you drove those cars away,

1008
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:49,170
didn't the the car shop people know about it?

1009
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:51,790
Yes.

1010
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:53,790
Are you stupid? Don't admit to something you didn't do.

1011
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,170
What is your relationship with the defendant Zhao Liang?

1012
01:24:58,290 --> 01:24:59,170
Employer-employee relationship.

1013
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:01,290
What was your job at the car shop?

1014
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:03,210
Sales.

1015
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:06,040
All the cars at my shop were for sale.

1016
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:08,670
One day, Xiao Ma came to borrow a car,

1017
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,210
saying he wanted to take it out for a spin.

1018
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:11,420
So I lent one to him.

1019
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:13,670
So you know the defendant Ma Da?

1020
01:25:14,670 --> 01:25:15,460
Yes.

1021
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:16,960
Were you aware he was causing accidents

1022
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,210
to commit insurance fraud?

1023
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:20,040
I admit I covered for him,

1024
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:21,460
because I sympathized with him.

1025
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,170
He is a disabled person.

1026
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,290
But I didn't expect him to become bolder later on.

1027
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:30,790
I didn't know.
Next.

1028
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:32,580
The public prosecutor

1029
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:35,540
will present evidence to the court

1030
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,920
regarding the criminal facts alleged in the indictment.

1031
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,000
The evidence proves

1032
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,750
the defendant Ma Da resisted arrest,

1033
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:41,170
and threatens personal safety significantly.

1034
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:42,330
While monitoring

1035
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:44,040
the defendant Ma Da, the police found that

1036
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,380
he was loitering

1037
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:47,920
near his daughter's school and residence.

1038
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,630
Sometimes, he'd even follow her to and from school.

1039
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:51,790
His intentions were unclear.

1040
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:52,670
He recently

1041
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:54,170
lost custody of his daughter.

1042
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:56,500
The police were worried that he might harm her,

1043
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,290
or even harm her on impulse.

1044
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,130
The police acted quickly.

1045
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:03,460
The defendant Ma Da, during the arrest,

1046
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:05,790
clearly resisted arrest and assaulted the police.

1047
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:06,790
What is assaulting the police?

1048
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:07,920
What is resisting arrest?

1049
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:12,170
It means your dad didn't want to be arrested,

1050
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:14,790
and he hit the police.

1051
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,670
No, he just wanted to see me.

1052
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:19,290
I know.
Defendant Ma Da,

1053
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:21,630
Do you have

1054
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:23,540
any objections to the evidence

1055
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:24,670
alleged in the indictment?

1056
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:28,170
No.

1057
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,460
Through further investigation,

1058
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:30,330
we have determined that

1059
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:32,040
the defendant began committing crimes

1060
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,420
while living with his daughter.

1061
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:35,040
He even caused an insurance fraud accident

1062
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,710
while his daughter was in the car.

1063
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,000
What father

1064
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,040
would endanger his daughter's life?

1065
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:41,960
Such an irresponsible father,

1066
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,330
his hearing impairment is not worthy of sympathy.

1067
01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:46,290
We request the court to judge according to law.

1068
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:46,960
You're lying.

1069
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,250
My dad isn't like that.

1070
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:49,380
The gallery must not talk.

1071
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:50,960
My dad has never hurt me.

1072
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,330
He is the best dad in the world.

1073
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:54,920
He has never hurt me.

1074
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,880
He is the best dad in the world.
The bailiff shall maintain order.

1075
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:57,040
The gallery shall be seated.
and comply with court discipline.

1076
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:58,670
Mumu.

1077
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:00,420
Daddy.

1078
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:02,290
Daddy is fine. Hurry and go back.

1079
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:03,380
Dad, tell them you're not like that.

1080
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:04,170
That's my daughter. Let me go.

1081
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:05,290
I'm calling a recess.

1082
01:27:05,290 --> 01:27:07,710
Let go of my dad.

1083
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:11,170
Quiet.

1084
01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:14,170
Daddy, tell them you're not like that.

1085
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:15,420
Please, your honor.

1086
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:17,170
The bailiff shall escort the defendant to await trial.

1087
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:17,830
Quiet.

1088
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:19,540
Please, your honor.

1089
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:22,080
I plead guilty. Just sentence me.

1090
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:27,250
Auntie, please help my dad.

1091
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,960
Let go of my dad.

1092
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:34,670
Mumu.

1093
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:36,380
Let go of my dad.

1094
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:38,920
This isn't right.

1095
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:41,830
Auntie, help him.

1096
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:44,170
I lied.

1097
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:52,290
I lied.

1098
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:55,290
I knew all about the insurance fraud and car accidents.

1099
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,500
Xiao Ma is the driver I found.

1100
01:27:58,790 --> 01:27:59,630
I know sign language.

1101
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:01,080
I specially learned it,

1102
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:04,420
because deaf people are obedient and easy to deceive.

1103
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,920
You can make them do whatever you want.

1104
01:28:09,670 --> 01:28:11,170
We arranged everything.

1105
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:13,290
Xiao Ma knows nothing about it.

1106
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:16,460
Were the fake certificates and vehicle transfers for Ma Da

1107
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:17,710
all handled by you?

1108
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:19,330
What exactly was your deal?

1109
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,420
We lied to him.

1110
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:22,710
Then why did he plead guilty?

1111
01:28:29,830 --> 01:28:31,960
Because he just wanted to protect his daughter.

1112
01:28:44,290 --> 01:28:45,040
Your honor,

1113
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:48,290
I saw

1114
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:50,170
Zhao Liang threaten Xiao Ma in sign language before session.

1115
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:50,790
You're lying.
I didn't.

1116
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:52,630
Stop. Don't move.

1117
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:53,790
I want to report it.

1118
01:28:53,790 --> 01:28:55,170
There are two more of Zhao Liang's people

1119
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:57,000
in the fifth row.

1120
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:17,290
Mumu is safe.

1121
01:29:17,290 --> 01:29:20,080
Don't be so silly anymore.

1122
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:38,960
Court proceedings will now resume.

1123
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:42,290
Do you have any objections

1124
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:44,330
to the defendant Li Mei's statement?

1125
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:48,080
No.

1126
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:50,790
Has Zhao Liang ever threatened you?

1127
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:56,580
Yes.

1128
01:29:57,330 --> 01:30:00,170
Do you know that what you did was a crime?

1129
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:06,670
Yes.

1130
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:09,960
Do you have any additional statements?

1131
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:20,330
I committed a crime.

1132
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,670
I'm sorry. I did wrong.

1133
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:30,710
I am deaf.

1134
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:35,500
I have a kind daughter.

1135
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:39,670
I work hard

1136
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:44,580
to give Mumu the best life.

1137
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:47,790
But it's really hard.

1138
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:51,920
I can only smile at others,

1139
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:56,210
but others don't understand me.

1140
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:03,170
Fortunately, Mumu can translate for me.

1141
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:08,580
I thought

1142
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:13,210
that as long as we hid in our own world, it would be enough.

1143
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:17,790
But her mom wanted to take Mumu abroad.

1144
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:20,210
I scared.

1145
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:24,790
I was afraid I'll never see Mumu again.

1146
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:30,170
But I shouldn't have kept her by my side

1147
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:31,710
to be my ears.

1148
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:35,040
I was too selfish.

1149
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:43,540
Mumu, you have to be yourself and grow up well.

1150
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:51,830
I don't deserve to be your father.

1151
01:31:57,290 --> 01:31:58,790
I've been thinking lately

1152
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:02,290
why I can't hear

1153
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:07,670
and why I can't speak.

1154
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,750
I really want to hear your voice.

1155
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:19,880
Your voice

1156
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:24,880
must be the best sound in the world.

1157
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:35,080
Sounds

1158
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:38,420
good.

1159
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:42,790
Sounds

1160
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:47,040
good.

1161
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,080
Li Mei's testimony

1162
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:25,670
helped reduce Ma's sentence a lot.

1163
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:29,920
But the case involved too much money.

1164
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:33,420
In the end, he was sentenced to six years.

1165
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:41,420
I know it's tough for deaf people to be heard,

1166
01:33:42,290 --> 01:33:46,290
but deaf people should have a fair trial.

1167
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:53,420
Believe me,

1168
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:56,170
I will help your voices be heard.

1169
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:57,710
Okay?

1170
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,790
Secretly recorded videos can also be used as evidence?

1171
01:34:18,170 --> 01:34:20,380
Her WeChat chat records can be evidence.

1172
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:22,170
But you forced her to delete them.

1173
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:23,540
Don't talk nonsense.

1174
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:24,670
What chat evidence?

1175
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:26,670
Can the data be recovered?

1176
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:27,790
It should be no problem.

1177
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:29,580
The technicians are working on it.

1178
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:30,790
Officer,

1179
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,290
I felt sorry for her, so I gave her this job.

1180
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:34,670
I also sympathize with her,

1181
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:36,210
which is why I care about her.

1182
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:38,710
You are three months behind on her salary.

1183
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:39,920
That's a fact, right?

1184
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:41,290
She suddenly wants to leave.
She was doing a good job.

1185
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:43,170
Why would she leave?

1186
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:44,420
I think these deaf-mutes

1187
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:45,630
must be missing something in their brains.

1188
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:46,920
Watch your attitude.

1189
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,170
They're not deaf-mutes.

1190
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:51,290
They just can't hear,

1191
01:34:51,290 --> 01:34:52,290
they're not mute.

1192
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:53,210
Please call

1193
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:55,540
them deaf or hearing-impaired.

1194
01:34:57,670 --> 01:34:59,040
And do you really understand deaf people?

1195
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:01,960
Do you know how afraid they are of our world

1196
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,830
because they can't hear?

1197
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:08,790
Your behavior is exactly what she's afraid of.

1198
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,290
Let's get this straight.

1199
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:11,920
I'm not the criminal.

1200
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:13,290
She's the criminal.

1201
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:17,460
We wake up every day, go out, eat, go to work,

1202
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:18,670
ask the boss for our salary,

1203
01:35:18,670 --> 01:35:19,920
protect ourselves from harm

1204
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:20,670
and being insulted.

1205
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:23,920
These are the most basic things for a normal person.

1206
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:27,290
But did you know that for a deaf person,

1207
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,040
they need to put in a hundred

1208
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,170
or a thousand times more effort

1209
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:31,790
and may still fall short.

1210
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:34,330
Just to get up every day and face the world,

1211
01:35:34,330 --> 01:35:36,040
they have to muster a lot of courage.

1212
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:37,580
When they encounter problems,

1213
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:39,670
they may even feel abandoned

1214
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:40,670
and excluded by society.

1215
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:44,170
So deaf people are very patient.

1216
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:47,710
You are the one who pushed such a patient girl

1217
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:49,080
to the police station.

1218
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:51,670
You even tried to land her in prison.

1219
01:35:52,290 --> 01:35:53,420
Can you live with yourself?

1220
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:55,250
We are now going to question you

1221
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,580
about the harassment.

1222
01:35:58,130 --> 01:35:59,000
Please cooperate.

1223
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:06,670
I will notify you as soon as I have any news.

1224
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:08,170
Please do.

1225
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:11,290
You haven't told me yet,

1226
01:36:11,290 --> 01:36:13,460
how can I recognize a deaf person at a glance?

1227
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,460
When you walk into a place,

1228
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,710
deaf people will smile at you

1229
01:36:20,170 --> 01:36:21,170

1250

The little girl who once wanted to protect her father can now protect more people.

1251
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:24,170
The world can be silent, but they will always have love.
