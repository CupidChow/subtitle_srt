1
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,638
Dear Lord, through your Son,

2
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:17,726
we pour the power of the Holy Spirit
into this water in abundance,

3
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,021
and may those who have died
with Jesus Christ

4
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,565
rise to a new life with him.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,611
Your Son lives and reigns with you
forever and ever in the kingdom of heaven.

6
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:34,200
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

7
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:41,416
Now, God will share his own life
with this dear child.

8
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,587
Let us all take part
in this ceremony with joy.

9
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,494
Are the godparents,
who've offered to help guide this child

10
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,454
onto the right path of faith,

11
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,664
present at this ceremony?

12
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,459
I'm here!

13
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,056
Here I am, guys. The child's godmother.

14
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,814
Who's here?

15
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,233
Auntie and Uncle, sorry for being late.

16
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,735
Hello, Cousin. Hello, cousin's wife.

17
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,911
This woman is really the baby's godmother?

18
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,213
What's going on?

19
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,469
Yes, we picked her.

20
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:20,056
She's family, and she's…
she's the child's godmother.

21
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,024
In the name… of the Father,

22
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,193
the Son,

23
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,862
and the Holy Spirit,

24
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,156
I baptize Angela.

25
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,616
Amen.

26
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,534
Amen.

27
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,877
Mu-hee, you must have gone crazy.

28
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,546
How dare you show up here!

29
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,340
Mu-hee's a part of your family.

30
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,760
You even said so in the article
and in front of the priest.

31
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,263
Well, then, you're showing us
how you're family?

32
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,350
You come with flowers for the baptism,
and everything's fine?

33
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,644
That's not it.

34
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,522
There's no world
in which I'm part of this family.

35
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,483
We've got no ties.

36
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,151
There's no Mu-hee here.

37
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,196
Um, what?

38
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,657
I'm Do Ra-mi.

39
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,825
Do Ra-mi?

40
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,661
You're filming a show, is that it?

41
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,830
I suppose you haven't seen the movie yet.

42
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,917
If this was a movie,
I wouldn't have arrived with flowers.

43
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,295
In the movie,
Do Ra-mi carries other things with her.

44
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,839
Oh, yeah? Like what?

45
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,803
A cadaver.

46
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,019
She delivers dead bodies to her enemies.

47
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,521
That's extremely terrifying.

48
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,110
I wonder…

49
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,114
whose dead bodies

50
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,825
would terrify you the most?

51
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,328
What scares you?

52
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,590
Mu-hee, tell us.

53
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,385
Do you remember how your parents died?

54
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,055
Should I say "I don't remember,"
like I did back then?

55
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,186
That's cool.

56
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,357
Well, I'll say I don't know.
Like I did then to piss you off.

57
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,987
Is that so?

58
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,073
We'll keep her in the dark, then.

59
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,825
It's better this way.

60
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,202
For your sake

61
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,704
and ours.

62
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,917
If that's how you want it,
you better not show up in her life again.

63
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,254
If you do whatever you please
and continue to show up

64
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,340
just because you want to hurt her,

65
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,633
her head could explode.

66
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,303
Boom!

67
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,433
All right, then.

68
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,478
She's not

69
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,607
just something you can shove
under the rug.

70
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,276
If she explodes, everybody dies.

71
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,326
So please,
receive the abundant grace from God

72
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,203
and go to heaven.

73
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,830
Amen.

74
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,099
<i>Dance! Feel alive…</i>

75
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:36,229
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

76
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,399
Hi there. I'm Do Ra-mi.

77
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:42,902
Do Ra-mi.

78
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:48,074
Do Ra-mi, your reputation precedes you.

79
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,535
Uh-uh. Different Do Ra-mi.

80
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,370
That creature is very frightening.

81
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,122
She's scary.

82
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,165
I am the version only you know.

83
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,711
The crazy bitch who's haunting Cha Mu-hee.

84
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,338
I see.

85
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,716
You must be that demon, I guess.
I should be scared of you, right?

86
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,803
You know what she said.

87
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,515
I heard too much about you already.

88
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,309
Although based on your clothes,

89
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,311
who would find you scary?

90
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,690
- Although, I wouldn't call you normal.
- You like it?

91
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,983
Looks good, huh?

92
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,611
I came from a photo shoot.

93
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,071
A photo shoot.

94
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,034
I heard you were there this morning,
and everything was fine.

95
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,078
Hey, how did you get in here?

96
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,497
I opened the door with the code.

97
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,375
I saw it when I came here
with that writer.

98
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,421
You're quite meticulous for a psycho.

99
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,548
One look at the code,
and you remembered it.

100
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,885
Cha Mu-hee's sneaky. That's who she is.

101
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,346
Creepy, huh?

102
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,514
Yeah.

103
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,933
I'm uncomfortable, thanks to you.

104
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,396
You can be frank.
I know so much about you already.

105
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,025
I've no desire to say mean things
to a person I just met.

106
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,070
But since you've said it's fine to,
I will.

107
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,072
I've had enough.

108
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,868
Whatever game you're playing right now,

109
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,205
I no longer want to take part in it.

110
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,624
So move along.

111
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,418
You're beyond boring. Get lost.

112
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,233
I don't like taking taxis.

113
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,321
Drive me home, okay?

114
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,908
Joo Ho-jin.

115
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,789
Hey, Ho-jin.

116
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,628
Hey, honey.

117
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,218
Are you angry?
Your pride's hurt 'cause I stood you up?

118
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,221
Aw, and I dumped you back in Canada.

119
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,265
What's wrong? Are you hurt now?

120
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,225
So cute.

121
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,396
When the driver comes,

122
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,523
we should go to my place together.

123
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,692
There's a nice bottle of wine.

124
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,610
We'll open it. Set the mood.

125
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,406
We'll listen to our song.

126
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,492
Yeah.

127
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,288
Sing.

128
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,000
Gets better each time I listen to it.

129
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,923
Your ride is on the way.
Once it gets here, I'll take off.

130
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,926
Don't make me leave.
You know I'll come back.

131
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,181
Hi, can I help you?

132
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,225
We're outside. Thank you.

133
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,019
Good.

134
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,063
I see you pulling up. Great.

135
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,107
Okay.

136
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,777
Cha Mu… Cha Mu-hee!

137
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,487
Come back here!

138
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,448
You can't…

139
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,367
Ah, shoot.
Please wait a sec. I'll get her.

140
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,744
Hey, Mu-hee!

141
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,954
She went back inside.
Please, wait. Cha Mu-hee.

142
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,726
Come on, stop this!

143
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,812
Your ride is waiting.

144
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,065
It's late. Go home already.

145
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:01,202
If you don't come out,
I'll report you for trespassing.

146
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,287
Hey, honey.

147
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,543
I scared you.

148
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,880
You go to sleep in this?
It's what you like to wear?

149
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,715
Oh, sexy.

150
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,175
That's my brother's.

151
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,011
It was in the laundry basket.
Why are you wearing it?

152
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,972
Give it back. Come on, now.

153
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,184
But I like it.
I wanted to wear it for the night.

154
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,604
Why? Why would you wanna sleep in that?

155
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,106
Should I sleep naked?

156
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,232
Hmm.

157
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,608
You have a dirty mind.

158
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,570
The taxi is here.

159
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,491
Go already.
You can just take that robe and get out.

160
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,035
Oh! I was so busy today. I'm too tired!

161
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,662
Oh, you're not staying here.

162
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,455
You're not gonna sleep here.

163
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,750
That's right. I'll shower
and then go to bed. Want that?

164
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,293
You won't do that.

165
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,129
- All right.
- Cha Mu-hee.

166
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,965
Cha Mu-hee isn't here tonight.

167
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,556
You see,

168
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,934
she wouldn't come to your house
after all that.

169
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,361
Hello? Yes, I'm sorry.

170
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,029
Please wait a moment.

171
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,282
She's on her way.

172
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,871
All right, then.

173
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,416
Okay, Ms. Do Ra-mi, let's have a talk.

174
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,670
Did she have you come to my house
to resolve things?

175
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,381
Because she can't say sorry
for what happened?

176
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,634
I didn't come to ask for forgiveness.

177
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:49,143
I'm here to make sure
you don't ever accept her apology.

178
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,978
No matter what.

179
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,272
For your sake, honey.

180
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,358
When you're in Italy,

181
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,694
don't let her persuade you.

182
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,695
This is my advice.

183
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,657
Your advice is of no use to me.
I won't be going to Italy, okay?

184
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,911
I'm looking for someone to replace me,

185
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,455
so I won't ever get involved
with Mu-hee again.

186
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:16,170
Yesterday was very upsetting,
but I understand that it wasn't her fault.

187
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,131
It's absurd,
but I won't be able to brush it off

188
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,008
and pretend you're not serious.

189
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,177
But I would never

190
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,888
get involved with a woman
who completely ignores

191
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,724
how other people feel,
depending on her mood.

192
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,644
Never. I can't stand those kinds of women.

193
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,606
Don't dump your emotions on others
and expect them to deal with it

194
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,067
because that's basically
psychological torture.

195
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,947
You're just a silly child
throwing a tantrum

196
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,908
'cause you wanted a toy so badly,
and you couldn't get it.

197
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,621
I just don't wanna be a part of that.
I'm gonna avoid you.

198
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,499
You said you think
before you speak. Is that right?

199
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,752
That means that you…

200
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,505
you despise Cha Mu-hee.

201
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,840
Yes, I do.

202
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,009
I don't ever wanna be with her.

203
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,390
I'll do my best to avoid her.
I'm not interested in being with her.

204
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,894
This is over, once and for all.

205
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,981
Okay.

206
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,026
So that's it. Don't change your mind.

207
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,446
Mm, time's up.

208
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,448
What do you mean "time's up"?

209
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,411
The timer.

210
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,830
It's for the pill I gave you.

211
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,252
Things could have gotten complicated
if Cha Mu-hee showed up.

212
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,255
You're Do Ra-mi. That's your story now?

213
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:46,010
Yeah, so if you run into Cha Mu-hee,
please don't tell her anything about this.

214
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,721
You're gonna keep insisting…

215
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,183
Good night.

216
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,437
And don't go back to her.

217
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,326
Oh.

218
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,120
Let's go back to
that child and a toy metaphor.

219
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,874
Just imagine that poor girl never had one.

220
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,920
Maybe she'd be confused because

221
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,839
she finally found something she wants.

222
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,177
Would you still consider that a tantrum?

223
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,432
She's really that pathetic.
That's why I'm here.

224
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,223
Are you awake?

225
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,604
Today's the day I'm moving in. Remember?

226
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,231
Ah, right.

227
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,275
You didn't answer your phone, so I used
the passcode you gave me to get in.

228
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,443
I didn't know you'd be here.

229
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,280
Were you drinking?
Is that why you slept on the couch?

230
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,241
Uh, no, I…

231
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,500
I brought my stuff inside for now.

232
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,252
It's not that much.

233
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,736
ZOLPIDEM, TRAZODONE, RAMELTEON
TAKE AT BEDTIME

234
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,238
<i>It's for the pill I gave you.</i>

235
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,949
She actually drugged me?

236
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,828
What's this?

237
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,122
Sleeping pills. Really?

238
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,125
Why'd she knock me out?

239
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:29,631
<i>Things could have gotten</i>
<i>complicated if Cha Mu-hee showed up.</i>

240
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,678
Mu-hee was here,
so why would it get complicated?

241
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,098
She was like
a different person last night.

242
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,267
Ho-jin?

243
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,479
- I'll put my stuff over there.
- Okay.

244
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,147
By the way…

245
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,401
…has Mu-hee

246
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,614
called herself Do Ra-mi lately?
Have you heard her joke around like that?

247
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,074
Yeah, she does that.

248
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,743
"You better watch out. I'm Do Ra-mi."
She's always saying that.

249
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,952
Oh, I see.

250
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,872
Everybody loves it
when she acts like Do Ra-mi.

251
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,209
She was a big hit at the photo shoot,
and they all said Do Ra-mi was killing it.

252
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,169
Mu-hee really loved it too.

253
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,713
Oh crap, the outfit!

254
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,174
Almost forgot about it.

255
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,593
Why? Because you need to return it?

256
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,387
She left set
wearing the outfit from the photo shoot.

257
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,517
Sounds like it's out of character for her

258
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,560
to leave a shoot
with an outfit from production.

259
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,645
Um, I guess.

260
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,940
She was tired and fell asleep right away.
She's been asleep until now.

261
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,067
She said that? Are you positive?

262
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,069
Is she better now?

263
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,988
I was on the phone with her earlier.
She's at Pilates right now.

264
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,740
Pilates?

265
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,997
You're doing so well today.

266
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,167
I've got a lot on my mind.

267
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,003
I need to focus on exercising.

268
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,430
Hey, about the replacement interpreter.

269
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,058
I have a friend. Her name's Yoko.

270
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,020
She's not completely fluent in Italian,
but she's available.

271
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,814
That's fine. Thanks for asking around.

272
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:09,773
It's all good.

273
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,154
But this isn't like you.

274
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,281
You're not the type to leave a job.

275
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,158
You're not irresponsible.

276
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,119
Or is it because of Do Ra-mi?

277
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,371
It's Mu-hee. Cha Mu-hee.

278
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,957
It's complicated. Please don't confuse it.

279
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,834
It's turned out well for her.

280
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,503
Playing Do Ra-mi
has turned her life around.

281
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,797
I read she was born rich too.

282
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,550
Her family's in education.

283
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,469
Maybe they knew your grandfather?

284
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,930
Why are you bringing him up?

285
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,807
They're connected.

286
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,475
Publishing and education.

287
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,853
I don't think so.
You're just trying too hard.

288
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,855
Anyway,

289
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,149
she was born to a rich family.

290
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,401
Who doesn't want that?

291
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,531
<i>Just imagine that poor girl never had one.</i>

292
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,162
But honestly,

293
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,122
why are you quitting?

294
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,334
- Did she dump you?
- Sure.

295
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,628
If I get dumped and rejected,

296
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,755
I should get really upset and get drunk.

297
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,924
Just quit my job on a whim.

298
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,383
Yeah.

299
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,302
Sounds great!

300
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,429
That's a healthy reaction, I guess.

301
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,266
Well, why not?
It might actually help to relax.

302
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,020
Drugging the guy who wants
to break up with you,

303
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,023
then going to your morning Pilates class
like nothing happened.

304
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,274
No way!

305
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,027
Man, she's worse than I thought.

306
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,404
Did Do Ra-mi really do that?

307
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,825
Hi there, I'm Do Ra-mi.

308
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,084
Yes, please contact Yoko quickly.

309
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,170
Tell her that she can make her plans
as soon as possible.

310
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,882
There won't be a camera on her
during the first part of our Italy trip,

311
00:20:58,966 --> 00:20:59,800
so don't worry.

312
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:00,926
Thanks.

313
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,638
Uh, as for her accommodations,
we booked a detached villa in Italy,

314
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,889
like the one in Canada.

315
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,267
But this time,
Hiro will stay in the same place.

316
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,393
Oh.

317
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:13,814
I thought, because there have been
articles about Mu-hee's relatives,

318
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:17,276
so what if they mention her relatives
during the Italy part of the trip?

319
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,530
We could even do a video call
with her family and profile them.

320
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,198
I'm so sorry.

321
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,869
The family's not close to her at all.
I don't believe they'll want any of that.

322
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,413
Ah, is that so?

323
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,415
I guess we can't help it.

324
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:35,460
Hiro's team said he's a fool
for his niece, so he might be up for it.

325
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,254
He's odd.

326
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,424
But apparently, he's proud of his niece.

327
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,009
Oh wow!

328
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,387
We'll make sure to bring a nice gift
when we meet later today.

329
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:47,723
Excuse me?

330
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,392
You're meeting Hiro… today?

331
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,562
He's here in Seoul. You didn't know?

332
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,772
No, we didn't.

333
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,069
- You could come and join us.
- No, we can't.

334
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,155
He's here for personal reasons.

335
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,157
We won't bother him. No!

336
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,242
Uh, well, then.

337
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,745
Hiro's niece is five years old.

338
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,954
She loves blue.

339
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,708
Her favorite character
is Power Ranger Blue. Nothing pink, then.

340
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,043
She won't like that.

341
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,462
Pink, no. And blue? Hell yeah. Got it?

342
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,089
You got that? No pink, just blue.

343
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,884
Think of it as an FYI.

344
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,844
Blue. Okay.

345
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,513
Is Mu-hee still coming
for her interview today?

346
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,265
Yes, she'll be here very soon.

347
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,354
And where's Ms. Shin?

348
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,397
Ah, she'll be here soon. It's fine.

349
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,858
Apparently, she was working all night.

350
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,319
Ah.

351
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,157
PRODUCER SHIN JI-SUN

352
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,076
<i>Come out. We need to talk.</i>

353
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,372
<i>Where are you?</i>

354
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,833
<i>I'm downstairs.</i>

355
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,839
<i>Come up to me. I'll be waiting.</i>

356
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,277
I should end things
before we run into each other.

357
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,955
Yeah.

358
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,167
I did this to myself. I'm not gonna run.

359
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,258
Coming! Hold on!

360
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,639
Are you, um, the delivery girl?

361
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,267
Who are you?

362
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,355
I… was gonna see someone.

363
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:44,816
Uh…

364
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,111
Honey, you expecting someone? Come here.

365
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,992
What do you want?

366
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,744
Uh…

367
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,205
Well, nothing. Yeah.

368
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,210
Oh wow. He's a bastard.

369
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,921
I come up here to see her? Is that it?

370
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,507
I don't wanna cling to you.

371
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,682
<i>The number</i>
<i>you're trying to reach is unavailable.</i>

372
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,684
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

373
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,937
She's not picking up the phone.

374
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,647
What's the matter?

375
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,533
Hold on. Let's talk this out.

376
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,868
I swear, we never met!
You have to believe.

377
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,995
- Believe me, okay? I just--
- I don't believe you.

378
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,873
I don't know her, really.
Look into my eyes. It's the truth, okay?

379
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,751
- Hey! Let go of me. I'm done.
- No, don't walk away!

380
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,962
We just moved in.
We can't fight like this.

381
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,923
Really. We've been a couple
for over eight years!

382
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,049
Don't do that!

383
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,010
Let me in!

384
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:58,265
Yes. I'm gonna talk to the staff now.
I'll call you later.

385
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,266
Bye.

386
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,820
Great! Is this the outfit?

387
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,490
- Yes, I'm sorry. I was very out of it.
- Thanks for bringing it.

388
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,243
- I'm really very sorry.
- It's okay.

389
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,537
There's something in here.

390
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,333
- I don't know what this is.
- You don't?

391
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,086
Hmm. What is it?

392
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,339
"If someone was kind to me"?

393
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,592
It looks like a page torn out of a book.

394
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,731
Hello, Mr. Joo.

395
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,443
It's a verse.

396
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,697
You don't know this poem?

397
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,325
Uh, well, no.

398
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,328
I don't know it. I never read poetry.

399
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,334
Mm, really? You've never seen it?

400
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,376
No.

401
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,129
I never read any poetry.

402
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,840
But why was it in my pocket?

403
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,344
The person who wore it
before you probably forgot to wash it.

404
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,512
Just throw it out.
Let's get to the interview.

405
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,472
Yeah.

406
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,440
Uh, may I talk to you?

407
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,569
There's something I wanna tell you.

408
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,407
I'm sorry.

409
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,286
So, so very sorry about everything.

410
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:55,840
<i>I'm here to make sure</i>
<i>you don't ever accept her apology.</i>

411
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:20,865
Yong-u.

412
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,325
Yup?

413
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,703
They said we might see a festival

414
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,080
on our trip to Italy

415
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,666
because it's gonna take place
when we're there.

416
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,625
Sounds good.

417
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,546
We'll also get to visit vineyards
and old castles.

418
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,173
So I better go.

419
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,926
If I quit, I'll miss all of that.

420
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,431
And I'll never see him again
if I don't go.

421
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,658
Hey, Yong-u.

422
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:08,163
What if everything just, uh,
gets super hard in life,

423
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,373
and it all just makes you wanna
quit everything,

424
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,209
but then you close your eyes,
and you wake up,

425
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,336
and suddenly realize
someone fixed everything.

426
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,213
That sounds great. I'd be grateful.

427
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,882
Really?

428
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,385
Are you saying I should thank her
for all of this?

429
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,262
Are you talking about Do Ra-mi?

430
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,099
- What?
- Mu-hee, you fell into a coma.

431
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:32,479
And when you opened your eyes again,
you were a global star thanks to her.

432
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,232
Yeah, that's true.

433
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,818
Well, it's actually pretty cool, I think.

434
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,737
While you were just lying in bed,

435
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,615
Do Ra-mi has accomplished
a whole lot for you.

436
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,034
She did.

437
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,495
I wasn't in charge.

438
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,371
I can't remember.

439
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,957
Look, Mu-hee, just imagine
if that worked every time.

440
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,042
Just close your eyes.

441
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,628
When there's something
you don't want to do, you say,

442
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,923
"Do Ra-mi, go clean the bathroom now.
I don't wanna do it."

443
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,258
And she does it for you.

444
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,057
Is this real?

445
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,204
<i>I can't do anything myself.</i>

446
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,707
<i>Maybe I should give up?</i>

447
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,075
<i>I closed my eyes,</i>
<i>and she's done everything while I was out.</i>

448
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,078
<i>Is it just like what happened back then?</i>

449
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,040
<i>Would it be okay for me to live like this?</i>

450
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,399
Hi!

451
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,109
Welcome to Seoul.

452
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,827
<i>Arigato.</i>

453
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,676
They don't speak
each other's language at all.

454
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,386
How can they communicate without you?

455
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,430
They'll figure it out.

456
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:17,518
It's not for long.
Hiro has been learning English.

457
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,813
He'll be able to talk to Mu-hee.
I'm sure it's gonna be okay.

458
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,484
Oh!

459
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,198
I got this present for your niece.

460
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,700
How do I say a present?

461
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,704
Present. A child's present.

462
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,708
Thanks for the present.
I know she'll love it.

463
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,877
You speak English now?

464
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,046
I've been practicing.

465
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,007
That's amazing. Wow!

466
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,928
Now I feel guilty
I don't really know Japanese.

467
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,513
I should've practiced it too.

468
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,430
Slowly.

469
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,057
Takes me time.

470
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,228
I can say things slowly.

471
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,399
Did she get drunk? Was she rude?
Did she say something wrong?

472
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,275
I'm wondering the same thing.

473
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:11,030
He wanted to ask Mu-hee
about what happened on the plane.

474
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,537
What did you

475
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,206
tell me before?

476
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,292
I'm sorry.

477
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,335
It's here.

478
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,879
I can't remember. Sorry.

479
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,883
That day,
you were looking me straight in the eye.

480
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,470
I don't know what he's saying.

481
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,389
His vocabulary's still very limited.

482
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,600
If I knew what those words meant,

483
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,144
I'd understand why you did that.

484
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,565
What are you saying?
I'm sorry, I don't understand!

485
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,862
You… gave kiss.

486
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,115
Kiss!

487
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,245
Kiss!

488
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,248
K… kiss?

489
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,792
- Me?
- Yes.

490
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,547
What? No. I wouldn't. You're lying.

491
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,216
I know you're lying.
That's what you're doing.

492
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,218
I'm lying? You are lying to me!

493
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,554
You don't say that.
You didn't kiss me on the plane?

494
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,639
If you said I was drunk
and threw up on you,

495
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,725
I'd be okay, even if I don't remember.

496
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:24,520
But in no world would I…
I don't want to kiss you.

497
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,231
I don't understand you,
but I can tell you're denying it.

498
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,318
This is really frustrating.
Call Nanami over, please.

499
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,903
No need.

500
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,739
I think that tells me
everything I wanted to know.

501
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,704
I studied Korean,

502
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,874
thinking it might help me remember
what you said that day.

503
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,627
It didn't, so I came here to ask you.

504
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,882
But I guess
what I really wanted to confirm…

505
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,677
wasn't what you said that day…

506
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,518
but your feelings.

507
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,148
Whether you remember it or not,

508
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:14,695
it's clear you didn't do it
because you like me.

509
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,787
Maybe our language barrier isn't so bad.

510
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,916
If you understood me,
I could never be so honest with you.

511
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,588
Sorry.

512
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,388
Please, please eat.

513
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,517
It's on you!

514
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,437
Okay.

515
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,704
Did Do Ra-mi do all this?

516
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,914
What for?

517
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,883
Do I need to quit everything?

518
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,816
If I quit everything, what will you do?

519
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,948
So if I close my eyes, Do Ra-mi,

520
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,160
tell me, what are you gonna do?

521
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,796
KINDNESS, TO ME

522
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,594
<i>Do that. You're good at it.</i>

523
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,305
Plus, you're basically
the only one who knows

524
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,432
about the hateful troll in my head.

525
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,811
So… keep rooting for me like you do.

526
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,105
Pray I never lose to my Do Ra-mi.

527
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,121
<i>Mu-hee, where are you now? Can we meet?</i>

528
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,208
I'd like to talk to you in person
to confirm certain things.

529
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,418
This is urgent.
It's important that we meet.

530
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,046
<i>You promised you wouldn't talk to Mu-hee.</i>

531
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,473
Oh, honey.

532
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,226
Why would you do that? You can't change.

533
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,312
Do Ra-mi.

534
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,314
Ah.

535
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,650
I'm very busy right now.

536
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,361
No, wait, Do Ra-mi!

537
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,615
Drives me nuts.

538
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,036
Thank you for the meal.

539
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,623
If you decide to come to Japan,
it'll be my treat.

540
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,419
Why did I promise that?
You don't even understand.

541
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,612
Bye-bye.

542
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,292
How did it go with Hiro?
You can't really talk to each other.

543
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,254
You carry her passport on you?

544
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,924
Yours? We'll be going
to Italy in two days.

545
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,092
I want it.

546
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,606
I'll go ahead and take off to Italy.

547
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,358
Sure. What?

548
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,110
I'll see you there.

549
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,446
Wait, hey.

550
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,493
<i>I wanna switch off my head</i>
<i>For a while…</i>

551
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,536
ITALY

552
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,914
<i>Can't you just dial it down?</i>

553
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:38,834
<i>I wanna shut down my POV for a while</i>

554
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,380
<i>Your shadow lingers too close</i>
<i>I can't take it now</i>

555
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:46,175
<i>Dance! Feel alive!</i>
<i>I would dive into the dark</i>

556
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:50,346
<i>I love to be alone, so leave me alone</i>

557
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,889
<i>Dance! Feel the vibe!</i>

558
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,682
<i>I might be a narcissist</i>

559
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,643
<i>I love to be alone</i>

560
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,728
<i>Just leave me alone</i>

561
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,108
<i>Dance alone, I'm dancing alone</i>

562
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:05,945
<i>Dance alone, don't ring the alarm</i>

563
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:09,198
<i>Dance alone, I'm dancing alone</i>

564
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,451
<i>Dance alone, dance alone</i>

565
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,953
PAPAGO♥

566
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,208
Oh jeez. He's calling me again.

567
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,716
You're calling again, honey. What is it?

568
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,926
<i>Where are you?</i>

569
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,846
<i>You agreed to meet,</i>
<i>so tell me where you are.</i>

570
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,098
Why? You'll come here if I tell you?

571
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,475
<i>I will, but I can't find you.</i>

572
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,978
<i>Raise your hand, and maybe I can see you.</i>

573
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,187
Oh.

574
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,064
Come, then.

575
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,233
<i>There's something I need to confirm.</i>

576
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,778
<i>Are you the hateful troll</i>
<i>in Mu-hee's head?</i>

577
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,907
Oh, that's me. Yeah.

578
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,743
I give constructive criticism, that's all.

579
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,496
It's for her own good, and yours too.

580
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,291
She will make your life difficult,
so avoid her.

581
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,210
I want to avoid her. Believe me, I do.

582
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,676
I don't even want to be here, believe me.

583
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,053
I'll never be happy to see you,

584
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,014
Do Ra-mi.

585
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,856
Mu-hee already went to Italy?

586
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,526
Good for her.
Shooting is different than travel for fun.

587
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,696
When was the last time
I went on a solo trip?

588
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,573
How's her meeting with Hiro?

589
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,950
Oh, yeah. The meeting.

590
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,702
They might have had a fight.

591
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,330
Hiro looked unhappy
when I saw him at the restaurant.

592
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,921
I'm here. You get a lot of editing done?

593
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,173
- We did.
- Yong-u brought us snacks.

594
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,842
He got your favorite macarons.

595
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,511
Thank you for these.

596
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,810
Did you look for the footage
that I mentioned?

597
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,816
- There are some copyright issues.
- How should we deal with that?

598
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,361
The cream inside is delicious.

599
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,321
I'm headed out for the evening.

600
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,114
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

601
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,575
- Yong-u's taking off.
- Ah.

602
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,619
- Bye.
- See ya.

603
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,497
Thanks for coming.

604
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,355
You don't pick up your phone
when you're angry?

605
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,774
That's right.

606
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,818
I really don't wanna fight.

607
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,446
I only fight when I have to.

608
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,991
Even if I get hurt a little.

609
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,870
Hit me, go ahead. Come on now.

610
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,753
I'm not angry at you, Yong-u.
This is my fault.

611
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:13,966
I got into a fight with the wrong person,
so I'm mad at myself.

612
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:17,011
Think of it as bumping shoulders
with someone,

613
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:20,306
and they're walking by frantically
down the street to move on.

614
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,351
That's it. Let's put an end to this
with me saying sorry.

615
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,188
That means you're dumping me?

616
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,443
How can I do that
when we weren't even dating?

617
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,946
Friends who had fun.
A simple one-night stand.

618
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,742
I don't do one-night stands.

619
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:44,913
I would never sleep with someone casually,
then ghost her.

620
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,042
And I'm pretty sure
you're not that kind of person either.

621
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,545
I thought that it meant
we were dating now.

622
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,089
Are you telling me you're ending things?

623
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,218
Whoa.

624
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,681
I thought I made it clear
I didn't wanna fight.

625
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,892
And you're actually picking one now.

626
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,355
Then… let's be honest with each other.

627
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:12,399
You're a cheater,
but you don't have casual sex?

628
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,068
I'm a cheater?

629
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:17,237
You told me to just come up,
and I saw a woman in your apartment.

630
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,240
So sleeping with me while you're with her
makes you a cheater.

631
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:25,788
Was I a joke? That's why you date me,
even though you live with your girlfriend?

632
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,873
- How dare you!
- You went to my house that day?

633
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,000
I said I was downstairs.
You said to come to see you.

634
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:30,959
But I just moved.

635
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,754
I don't live there anymore.

636
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:38,842
Ah.

637
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,971
That's why you didn't answer
any of my calls, Ji-sun.

638
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,141
I was waiting here.

639
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,853
You were supposed to stay up and edit,
so I got you a coffee.

640
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,565
Uh…

641
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,994
You mind sharing that?

642
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:19,800
Ah!

643
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,302
I was so nervous. I thought we were done.

644
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,850
Well, then… we're still together?

645
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:39,069
Give me a moment.
I feel… like I got gut-punched.

646
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,363
I need a drink too. To come to my senses.

647
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:11,310
You spent 3,000 on wine,
a shopping spree, and a hotel suite?

648
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,811
You're spending too freely.

649
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,314
It's thanks to me she has it.

650
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,858
Bonjour.

651
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,820
You're speaking French.
It doesn't mean what you think.

652
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,113
She's the stupid one.

653
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,367
Well, you have something in common
with her, at least.

654
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,077
You told me you were Do Ra-mi,

655
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,246
so I hoped you were impressive
like the fictional girl.

656
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,165
I don't speak French.

657
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:37,127
So what?
This and this is everything I need.

658
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,299
What? You're a superhero
who defeats Do Ra-mi, right?

659
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:44,551
No way.

660
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,970
This is so great.

661
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,265
You've lost, honey.

662
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,893
I hesitated before coming here.

663
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,188
When I thought you were simply delusional,
it was okay.

664
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:59,107
And this time,
you didn't even ask for anything at all.

665
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:03,195
However, I regret coming here
since I heard you… call me "honey."

666
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,324
Don't be like this, honey!

667
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,913
I've been wondering.

668
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,291
How is a creature like you her alter ego?

669
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,462
That's easy.

670
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,423
I gave Cha Mu-hee her success.

671
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,301
That's what I thought too.

672
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:30,138
It's because of her fall
she's been having psychological issues.

673
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,725
And traveling so much
adds to all the stress.

674
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,479
- But that's not the whole story.
- What more is it, then?

675
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,192
Despite what was in that recent article,

676
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,444
you weren't a happy rich kid.

677
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,698
What would you know about that?

678
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,370
There's one more thing I found out,
although I didn't want to.

679
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,541
I saw someone on a hospital bed
in a large ward.

680
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:02,629
I saw that her family members
didn't care if she lived or died.

681
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:10,178
"How would someone, who's never had
anything she wanted, feel"?

682
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:11,972
You said that.

683
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:18,604
You could've emerged for many reasons,
but it may have to do with

684
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,690
that dark and sad past of hers.

685
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,526
A deep kind of pain.

686
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,951
No wonder you were kind.

687
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,622
It's because you took pity on her
when you saw all this.

688
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:40,834
So if I'm right,
will you share your version of the past?

689
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:45,130
You're right.
This girl's pathetic, so I had to emerge.

690
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:49,051
And if she's happy and fulfilled,
then you'll go away and leave her alone?

691
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,594
You have no idea.

692
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,639
I've been telling you,
happiness is not in her cards.

693
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,556
Why not?

694
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,313
Try being kind to me.

695
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:03,690
What?

696
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,443
If you're kind to me, I'll tell you.

697
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,112
- You've said not to be kind to you.
- Look.

698
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,325
One person wants to die
when they're treated kindly.

699
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:16,620
The other murders people
when someone treats them well.

700
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,081
What would kindness trigger, then?

701
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:24,419
I said don't get involved,
stop and avoid her, yet you're here.

702
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,338
Take responsibility, Ho-jin.

703
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,884
At least your timing is good.

704
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,637
Here, I was worrying
I had maxed my card out.

705
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,722
It's on you.

706
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,600
Thanks, honey. Bonjour.

707
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,687
Sit down. Do Ra-mi. Hey, wait, come back!

708
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,611
Thank you.

709
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:58,078
Excuse me. You left your bags.

710
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,789
The phone battery's almost dead.

711
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,041
You've got a charger?

712
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,502
- Tell me!
- I don't.

713
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,254
- Come on.
- No!

714
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,297
I need to charge up my phone.

715
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,928
Let's go. I'll ask someone for a charger.

716
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,807
- Come with me.
- That's so kind.

717
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:21,309
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey.

718
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,188
You know, we're really vibing together.

719
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,690
It's casual and fun.

720
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,497
Uh…

721
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,791
Could we get a refund?

722
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,334
That woman

723
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:50,589
made a few impulsive purchases.

724
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:54,634
Certainly. To proceed with a refund,
I'll need the card she paid with.

725
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,802
Yes, yes.

726
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,597
Your credit card. Now.

727
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,185
Why? I need to pay to charge my phone?

728
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,936
They're taking advantage.

729
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,732
They charge for restrooms too?

730
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,151
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

731
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,194
Thank you.

732
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,702
Thank you.

733
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,662
- This is yours.
- Thank you.

734
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,874
Wait. Why is she taking those?

735
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:28,085
Stop it. You received a refund.

736
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,296
Are you dumb? I'll just buy it again.

737
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,799
No, you can't.
Your card's locked for three days.

738
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,801
It won't work. It's fully maxed out.

739
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,346
How's your battery now?

740
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:45,185
Hmm, there's not much power.
It'll die soon.

741
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,146
Soon, you'll have no credit card
and no mobile phone.

742
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,444
Shit.

743
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:22,639
Looks like
the South Korean production crew

744
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,182
will arrive after midnight.

745
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,310
Would you like to eat something
before we arrive at the hotel?

746
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:35,193
CHA MU-HEE
I'LL BE WAITING

747
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:55,005
You say you wanna
make me happy, but you got me pizza?

748
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,675
You wanted to sit somewhere
with a nice view.

749
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:02,220
There's no restaurant nearby,
so… I bought you this slice of pizza.

750
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,390
That's a restaurant. Or that one?

751
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,059
I have eyes. They're restaurants.

752
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,644
We could go to one of those.

753
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,271
Those are tourist traps.

754
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,065
Like the one
where you had me pay for your wine.

755
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,235
So expensive.

756
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,071
This is fine. Enjoy the pizza.

757
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,908
You could have gotten us a drink.

758
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,372
So, about what you said back then.

759
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,500
Once she's happy, you'll go away forever?

760
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,921
Most likely. But it won't be easy.

761
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,924
That's why you leave hateful comments.
So she can't ever be happy?

762
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:43,094
When she keeps fumbling in her life,
I have to hit her with a stick.

763
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:46,306
Even Italy, she wouldn't stop debating
if she should go.

764
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,891
I went ahead and did it.

765
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,354
So, to summarize, you make decisions

766
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:55,440
because you think Mu-hee
always takes too long before she acts?

767
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:56,358
Yeah.

768
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,570
If she finds out I met you,
she won't be able to deal with it.

769
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,573
Because you know her inner thoughts.

770
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,247
What'll you do, honey?

771
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:13,124
You've sorted out your feelings,
yet you're here.

772
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,542
Well, nothing's changed.

773
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,755
My feelings being sorted out have nothing
to do with you. They're about her.

774
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,341
I'm not going back on what I said.

775
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:32,269
So you've come all this way,
and it's just because of me?

776
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,855
Do you want me to go away?

777
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,653
All right.

778
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,655
To make it happen, there's a way.

779
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,199
What? Tell me.

780
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,331
If I drink a cup of nice, warm coffee,

781
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,835
she just might get so happy
that I'll go away.

782
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,797
If you put two sugars in that same coffee,

783
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,966
I could go away and disappear forever.

784
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,009
That's wild.

785
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,260
And also,

786
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,389
when that bell up there starts ringing,

787
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,183
she'll be happy just to hear it.

788
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,187
I'm sure.

789
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,984
Okay. I have no choice, I guess.

790
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,611
I will just listen
and do my very best right now.

791
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:27,449
Every time you hear me say
the most idiotic, dark, dirty stuff,

792
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,992
you must listen closely.

793
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,535
You'll be able to hear.

794
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,662
It's actually her mind talking.

795
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,208
That's right.

796
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,253
You are Cha Mu-hee as well.

797
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:45,550
Let's get to it.
I'll buy you a coffee with two sugars.

798
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,669
Look forward to this.

799
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,883
Let happiness come to you.

800
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,142
So if I close my eyes, Do Ra-mi,

801
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,270
tell me, what are you gonna do?

802
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,834
<i>I ended up coming to Italy?</i>

803
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,345
You really were waiting here.

804
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,317
Come to the clock square.
I will wait there.

805
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,861
I understood those words.

806
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,433
<i>When that bell up there starts ringing,</i>

807
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,311
<i>she'll be happy just to hear it.</i>

808
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,689
<i>I'm sure.</i>

809
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,602
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

810
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,718
<i>This love is bittersweet</i>

811
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,472
<i>I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours</i>

812
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,515
<i>Close to me, close to me, close to me</i>

813
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,893
<i>I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours…</i>

814
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,022
<i>This love is bittersweet </i>

815
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,567
<i>Say it to me, say it to me…</i>

816
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,334
<i>I'll light it up</i>
<i>The way you walk to me…</i>

817
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,519
<i>This love is bittersweet… </i>
