1
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,351
Do Ra-mi?

2
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,209
Your delusions are sad.

3
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,504
They're sad because they're too beautiful.

4
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,304
You're crying?

5
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,644
Because I accomplished what you couldn't.
Saying goodbye.

6
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,733
It's time to find joy again.

7
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,878
Goodbye.

8
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:29,709
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

9
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,224
Why did she say that? Why say goodbye?

10
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,560
Maybe that's it for her, then?

11
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,689
Honey.

12
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,527
Uh,

13
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,197
I don't have any euros on me.

14
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,449
No money. Sorry.

15
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,787
Where's that man
who's fluent in Italian? "Honey"?

16
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,122
Uh, "honey?"

17
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,041
You understand English?

18
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:14,337
We took a picture together with "honey."

19
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,257
I'm sorry. Uh…

20
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,302
I… I can't make out
what you're trying to tell me. Sorry.

21
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,764
The hat.

22
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,269
Did she sell it to me?

23
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,271
Maria, I'm going.

24
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,856
I need to get going. See you later.

25
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,780
Seems like it.
That's the beanie she bought.

26
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,076
But where are the pictures?

27
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,661
Did she delete them?

28
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,835
Here it is.

29
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,838
This is her "honey."

30
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,173
That's too bad.

31
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,053
Is Do Ra-mi
getting me into trouble around here?

32
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,891
Can't worry about that.

33
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,020
We're almost wrapped here.
Let's keep at it.

34
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:20,987
I don't get why he wants
to stay elsewhere, away from us.

35
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,449
Bet it's the girlfriend.
Too busy dating her every night.

36
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,744
Well, what if she's just
someone he likes to hang out with?

37
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,079
You don't hug a friend like that.

38
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,459
He's fluent in Italian,
so maybe she's an Italian girl?

39
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,919
He said he lived out here
when he was a kid,

40
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,713
so maybe he couldn't forget
his first love?

41
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,090
Can you stop gossiping like a tween?

42
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,552
Whether Ho-jin is seeing his girlfriend
or staying with her all night long

43
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,430
is his business,
and I don't wanna intrude, okay?

44
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,724
Okay.

45
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,687
You're scaring me. Jeez.

46
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,898
I'm just saying. It's his private life.

47
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,278
There will be a wedding tomorrow

48
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,155
at the winery where we're shooting today.

49
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,950
The festival is canceled due to the fire,
so we'll be attending the wedding instead.

50
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:09,994
Sure.

51
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,500
Does it still bother you
how Ms. Cha Mu-hee left yesterday?

52
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,797
No. I just saw
something strange yesterday.

53
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,342
What did you see?

54
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,095
Do Ra-mi?

55
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,597
Ms. Cha Mu-hee is Do Ra-mi.

56
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,102
Yes, Cha Mu-hee is Do Ra-mi,
but I saw the real Do Ra-mi, not a zombie.

57
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:38,022
Don't you often refer to Ms. Cha Mu-hee
as "zombie" or "Do Ra-mi"?

58
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,526
I don't call her that because I hate her.
I mean, I did at first.

59
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,654
But it just stuck,
and she doesn't seem to hate it either.

60
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,656
No woman would think

61
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,201
a guy who calls her a zombie
is actually interested.

62
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,994
Just how dense can you get?

63
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,621
"Dense"?

64
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:58,042
I've heard that word before.
It means something bad, doesn't it?

65
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,669
It means "cute."

66
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:04,298
Before I forget,
here are the opera tickets you asked for.

67
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,926
You can give them to her
during the winery shoot.

68
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,053
Why would I do that?

69
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,806
That way, she won't refuse them.

70
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,725
You never ask someone out
if rejection's on the table.

71
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,894
This has nothing to do with the shoot.

72
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,731
Besides, I haven't decided if I'll go.

73
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,069
Hiro.

74
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,991
Can I tell you what happened
the other day during dinner

75
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,034
with the crew?

76
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,793
Joo Ho-jin was with a woman?

77
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,385
Ho-jin wouldn't do that to a woman.

78
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,223
No, I guess he could.

79
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,144
He didn't seem the type though.

80
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,524
What am I supposed to do?

81
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,240
In pain?

82
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,620
Oh. Mm, no worries.

83
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,371
I'll be okay. Thank you.

84
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,499
Good.

85
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,876
PAPAGO♥

86
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,336
Joo Ho-jin?

87
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,630
You can read that?

88
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,467
Are you going
to ask him if he has a girlfriend? Don't.

89
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:31,969
You'll regret it.

90
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,472
Hey, give it back.

91
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,848
Uh, uh, hey!

92
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,896
Slick moves, zombie.

93
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,941
Course I'm a zombie. I'm Do Ra-mi.

94
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,778
I forgot not to call her a zombie!

95
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,662
The plan is to shoot at, uh,
my mother's winery?

96
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,872
Didn't Jin-suk keep you posted?

97
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,208
He said he told you the plan earlier.

98
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,418
Well, he called.

99
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,171
Asked about my mother's health.

100
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,549
That catching up with her
was long overdue.

101
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,927
I guess he did let me know.

102
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,556
Is this really okay?
You meeting her like this?

103
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,849
I don't have a choice. It's work.

104
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,395
I don't want anybody to feel bad,
so please don't tell the crew.

105
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,646
Of course not.

106
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,106
Anyway,

107
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,608
I feel really bad about this.

108
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,901
No, it's okay.

109
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,363
Couldn't have been easy,
having to contact Jin-suk.

110
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,534
Calling my ex
for help with a shoot location?

111
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,494
Just about died.

112
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,162
Don't worry about it.

113
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,082
He's someone who doesn't let work
get personal, Ji-sun.

114
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,042
It's been a while.

115
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,336
You haven't been fixing
any of Jin-suk's nonsense lately.

116
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,921
I guess.

117
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,840
So now it's my turn.

118
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,595
Tell me when you're ready.

119
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,805
What?

120
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,975
And just like that,

121
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,935
it almost feels like

122
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,813
I scored an Italian girlfriend
without trying.

123
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,732
Honey.

124
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,159
Why do you look so shocked?

125
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,038
Can you interpret "honey" into Italian?

126
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,750
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

127
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,419
What's with the Ms.?

128
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,422
There's no way
Mu-hee can mean "honey" in Italian.

129
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,177
Tell me. I bet you know some intimate way
of saying "honey" in Italian.

130
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,178
So let's hear it.

131
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,555
Go on. I just wanna know.

132
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,015
Well, don't.

133
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,142
Why not?

134
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,062
You get banned from using romantic terms
in Italian because you're single?

135
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,857
What I mean is that don't.
This word, honey. Don't use that word.

136
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,943
Hon… What's wrong with it?

137
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,695
I just can't stand it.

138
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,780
Stop it.

139
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,907
Wait, but I don't get it.

140
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,243
Don't you like being called one?
I thought it'd be sweet.

141
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,204
Sweet?

142
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,124
You think?

143
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,089
Say it again.

144
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:15,883
Me?

145
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,762
Honey.

146
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,808
Once more.

147
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,898
Honey.

148
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,361
You hate it.

149
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,404
That's it.

150
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,115
You're prohibited from now on.

151
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,366
No more "honey."

152
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,951
You're confusing me.

153
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,913
No more? When would I ever need
to call you names like that, huh?

154
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,749
Someone else could.
But I'm trying to make a point.

155
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,921
So you're bothered
by the crew's latest gossip after all.

156
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,757
I heard they've seen you
out at night with a girl.

157
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,010
Is that what's… happening? For real?

158
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,307
<i>Ho-jin, you're a very kind, honest man.</i>

159
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,144
Leave this girl.

160
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,730
<i>Then I can go away.</i>

161
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,401
It's true. I was with a girl.

162
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,318
And

163
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,447
I guess she does call me "honey."

164
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,950
So it is true.

165
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,957
Who is she?

166
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,134
If you're actually prepared
to hear me to the end, I will say it.

167
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,637
You should know, though,

168
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,890
we'll both suffer for it
once you find out.

169
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,435
I know I can take it.

170
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,646
How about you? Can you handle it?

171
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,362
Well, I… Maybe I shouldn't, then.

172
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,202
Congrats on finding a new "honey."

173
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,871
Uh, not that I was ever
your, um, "honey" to begin with,

174
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,664
but congrats regardless.

175
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,624
That's not it.

176
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,668
No, I meant I was never your "honey,"
so it's whatever.

177
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,836
Congrats either way.

178
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,631
Stop it.

179
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,426
I feel wrong and terrible…

180
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,930
when you use that word.

181
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,403
Stop doing this, Mu-hee.

182
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,906
"Honey"? Am I crazy?

183
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,284
Congrats? For what?

184
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,715
<i>The birds are flying</i>

185
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,552
<i>I heard it in the sky</i>

186
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:08,931
<i>Something they want to imply</i>

187
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,101
<i>I greet the breeze</i>

188
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,020
<i>And nod to the trees</i>

189
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:19,191
<i>I heard the winds reply…</i>

190
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,736
Welcome to our winery.

191
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,490
- Thanks for having us.
- Thank you for having us.

192
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,368
Please speak up
if we can be of help for you.

193
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,745
We'll do our best
to assist you how we can.

194
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,080
- Thank you, Mi-jeong.
- Thank you.

195
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,623
Thank you so much.

196
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,877
These are our leads.
Ms. Cha Mu-hee and Mr. Kurosawa Hiro.

197
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,295
Nice to meet you, Ms. Mu-hee.

198
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,546
Nice to meet you.

199
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,799
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

200
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,468
I hope you enjoy it here.

201
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,846
Thank you.

202
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,222
This is Mr. Dario.

203
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,725
He and I both operate this winery
together out here.

204
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,561
- Good morning. Welcome.
- Good morning.

205
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,021
Good morning.

206
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:58,939
- Dario.
- Yes?

207
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,443
We should first show them
around the winery.

208
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,777
Of course.

209
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,195
Thank you so much.

210
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,451
How come a Korean woman
has a winery in Italy?

211
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,245
She speaks Italian so fluently too.

212
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,748
She does.
It kind of reminds me of someone.

213
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,124
Yeah.

214
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,461
Hi. How are you?

215
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,923
Your son is, uh…

216
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,718
He's probably busy in the minivan
'cause he had a lot to do for the shoot.

217
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,428
Oh, I see.

218
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,559
This isn't easy. I'm nervous.

219
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,605
How can I be of help
for the shoot until then?

220
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,573
She's much older now.

221
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,419
Be careful.

222
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,380
This is amazing.

223
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,298
- Guess we shoot here.
- Mm.

224
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,136
Wow! That tree is massive.

225
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,515
Oh!

226
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,934
- Which one?
- This one?

227
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,686
Oh, this one?

228
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,189
Oh!

229
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,366
- It's nice.
- It's nice.

230
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,416
Oh, it's working. It's working!

231
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,836
Oh!

232
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:50,968
CHA MU-HEE

233
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,849
Wait, you actually know how
to write my name?

234
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,103
Here.

235
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,813
For you, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

236
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,690
Wow!

237
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,992
And then horizontally…

238
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,744
Straight.

239
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,120
Ah!

240
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,542
Like this.

241
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,127
- Dot, dot, dot.
- Dot, dot, dot.

242
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,421
- "Kuro."
- Yes.

243
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,464
<i>"Kuro."</i>

244
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,804
Hiro is behaving differently again.

245
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,893
Look how he's acting really sweet now.
He might actually be falling for her.

246
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,770
Falling for her?

247
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,482
I mean, that happens
only when the feelings are mutual.

248
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,649
Could work.

249
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,319
Mu-hee sure seems really happy.

250
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,446
Ah!

251
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,206
Huh?

252
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,834
Isn't this that famous author?

253
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,504
Mr. Kim Young-hwan, right?

254
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:09,963
Yes.

255
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,634
Well, Mr. Kim and Father were very close.

256
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,470
Because of his book company,
they got to know each other.

257
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,763
He's like family, really.

258
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,558
Did he collect antiques?
Your father, I mean.

259
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,644
Like, back during the time
when he was alive?

260
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,647
Oh, most certainly. How did you know that?

261
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,608
Are you Mr. Joo Ho-jin's mother?

262
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,655
Yes. He's my son.

263
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,619
- Oh! Hello, there.
- Hello, there.

264
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,204
I had no clue.

265
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,039
Oh, now I see it!

266
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:49,461
Ah, this is, uh… The lady is Ho-jin's mom.

267
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,296
<i>Mother.</i>

268
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,132
<i>Ho-jin's mother?</i>

269
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,135
- No wonder.
- <i>That's his mother?</i>

270
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,888
- But they look different.
- Yes, she's my mother.

271
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,477
- Do you wanna say hi?
- Huh?

272
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,528
<i>I think that that camera should link</i>
<i>straight back to where he's watching.</i>

273
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,947
<i>Just put this in.</i>

274
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,074
<i>Here.</i>

275
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,662
<i>Look over at that lens and say hi.</i>

276
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,250
<i>Ho-jin, it's Mom. Are you there?</i>

277
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,174
I'm here.

278
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,259
Hi, Mom.

279
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,344
How have you been?

280
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,643
His mother is here?
And he didn't come out to say hi to her?

281
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,353
I know.

282
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:52,608
I was so worried they'd be awkward,
and Mu-hee breaks the ice right away.

283
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,444
<i>I made something for dinner,</i>
<i>especially for you.</i>

284
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,653
<i>I hope that's all right?</i>

285
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,329
Yeah. Thanks.

286
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:07,998
Okay.

287
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,709
We'll talk more once you're free, then?

288
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,977
I had no idea
you're not on good terms with her.

289
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:29,895
Sorry.

290
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,439
Oh, please.

291
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,650
We talked in this stupid manner
entirely because of you.

292
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,028
Given what she said, though,

293
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,280
it's probably best for you
to attend the dinner with her

294
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,782
before you leave, you know?

295
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,534
Enjoy the special food
your mom prepared just for you.

296
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,287
Well, my mother can't cook,
so the meal won't be any good.

297
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,749
Also, I would count on it being
an awkward dinner, so enjoy.

298
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,542
Wait, what?

299
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,673
Did you really wanna just
put me in this situation and leave?

300
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,050
You're coming with, and that's final.

301
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,470
How am I going to help if I join though?

302
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,140
Just blurt out your thoughts.
You're very proficient at that.

303
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,476
That's it. That's all you need.

304
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,898
Ho-jin, is it really that tough,
seeing your mother again?

305
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,944
Last time I spoke with her

306
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,738
was close to 13 years ago.

307
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,742
We got into a huge fight. Never made up.

308
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,705
We let time pass so quickly,
ended up avoiding each other.

309
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:35,502
Then you probably don't even know
what to talk about tonight.

310
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,922
It'll be okay.

311
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,426
I can begin with a conversation
about wine or something.

312
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,303
Oh, are you into wine now?

313
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,889
Not really.
I'll just try to ask about random stuff.

314
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,851
Maybe like prices of bottles
or which ones sell well.

315
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,021
You're really gonna improv, huh?

316
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,442
Also, I just realized that,
this time, I'm interpreting for you.

317
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,236
Both of you are fluent
in so many languages,

318
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,572
and yet you can't communicate.

319
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:08,160
I'm kind of an expert at making stuff up
as I go, so wish me luck!

320
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,496
Sure. The best of luck with that.

321
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,445
Your mother seems quite young.

322
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,615
She was a freshman in university
when she met Dad.

323
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,784
And shortly after, they got married

324
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,537
despite the fact that he was already
twice-married and had a boy.

325
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,500
That sounds like a wild affair.

326
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,544
What about your father, then?

327
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,673
He's retired now,
happily jogging along the Florida coast.

328
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,551
Before he dies,
he wants to travel to space on a rocket.

329
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,763
He's quite determined. Training regularly.

330
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,474
A winemaker and a space traveler.

331
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,936
Guess you didn't follow
in their footsteps, Ho-jin.

332
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,231
I followed my grandfather on Mom's side.

333
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,067
Ah, the antique collector.

334
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,319
I can see that.

335
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,241
Oh! He's the groom in tomorrow's wedding.

336
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,203
You weren't there the time we said hi.

337
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:37,040
He works here in the winery
with your mother. The ceremony's tomorrow.

338
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,626
Ah, I remember hearing about this.

339
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,839
Are dinner preparations going well?

340
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,342
Is something wrong?

341
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,303
Oh, I just kind of burned
one of my fingers.

342
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,305
Oh!

343
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,433
No, I'm gonna be fine. It's all right.

344
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:58,311
Try to be careful
with these precious hands of yours.

345
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,148
I told you it's not that bad.

346
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,483
- Let me make sure they're all right.
- No, no, no, no.

347
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,069
This could be really serious.
I should take a proper look.

348
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,195
Come on now.

349
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,196
Let her go!

350
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,870
- Are you okay?
- Ho-jin.

351
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,872
- Stop it right now, man!
- Who are you?

352
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,333
Let go of me!

353
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,421
Are you okay?

354
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,548
Uh-huh. I'm okay.

355
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,300
Jesus!

356
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,593
You should back off right now.

357
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,061
Ho-jin! Stop it, Dario!

358
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,062
Oh my goodness!

359
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,940
Stop! Let him go!

360
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,445
Stop it! Oh my, oh my.

361
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,825
Stop it! I'm sick of it!

362
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,327
Ho-jin!

363
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,498
No!

364
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:06,046
Stop! Just listen. He's my son, Dario!

365
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,967
He's your son?

366
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,428
Yes, he's my son.

367
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,270
You should calm down too.
Let me explain everything.

368
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,189
How can I when this asshole…

369
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,899
He kept pulling your arm
after you said no.

370
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,359
It's not like that.

371
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,569
It's not?

372
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,238
Then who is he?

373
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,075
- We're getting married.
- You're getting…

374
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,536
What?

375
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:41,289
This is Dario, and tomorrow…
tomorrow's our wedding.

376
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,711
I was going to update you
during dinner tonight.

377
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,129
But that's that.

378
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,469
So…

379
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:56,930
Wait.

380
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,225
That wedding happening tomorrow

381
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,310
is your wedding, Mother?

382
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,272
Didn't Jin-suk say anything
about this at all?

383
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,899
No. He just told me to meet up with you.

384
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,988
This must be a shock, then.
I thought you already knew everything.

385
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,327
Wait. So if my work
hadn't forced me to come here,

386
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,413
I wouldn't have known at all?

387
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,456
Unbelievable.

388
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,210
How can you… How…

389
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,671
- Please come.
- How old is this guy?

390
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,382
He's not some guy.
He's eight years older than you.

391
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,050
He's still too young for you!

392
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,386
Not true. Take Young-hwan, for instance.

393
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,179
He's only eight years older,
but I call him--

394
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,349
That's because you met him
when you were both really young,

395
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,601
so it's different.

396
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:46,062
There's no difference!
Eight years is eight years!

397
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,231
You probably still can't admit
you're wrong, can you?

398
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,109
And you're still a baby
who can't help but judge me all the time!

399
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,700
- Cha Mu-hee!
- Oh no!

400
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,331
- Here? Here?
- Uh…

401
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,251
Are you okay?
Sure you don't wanna go to the hospital?

402
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,796
Yeah, I'm doing fine.
It's just a bump on my head.

403
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,051
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have gotten you involved.

404
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,761
It's not you.

405
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,180
I only got hurt 'cause I interfered.

406
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,558
Are you bleeding?

407
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,519
I didn't know you were hurt. You okay?

408
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,356
Yeah. I'm fine. Dario is the problem.

409
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,733
Was he bleeding too?

410
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,110
No, but he's got a bruise.

411
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,904
Pretty big one.

412
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,908
- Right before his wedding.
- Oh, yeah.

413
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,911
Your mom's eyes got intense
when you were hit.

414
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,455
It was from fear of seeing you get hurt.

415
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,126
So just try speaking next time
instead of fighting.

416
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,254
It was deliberate, then?

417
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,840
You fell on purpose
to stop us from arguing?

418
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,842
You knew?

419
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,930
Well, everyone got really mad,

420
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,475
so it was impossible
to just try and jump between you two, so…

421
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,395
so I just improvised something.

422
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,522
You could've just pretended.

423
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,191
What if you had actually gotten hurt?

424
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,527
I'm Do Ra-mi.

425
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,946
I can do action scenes, so I'll be fine.

426
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,120
I appreciate it.

427
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,417
I ended up spouting out my thoughts.

428
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,254
We could've said some things
that could not be forgiven.

429
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,798
I'm happy you stopped us.

430
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,677
In which case,
the back of my head saved the day.

431
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,014
Okay.

432
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,894
Let's see. Does it hurt over here?

433
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:51,938
A little.

434
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,150
You can stay like this
for a little longer.

435
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,094
You know…

436
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:25,930
Ho Jin…

437
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,399
that thing about calling you "honey…"

438
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,494
Ho-jin.

439
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,664
Your mother's waiting for you.

440
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,711
I should probably go talk to her.

441
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,338
Get some rest.

442
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,647
Does Father know? About the wedding?

443
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,773
He does.

444
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,027
He wanted to come to the wedding.
I told him not to.

445
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,781
He actually mailed us a gift.

446
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,116
He shipped us a few boxes of wine.

447
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,453
A winery being mailed wine.

448
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,497
Typical.

449
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,582
Unpredictable and as oblivious as always.

450
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,085
And you always regretted the marriage.

451
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,005
Like, do you want
another regretful marriage?

452
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,423
Or what?

453
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:46,427
You'll base your next novel
on my next failed marriage?

454
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,351
Young-hwan mentioned it.

455
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,437
You stopped writing because of me.

456
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,731
Just be honest.

457
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,485
Don't make me talk about this.
You lit a copy on fire in front of me.

458
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,905
That's because…
I felt like I was reprimanded

459
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,907
while everyone else
got a pass in your book.

460
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,286
Still, the book did well.

461
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,538
Didn't make sense to stop printing it.

462
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:19,168
That's because it ended up bothering you
to where… you said we'd never talk again.

463
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,925
I felt like it was the best possible way

464
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,136
to make amends to you.

465
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,112
Looking back,
I was so upset about everything.

466
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,989
It wasn't your novel.

467
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,784
I thought about it a lot.

468
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,662
I feel bad about how it ended too.

469
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,832
But it was pretty difficult
trying to bring it up.

470
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,095
You're, uh…
You're making enough money these days?

471
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,517
Yeah. We're doing well.

472
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,437
- Dario makes really good wine.
- Ah, Dario.

473
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,398
He's not the greatest fighter,
but that's good to hear.

474
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,195
You okay?

475
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,238
Are you okay?

476
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,658
Dario is… bruised up.

477
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,035
The best option at the time
was to stop you two.

478
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:35,954
And you.

479
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,040
How is it that I signed you up
for tae kwon do, kendo, and judo classes,

480
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,000
and you missed every single punch?

481
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:42,877
I know.

482
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,514
I'm sorry.

483
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,737
Well, I can't prepare anything now.

484
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,911
I'm sorry too.

485
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,825
I think everything went well.

486
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,786
The wedding and the shoot were great!

487
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,371
- Yay!
- So good.

488
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,041
Huge thanks to Jin-suk for sure.

489
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,376
Go for it.

490
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:10,006
But Jin-suk, um, he is a bit reckless.

491
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,133
He mentioned nothing about the bride.

492
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,802
I'm just glad
we didn't offend Ho-jin's mother.

493
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,888
That's because he's like that.

494
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,184
Ji-sun, your wedding
is happening afterwards.

495
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:24,687
That's right.

496
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,983
So then,
we should buy a gift for the bride!

497
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,860
We can all pitch in.

498
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,862
- Let's do it.
- What should we get?

499
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,448
- How about a vacuum cleaner?
- Maybe a gift card.

500
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,033
Yeah, yeah, those are great!

501
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,952
Let's do a gift card.
Two small gifts, one big one.

502
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:43,081
Yeah, they're useful for a bride.
I'll get the big one, then.

503
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,582
As for your wedding,

504
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,752
we're thinking of gifting you
a robot vacuum and an air fryer.

505
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,965
I'm sorry. I don't think so.

506
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,926
Uh… Oh, I see.

507
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,804
How about a TV or something like that?

508
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,890
No, it's just…

509
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,185
The wedding's off.

510
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,439
The wedding got canceled
when I joined the shoot.

511
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,609
I thought it's best to keep it private,
so nobody feels awkward about it.

512
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,070
But I'm comfortable telling you now
because the shoot is over.

513
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:17,323
Oh. Oh my. So that's what happened.

514
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,075
And we had you call him.

515
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:22,662
All good. It was my choice anyway.
Don't worry about it.

516
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,248
Be right back.

517
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,628
Now that's uncomfortable.

518
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,672
She could've just told us.

519
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:36,717
I mean, there's been quite a few moments
to explain the situation.

520
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,427
You knew this?

521
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,555
Oh, come on.

522
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,223
You've been hiding it?

523
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,101
This isn't the only private matter
I've tried to keep from you.

524
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,478
Then tell me. What do you mean?

525
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,479
Just drop it, okay?

526
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,690
Let's try to respect
everyone else's lives.

527
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:51,774
Chin-chin.

528
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,820
Everybody knows now. My wedding's off.

529
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,284
I couldn't muster up the courage earlier,

530
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:05,037
partly because I was afraid of
everything falling apart in the end.

531
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,374
When I expressed my feelings
over the phone,

532
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,586
it became clear to me
that I don't miss him anymore.

533
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,462
Hmm.

534
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:17,091
Man, that's a relief.
I was worried you'd start things up again.

535
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,561
It would seem
that our scores are different.

536
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:34,275
That bullseye you hit won you everything
right from the start of the game.

537
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,778
But I don't know
if I managed to score even one yet.

538
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,870
Well, you haven't missed
the board or anything.

539
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,916
Um, perhaps

540
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,001
three points?

541
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,795
That's how much you've scored so far.

542
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,966
The first time I scored three points
made me bawl all night.

543
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,843
I'll cry today too, then.

544
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,221
From happiness.

545
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,853
You wanna guess
how long it'll take me to four?

546
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,024
I don't know. Like, a month?

547
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,359
Or three?

548
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,069
Ten seconds.

549
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,532
How many points?

550
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,577
Okay. Four points.

551
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,958
Perhaps I'll try to make it even five.
Maybe a little more time.

552
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,501
Not sure if ten seconds is enough.

553
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,587
I'm done. Now you're back to zero.

554
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,799
Come on, not cool. No take-backs allowed.

555
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,931
Five points.

556
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,060
I don't like to be so generous
with my points.

557
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,313
Four and a half, then.

558
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,357
<i>She ran away</i>

559
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,987
<i>from the childhood memories</i>
<i>she should never recall.</i>

560
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,364
<i>From having a life with you.</i>

561
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,491
<i>All that disappears with me.</i>

562
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,953
<i>So let her go</i>

563
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,540
<i>for the sake of Cha Mu-hee's happiness.</i>

564
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,745
Don't leave.

565
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,206
Party.

566
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,665
Stay here.

567
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:40,044
Wow. You're learning English so fast.

568
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,800
Oh yeah, speaking of,
I've been learning too.

569
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:53,849
Look.

570
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,190
I wrote a letter for our final shoot.

571
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,234
- A final message.
- Final?

572
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:10,408
"Our journey together has been wonderful."

573
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,578
"Although our journey ends here,

574
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:19,583
I will always root for you
as your friend."

575
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,674
Did you get it?

576
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,429
My accent was too rough?

577
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,684
An unremarkable goodbye
that could've been for anybody.

578
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,731
At this rate, all this will end
with an utterly forgettable goodbye.

579
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,195
It seems to me what I said
upset you quite a lot.

580
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,034
I guess I'll try practicing
a little more in that case.

581
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,630
Ms. Cha Mu-hee seems
to have prepared a message in Japanese.

582
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,302
I don't like unremarkable things.

583
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,472
I'd have preferred something shocking.

584
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,224
At least then
it would have been memorable.

585
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,125
You're down here?

586
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,627
Oh, yeah.

587
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,759
This one. It might be too heavy and dry.

588
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,220
Young women prefer lighter wines.

589
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,139
Wines that end on a more refreshing note.

590
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,060
This might be better.

591
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,480
It's your final day in Italy, right?

592
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,275
Go share some with, uh, the actress.

593
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,820
Looks like Young-hwan
told you some nonsense.

594
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,032
I believe

595
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,117
this might work better.

596
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,246
For a solo drinking experience.

597
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,750
So is it a one-sided situation?

598
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,836
You like her.

599
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,297
I guess.

600
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,675
We're not meant to be happy though.

601
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,513
How can you be so blind?

602
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,683
It's written all over her face.

603
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,600
What?

604
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,144
When I sent you
to tae kwon do classes as a boy,

605
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:48,190
the girls in your group liked you
instead of the boy who had a black belt.

606
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,149
And at school,

607
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,736
you received a mountain of chocolates
on Valentine's Day from girls every year.

608
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,573
Mom, enough!
You're just embarrassing me right now.

609
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,825
It hurts my pride to hear that.

610
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,495
Will wine be enough?
We got some whiskey too, you know.

611
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,458
I don't think the situation calls for
that strong of a drink.

612
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,460
I need

613
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,213
a proper closure, is all.

614
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,633
All right.

615
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,137
If just a bottle of wine
is enough for you,

616
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,014
I don't need to worry.

617
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,892
Yeah. I'll hold on to this.

618
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,395
People are waiting. You should go.

619
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,530
Ho-jin.

620
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,491
You know,

621
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,161
that day you got home from tae kwon do

622
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,455
with a broken arm

623
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,084
and yet you kept on saying you'd be fine
with some banana milk?

624
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,462
What pain you must've felt.

625
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,469
It's just… That's who you are.

626
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,876
Ho-jin forgot his phone.

627
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,013
But it's in Italian.

628
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,265
Is it from her?

629
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,562
What does it mean?

630
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,442
You Mu-hee right now?

631
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,825
You just got a text.

632
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,791
Even if I peeked,
I don't know how to read Italian.

633
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:53,792
I know.

634
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,798
You might wanna answer that.

635
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,925
Maybe it's something urgent.

636
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,595
Urgent? No, probably not.

637
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,139
But I'm not able to read it.

638
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,225
It's a friend
from that Italian restaurant.

639
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,560
We went, remember?

640
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:12,978
Ah.

641
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,814
That pasta was super yum.

642
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,650
I think it was.

643
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,613
What are you up to?
I assumed you were with everyone else.

644
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,954
I wanted to say farewell.

645
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,750
As tomorrow's our last day.

646
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,629
Because we're on different flights,
it's better to tell you now.

647
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,806
Thank you for everything.

648
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,141
I'm grateful things went smoothly.

649
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:57,606
Yeah.

650
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,192
Glad to be of help.

651
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,696
Time to get some rest, then.

652
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,208
Wait a second, Ho-jin.

653
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,386
I am sorry that I threatened you.

654
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,641
I haven't been able to handle things…

655
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,687
and I'm very sorry about everything.

656
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,859
Still, I…

657
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,654
I'm happy that you didn't despise me
in the end.

658
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,745
It almost felt like traveling with you,
as I heard you along the way.

659
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,710
But I feel a bit sad, knowing, uh…

660
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:03,714
our trip ends here.

661
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,308
You can stay here. I should go.

662
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,954
I've suppressed how I felt about you.

663
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,875
And you're drawing me in again?

664
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,715
You feel apologetic, but you're grateful.

665
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,342
And you leave it at that?

666
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,890
Is this chapter of our lives

667
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,060
an ending or a fresh start?

668
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:01,939
I just…

669
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,817
If you're already with someone else,
why would I try anything?

670
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,736
I'm with someone else?

671
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:15,953
I see.

672
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:20,874
You should know that woman demanded
I never see you again.

673
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,379
So stop it and leave.

674
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,190
Wait a second.

675
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,530
Does she know who… I am?

676
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,118
She does.

677
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,286
She knows you quite well.

678
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,544
If she misunderstood you,

679
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,921
then I feel bad for her pain too.

680
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,048
No need to feel guilty.

681
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,508
Rather,

682
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,719
try to be happy.

683
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,518
We've made it to the end.

684
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,989
If you ever feel
like nobody cares for you,

685
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,533
remember it's not true.

686
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:40,746
Do that,

687
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,374
and that nagging voice will disappear.

688
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,509
I

689
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,179
do believe in you, Cha Mu-hee.

690
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,598
So please be happy.

691
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,989
<i>"So beautiful.</i>
<i>It makes me wanna keep looking forever."</i>

692
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,324
Yeah, sure.

693
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,746
We've seen so many magical
and special places.

694
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,250
It's so sad it's nearly over.

695
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,209
That

696
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,753
this chapter's over.

697
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,298
I agree.

698
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:19,928
I would like…

699
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,933
to keep seeing you.

700
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,108
I think the reason every moment

701
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:36,361
of our journey has been beautiful…

702
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,074
is that you

703
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,202
were a part of the scenery.

704
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,876
I'm ready. What did he say?

705
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,460
Translate.

706
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,629
Is it time to say goodbye?

707
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,340
I've prepared a whole speech for Hiro.

708
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,927
Mr. Joo,

709
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,306
if you were too shocked
to interpret what I just said,

710
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,892
can you just pass on

711
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,560
these words to her?

712
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,399
I…

713
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,487
really like you, Cha Mu-hee.

714
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,665
Joo Ho-jin, please translate.

715
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:35,295
If you don't tell me what he said,
I can't say my speech.

716
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,718
<i>A farewell might not be necessary.</i>

717
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,763
<i>I'll translate his speech.</i>

718
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,806
<i>He asked me to pass on this.</i>

719
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:56,149
<i>"I need Cha Mu-hee to know</i>
<i>that I adore her."</i>

720
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:10,830
<i>Have you heard me?</i>

721
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,583
<i>Have you received the message, Mu-hee?</i>

722
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,633
Mu-hee, why don't we take
a bit of a break?

723
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,639
<i>What do I do?</i>

724
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,479
<i>I'm lost for words. What do I say?</i>

725
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,028
<i>Mu-hee, if there's anything</i>
<i>you wanna say, tell me.</i>

726
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,531
<i>I will translate it for you.</i>

727
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,491
<i>Just go ahead.</i>

728
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,840
Actually, I'm fine
saying this with my own words.

729
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,633
Just let me do it.

730
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,390
Okay.

731
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,310
Thank you.

732
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:15,854
Me too.

733
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:22,819
Appreciate it.

734
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:32,120
That concludes our production
of <i>Romantic Trip. </i>Good work, everyone.

735
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,538
- Whoo!
- Yes!

736
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,882
So that's it, then.

737
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,639
Good job. Thanks for your hard work.

738
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,059
- You too.
- Thanks for your hard work.

739
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,686
Good job, good job. Ho-jin!

740
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,272
Thanks for all your hard work.

741
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,816
Good job.

742
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,152
Eun-jin, meet with the cast first.

743
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,946
Ji-sun, I can help with some equipment.

744
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:09,949
Good job.

745
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,412
Hey, Ho-jin.

746
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,678
Hiro!

747
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,475
You finally told Ms. Cha Mu-hee
how you feel.

748
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,478
Is that what it looked like?

749
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,438
It wasn't like that.

750
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,482
Sorry?

751
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,234
She already rejected me a while ago.

752
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,028
Today…

753
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,616
<i>she </i>was rejected.

754
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,371
Mu-hee!

755
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,542
Everyone's so happy.
They say it'll be a hit.

756
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,419
- Really?
- Yeah.

757
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,642
It ended just like your favorite movie.
A happy one, right?

758
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,603
Well, that movie
didn't have a happy ending.

759
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:24,524
The song that plays when the movie ends
is sad. It's a farewell song.

760
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,276
Hmm, I didn't know.

761
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,362
In any case, they're all happy.

762
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,560
It's time to find joy again.

763
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,521
I…

764
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,191
I believe in you, Cha Mu-hee,

765
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,776
so please be happy.

766
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:17,660
Why did Ho-jin and Do Ra-mi
tell me the same thing?

767
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,966
Well, the only ones who absolutely need
to be in the editing room are leaving,

768
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,844
but the rest of the team are
keeping their rooms and staying for a bit.

769
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:38,139
Ah, I appreciate it.
We're planning on flying back tomorrow.

770
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,726
Ah, what about, um, Ho-jin?
Last time I saw him was after we wrapped.

771
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,728
Aren't we taking the same flight
back to Korea?

772
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,898
Right, we're meeting him
at the airport. Yeah.

773
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,193
Uh, so…

774
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:53,905
So Mu-hee and Hiro planned an opera date?
Sounds pretty fun.

775
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,866
Does this mean they're gonna be
a real couple, hmm?

776
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,432
Um, I know opera tickets are pricey.

777
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,810
These seats are upgrades too.

778
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,771
I appreciate it. <i>Arigato.</i>

779
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:30,817
You okay?

780
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,199
Are you okay
after being completely rejected?

781
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,996
You seem to be doing better
than I thought you would.

782
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,596
Is this a video?

783
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,477
One moment. Sorry.

784
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,699
Uh, why are you out here?

785
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,326
You're welcome to join us.

786
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:24,537
Ah, I'm not into opera.

787
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,205
K-pop is more my style.

788
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,207
Me too, actually.

789
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,209
I'm worried I'll end up passing out.

790
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,130
Oh, those shoes.

791
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:38,384
- Huh?
- Your shoes.

792
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,678
What about them?

793
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,889
Uh…

794
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:47,518
Mr. Ho-jin's, uh, mysterious lady?

795
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,854
She was wearing the exact same ones.

796
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:53,858
I thought it was you,
but it appears I was mistaken.

797
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,569
Sorry about that.

798
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:59,238
No worries.

799
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,425
My shoes.

802
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:39,654
<i>It's only fair that you get to see him</i>
<i>in the same way he saw you.</i>

803
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:43,050
He believes I can do it,
so I'll be happy like he says.

804
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,261
<i>All right,</i>

805
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,138
<i>here we go.</i>

806
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:51,392
<i>Just run away and hide</i>

Here we are.

01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,890
<i>This is where all of your anxiety started.</i>

809
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:48,908
<i>The safest way for a child</i>
<i>who can never be loved to find happiness</i>

810
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:53,246
<i>is for her to abandon anything</i>
<i>she might have ever loved</i>

811
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,249
<i>so that a colorful aurora</i>
<i>would never appear</i>

812
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,459
<i>in the skies above her again.</i>

813
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:07,885
<i>Your childhood memories</i>
<i>and Do Ra-mi's memories,</i>

814
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:12,181
<i>let's leave all of that in this room</i>
<i>and close the door.</i>

815
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:17,311
<i>Do it. Walk out of this place</i>
<i>and be happy.</i>

816
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,833
Can I really leave it all behind?

817
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,329
Ciao.

818
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,204
<i>Oh, hi, honey. Look, it's me.</i>

819
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:44,834
<i>Let's get to it.</i>
<i>Buy you a coffee with two sugars.</i>

820
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:59,056
<i>When that bell up there starts ringing,</i>

821
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:02,393
<i>she'll be happy just to hear it.</i>

822
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,438
<i>That's the kindness you want.</i>

823
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,398
<i>Just take it.</i>

824
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:09,275
<i>Way to go.</i>

825
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,740
<i>Someday…</i>

826
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,174
<i>- When you're calling my name</i>
- Honey.

827
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:39,180
<i>There's only you and me</i>

828
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:47,188
<i>Just like my dreams come true</i>

829
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:55,571
<i>'Cause I feel so lonely inside</i>

830
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,658
<i>Something's changed</i>

831
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,827
<i>When you smile</i>

832
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:07,249
<i>I would stay forever and more</i>

833
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:11,796
<i>Until you find out…</i>

834
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:42,159
<i>Joo Ho-jin, I heard you changed flights.</i>

835
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:43,702

HONEY

838
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:44,972
Now that you're finally here,

839
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:48,017
that wish of hers can really come true,
I guess.

840
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,443
MAY AURORAS LIGHT UP THE ENTIRE WORLD!

<i>Addio.</i>

846
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,652
I hope I remembered it correctly.

847
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:25,155
Rote memorization is pretty good.

848
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:30,744
I should maybe try
to pick up a foreign language.

849
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,372
I got a gelato earlier.

850
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:36,333
I'd hoped I knew enough
to maybe order strawberry,

851
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,544
but I got watermelon.

852
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:41,505
I was gonna exchange it,
but I didn't know how.

853
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:44,008
The watermelon flavor
was really good though.

854
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:48,137
I know.

855
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:51,348
I'm just randomly saying stuff.

856
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,933
I'm just embarrassed.

857
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,395
I remembered everything.

858
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,316
Honey.

859
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:05,571
She said

860
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,282
those memories would disappear with her.

861
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,411
I couldn't let them vanish like that.

862
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,497
'Cause I realized

863
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:18,375
you were in there too.

864
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,633
Do Ra-mi explained it all.

865
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:28,719
Makes sense.

866
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:32,222
Joo Ho-jin…

867
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:36,185
I'm in love with you.

868
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,021
But…

869
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,651
there's not a thing
you don't know about me.

870
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:49,281
I can't stand that.

871
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,208
You made me feel afraid because

872
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:04,421
the more my feelings for you grew,
the scarier things got.

873
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,343
So stopping myself was the only way out.

874
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,639
Yet all my feelings

875
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,934
just continued to grow.

876
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:22,689
What now, Ho-jin?

877
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:27,653
I don't know what to do.

878
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:36,537
You say you're afraid of being hurt,

879
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:39,623
so why wish
for a messed-up thing like this?

880
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,877
So we could die together?

881
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:46,755
Oh, no. This isn't what I meant. Um…

882
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,257
Look, Mu-hee.

883
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,094
Randomly seeing the aurora might mean

884
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:54,054
you're basically mad.

885
01:13:58,058 --> 01:13:59,059
I'm so sorry.

886
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:04,481
You finally pulled yourself out of
all of this, and I'm dragging you back in.

887
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:06,817
Well, and then

888
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:10,779
Do Ra-Mi had a fun time with you,

889
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:13,657
so I got my hopes up too.

890
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,579
Just go.

891
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:24,042
I am not willing
to let you do that ever again.

892
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:24,960
You got me?

893
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,592
All right. I see that it's unfair.

894
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:34,720
This time, you can just reject me.

895
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:37,055
I've been so mean to you.
Please just do it.

896
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:43,687
Let's get something straight.

897
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:47,691
I'm going to stop pushing you

898
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:49,526
to try and be happy.

899
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:55,949
Don't expect a nice, happy ending for us
because we're not gonna end well.

900
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:02,080
I know you won't really believe me

901
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,749
if I swear we'll be happy,

902
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:05,709
be together forever.

903
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,839
Um, I'm confused right now.

904
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:14,676
Your problem is that you get petrified
ahead of time and leave,

905
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:17,262
anticipating the sad ending.

906
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:23,852
Wait. I'm still really confused, Ho-jin.

907
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,899
Are you… turning me down again?

908
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:30,609
Right now?

909
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:33,570
I have to anticipate, too,

910
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:37,032
so that I don't end up rejected
as soon as you get anxious.

911
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:41,328
So you're gonna end our relationship?

912
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:44,998
But that's crazy.

913
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:47,793
Fair enough.

914
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:51,713
And yet,

915
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,091
your wish came true after all.

916
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,136
After all of this,

917
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:00,847
I think my sanity is stretched too thin.

918
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:04,768
Because of you, now I'm crazy too.

919
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,565
The aurora borealis.

920
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:12,818
Now I see it myself.

921
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:21,702
That's my confession.

922
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:25,122
Does that make sense?

923
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:39,344
Yeah, uh, it does.

924
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:45,058
But I'm not sure it's right…

925
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:51,875
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

926
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:56,046
<i>If I be honest</i>

927
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:58,423
<i>Babe, will you stay</i>

928
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:03,428
<i>You make me feel like</i>
<i>I'm living inside my dreams…</i>

929
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:22,406
<i>You make me realize</i>
<i>Who I've been waiting for…</i>

930
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:25,033
<i>It's you, my daydream</i>

931
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:23,592
<i>If I be honest</i>

932
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:26,011
<i>Babe, will you stay</i>

933
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:31,057
<i>You make me feel like</i>
<i>I'm living inside my dreams…</i>

934
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:50,076
<i>You make me realize</i>
<i>Who I've been waiting for…</i>

935
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,579
<i>It's you, my daydream</i>

936
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:54,164
<i>It comes and goes… </i>

937
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,925
<i>Maybe that's what it is</i>

938
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:07,302
<i>Maybe that's love…</i>
