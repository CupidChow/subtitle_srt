1
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:09,926
<i>Standby.</i>

2
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,770
<i>We'll begin preliminary interviews</i>
<i>for </i>Romantic Trip.

3
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:21,813
Slate.

4
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,320
I'm still not sure
who I'll be traveling with yet.

5
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,448
They've refused to tell me anything.

6
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,535
Yeah, I'm really curious about who it is,

7
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,079
but that's what makes me
anticipate this trip even more,

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,000
meeting a foreigner
who doesn't speak your language.

9
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,543
An attractive person at that.

10
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,631
And traveling with them
in an unfamiliar country is quite unusual.

11
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,677
It feels like I'm in a movie
or novel 'cause it's incredible, you know?

12
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:56,806
I'm a bit nervous and, well, excited.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,059
Wow! I'll be meeting her soon.

14
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,270
I hope she's not disappointed by me.

15
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,608
I hope it'll be a wonderful trip.

16
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,902
This is who you'll be traveling with.

17
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,904
You're telling me right now?

18
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,073
Here. Get ready. You'll find that scene…

19
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,366
- I'm nervous.
- Just play it.

20
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,579
<i>Hello.</i>

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,666
<i>I'm Kurosawa Hiro, an actor from Japan.</i>

22
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,877
<i>I'll see you in Canada.</i>

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,088
Ah, a familiar face.

24
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,673
I've run into him at a film festival.

25
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,927
<i>Uh, hi.</i>
<i>This is your South Korean travel friend.</i>

26
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,136
<i>My name is Cha Mu-hee.</i>

27
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,431
Uh…

28
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,183
Do Ra-mi.

29
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,187
Am I right?

30
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,399
I see.

31
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,404
Do Ra-mi.

32
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,907
<i>I look forward to Canada!</i>

33
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:14,884
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

34
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,097
CANADA

35
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,502
- I'm in room 203.
- I see.

36
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,962
Could you provide the key?

37
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,261
Wow. So nice.

38
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,388
I wonder.

39
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,391
Mu-hee is gonna be staying here?
It's the same place as the crew?

40
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,268
We should put her in a nice hotel.

41
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,228
Like the one Hiro is staying in.

42
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,272
Ms. Cha prefers to stay here.
It's more convenient.

43
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,150
Really? Why?
We don't have anything to shoot here.

44
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:13,860
What?

45
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,363
Well, if Mu-hee just wants to show us
that she can get along with the crew

46
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,408
and be down to earth, I think
she'd still be better off in a good hotel.

47
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,535
She doesn't need to stay here.

48
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,121
No, she's still nervous
and likes to hang out with the crew.

49
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,789
People she's more comfortable with.

50
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:31,002
So she's the type who goes to LA
but won't ever leave the hotel room?

51
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,170
I'm like that too.

52
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,298
It's so nice to have her close.
And it'll be easier for meetings.

53
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,717
I feel like it could be a nuisance.

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,471
We're already babysitting a crew.
Are we supposed to wait on an actress too?

55
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,973
I'm gonna be looking after her,
so don't be worried.

56
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,518
I have tons of Korean snacks,
like, um, instant noodles.

57
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,021
If you want any, I'd share them with you.

58
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,691
- Ta-da!
- Wow! That's so much!

59
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,776
Wow!

60
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,320
Did you rob a convenience store?

61
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,406
- Are you gonna eat all this?
- Yes. This is Korean soul food.

62
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,619
Please, Producer Park,
take as much as you want. Hmm?

63
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,082
Uh…

64
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,253
If you insist. Here.

65
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:17,173
Yong-u, you can share this room
with Mr. Joo. It's the biggest one.

66
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,801
Did you bring Neoguri, the spicy ramen?

67
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,552
Oh. It's next on the list!

68
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,899
Rewatching this
shows how out of it I was that day.

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,486
I wouldn't have been able to recognize
him at the after-party.

70
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,906
I found out his nickname in Japan
is "Prince Charming."

71
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,034
Let's make his heart beat so fast
he dies of an attack.

72
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,704
Don't say that kind of thing.

73
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,706
Do Ra-mi has killed so many people.

74
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,249
It's an image I wanna erase.

75
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,626
No, don't… …kill him like this.

76
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,545
Kill him like that.

77
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,463
Oh!

78
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,551
Like this?

79
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,346
No. Let's go for something more natural.

80
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,434
You'll be an innocent female lead
in a Japanese… coming-of-age story?

81
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,686
Ah! Got it!

82
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,066
Hiro dear?

83
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,070
Oh wow! You can do anything!

84
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,365
Good, then.
I'll act my heart out. Be natural.

85
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,746
By the way, do you know
if Hiro is in Canada yet?

86
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,290
Hmm. He could be here.

87
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,792
Should I reach out to Mr. Joo?
He's coming with them.

88
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,502
Joo Ho-jin?

89
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,672
No, it's fine.

90
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,550
If you call him,
he'll think I told you to.

91
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,553
Yeah, let's not.
It'll hurt my self-respect too.

92
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,849
All right, take it easy.
I'm close by, so shout if you need me.

93
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,559
Hey!

94
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,479
You're sharing a room with Joo Ho-jin?

95
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,565
Which means he'll be
close by as well, right?

96
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,317
Stop that! Get your mind off him.

97
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,693
Set your sights on Hiro!

98
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,653
Yes!

99
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,746
That's right. Focus on Hiro.

100
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,748
Joo Ho-jin's here for work.

101
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,216
In any case,

102
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,885
we're here together on this adventure.

103
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,403
It's freezing.

104
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,454
Sorry about that.

105
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,046
Uh, Mr. Joo, do you mind
if we have a brief chat?

106
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,464
Go, grab his bags.

107
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,799
Mm.

108
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,970
We almost didn't make it to Canada.

109
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,973
It's thanks to you,
we could coax him into coming, Mr. Joo.

110
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,143
I just interpreted, Mr. Kim.
It's you who did the coaxing.

111
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,396
He wanted us to cast from the short list,
but we picked Do Ra-mi instead,

112
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,023
and, well, he was shocked.

113
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,734
Her public image is a horror queen.

114
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,821
Ms. Cha Mu-hee's casting wasn't discussed
with Hiro or his team at all?

115
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,739
We talked with his agency.

116
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,452
Do Ra-mi's global fame would benefit
their Japanese actor, so they agreed.

117
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,205
But, well… …it's good
the crew doesn't speak Japanese

118
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,667
because only you and I would know
how he feels about her

119
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,628
and about this unfortunate situation.

120
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,923
Mr. Kim, are you trying
to cover this up? Is that it?

121
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,176
This show is about them dating.

122
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,219
The premise is a fairy tale.

123
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,015
Who do you know who would wanna be
with a guy who says he's not interested?

124
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,851
- She would never like him. You agree?
- Yes, that's true.

125
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,270
Telling her would only
compromise the romance.

126
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,147
Do you wanna get
in the way of their romance?

127
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,064
I don't.

128
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:06,736
Then we must keep this our secret
between you and me, you know?

129
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,989
You can't mention this to her,
even if… you're friends.

130
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,575
I don't gossip,
including when I'm interpreting.

131
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,369
And thankfully,
Do Ra-mi doesn't know Japanese.

132
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,580
Hiro may cross the line
and say something rude,

133
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,916
so please filter that out for her.

134
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,292
On-the-spot editing.

135
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,880
Since I'm the, um, producer in charge,
I'm asking you to edit, okay? Hmm?

136
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,382
No, I won't.

137
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,010
An interpreter translates words
as they're said.

138
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,679
The editing? That will be done by you.

139
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,682
I ask this of you
since Do Ra-mi and you are buddies.

140
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,060
Why do you call her Do Ra-mi?

141
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,730
Everyone calls her Do Ra-mi
when I translate.

142
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,357
Her name is Cha Mu-hee.

143
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,566
We know.

144
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,819
But Do Ra-mi is the celebrity here,
and that name's much catchier.

145
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,697
When you call someone the wrong name,
it makes the job harder.

146
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,658
Please refer to her as Cha Mu-hee.

147
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,493
Fine.

148
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,130
Hey, welcome.

149
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,007
- You're here too.
- I am.

150
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,133
Thank you.

151
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,262
I'm staying in the smaller room.
You can have the bigger one.

152
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,138
Really? Thanks.

153
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,641
Wow.

154
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:20,977
What's this stuff?

155
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,479
Yummy snacks. Have some if you want.

156
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,232
Everything from instant noodles
to the latest.

157
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,777
You'll like this. It's new.
I had to line up at the store for it.

158
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:32,947
Huh.

159
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,782
Strawberry flavor?

160
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,952
You met up with Hiro? How is he?

161
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,538
I bet he's really excited
to work with Mu-hee on this?

162
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,839
How's Cha Mu-hee?
She excited to work with Hiro?

163
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,300
She's super thrilled.
He's a good-looking guy.

164
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,594
He's supposed to be sweet and considerate.

165
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,886
Mm.

166
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,056
So Mu-hee thinks
Hiro's image is nice, yeah?

167
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,267
Yes, she does.

168
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,894
The two of them
had seen each other before.

169
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,980
He was kind to Mu-hee
and treated her well.

170
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,858
He was kind?

171
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,655
They've been sort of into each other
since the show was announced.

172
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,491
Oh. Of course.

173
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,706
Cha Mu-hee thinks
that Hiro's into her, then.

174
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,463
Joo Ho-jin was interested?

175
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,382
It's just 'cause you asked
a bunch of questions.

176
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,300
I didn't.

177
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,719
I just asked him about Hiro,
and he kept pushing

178
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,930
and… wanted to know if you liked Hiro.

179
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,682
Really?

180
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,020
So tell me what you said.

181
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,814
I said you both already knew each other
and liked one another.

182
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,400
When I told him that, he looked…

183
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,527
- What? Come on!
- Hmm…

184
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,616
I'm not sure if it's accurate
to say he looked… upset by the situation

185
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,701
or worried, maybe? I don't know.

186
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,206
Whoa. Why would he act like this?

187
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,292
Why would it worry him
that I may be into Hiro?

188
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,630
Okay, stop. You're being delusional.

189
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,716
How was the meeting today? It went well?

190
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,929
Well… So the producer suggested
I could plan a surprise for him,

191
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,516
so I told them that
I'd come up with something fun.

192
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,934
A surprise that's fun?

193
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,353
I like it. We'll come up with a good one.

194
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,273
Ah, Yong-u.

195
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,651
- Could you come here for a sec?
- Sure.

196
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,362
- Mu-hee, go get some rest.
- Mm.

197
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,407
Yeah, I just wanted to check in

198
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,701
to make sure
everything is good for tomorrow.

199
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,682
Yong-u.

200
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,978
Are you there?

201
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,607
Just a moment.

202
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,110
Oh my! Joo Ho-jin?

203
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,279
Isn't Yong-u staying here?

204
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,323
Oh?

205
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,702
Yes. I… I share this room with him.

206
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,037
Okay, is that so?

207
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,956
I came by to see Yong-u.

208
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,543
My room's right there.
It's just across the hallway.

209
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,171
Yes, I know. I planned to come say hi.

210
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,883
You did?

211
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,887
Yong-u mentioned you left your phone here,
and he's hanging on to it.

212
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,305
I was just talking to him.

213
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,767
This is Yong-u.

214
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,769
Go ahead. It's him.

215
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,776
Yes, Yong-u.

216
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,153
<i>Mu-hee, I heard everything.</i>
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

217
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,363
Yeah, okay. Well, glad it's all good.

218
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,421
Well done. You've found Yong-u so quickly,

219
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,009
and there's no reason
for me to go to your room, so…

220
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,013
so what now?

221
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,475
I used him as a lame excuse.

222
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,144
I worried if I came
to see you by yourself,

223
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,774
you might feel intimidated,
and, uh, you might freak out a bit.

224
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,901
Oh. I'm terrified.

225
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,405
I came here to say something else.

226
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,450
Um, forget it. Good night.

227
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,079
Let's walk. We'll talk outside.

228
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,457
Or we could just… stay and talk in there.

229
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,460
I'm sorry. I can't invite you in.

230
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,712
I'm too terrified.

231
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,840
What if I die?

232
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,023
What did you eat on the plane?
I had mushrooms with rice.

233
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,361
Your flight came in from Japan,
so did they have sushi or <i>donburi?</i>

234
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,779
Maybe tempura.

235
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,073
It means deep-fried food
in Japanese, right?

236
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,743
Tempura does mean deep-fried food,
but I got <i>donburi.</i>

237
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,662
If you're saying things
off the top of your head

238
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,790
just to make conversation,
can we start with how we're doing?

239
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,166
So…

240
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,712
how are you?

241
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,967
Great. But busy, you know.

242
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,385
And you?

243
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,054
Hey!

244
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,348
Any news regarding her wedding?

245
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,184
It's still happening next week.

246
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,478
I've used this
as my way of not attending it.

247
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,316
Starting tomorrow,
we'll be pretty busy working anyway.

248
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,443
Next week will be gone in a blur.

249
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,527
Hmm.

250
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,072
Uh…

251
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,743
Do Ra-mi, is she still, um, haunting you?

252
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,621
She isn't fully gone.

253
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,124
I think a little about her,

254
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,752
how she's similar to comments online.

255
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:20,961
Comments?

256
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,964
The hateful, mean ones.

257
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,216
"Do you think these good times will last?"

258
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,510
And when it gets bad, she says,
"Serves you right."

259
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,678
"I knew this would happen."

260
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,264
She's like an online troll.
I wanna sue her.

261
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,767
She lives here, so I can't do that.

262
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,561
I can just pretend to ignore her.

263
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,941
If she's up there, as you've mentioned,

264
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,819
then that means you're making
those hateful comments up yourself.

265
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,530
Oh, yeah? Am I?

266
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,535
Right. I guess.

267
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,414
Tell me everything about these comments.

268
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,459
What does Do Ra-mi say to you?
Word for word.

269
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,799
We've ended up here together.

270
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,428
You're so giddy

271
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,932
after making him work here
to see the Northern Lights as an excuse.

272
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,393
He's the bachelor next door.

273
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,854
He's sleeping close by, so you'll see him
every day as you keep hoping,

274
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,274
while working and… eating together.

275
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,780
Why would I tell you that kind of stuff?

276
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,659
I'm the one who knows about it.
You've asked me for help. So tell me.

277
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,122
If everything Do Ra-mi says is up here,
you want me to share that?

278
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,666
It would be like
letting you read my diary.

279
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,917
I can't do that.

280
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,462
Why not?

281
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,091
Is there a translator in your entries?

282
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,927
I don't know.

283
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,304
How can you say you don't know?

284
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,390
Is it full of insults about me?

285
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,520
You think it's just insults?

286
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,772
Do Ra-mi has great insights.

287
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:08,652
If you only knew, you'd be frightened
to be alone with me tonight.

288
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,990
Why is that? Why?

289
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,493
You scaredy-cat.

290
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,173
Hiro?

291
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,051
What is it?

292
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,385
Why are you here?

293
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,763
I was waiting to tell you
about tomorrow's shoot.

294
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,556
Are you all right?

295
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,474
What's that?

296
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,728
The hotel sent a welcome cake and flowers.
Want some?

297
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,647
Ever seen me eat anything at night?

298
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,567
A slice of shortcake has 600 calories.
That'd be two hours on the treadmill.

299
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,195
Why is it so cold here this time of year?

300
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:37,241
I told you many times that Canada's fall
is colder than Japan's winter.

301
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,910
- Shall I turn up the heater?
- No, then it'll get too dry.

302
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,622
My eyes are already so dry
that they might pop out any minute.

303
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,208
What do you need to tell me?

304
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:51,255
Uh, they're asking if you prepared
a surprise gift for your first meeting.

305
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,173
Not likely.

306
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,552
Are they asking
because she's prepared something?

307
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,970
I believe so.

308
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,019
Fine. Then tell them
I'll prepare something too.

309
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,814
I guess I'll party with the zombie.

310
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,779
Are you still mad she didn't recognize you
that night and taking it out on her?

311
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,366
Sure, she was rude,

312
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,911
but do I look like a jerk
who'd hold such a petty grudge?

313
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,499
I asked you a question.
Why aren't you answering me?

314
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,168
Fine, I'll take your word for it.

315
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,338
I just don't like her public image.

316
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,426
You hate Do Ra-mi's zombie image
that much?

317
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,430
Prince Hiro, who'd smile like the sun,
even before a zombie.

318
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,350
That's the image I hate.

319
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:00,073
Have a bite of something sweet.
It'll make you feel better.

320
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,408
I'll leave it here.

321
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,218
Hearts, huh?

322
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,062
Come on.

323
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,981
Tell me all the things
Hiro has said about me.

324
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,817
Why ask the interpreter?

325
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,361
Go and talk to the director.

326
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,280
When someone goes on a blind date,
it's normal to ask questions.

327
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,283
Well, what…
Why would this shoot count as a date?

328
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,827
It's a shoot, but it's still a date.

329
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,830
And the person connecting us,
in this case, is you, Joo Ho-jin.

330
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,042
You're… the true messenger of love.

331
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,044
So what did he say?

332
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,338
That's all the more reason
not to say anything.

333
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,882
I don't wanna say anything
to muddy the waters here.

334
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,178
Well, why did you get upset, then?
Just tell me what he said.

335
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,055
Who's upset?

336
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,723
Yong-u said you were.

337
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,977
That you were sad when I said
I was into Hiro, romantically.

338
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,229
Yong-u may have misheard.

339
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,772
You understand?

340
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,275
The translator must never interpret
with a bias.

341
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,653
It might lead to silly misunderstandings
like this one.

342
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,198
So tell me, Joo Ho-jin,

343
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,951
you can interpret
with no emotions whatsoever?

344
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,247
If we act cutesy and adorable
with one another, it won't get to you?

345
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,040
My work is to be a listener

346
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,584
and translate between the two languages.

347
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,005
What's said or done involves
no emotions or reactions on my part.

348
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,923
Oh, what a relief.

349
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,721
That's good 'cause I worried about
crossing the line and embarrassing you.

350
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,932
Now I'm reassured
I can act cheesy and lovey-dovey.

351
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,685
Wait, why would I be embarrassed?

352
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,648
Oh, the drama.

353
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,493
From now on, go ask the producer
if you have any questions.

354
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,122
They wanna make the show dramatic
by all means.

355
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,415
They'll say anything.

356
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,085
You're closer to me. I can trust you.

357
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,129
I'm asking you to be on my side.

358
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,010
They're pretty.

359
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,931
I'm gonna make a heart with these leaves.

360
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,267
Like what they do on socials.

361
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,602
I'll make one that says,

362
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,980
"I'm giving you this heart
to celebrate our first meeting."

363
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,900
How do you say "heart" in Japanese?

364
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,027
"Heart" is "ha-to" in Japanese.

365
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,987
Of course.

366
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,198
Hearts are universal. Amazing.

367
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,339
You've made me think…

368
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,469
about things people said.

369
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,763
I think you're right.

370
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,891
The hateful comments are only my thoughts.

371
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,814
I told you that
this is my long-awaited festival?

372
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:19,856
Hmm.

373
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,943
What if all the fireworks will end

374
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,404
and everyone will go away?

375
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,032
I'll end up all by myself again, I'm sure.

376
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:31,827
I'm

377
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,995
gonna be left with nothing.

378
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,335
That's why Do Ra-mi's here
and leaves comments like,

379
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,921
"What a sad loser. You're going to fail."

380
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,556
You shouldn't listen to Do Ra-mi.

381
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,602
It won't happen to you
as long as you don't let it.

382
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,274
If you say so.

383
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,405
I said I'll help you,
but I don't know what more I can do.

384
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,283
I can neither hear nor see Do Ra-mi

385
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,743
because she lives inside your head.

386
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,456
You said you'd root for me, didn't you?

387
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,543
You said you'd never ask me out,
but you'd keep rooting.

388
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,670
Do that. You're good at it.

389
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,799
Plus, you're basically
the only one who knows

390
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,843
about the hateful troll in my head.

391
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,636
Go on!

392
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,264
Keep rooting for me like you do.

393
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,475
Pray I never lose to Do Ra-mi.

394
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,603
Yay, Cha Mu-hee.

395
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,148
Win. Keep winning.

396
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,942
Go Cha Mu-hee!

397
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,031
Let's figure out a better cheer.

398
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,412
Cha Mu-hee.

399
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,206
May I…

400
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,835
Mu-hee!

401
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,923
Yong-u will think
I was flirting with you again.

402
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,008
I'm going inside.

403
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,595
Good night, bachelor next door.

404
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,973
- Do you have my phone?
- Ho-jin--

405
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,100
I have it right here. Were you…

406
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,936
I was just asking about Hiro.

407
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,687
Of course you were.

408
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,292
Producer Kim.

409
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,838
Producer Kim.
Why didn't he take his walkie-talkie?

410
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,382
Oh, hi! Well…

411
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:54,052
You… need to go over there.

412
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,721
Mu-hee!

413
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,849
You look so pretty this morning.

414
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,768
- How are you today?
- I'm excited.

415
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,187
Good. As for the cameras,

416
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,440
we'll make them
as unintrusive as possible.

417
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,525
And, oh,

418
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,152
we watch everything from the monitors

419
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,239
<i>in our video village over there.</i>
<i>That's the main one.</i>

420
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,202
<i>You'll hear the interpreter</i>
<i>through your earpiece.</i>

421
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,621
Sir, in today's script…

422
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,086
Could you lower the drone
to focus on Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

423
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,546
Good.

424
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,298
That camera could readjust…

425
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:37,012
Should we switch from the drone
with this shot? It's more dynamic.

426
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,014
- Switch these two?
- Yeah, yeah.

427
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,943
Can you hear me, Mr. Joo?

428
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,613
<i>I can hear you.</i>

429
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,032
Fun. I can hear you too.

430
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,537
Done. It's in.

431
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,293
The weather is so perfect.

432
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,423
All right, cameras, at your positions.

433
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,550
Drone, follow Hiro.

434
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,390
Let's begin the first day
of <i>Romantic Trip.</i>

435
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,434
Let's do this.

436
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,855
<i>Move the drone towards Cha Mu-hee.</i>

437
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,036
<i>Let's follow Hiro now.</i>

438
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,558
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

439
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,644
Oh.

440
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,229
Yes, hello.

441
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,482
I'm headed your way.

442
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,778
Well, I'm sitting

443
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,280
right under a big maple tree.

444
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,491
<i>Will you be able to find me?</i>

445
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,458
I see you're sitting on a bench.

446
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,669
Yes, I am. Good.

447
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,588
You can see me?

448
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,427
Where are you?

449
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,637
Why don't you come find me?

450
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,222
Sorry?

451
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,227
It wouldn't be any fun
if I just appeared in front of you.

452
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,272
Try to find me.

453
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,276
Ah. Well, it's a huge park.

454
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,777
I don't know where to start.

455
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,239
Take a good look around.

456
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:05,618
You'll find me below the red balloon.

457
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,082
He's under a red balloon?

458
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,547
A red balloon!

459
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,549
I see the balloon!

460
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,218
Then, um, I'll head over that way.

461
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,858
Wow. Hiro's created
an interesting situation on his own.

462
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,151
It's pretty entertaining.

463
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,487
Who knew Do Ra-mi could run.

464
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,867
Drone, keep your sights on Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

465
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,951
Follow her.

466
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,919
Whoa!

467
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,631
Ay!

468
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,568
<i>Okay.</i>

469
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,654
Next is a blue balloon.

470
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,113
Run!

471
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,037
A blue balloon this time.

472
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,455
Okay…

473
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,418
Oh my. You're really making this hard.

474
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,756
Wait right there. I'll go and find you.

475
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,599
<i>Look straight to your left.</i>

476
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,267
<i>He's on your left.</i>

477
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,462
Yes!

478
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,482
I caught you!

479
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,462
She found him! She got him!

480
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,256
Well done, Do Ra-mi! Good work.

481
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,384
- She did it!
- Nice, Do Ra-mi!

482
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,844
She's pretty and smart. Wow.

483
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,515
We had zero reasons to be worried.
They're entertaining.

484
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,644
This is what's entertaining?
Making someone run around a huge area?

485
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,646
It's a reality show.

486
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,587
We've met recently, you know?

487
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,173
I didn't get your name then.

488
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,051
Mr. Hiro Kurosawa. Is that right?

489
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,138
I remember you too.

490
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,016
So we meet again, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

491
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,979
Wow, I might have run around everywhere

492
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,231
until all of those balloons were gone.

493
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,154
I'm glad you found me
before they were all gone.

494
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,073
I got these as a present for you.

495
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,369
Ah!

496
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,511
Oh, I'm so sorry.

497
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,346
I didn't catch it and lost your gift.

498
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,860
It's fine. I had fun thanks to you.

499
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,946
Thinking back
to how you were in that movie,

500
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,783
I thought running around like crazy
to find a guy

501
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:40,745
would suit you better
than sitting prettily waiting for him.

502
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,582
And I was right.

503
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,628
Wouldn't it be funny
if we cut from you running just now

504
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:52,882
to the shot from your movie
of you running with a bloodied axe?

505
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:54,967
Right?

506
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,082
It was so fun, like shooting a movie,

507
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,132
Ah.

508
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,176
That was kind of fun, yeah.

509
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,475
I had fun too.

510
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,647
Watching you frantically pedal that bike

511
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,524
was pretty hilarious.

512
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,407
Ah! I have a present for you too.

513
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,661
Huh.

514
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,382
This is my present.

515
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,718
It's a heart.

516
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,138
This is the worst.

517
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,793
- Oh my.
- Oh!

518
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,588
They make such a pretty picture.
They're both "wow."

519
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,965
Couldn't look better.

520
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,430
Canada is the country of maple leaves.

521
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:08,184
I made a maple leaf heart
that symbolizes that.

522
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,356
Here you go.

523
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,238
Is something wrong?

524
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,781
There's dust in my eye.

525
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:26,994
My contact fell out.

526
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,335
He says he can't continue filming

527
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,670
without his contacts.

528
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,380
He didn't bring any of his spares.

529
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,549
New ones can be shipped,
but they'll get here tomorrow evening.

530
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,344
So we stop filming
until the lenses arrive?

531
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,345
What?

532
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,390
This afternoon,
we planned to go to Horseshoe Canyon.

533
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,684
Today's the only day we can film there.

534
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,477
I'm so sorry.

535
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,646
I'm very sorry.

536
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,440
Wait. Oh, Nanami…

537
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,734
Do something about this.

538
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,990
It's my fault.
Sorry for… for that pile of leaves.

539
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,075
It's fine. It's okay.

540
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,499
We're supposed to find
a contact lens in here?

541
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,293
If we find it, would it be wearable?

542
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,962
Keep an eye out for something shiny.

543
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,463
Be careful. It's small.

544
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,382
What am I doing?

545
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,892
"This is the worst."

546
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,895
I heard him say that.

547
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,732
Although no one else was able to hear him.

548
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,697
If that's what you heard him say…

549
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:50,661
why didn't you translate
what you actually heard?

550
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,210
I'd ruin this project.

551
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,712
Now, I need your help.

552
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,759
We have to resolve this matter
quickly and quietly.

553
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,053
I'll do my best too.

554
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,517
<i>There's one thing</i>
<i>Hiro is obsessed with right now.</i>

555
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,978
<i>That might resolve things.</i>

556
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,070
Honestly. Does it have to come to this?

557
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,120
What a day.

558
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,706
Everyone's blaming Mu-hee
for holding up the shoot.

559
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,751
They say the heart made of leaves
was a bad idea.

560
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:43,464
Why would his contact fall out?
And why was it so damn windy?

561
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,646
Where are you going?

562
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,402
Just to meet my friend downtown.

563
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,869
Wow, everyone likes this guy.

564
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,419
Joo Ho-jin, I heard you're going downtown.

565
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,004
Can you give me a ride?

566
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,965
I gotta go somewhere.

567
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,302
You didn't wait
to hear yes or no, did you?

568
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,721
Where you off to?

569
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,723
A good Japanese restaurant.

570
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,144
Why go to a Japanese one in Canada?

571
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,688
I wanna pick up takeout
for a Japanese friend.

572
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,690
Let's just go.

573
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,110
There's supposed to be a very famous
Japanese restaurant here,

574
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,612
and when you're away,
you miss food from back home.

575
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,574
He's been here for two days.
I doubt he misses it already.

576
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,034
We had Japanese food on the flight too.

577
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,705
I can't apologize to him empty-handed.

578
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,210
Why see him at all
when you don't understand each other?

579
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,297
Nanami, his assistant? She speaks English.

580
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,717
I have to ask him to continue
with glasses on or something else.

581
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,677
Production's responsible for that.

582
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,220
Don't go see him.

583
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,725
Why don't you want me to go?

584
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,519
Does he not like me?
Is that what you think?

585
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,234
When we were shooting this morning,
Hiro was saying a whole lot,

586
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,778
but you only said a brief sentence
and moved on.

587
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,739
What did he say to me?

588
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,408
I don't know. I can't remember.

589
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,327
I translated every single word.

590
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,873
Don't you have somewhere to go?

591
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,335
Just go now. I will be okay.
You're seeing a friend, right?

592
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:50,633
I'll be right back. Be right here.
Don't see him alone, okay?

593
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,689
I wonder if that part
he didn't translate was rude.

594
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,995
These were really hard to get.

595
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,914
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

596
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:25,334
These were really hard to get as well.

597
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,128
Oh.

598
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:32,007
Honestly, I would've done
anything for this.

599
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:33,968
Thank you.

600
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,085
He seems to be okay.

601
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,548
That guy is just a big liar!

602
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,674
What should we do?

603
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,227
Take it.

604
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,360
You can crush his skull.

605
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,903
Throw it at him!

606
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,092
Don't be a pushover!

607
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,698
He took off.

608
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,125
This time,

609
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,379
Do Ra-mi put a rock in my hand.

610
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,090
She said, "Throw it."

611
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,844
But if I…

612
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,141
If I smacked him right now,
it would make things worse

613
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,769
and maybe ruin the whole show.

614
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,105
I held myself back.

615
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,441
That means you won.

616
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,489
You said you're rooting for me?
Then tell me everything you know.

617
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,158
Why is he mocking me like this?

618
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,246
There were problems
before we even got here.

619
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,416
He didn't want you cast

620
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,126
as his partner.

621
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,379
Ah.

622
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,176
So he just doesn't like me.

623
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,140
Joo Ho-jin.

624
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,935
You already knew he didn't like me at all?

625
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,272
You just listened while
I was being teased on TV yesterday.

626
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:02,194
How silly and stupid I looked when I said

627
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,572
I was going to be all cutesy?

628
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,828
You don't have to hold it in. Get angry.

629
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,964
You should have talked me out
of making that stupid heart.

630
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,156
It really was that zombie.

631
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,451
Why did she just walk away?

632
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,413
She definitely saw me.

633
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,584
The interpreter is here to see you.

634
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,919
The interpreter? Why?

635
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:07,009
I bet the production crew sent you
to convince me to resume the shoot.

636
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,637
Your eyesight must be quite poor.

637
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,348
Those glasses look very thick.

638
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,480
It's an insecurity of mine.

639
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,859
I don't even leave my house
without my contacts.

640
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,737
So I can't continue the shoot.

641
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:28,697
I see.

642
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,949
Well, that's a shame.

643
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,494
Hiro.

644
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,289
I suggest you check again thoroughly

645
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:40,083
whether you really didn't bring
any spare contacts.

646
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,003
Otherwise,

647
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,672
you may really regret it.

648
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,726
Ah…

649
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,229
Hiro will be able to start
shooting again now.

650
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,106
- Oh.
- That's great.

651
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,901
Wow, Mr. Joo must've been able
to persuade him.

652
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:12,074
He was able to find some
spare contacts in his bag.

653
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,784
I'm sorry for any inconvenience.

654
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,411
It's not a problem.
I'm glad it's worked out. Let's go.

655
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,788
- We'll be going again.
- Oh.

656
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,374
He would like to talk to you
to clear the air

657
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,709
before resuming production,
if that's okay.

658
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,211
Both of you.

659
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:25,963
Let's go.

660
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,887
<i>Keep in mind </i>

661
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:42,145
<i>I'm never gonna</i>
<i>Leave your life ever long… </i>

662
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,829
<i>You'll be okay… </i>

663
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,809
Thank you so much!

664
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,769
- I love you!
- Will you sign my shirt?

665
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,146
- Sure.
- Oh!

666
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,815
Your name?

667
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:42,289
<i>So babe, I promise </i>

668
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:47,085
<i>Forever I'll never leave… </i>

669
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,506
Thank you so much!

670
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,509
- Bye!
- Thank you!

671
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:14,780
<i>Forever I'll never leave </i>

672
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,373
Did you turn your phone off, Mu-hee?

673
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,669
Were you looking for me?
Why? So you can make fun of me?

674
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,923
The shoot they canceled is on again.

675
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,842
We have to hurry and get over there.

676
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,562
Was Hiro embarrassed
that I saw him at the clock?

677
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,899
Was he afraid
that I would tell production?

678
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,903
What made him change his mind?

679
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:56,863
Who knows.

680
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,243
In any case,
it's good that we're shooting today.

681
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,914
So then what are you gonna do, Mu-hee?
Can you pretend you don't know?

682
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,752
Of course. I've often had to pretend
in front of people who don't like me.

683
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,131
If I didn't hide my feelings, I'd lose.

684
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,218
You translated for me
at the doctor's office.

685
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:22,389
You know I grew up with relatives that
didn't welcome me. I adapted to survive.

686
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,688
What is it?

687
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:34,109
I've taken my share of abuse,
so don't worry. I'll be fine.

688
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,112
You said Do Ra-mi put a rock in your hand?

689
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,325
Even if you can't throw it,
tell him that you have it.

690
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,119
That way, he won't treat you…

691
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,371
He won't treat you badly anymore.

692
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:53,253
If you feel like telling him,
I'll translate it exactly for you.

693
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:54,880
You mean it?

694
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:59,384
No matter… if I swear or not?
You said you don't translate profanity.

695
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:02,012
Swear at him. Sure.
I'll interpret everything.

696
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:08,977
You didn't interpret what he said earlier
on purpose. Why not?

697
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,564
Were you worried I'd get too upset
and ruin the shoot?

698
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:17,861
I guess you feel bad for agreeing
to trick me with Producer Kim.

699
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,447
That's not it.

700
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,576
Who wants to translate that?

701
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,581
It, uh… upset me for a reason.

702
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,006
I thought no matter what,

703
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:43,011
your job was to avoid emotions
and interpret everything whatsoever.

704
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:47,641
I said that. Guess I've changed my mind,
and now I'm on your side.

705
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:52,812
I'm sorry.

706
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,696
Well, if you're on my side,

707
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,282
I'll forgive you.

708
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,742
<i>You make me feel all right</i>

709
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,706
<i>You make me feel…</i>

710
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:07,012
- Go ahead so you can get ready.
- See you or hear you soon.

711
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,266
Joo Ho-jin.

712
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,060
Thank you!

713
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:32,287
<i>When I look into your eyes</i>

714
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:38,626
<i>Fall in love with you…</i>

715
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,652
If they meet over there…

716
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,154
Sorry we're late.

717
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,323
- Oh, yes, great.
- Sorry.

718
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,408
- Sorry, sorry.
- Go to your mark.

719
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:11,534
Sorry.

720
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,789
Sorry. I'm here. Hi. Hello.

721
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,639
This place is huge.

722
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,226
How many Tokyo Domes would fit in here?

723
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:52,909
The clock tower.

724
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,780
See? It's a heart.

725
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,117
The last one was ruined.
Let's be good to this one, right?

726
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:50,175
<i>The birds are flying…</i>

727
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,969
<i>We're ready to start shooting</i>
<i>at Horseshoe Canyon.</i>

728
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:57,307
<i>Something they want to imply</i>

729
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,935
<i>I greet the breeze</i>

730
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,563
<i>And nod to the trees</i>

731
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:07,859
<i>I heard the winds reply</i>

732
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:15,200
<i>A thousand languages start to whisper</i>
<i>Around my world</i>

733
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:26,127
<i>One quiet voice answers them</i>
<i>In gentle word…</i>

734
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,337
You don't even say thanks?

735
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,884
<i>Stuck in my throat</i>

736
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:35,470
<i>Round and round</i>

737
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,139
<i>I wanna speak out…</i>

738
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:39,724
This is breathtaking.

739
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,896
<i>Echoes of my voice answer alone…</i>

740
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:45,813
Wow!

741
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,942
<i>Tell me the truth</i>

742
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,778
<i>What don't I see?</i>

743
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,947
<i>Stuck in my thoughts</i>

744
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,449
<i>I walk till I fade</i>

745
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,868
<i>I feel the love…</i>

746
00:58:58,952 --> 00:58:59,827
This is great.

747
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,121
We'll be able to wrap this up
before sunset.

748
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:04,958
Look at that.

749
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,877
Why is she in such a good mood?

750
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,463
<i>Round and round, my life just goes on</i>

751
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,924
<i>I greet the breeze</i>

752
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,468
<i>- And nod to the trees…</i>
- Oh.

753
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,345
<i>I hear the winds…</i>

754
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:19,347
<i>Those words I don't need to translate.</i>

755
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:32,986
Hey.

756
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,489
How did Mr. Joo get Hiro
to come back again?

757
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,834
I've visited Canada before.

758
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,003
Vancouver, Calgary, Banff.

759
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,716
He's obsessed
with attending sporting events.

760
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:59,220
He's been to Canada a few times,

761
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:03,516
but he's been sad about never being able
to go to an ice hockey game.

762
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,731
Ice hockey.

763
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:26,372
I'm guessing you'd need
your contacts to watch the hockey game.

764
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:36,883
Hey, Yong-u.

765
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,801
Where are the snacks you packed?

766
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,678
You said you had a bunch of chips.

767
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:43,431
Yeah, I'm sure I did.
I had a bag full of stuff.

768
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:47,143
Why have… This is all I have left?

769
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,562
Where… where's my stuff?

770
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,731
Thank you for the ticket.

771
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,901
- You helped me out, Robin.
- <i>No. Thank you!</i>

772
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,403
<i>Their favorite K-pop band had these,</i>

773
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,073
<i>but they're impossible to get in Canada.</i>

774
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,032
<i>Thanks to you,</i>

775
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,409
<i>I scored some serious brownie points</i>
<i>with these girls.</i>

776
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,953
<i>- What do you say to him?</i>
<i>- Thank you! You're the best!</i>

777
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:08,956
<i>Exactly. Thank you, Ho-jin.</i>

778
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:26,474
You seem a lot better
after getting those tickets.

779
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,434
To be honest,

780
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:32,146
when he told you to talk with the crew
instead of taking it out on Cha Mu-hee,

781
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,607
I was certain you'd get mad.

782
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:40,113
I was waiting for a chance to score
when Mr. Joo gave me… the perfect assist.

783
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,116
It wasn't just because of the ticket.

784
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:46,744
Thanks to him,
the crew agreed to accept my input.

785
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:51,457
We're here to create
a reality television show.

786
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:56,045
We don't want you to smile in a fake way
like you're some kind of prince, you know?

787
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,922
When you're in a bad mood

788
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:01,175
or if there's something
you'd rather not do,

789
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,844
tell us, be honest.

790
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:06,389
Then what if I never warm up
to Ms. Cha Mu-hee

791
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,808
and decide I don't want
to keep traveling with her?

792
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,393
Would that be okay?

793
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,564
Yes.

794
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:18,818
Well, we'd just have
you travel separately. That's it.

795
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:22,196
But it's possible
you will start to actually like her.

796
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:27,034
You could grow fond of her, you know.

797
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,370
Would you admit to it if it was the case?

798
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,874
That's ridiculous.

799
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,878
If I grow to like Ms. Cha Mu-hee…

800
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,634
I won't hide it. I'll confess my feelings.

801
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,976
This isn't a joke. I mean it.

802
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:54,812
So please translate my words verbatim.

803
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,200
I didn't wanna translate it.

804
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,953
It was wrong. For some reason, it hurt.

805
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,352
The heart of a zombie…

806
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:38,940
Have I been infected?

807
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:37,957
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?
