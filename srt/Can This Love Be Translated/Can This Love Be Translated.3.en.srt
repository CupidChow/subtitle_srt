1
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,950
Perfect, Hiro.

2
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,121
Let's get out once the actress
ahead of us is past the main photo line.

3
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,544
Who is that?

4
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,671
You don't know her?

5
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,922
That's Do Ra-mi.

6
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,675
The one who's blowing up globally.
Do Ra-mi.

7
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,094
No, I don't know her.

8
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,263
You really don't?

9
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,974
You haven't seen the Do Ra-mi movie?

10
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,809
He has.

11
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,022
It was in your Netflix viewing history,
both this month and last.

12
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,691
Right, that killer zombie?

13
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,318
What was the actress's name again?

14
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,819
Cha Mu-hee.

15
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:14,783
Her name was in your search history,
yet you don't remember?

16
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,536
Why do you even have my tablet?

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,830
You said to always stand by
with it in hand.

18
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,624
Don't snoop without permission.

19
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,084
- Mirror.
- Here.

20
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:30,840
Okay.

21
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,180
What's up with her?

22
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,976
Why's she standing there like a zombie?

23
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,561
You're right, she is.

24
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,481
She's been standing there long enough.
What is she doing?

25
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,483
She should go so you can have your moment.

26
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,193
Something seems off with her.

27
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,987
She doesn't look well.

28
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,157
If she faints, this red-carpet event
will come to a screeching halt.

29
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,619
But I waited three months.

30
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:03,039
I waited three months
for this custom-made suit from Italy.

31
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,543
I can't let that happen.

32
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,921
- Hiro!
- Hiro!

33
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,715
No way. Is he going to walk past her?

34
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,802
He wouldn't do something so insane,

35
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,263
even if he wants to show off
that custom-made suit.

36
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:22,976
<i>Hiro is attending</i>
<i>the Tokyo International Film Festival</i>

37
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,477
<i>for the second year in a row.</i>

38
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:29,399
<i>This year, his performance as Hideo</i>
<i>in </i>Can I Love You? <i>earned him acclaim.</i>

39
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,530
Wake up.

40
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,449
I'll help you.

41
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,373
Let's walk together.

42
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,013
These two are a no-go.

43
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,266
They just confirmed
that they can't make the dates work.

44
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,101
And last time we spoke,

45
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,686
these three were interested.

46
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,440
But they're asking for more time
before making a decision.

47
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,650
As for these girls,
they're really excited,

48
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,486
but I don't think
that Hiro will like either of the two.

49
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,282
Casting this show has been a pain.

50
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,827
But who can we find for the female lead
by the end of the week?

51
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,915
Cha Mu-hee would be great!

52
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,541
Cha Mu-hee?

53
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,168
Do Ra-mi?

54
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,420
Do Ra-mi is a zombie.

55
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,549
Oh, please. The genre's completely wrong.
A zombie on a show called <i>Romantic Trip?</i>

56
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,843
I have a feeling
they'd be a good match though.

57
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,970
Mostly because of this footage I saw.

58
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,598
The clip is going mad viral right now.

59
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,229
Hasn't the Do Ra-mi trend
died down though?

60
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:53,524
Even that one drama she was gonna be in,
it, uh, fell through, right?

61
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,585
This could actually work.

62
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,420
Oh my God!

63
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,965
Do Ra-mi? Do Ra-mi. Who reps her?

64
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,425
- Get her schedule right away!
- Okay. Got it.

65
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,428
Here's Japan's number one prince charming.

66
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,349
And here's South Korea's
number one scream queen.

67
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,809
Nice to meet you.

68
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,730
Hey there.

69
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,777
But their branding is different,
don't you think?

70
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,571
It is, which is why
they have to learn to communicate.

71
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,283
That's basically
the theme and the concept, right?

72
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:47,537
Two strangers, meeting for the first time,
falling in love despite it all.

73
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,622
Overcoming different languages.

74
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,292
Black and pink will be a great match.

75
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,751
Blackpink?

76
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,671
Our show needs to be a hit
like the girl band!

77
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,715
Blackpink!

78
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:26,367
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

79
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,254
Great, thank you.

80
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,969
You need to meet
with a specialist when it gets this late

81
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,804
if you wanna buy any sleeping pills.

82
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,767
Fortunately, for you, I just so happen
to know one who works late.

83
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,018
So talk to him first.

84
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,688
Why can't I pick up some pills
and just go?

85
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,067
I'm in a rush, and there's a party
I need to be at later tonight.

86
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,068
Then tell the doctor.

87
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,697
Also, how did you figure out
I was at that hotel? Tell me, Mu-hee.

88
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,784
Because I've got a room there too.

89
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,036
My manager, Yong-u,

90
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,622
he said he spotted you before,
back in the lobby.

91
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,248
Ah.

92
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,003
Do you happen to have any other problems?

93
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,298
Why? You don't believe me?

94
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,385
I feel dizzy, shaky,
nauseous, and feverish too.

95
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,387
Like I wanna collapse all the time.

96
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,848
Give me your forehead to check.

97
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,434
No.

98
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,021
Cha Mu-hee, don't play around.

99
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,732
You'll be forced
to go to a hospital immediately

100
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,984
if I translate all of these symptoms.

101
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,363
- So no games, okay?
- Hey! You think I'm pretending?

102
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,449
I had those symptoms earlier.

103
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,369
I'd never dream of asking for your help
'cause you turned me down.

104
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,337
Ho-jin, sorry to keep you waiting.

105
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,296
Not at all.

106
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,966
Come in. This way.

107
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,303
Let's go in. Here.

108
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,813
Tell him I'm just here
to, um, get a prescription.

109
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,190
And mention
that my heartbeat was too fast.

110
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,109
Anxiety pills would be great.

111
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,540
He's asking you
to try and describe the anxiety.

112
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,208
As well as any symptoms.

113
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,294
Does he need to know?

114
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,504
Yeah, he kinda does.

115
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,093
All I need is to buy medicine
without providing all these details.

116
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,138
Then buy whatever you need from the store.

117
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,599
You can't buy anxiety drugs
without a prescription.

118
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,892
Exactly.

119
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,353
You came here 'cause you're in pain,

120
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,940
so let the doctor know
because he can help with your symptoms.

121
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,824
He's a doctor,
so I hope he won't tell anyone, right?

122
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,705
But you're translating,
so you'll hear everything

123
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,290
and know exactly what's wrong.

124
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,834
Well, you need to talk so I can translate.

125
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,218
If that's a problem, then just fly home.
I'll look for a flight back to Seoul.

126
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,637
No way! I have an event tonight!

127
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,555
These actors and a big director
wanna meet up,

128
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,349
so I can't just leave and blow them off.

129
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,850
What about the doctor?

130
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,021
Ah…

131
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,733
Well, basically…

132
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,363
what I'm anxious about is…

133
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,575
that I've had visions of

134
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,953
Do Ra-mi lately.

135
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,503
She just shows up randomly.

136
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,634
She laughs.

137
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,680
Like she wants to taunt me.

138
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,486
<i>At first, I thought it was just fatigue</i>

139
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,238
<i>making me see things.</i>

140
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,740
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

141
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,578
<i>Because I kept seeing her</i>
<i>even after I got some rest.</i>

142
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,249
So Director Peter Jason is gonna make
an appearance at the after-party.

143
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,084
You think that's true?

144
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,878
Oh, and apparently there's gonna be
a bunch of famous actors.

145
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,422
Would it be rude to ask for pictures?

146
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,675
<i>I just wanna ignore it</i>
<i>because it's only a hallucination.</i>

147
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,262
<i>But I see her so clearly, so I can't.</i>

148
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:01,225
<i>I'm always on edge,</i>
<i>worried about where she'll appear next.</i>

149
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,061
<i>And today,</i>

150
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,148
<i>I think I just fell apart.</i>

151
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,990
Am I crazy?

152
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,015
What would you like?

153
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,934
Whatever. You choose.

154
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,941
When I was just a kid,

155
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,111
I was in this really bad accident.

156
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,573
But it's a giant blank.

157
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,118
I don't remember anything about it,

158
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,454
even how my parents died.

159
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:09,210
Is there any history
of mental illness in your family?

160
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,380
I was raised in my uncle's house.

161
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,927
There was no one with mental issues
as far as I can recall.

162
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,970
Not on Mom's side.

163
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,686
The accident was probably her fault.

164
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,565
'Cause nobody ever mentions
her in my family.

165
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,110
Any more questions?

166
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,794
As you can see,
Mu-hee is not in good shape.

167
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,506
Once she graduated from high school,
she informed us via letter

168
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,217
that she was cutting ties
with our side of the family.

169
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,679
So don't contact us,
no matter what happens to her.

170
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,848
Excuse me?

171
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,226
That's pretty cold.

172
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,365
The medicine's only a temporary solution.

173
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,826
So when you go back home,
try to get proper care.

174
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,828
I know what to do, all right?

175
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,707
This isn't a lecture. I'm interpreting
what the doctor said earlier.

176
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,127
He said your condition
could be stress-induced,

177
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,587
like you presumed it was.

178
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,504
But it…

179
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,300
it could just as likely be brain damage.

180
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,387
That's something you've
already translated, so please stop.

181
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,852
Your manager will arrive soon.

182
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,354
He said he'd come by and pick you up.

183
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,231
You talked to Yong-u?

184
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,610
He called to say he was looking for you,
so I told him earlier you were here.

185
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,529
And the hospital stuff?

186
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,365
I said you gave me a call,
and you needed help

187
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,744
because of a bad stomachache,
so I ended up taking you to the hospital.

188
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,329
Oh.

189
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,581
A stomachache, huh?

190
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,505
It's funny.

191
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,215
I never said anything,

192
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,343
but Yong-u figured out
that I asked you out and got rejected.

193
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,512
Then how stupid is it

194
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,890
that a painful stomachache
was all it took in the end

195
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,225
for me to come see you?

196
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,436
He must think I'm desperate or something.

197
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,026
Is the new medicine making me giggle?

198
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,833
Maybe I really did lose my mind.

199
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,561
Thanks for your help, Joo Ho-jin.

200
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,189
But I just can't repay a favor like this.

201
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,985
'Cause I know we'll never meet again.

202
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,073
You were only an interpreter, but…

203
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,411
but you know too much about my life now.

204
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,041
So sometimes
I don't know how my face looks

205
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,960
or how to react when I see you.

206
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,589
Today, you ended up making me laugh.

207
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,887
I'll probably cry
next time I see you though.

208
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,101
Yong-u should be here soon.

209
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,645
I really appreciate your help,
and I apologize.

210
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,402
The doctor said to try and take it easy,

211
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,487
but I guess
you're going to the event, right?

212
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,115
Yeah, of course. This is my festival.

213
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,329
Yeah. I'm so in love with my new life.

214
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,956
And I never wanna stop loving my life.

215
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,630
Okay, you can enjoy the night,
but no drinking, all right?

216
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,923
Don't mix it with the medicine.

217
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,216
The doctor recommended that too?

218
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,718
It's not a translation.

219
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,346
It's me, worrying about you, Mu-hee.

220
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,019
Nice to meet you. You look so amazing.

221
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:19,937
Thank you.

222
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,693
I'm a big fan. Can we take a picture?

223
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,694
Okay.

224
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,095
It might just be the medicine.

225
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,599
I'm tired.

226
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,697
It's the zombie.

227
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,660
Hello there.

228
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,997
So we meet again.

229
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,916
Ah, Japanese.

230
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,462
He's cute.

231
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,338
An actor?

232
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,759
Hmm. What's she saying?

233
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,186
Wow.

234
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,854
What is he staring at?

235
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,357
Does he wanna talk to me or what?

236
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,573
What's with this woman?
Aren't you going to thank me at all?

237
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,492
A simple thank-you can't be that hard.

238
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,835
Hmm?

239
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,504
Photo? I'm okay.

240
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,380
- Selfie? Camera?
- "Camera"?

241
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,174
Take a Picture? Picture?

242
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,426
- "Camera."
- Ah… right.

243
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,096
Okay. One, two, smile!

244
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,264
Uh, a heart?

245
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,517
Okay, one, two, three, hearts!

246
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,523
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Have a nice day.

247
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,322
Does she think
she did me a favor by taking a selfie?

248
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:36,865
Huh?

249
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,409
That zombie doesn't realize who I am.

250
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,916
He seems kinda familiar.

251
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,961
Or maybe he was in a movie I saw?

252
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,279
I took a look
at the request you sent over.

253
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,198
My experience with TV is a little limited,

254
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,242
so I don't know if I can help.

255
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,078
Oh, no, no. Don't worry about that.

256
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,205
- Don't worry. It doesn't matter at all.
- Ah.

257
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,459
We're gonna see Europe.
Parts of North America as well.

258
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,920
And when we heard
that there was a man like you

259
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,714
who knew all of those languages,

260
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,632
I thought, "Oh, my! That's it!"

261
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,718
- "You are the chosen one, Mr. Joo."
- Exactly.

262
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,721
So please, you've gotta help us out,
just this once.

263
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,806
Well, how long
is the shoot expected to be?

264
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,518
It'll be a slightly longer trip.

265
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,478
Three to four months, probably.

266
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,606
It's not as long as you think.

267
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,234
Uh, that sounds like quite a long time.

268
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,403
We are moving between countries,

269
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,489
but you can be sure we'll come back
to Seoul too. Isn't that right, Ms. Cho?

270
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,742
Yeah, sure.

271
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,786
The show is called <i>Romantic Trip.</i>
It's like a fairy tale.

272
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,915
So I want you to picture
these truly magical,

273
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,125
scenic, gorgeous places we'll be visiting.

274
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,836
It won't be exhausting
or anything like that. Right, Mr. Kim?

275
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,921
Yep.

276
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,632
Also, did you happen to watch
our previous season?

277
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,300
Oh, you'll love it!

278
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,011
Well, Shin Ji-sun,
our producer, recommended you.

279
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,388
We worked on that first season together.

280
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,100
This is because
Shin Ji-sun mentioned my name to you?

281
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,060
Yeah.

282
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,355
On that note,
Producer Shin said she'd come by.

283
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,482
She wanted to see you, Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

284
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,028
Oh, hey.

285
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,238
Where's Ho-jin?

286
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,823
He's, uh… Well, had somewhere else to go.

287
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,202
Is that so?
I was hoping we'd grab lunch together.

288
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,161
Me too.

289
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,831
Maybe I could have persuaded him
over lunch, but he didn't fall for it.

290
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,419
Shin Ji-sun, I heard that
you're dating his brother, right?

291
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,964
Tell him to put in a good word for us.

292
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,507
We're getting really desperate.

293
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,135
His brother doesn't pay attention either.

294
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,512
I'll try my best.

295
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,992
Hey, isn't that the writer, Na Jin-suk?

296
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,497
- He came to our store for a signing event.
- Yeah, that does look like him.

297
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,458
Still dresses as flashy as ever.

298
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,463
Oh, hey. I was going to…

299
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,137
So you're not taking the job?

300
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,014
I don't really see the need to.

301
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,308
Mostly because I have other opportunities.

302
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,060
Yeah, you better pass.

303
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,731
I heard a gig would take you
out of the country for way too long.

304
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,357
If you take it, you'll miss the wedding.

305
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,528
What wedding?

306
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,615
Matrimony? Next month.

307
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,117
Finally doing it.

308
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,077
Just gotta tell Ji-sun first.

309
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,331
So you haven't even gotten around
to telling the bride

310
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,665
about the wedding next month?

311
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:17,836
Ji-sun has wanted to get hitched
for a while, but I kept getting cold feet.

312
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,630
We've been arguing
and bickering constantly,

313
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,008
and I'm just done fighting over it.

314
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:26,011
So I made up my mind, and it's happening.

315
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,679
Aren't you proud?

316
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,141
How on earth could I be proud
when she doesn't even know

317
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,476
what you're doing?

318
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,770
Please be proud, Ho-jin.

319
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,398
Hmm? You're the only sane person
in our family after all.

320
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,233
I mean it.

321
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,487
You're the only one I'm not embarrassed
to introduce Ji-sun to.

322
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,280
Please, Ho-jin. Do your big bro a solid.

323
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,660
You are embarrassing, Jin-suk.

324
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,248
I mean, which thrift store
did you get that from?

325
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,167
My scarf?

326
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,086
Doesn't it look nice?

327
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,672
Not at all.
It clashes with the rest of your clothes.

328
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,217
Really? It does?

329
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,927
- It'll match yours, maybe.
- Not interested.

330
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,847
And by the way, the little robot vacuum
you took from me? Give it back.

331
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,057
No, no, no, not him!

332
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,976
We already bonded,
and I even named him "Alberto the Third."

333
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,645
What are you talking about?

334
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,357
And all I have to do is tell him "sock,"
and he zooms off to bring the sock!

335
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,235
Are you okay? You need a cab?

336
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,445
I'm good, I'm good.
She's gonna pick me up.

337
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,156
Oh, she's here already.

338
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,372
Now, now. You, sh! Hey!

339
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,793
You're such a pain. Take a cab next time.

340
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,130
- Ho-jin, good to see you.
- Thanks for coming.

341
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,756
A gift?

342
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,844
Rose for my rose.

343
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,389
Um, thanks. You're the only one
who got drunk again?

344
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,851
You always seem to have a fun time,
but nobody else is.

345
00:23:55,934 --> 00:24:00,063
Well, today's 'cause you begged me
to try and convince my little bro here.

346
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:00,981
Oh, really?

347
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,649
Well, did it pay off?

348
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,735
They probably were hoping
you'd agree to join by now.

349
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,281
Nah. He doesn't want to.
Doesn't wanna play.

350
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,657
Hey, here.

351
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,908
Ah!

352
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,160
- Peace out.
- Come on!

353
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,327
Hey, take it back! Hey!

354
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,122
It looks great on you, little bro!
Rock it!

355
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,748
- It looks…
- Give it.

356
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,208
It's my scarf.

357
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,462
It was a birthday present from him,
but he wears it more than I do.

358
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,297
I'm sorry. Your present's nice.

359
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,966
I didn't take it personally.

360
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,552
He's the one who's inconsiderate.

361
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,638
I think he forgot
he gave it to me in the first place.

362
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,478
You should get angry
when he's acting like that.

363
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,896
Don't just dismiss it.

364
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,941
'Cause Jin-suk,

365
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,111
he has to be told
that things aren't all right.

366
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,656
Everything's great
as long as he's happy, and then…

367
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,868
Good point.

368
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,038
I can't just keep
indulging his character like this.

369
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,338
Should I punch him?

370
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,551
I could… whip him
or smack him just like this.

371
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,429
Do it. You have my blessing.

372
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,223
Okay.

373
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,641
Na Jin-suk's dead.

374
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,768
Getting whipped with that
won't hurt though.

375
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,855
I shouldn't actually smack him like that.

376
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,941
Hurting him isn't the point.

377
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,027
I just wanna try to scare him
into treating me better.

378
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,783
The team told me you turned down the show.
Sure you don't wanna be part of it?

379
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,537
They probably need you
since they begin shooting next month.

380
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,332
<i>Matrimony? Next month. Finally doing it.</i>

381
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,711
Please reconsider it.
I'm begging you. It'd be so great.

382
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,839
All right. I'll join the project.

383
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,341
Really?

384
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,261
Now I got a reason to say yes.

385
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,555
So count me in. I'll do it.

386
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,778
Mr. Joo Ho-jin!

387
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:18,410
- Good night, little brother of mine.
- See you later! Careful!

388
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,619
Good night!

389
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,802
Ah.

390
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,263
I'm excited to be working with you.
Welcome aboard, sir.

391
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,681
Thanks a lot. It's my pleasure.

392
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,351
We were worried, and we thought
we might have to find another solution

393
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,562
because you didn't wanna be
gone that long.

394
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,064
The production schedule said

395
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,567
the following month
would be in Canada, right?

396
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,651
Yes.

397
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,697
Well, you mentioned
you need to get back to Seoul.

398
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,948
- Does that worry you?
- Oh, no.

399
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,367
I'd prefer being overseas
working and staying busy.

400
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,537
I'm thrilled to be working with you!

401
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,289
The chosen one!

402
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,667
Oh, I believe she's here.

403
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,711
That's great. Perfect timing.

404
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,630
Our lead has just arrived
for her audition.

405
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,924
Since you might translate for her,
swing by and say hello, okay?

406
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,926
So are you still looking
for the female lead?

407
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,512
Because I saw a couple people
on that form you sent over.

408
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,099
Oh, it's someone else. She's brand-new.
We found her yesterday. Last minute.

409
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,100
She's, uh…

410
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,186
She's in this movie <i>The Quiet Woman.</i>

411
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,938
- No one remembers the name, Jeong-su.
- Really?

412
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,900
Do Ra-mi. You know Do Ra-mi, right?

413
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,527
Do Ra-mi… You mean…

414
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,237
Ms. Cha Mu-hee is here!

415
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,624
- Hello there.
- Thanks for coming.

416
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,625
Welcome.

417
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:55,924
This is Mr. Joo Ho-jin, the interpreter
who'll be handling our translation needs.

418
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,426
But, Mr. Joo, you know Cha Mu-hee, right?

419
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,053
Uh, yes.

420
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,682
Mr. Joo.

421
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,309
You know each other?

422
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,727
Yes, we do.

423
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,063
He interpreted her interview
for a foreign magazine.

424
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,899
Really? Well, that's great!

425
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,110
You'll be traveling together
for a long time,

426
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,862
so it'll be a lot easier
if you already know each other.

427
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,364
Wonderful!

428
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:25,078
I couldn't imagine I would end up running
into you again, Ho-jin.

429
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,873
It is just as surprising to me
as it is to you.

430
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,375
Nice to see you, Cha Mu-hee.

431
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,592
I didn't think you'd want to work
on a TV show again.

432
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,969
Yet here you are.

433
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,596
Are you doing better?

434
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,849
Did you start seeing a therapist?

435
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,643
Please.

436
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,729
This isn't the right place for that.

437
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,357
We can catch up
on this subject later, all right?

438
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,277
Ms. Cha Mu-hee,
we're about to start shooting.

439
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,361
Okay.

440
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,492
The writer will be asking questions.

441
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,244
Maybe about five or six at most.

442
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,287
Got it.

443
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,038
Okay, let's get ready!

444
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:21,176
Mu-hee, just talk at your natural pace,
and be comfortable.

445
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,802
It's like talking to a friend.

446
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,181
Look into the camera.
I'll ask a few questions from back here.

447
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,223
Okay.

448
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,689
I'm ready to start.

449
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,694
Cha Mu-hee, do you like to travel?

450
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,363
Oh, yeah. You bet.

451
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,034
I haven't had a lot of opportunities yet.

452
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,954
Still, I like visiting new places.

453
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,587
Quiet on set!

454
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,761
Sorry about that, Mu-hee.
Let's start from the top.

455
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,014
Do you like to travel?

456
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:09,974
Uh…

457
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,060
Tra… Travel?

458
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,064
Travel? Travel.

459
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,607
Oh, yeah. Uh…

460
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,401
I have been looking for opportunities to…

461
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,344
Mu-hee.

462
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,389
Mu-hee!

463
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,144
Uh, my apologies.

464
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,146
Please look into the camera.

465
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,316
And relax. Lighten up a bit.

466
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,820
Yeah, I'm sorry. Sorry, I'm fine.

467
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,115
Let me start again.

468
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:16,791
Uh…

469
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,504
My bad. My bad. Once again, please?

470
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,466
I haven't had many opportunities
to travel, but…

471
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,135
Uh…

472
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,562
Let me do one more.

473
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,113
I'm sorry.

474
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,659
Let's take a break.

475
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,828
She's terrible.

476
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,040
She's not funny at all.
She can't talk and can't focus.

477
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,958
Do Ra-mi is a lot more interesting

478
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,628
'cause the actress
isn't charming at all whatsoever.

479
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,174
I guess she wasn't that bad
in <i>Junprecedented, </i>right?

480
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,762
That's just because
the host did really good.

481
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,598
Let's end the shoot.

482
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,769
Let's explore other options.
Cha Mu-hee's not gonna work.

483
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,438
You believed in her though.
Blackpink levels of popularity.

484
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,190
Well, I was wrong, okay?

485
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,734
How do I send her out now?

486
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,236
She probably believed this was in the bag.

487
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,296
I messed it all up, didn't I?

488
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,715
She hates me. I can tell she does.

489
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,093
Nah, this is nothing more
than first-time nerves.

490
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,804
You'll do great once you get used to it.

491
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,726
By the way, Mu-hee,

492
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,814
did you really not know
he was working this show?

493
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,525
You saw how shocked I was earlier.

494
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,485
I'm not that good of an actress.

495
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,155
Why was Joo Ho-jin even on set anyway?

496
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,618
I asked the assistant director
about that earlier,

497
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,954
and it seems it's a favor to Shin Ji-sun.

498
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,039
Shin Ji-sun the producer?

499
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,583
Yeah, that lady we found
in the comments of his Instagram posts.

500
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,876
I know.

501
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,631
So he's here because of her.

502
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,592
She was the coproducer
of the previous season.

503
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,928
I heard he really didn't want to do it,

504
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,389
but he said yes after they talked it over.

505
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,726
Guess he still likes her that much.

506
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,729
I get it already, so just stop saying it.

507
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,522
Come on.

508
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,822
Should be safe here.

509
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,992
- What did you wanna know?
- Did you get a follow-up?

510
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,702
I can take care of myself.

511
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,164
You already told me
you weren't taking any TV gigs.

512
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,166
Guess that wasn't true.

513
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,209
Did your doctor say
it's okay to take on the show?

514
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,464
You'll be out of the country for a while.
You sure that's not an issue?

515
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,675
Of course not.
It's not an issue if I'm okay with it.

516
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:16,179
But what about you? Do you think
you can handle us working together?

517
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,972
You're not facing your issue.

518
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,099
Admit it. Did you see a doctor?

519
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,102
I feel like I make you uncomfortable,
don't I?

520
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,771
I get why.

521
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,398
So, well, can't you just
quit the project altogether?

522
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,819
I feel uncomfortable when I'm with you.

523
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,239
I shouldn't have translated
your therapy session.

524
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,784
I heard things about you
I didn't want to know.

525
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,703
I feel bad, and I'm worried,
so if you want,

526
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,121
I'm going to quit this show.

527
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,252
But I did…

528
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,839
I saw a doctor.

529
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,934
So, is something wrong with me?

530
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,103
Did my brain get damaged in the accident?

531
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,481
Upon checking your MRI,

532
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,526
it seems there's nothing wrong
with your brain.

533
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,988
However, you're still clearly suffering
from hallucinations.

534
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,282
Something is happening inside your mind

535
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,035
that cannot be diagnosed
by modern medicine.

536
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,249
Then what am I supposed to do, Doctor?

537
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,710
Memory issues would be alarming,
or paralysis,

538
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,629
but these are just visions, right?

539
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,967
You should see a psychiatrist
on a regular basis.

540
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:40,680
I did, but they said to see a neurologist
because it was caused by the accident.

541
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:45,184
And I don't have any problems
other than the Do Ra-mi visions.

542
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,770
Can we please just find
a way to get rid of her?

543
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:54,318
Well, given that we don't know why
those particular visions are presenting,

544
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,571
there's nothing we can do for now.

545
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,284
He said that Do Ra-mi can't be removed
with medicine.

546
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,871
I even tried going to a shaman healer
because I was so frustrated.

547
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,707
But since it's not a ghost,
she couldn't help me either.

548
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,835
Are you happy?

549
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,795
Are you still feeling uncomfortable?

550
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,841
Now please quit this project.
We're done here.

551
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,678
But me quitting
won't solve any of your issues.

552
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,266
You seemed to be struggling on set.

553
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,395
It's almost like you're totally different
all of a sudden.

554
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,189
You're not the Cha Mu-hee I know.

555
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,733
Well, I've changed ever since
Do Ra-mi has taken over in here.

556
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,151
But this isn't going to work.

557
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,738
Then what?
Are you gonna tell the crew on me?

558
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,241
Tell them she's crazy,
and she's haunted by Do Ra-mi.

559
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,076
I'll be kicked off of the shoot
in an instant.

560
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,369
I don't have to do anything.

561
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,122
That's what's gonna happen anyway.

562
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:53,294
Happy trips and exciting romance
is the very essence of the whole show.

563
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:58,216
People won't watch it or feel good
with that sad look in your eyes.

564
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,844
I feel uneasy
when you are looking at me this way.

565
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,306
You finally admit you're crazy,

566
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,809
but… you don't seem like
you wanna improve your situation.

567
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,104
I guess there's no point
in talking you out of this.

568
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,275
Goodbye, Cha Mu-hee.

569
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,861
I'm gonna quit the project.

570
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,783
I owe you my thanks, Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

571
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,535
But are you sure about that?

572
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,915
If you pull out, you'll ultimately
let down the person you love.

573
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,710
This job's the only way to show off
to your beloved Shin Ji-sun.

574
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,922
You really hope
she won't find out how you feel?

575
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,341
I assume you changed your mind?

576
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,517
I mean, you must've already agreed to it,

577
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,852
which would put you in a tough spot.

578
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,563
You're right.

579
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,524
This is a real issue.

580
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,734
I'm gonna have to confront it now.

581
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,363
She's getting hitched soon.

582
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:03,823
And that's it.

583
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,580
I didn't wanna see her get married to him
or plan the wedding.

584
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,292
I tried to find the best way out of this,

585
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:19,088
but that plan was ruined
when I met a psycho.

586
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,017
Fuck.

587
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,069
Mr. Joo!

588
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,324
Hey, sorry. Do you know Ms. Cho?
She's the head writer.

589
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,745
I think they're gonna
kick Mu-hee off the show.

590
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,622
They stopped filming, and they're even
refusing to give us the contract

591
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,458
'cause they didn't like her interview.

592
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,917
Doesn't look good.

593
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,420
So could you put in a good word?

594
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,172
I was about to tell them I'm done.

595
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,673
That's great!

596
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,509
Threaten to drop the project
if they get rid of Mu-hee.

597
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,595
It really seems like they like you.

598
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,847
That's not why I'm leaving.

599
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,350
So don't bother.

600
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,685
But… but…

601
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,936
- Um--
- Mr. Joo!

602
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,650
Why don't we all have lunch together?
Let's talk about the show.

603
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,444
There's something
I have to inform you about.

604
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,613
If you'd like,
we can grab a quick Japanese lunch.

605
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,240
Do you drink?
The company is gonna pay for it, huh?

606
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,118
Let's head out. Let's go.

607
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,954
If Mu-hee's off the project,
so are you. Go team!

608
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,582
- I don't wanna get myself involved.
- Come on already!

609
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,856
Hey.

610
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,316
You getting in?

611
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,277
Now you're talking to me?

612
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,453
Fine. I'm ready for this.

613
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,551
You're finally talking to me.

614
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,138
Such a shame.

615
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,808
You made a total fool of yourself
in front of him.

616
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,729
- Bitch, you crazy.
- Shut up! Oh, shut up!

617
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,065
I said shut up! Enough! Enough!

618
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,779
Oh, fucking hell.

619
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,077
Oh.

620
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,123
I scared ya, huh?

621
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,625
This thing happened.

622
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:46,045
Almost made me lose it.
And you know, for a sec, I did.

623
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,298
Ms. Cho.

624
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,759
You look kind of shocked right now.

625
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,093
Sorry I scared you.

626
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,346
Mm…

627
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,264
You despise me, right?

628
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,435
During the shoot, I noticed
you were all giving me very bizarre looks.

629
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,396
And you!

630
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,150
You were asking yourself,
"Should we get rid of her?"

631
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,487
Do it. Do what you gotta do!

632
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:16,367
I might be bitter about it, but, you know,
I'm not actually Do Ra-mi, right?

633
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,249
Mu-hee.

634
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,270
Yong-u.

635
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,021
Let's go.

636
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,301
Ho-jin.

637
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,927
Can you help me out here?

638
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,221
- Ah, sure.
- I need an extra hand.

639
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:23,434
Can you reach for a book
on the top shelf over there?

640
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,812
It's on the right.
Top shelf. It's a beige cover.

641
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,689
That's it.

642
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,028
Huh?

643
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,281
Uh, what's this?

644
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,952
It's your family photo.

645
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,080
You all may be living
in different countries now,

646
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:48,000
but back then,
you all seemed to get along.

647
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,085
I was only a kid back then.

648
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,464
- The tall one is Na Jin-suk?
- Yeah.

649
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,175
What's he doing in your family picture?

650
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,926
He's still my father's son.

651
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:01,889
My goodness.

652
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:05,100
I don't get how your mom raised
a kid that's not hers.

653
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,228
And your dad,
smiling so innocently like that.

654
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,481
Or Na Jin-suk,
who joined this family photo.

655
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:13,192
Your family's really strange.

656
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,027
What's even more strange…

657
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,237
This photo?

658
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,615
It's Jin-suk's mother
who actually took it.

659
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,741
What?

660
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,371
Uh, oh, for the love of God.

661
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,914
This is way too much.

662
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,749
Sounds like an American soap opera.

663
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,000
Amazing.

664
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,379
So does that mean you'll be getting
together for Jin-suk's wedding?

665
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,424
He just asked me to officiate it.

666
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,677
It's happening next month.

667
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,512
But I said no.

668
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,181
But you'd be a good fit.

669
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,599
No.

670
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,810
I decided a while ago

671
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:51,438
that yours will be
the first I'll officiate.

672
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,652
So, uh… any progress with that actress?

673
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,613
I told you. There's nothing going on.

674
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,117
You can't fool this old man here, Ho-jin.

675
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,911
You just keep trying too hard
to be distant.

676
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,913
Make sure you're more gentle with her.

677
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,083
Wait.

678
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:12,793
Do I come off mean?

679
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,380
To be honest, you usually
come across as mean and blunt.

680
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,382
You sound like "Mr. Always Right."

681
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,303
Since you know it all,

682
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,265
do you know how many different languages
there are in this world?

683
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,644
I believe over 7,100.

684
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,938
Nope. Wrong answer.

685
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,692
It's the same number
as people on this planet.

686
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,653
Everybody speaks their
own personal language.

687
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:44,032
And that's why misinterpretations happen,
and we end up offending one another.

688
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,663
Listen, I know you very well, Ho-jin.

689
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,459
You always sound so clever and eloquent.

690
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,544
But you're too harsh.

691
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,174
<i>People won't watch it or feel happy</i>

692
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,800
<i>with that desperate look in your eyes.</i>

693
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,179
I feel uneasy
when you are looking at me this way.

694
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,308
<i>My words are harsh, huh?</i>

695
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,812
They must be painful to hear.

696
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,776
<i>You've been summoned.</i>

697
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,320
<i>A customer at the restaurant</i>
<i>asked for you.</i>

698
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,696
<i>Could you come over?</i>

699
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,458
Please sit.

700
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,669
It would be a little stalker-y
to go to your house.

701
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,463
I asked to meet here instead.

702
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,557
You saw me freaking out.

703
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,142
Did that surprise you?

704
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,606
The crew hasn't reached out to me since.

705
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,734
That's that. I lost that gig.

706
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,656
Sorry. I'm sorry for what I said.

707
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,492
Don't worry.

708
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,494
I totally crossed the line that day.

709
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,374
I'm really sorry.

710
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:18,627
It wasn't fair of me
to bring up Shin Ji-sun.

711
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:23,090
I wanted to address your weaknesses
because I…

712
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,552
I felt like you knew
all about my darkest secrets.

713
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,307
Are you still seeing her? Your demon?

714
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:33,809
Do Ra-mi?

715
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:39,106
After I flipped out like that,
she just vanished.

716
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,399
She's gone now.

717
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,571
Looks like, sometimes,
it's better to let it all out

718
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,489
than to get sedated with pills.

719
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,369
Still, it's probably not helpful
for mental health.

720
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,705
I should be careful.

721
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,002
And what about your situation?

722
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,589
They decided on the wedding date.

723
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,883
I just don't wanna be dragged
into any wedding events

724
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,968
or get involved in all the family drama.

725
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:18,145
It might be a good idea to be a part
of that show if you still can.

726
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,731
I hear they're still looking.

727
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,525
And they're getting real desperate now.

728
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,818
I know.

729
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,237
They're still reaching out
to see if I wanna join.

730
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,072
Is that so?

731
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:30,866
Good for you.

732
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,701
They dropped me.

733
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,495
You managed to freak everybody out.
Are you surprised?

734
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,872
I'm not.

735
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,041
That was such a good gig.

736
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,168
It would've improved my brand.

737
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,463
Do Ra-mi changed my career so much.

738
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,839
I got lots of offers,

739
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:49,927
but they all wanted me to play
a serial killer, a psychopath, and so on…

740
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,764
If I played all those parts,
my body count would be in the thousands.

741
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,349
Mu-hee the serial killer.

742
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,144
That was precisely my reason to do it.

743
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:03,607
Because the whole point of the show is
happy trips, exciting dates.

744
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,691
Hmm.

745
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:09,237
Oh, and we get to see
the aurora borealis during the trip.

746
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,032
It was always a pipe dream, I guess.

747
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,869
Yeah, it's been one of my dreams too.
It's not an easy sight to see though.

748
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,537
- Right?
- Yeah.

749
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,040
Getting there is kinda difficult.

750
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,045
Oh, that's so disappointing.

751
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,601
- Sorry, I'll be back.
- Sure.

752
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:42,521
Yes, Yong-u?

753
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,856
The aurora…

754
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,278
What?

755
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,742
Yeah, okay.

756
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,580
Yeah, I'll call you back.

757
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,291
Okay.

758
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,514
Yong-u called you?

759
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,516
You should probably go.

760
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:24,062
Um, I… I just booked the gig
we were talking about.

761
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,275
<i>Romantic Trip </i>called Yong-u just in.

762
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,901
It confirmed that I am cast

763
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,237
and sent over a contract.

764
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:34,865
That's…

765
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,576
That's really good.

766
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:38,994
You wanted that.

767
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,122
But

768
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,501
booking it and actually going
kinda frightens me though.

769
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:51,173
I hope you'll have an… interesting
and exciting trip, Mu-hee.

770
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,009
It'll be hard.

771
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:55,594
I'm worried.

772
00:50:56,094 --> 00:51:00,223
You know that Do Ra-mi is still an issue.
She keeps haunting me, and I need help.

773
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,975
I won't be able to make it alone.

774
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,102
In a foreign country
where I don't speak the language?

775
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,438
And no one will help me
with all my issues!

776
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,942
Mu-hee, I'm making an effort to be polite

777
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,611
and keep boundaries with you.

778
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,071
This is what you wanted.

779
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,822
Why are you making me say
things like that?

780
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,699
Because you're mean but honest.

781
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,952
I'm aware that you say all that stuff
'cause you're worried about me.

782
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,710
Mu-hee, you are a…

783
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,964
a very adventurous person
who can also be pretty fickle.

784
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,592
You might say one thing,
then you change your mind again.

785
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,969
Then you take it back and go in circles.

786
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:41,014
And you also have Do Ra-mi
giving you major anxiety.

787
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,644
I can picture you freaking out again,
and I'm worried.

788
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:53,568
You're right.

789
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,530
What if…

790
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,700
I can find a guy to join?

791
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:04,454
Someone who keeps cool
and always goes by the book

792
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,832
to make sure everything works out.

793
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,087
And if maybe he just so happens
to be fluent in many languages,

794
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,463
I should be okay, right?

795
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,759
I can probably get by
if I had a guy like that.

796
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,177
What do you think?

797
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,262
Mu-hee.

798
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,973
Just say what you wanna say.

799
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:24,808
You're beating around the bush,

800
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,477
and you're still getting worked up
and upset about everything.

801
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,606
And I'm not able to understand…
what you really want from me.

802
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,607
Please help!

803
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,569
I'd like you to come with me.

804
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,784
Are you uncomfortable around me?

805
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:45,203
Do you think I'm gonna try
to make you go out with me?

806
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,830
I'm confident that won't be an issue.

807
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,290
Then, let's go!

808
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,960
We might see
the aurora borealis, remember?

809
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,963
Aurora!

810
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,843
Aurora borealis. Green and blue.

811
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,928
You can take nice photos.

812
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,055
The coolest photo of your life!

813
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,265
Aurora!

814
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,942
Okay. I'll join you.

815
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,154
I need a place to hide from everyone.

816
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,908
All right, I'm in.
Aurora borealis, here we come.

817
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,869
Yay! Let's go see
the Northern Lights together.

818
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,689
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?
