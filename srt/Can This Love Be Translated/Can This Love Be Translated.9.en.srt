1
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,411
Let's grab a single on Mu-hee.

2
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,341
- For her close-up though…
- Okay. Great.

3
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,650
When I heard
we were shooting at the opera house,

4
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,443
I wanted to sit right here.

5
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,612
Do you like operas?

6
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,241
I don't know it well.
There's a scene in a film I like

7
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,243
where the two main characters
go to the opera.

8
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,955
Um, do you know the movie
<i>Pretty Woman</i>, starring Julia Roberts?

9
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,500
Ah, I do know that movie,

10
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,961
but wasn't that way before your time?

11
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,463
That's it. That's exactly right.

12
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,591
The leading man in that film
is really rich.

13
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,511
They go to the opera
and get the most expensive seats.

14
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,971
Just like these here.

15
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,890
This is why I wanted to come and sit here.

16
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,066
We need to find out the opera
that's in <i>Pretty Woman</i>.

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,401
<i>- Pretty…</i>
- Please go look.

18
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,694
Okay. Okay.

19
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,487
When we get it, we'll start playing it.

20
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,905
<i>La Traviata.</i>

21
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,580
The opera the characters watched
in <i>Pretty Woman </i>was Verdi's <i>La Traviata</i>.

22
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,796
This music also plays at the end.
It's the best scene, I think.

23
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,860
<i>Amami, Alfredo.</i>

24
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,738
<i>Quant'io t'amo.</i>

25
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,282
<i>Quant'io t'amo.</i>

26
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,784
<i>Addio.</i>

27
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,330
What's that? Was that Italian?

28
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,289
But how?

29
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,874
They're opera lyrics.

30
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,045
Whoa. She memorized them?
What's she saying?

31
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,299
Love me, Alfredo,

32
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,969
as much as I love you.

33
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,141
Good

34
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,352
bye?

35
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,987
<i>Love me, Joo Ho-jin…</i>

36
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,208
<i>as much as I love you.</i>

37
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,712
<i>Goodbye.</i>

38
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:22,762
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

39
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,475
TEN DAYS AGO, JAPAN

40
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,786
Aya-chan, you're brilliant!

41
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,665
Uncle Hiro's been studying lately too.

42
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,709
I'm learning Korean.

43
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,512
But your uncle's so smart
that he couldn't help it.

44
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,982
I'm not the kind of guy who meets someone
simply because they ask me to.

45
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,493
Thank you.

46
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,040
She's one rude woman.

47
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,958
Kissing me without permission.

48
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,171
If she wanted to meet,
she should have said when and where.

49
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,714
Now I'm waiting anxiously.

50
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,222
Aya-chan.

51
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,101
Maybe I've been infected
by a zombie virus.

52
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,275
So are you flying to Italy today?

53
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,695
I just came to give Aya-chan her gift.
Then I'll head to the airport.

54
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,489
How thoughtful.

55
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,991
And how was the shoot? Did you like?

56
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,327
Huh?

57
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,037
Why would I like a zombie?

58
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,790
And those dates are strictly work.

59
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,626
It's not like
I'm actually interested in her.

60
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,963
I was asking whether you liked Canada.

61
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,800
I wasn't asking if you liked that woman.

62
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,970
What's with you?

63
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,933
They kissed.

64
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,522
No. Honestly, it's not like that.

65
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,566
That zombie caught me off guard.
That's all.

66
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,653
I see, and I'm guessing
you fell for her too.

67
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,779
Huh?

68
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,489
Your first love.

69
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,784
The older girl
who was the neighborhood rebel.

70
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:51,911
Like Do Ra-mi.

71
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,122
Why would you bring that up?

72
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,124
It was the talk of the town.

73
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,918
The romance between the rebel girl
and the pretty boy.

74
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,839
Do we have a South Korea-Japan scandal
on our hands this time?

75
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,674
This should be fun.

76
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,176
- This should be fun!
- Right?

77
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,190
Maybe the pretty boy
has fallen for a zombie this time.

78
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,109
- Maybe?
- Right?

79
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,027
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

80
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:30,241
CHA MU-HEE

81
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,175
You're really here this time.

82
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,677
Hiro?

83
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,476
Did we arrive here together?

84
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,522
We've been together all along?

85
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,427
I wasn't here with Hiro.

86
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,762
I was alone.

87
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,100
CALL HISTORY

88
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,352
There's no one

89
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,938
I wanted to be with.

90
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,066
MESSAGES

91
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,192
I'LL BE WAITING.

92
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,653
I did text Hiro to come here.

93
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,369
Do Ra-mi's the one who invited Hiro.

94
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,210
But what he said about me kissing him…

95
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,614
You asked me to come,
but you don't look happy to see me.

96
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,908
Let's look at this objectively.

97
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,080
I flirted with you on the airplane,

98
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,375
and that's why you came all this way.

99
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,335
Hmm?

100
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,337
But no matter what,

101
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,593
these fingers texted you,
and I asked you to meet me.

102
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,804
And these lips,

103
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,556
um, well…

104
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,267
I kissed you with these, uh…

105
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,938
so I have to take responsibility.

106
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,189
Response?

107
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,569
So let me ask you this.

108
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,865
Do you like me?

109
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,664
Do you love me?

110
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,419
No, no! No way! Oh, no, no, no!

111
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:29,920
Oh, no!

112
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,759
I guess my showing up here
gave you the wrong impression.

113
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,094
I only came here to confirm something.

114
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:41,599
I came to see if you'd lied again
and to teach you a lesson if so.

115
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,311
Then that means

116
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,064
you don't like me?

117
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:48,981
Oh.

118
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,399
I don't like you.

119
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,400
Oh!

120
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,943
Oh, thank you.

121
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,445
Oh, this is great.

122
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,323
Of course, there's no way you'd like me.

123
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,741
You hate me. Oh, good.

124
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,536
Hey, then, sorry to ask you
a weird question. Sorry.

125
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,455
Sorry?

126
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:06,832
Actually,

127
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,087
I had debated
if I should go to Italy or not.

128
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,131
If I hadn't seen you when I came here,

129
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,718
I might've turned around
and gone back to Seoul.

130
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,266
Thanks for taking the time to talk.

131
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,687
- Thank you.
- Thank you?

132
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,482
I'll work harder now
because of what happened.

133
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,442
I'll fight hard. Fighting.

134
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,491
You…

135
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,328
Do you want to date?

136
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,288
Oh!

137
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,084
No! Not at all. No way.
No. Never. No romance, ever.

138
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,253
Don't worry.

139
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,673
I don't pick fights I can't win.

140
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,884
I'd be losing by liking you
when you don't like me back.

141
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,928
I will never lose!

142
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,013
Fight!

143
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,142
- Oh, yes. Fight.
- Yes.

144
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,476
Oh good. Fighting.

145
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,478
- Fight!
- That's it. Yes, yes. Fighting.

146
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,604
Fight!

147
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,485
- We should go.
- Oh, I can pay.

148
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,529
I'll take this. Thanks.

149
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,950
In Korea, the one who pays
is the one who asked for the meeting.

150
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,412
Call it a Korean rule. Okay?

151
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,832
I'm sorry, your card has been declined.

152
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,293
What?

153
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,384
Oh no. Wait.

154
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,927
Here you go.

155
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:50,102
Jeez. I'm sorry that my card got declined.

156
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:51,979
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,941
And thank you for the ride, too,

158
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,194
since my phone battery died.

159
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,362
Thank you.

160
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:11,832
Let's go.

161
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,917
Oh.

162
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,486
- Hello there.
- Oh, hi!

163
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,531
- Hello. Good to see you.
- Yes, hi. Good to see you.

164
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,587
Hiro. I have today's schedule.

165
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,797
Could you take a look?

166
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,216
Looks like you'll have a lot of downtime.

167
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,760
Shall we do a costume change
and touch-up here?

168
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,928
Yeah, okay.

169
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,101
- Hello.
- Yo.

170
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,312
Mu-hee, here's your headset.

171
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,981
- Great. Thank you.
- For your ears.

172
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,069
Were you cast in Josh Safdie's new film?

173
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,571
How did you know?

174
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,323
We're talking right now
and taking a look at the script.

175
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,409
I hope we can work together again.
I just signed on.

176
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,495
- Really? That's great. I'd like that.
- I would too.

177
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,747
- This good?
- Oh, yes. Looks good.

178
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,258
<i>Cha Mu-hee, can you hear me?</i>

179
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,848
<i>Cha Mu-hee?</i>

180
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,063
Yes, I hear you.

181
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,733
<i>The weather's good for our first day.</i>

182
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:09,533
When the weather's good on the first day,
it'll stay like this for the rest.

183
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,787
<i>I hope everything will work out</i>
<i>for you while you're in Italy.</i>

184
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,540
I'm grateful…

185
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,836
and happy to be working with you again.

186
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,362
Cameras, stand by.

187
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,956
<i>Let's begin the Italian shoot</i>
<i>of </i>Romantic Trip<i>.</i>

188
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,419
We're starting again here, in Italy.

189
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,507
Do Ra-mi must have worn this
to go out last night.

190
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,989
And she bought this hat?

191
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,125
Oh!

192
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,048
"Lemoncello"?

193
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,301
A lemon liqueur?

194
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,679
I went out drinking?

195
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,894
Are you okay?

196
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,021
Yeah, I'm fine.

197
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,649
Well, I went drinking last night.

198
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,495
This area was a bathhouse long ago.

199
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,123
What is that?

200
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,628
In South Korea,
you buy snacks when you go to the spa.

201
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,880
It's… very popular.

202
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,507
It's called a <i>jjimjilbang.</i>

203
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,424
<i>Mix.</i>

204
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,511
<i>Like a mix. You know? A mix of things?</i>

205
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:27,022
In Canada, they were awkward,
and Mu-hee was sweet and laughed.

206
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,567
Hiro was a bit self-involved.
It was an odd vibe.

207
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,693
But now,

208
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:36,073
they're like two seasoned
traveling buddies reporting on things.

209
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,616
Huh.

210
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,410
How did it change?

211
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,830
- Maybe they're too friendly now?
- Think so?

212
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,251
Is it true Joo Ho-jin is booked off-site
at a place in Italy?

213
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,087
We'll need to process receipts for that.

214
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,965
He's staying at a friend's place
since they're out of town.

215
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,383
He said not to worry about it.

216
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,300
Huh.

217
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,718
It's your fault.

218
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,513
You kept asking him for favors,
Park In-su.

219
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,932
So he decided to stay elsewhere.

220
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,186
Poor Joo Ho-jin.

221
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,148
Uh, he's avoiding me because I'm annoying?

222
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,144
Ciao!

223
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,146
Oh, no. We're closed. I'm sorry.

224
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,773
- We closed already. I'm sorry.
- One drink, okay?

225
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,651
- No. Go find another place tonight.
- Why?

226
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,069
- Tomorrow, okay?
- Hey, no!

227
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,863
Ciao! Ciao!

228
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,869
Ciao!

229
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,758
Looks delicious.

230
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,562
- Bonjour.
- No.

231
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,772
Not bonjour.

232
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,274
- Thank you.
- Well done.

233
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,446
Oh, hi, honey.

234
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,755
I had hoped tonight would be relaxed.

235
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,632
You're here again.

236
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,635
Mm. <i>Bueno.</i>

237
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,466
Oh, hi, honey. Look, it's me.

238
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,884
This is just crazy.

239
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,304
Oh, honey. Accept this. It's great.

240
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,347
Whoa!

241
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,857
That's the one.

242
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,152
There are plenty of hats like that
at Dongdaemun too.

243
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,654
That's enough.
Let's head back to the hotel now. Stop.

244
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,781
- Do Ra-mi.
- This is cute.

245
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:05,782
Cute?

246
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,952
Ah.

247
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,998
Wow, really?

248
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,127
Here. This is for you.

249
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,754
Okay.

250
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,679
That's the hat she bought last night.

251
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,480
Cheers.

252
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,613
This is so good.

253
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,200
It's too much. Stop.
This isn't lemon juice.

254
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,202
Waiter!

255
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,204
I'd like another bottle for the table.

256
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,663
Or maybe two?

257
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,750
Two bottles? You gotta be kidding me.
I wanna go home.

258
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,460
Thank you so much.

259
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,128
They want us to go.

260
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,348
Ah, honey.

261
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,682
Sh. It's late.

262
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,267
Quiet.

263
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:24,027
- I need to use the restroom.
- Sh. Let's try and be quiet. Sh.

264
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:27,906
Is she okay?

265
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,574
Is she feeling okay?

266
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,035
<i>Sure. I'm okay.</i>

267
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,288
<i>Well… I went drinking last night.</i>

268
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,957
Maybe I should have said no.

269
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,877
This looks good. I want one.

270
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:41,962
Let's go.

271
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,298
- I want it!
- No.

272
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,594
Stop. Look at
their business hours. They open at 4:00.

273
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,846
Huh?

274
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,014
I'll wait until then.

275
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,057
What?

276
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,727
You kidding?

277
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,566
Really?

278
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,565
The lyrics from the opera
in that movie you like.

279
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,276
Thank you.

280
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,238
Hey, honey, this is super hard to read.

281
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,741
What does it say?
Write the pronunciations down.

282
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,920
When we're at the opera,

283
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,755
she'll come off as super smart

284
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,466
by saying lines from the movie she likes,
and it'll make her happy.

285
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,136
If you memorize this,
Mu-hee will know it too?

286
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,056
I've told you, yes.
We share the same brain.

287
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,432
We're stupid because she is.

288
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,852
If I become smarter, she will too.

289
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:23,980
That's enough.

290
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,193
Who knows if you can memorize it.

291
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,195
Especially if you drank so much yesterday.

292
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,780
Oh, are you worried?

293
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,240
You're a sweetheart!

294
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,158
Yes.

295
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,411
I'm doing the best I can to be kind
in the hope that you'll leave.

296
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,999
Would you sing these out loud
to help me memorize?

297
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,459
It's too hard?

298
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,003
Want me to make it easier?

299
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,672
Yeah.

300
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,840
Any way you can.

301
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,885
Rote memorization. Repetition works.

302
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,304
Now do it.

303
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,310
Mama… mama mia… ma… ma, ama…

304
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,479
- Ah!
- Get it together.

305
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,731
A… ama, mama… mama mia?

306
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,191
- Again.
- Ow!

307
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,278
I didn't get a proper look, man! Ow!

308
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,404
Okay.

309
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:13,905
Review the paper now.

310
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:16,950
One, two.

311
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,619
<i>Amami, Alfredo.</i>

312
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,289
<i>Quant'io t'amo. Quant'io t'amo.</i>

313
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,582
<i>Amami, Alfredo.</i>

314
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,333
<i>Quant'io t'amo. Quant'io…</i>

315
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,712
Now try it.

316
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,381
<i>A… amami, Alfredo.</i>

317
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,467
<i>Quant'io t'amo. Quant'io t'amo. Addio!</i>

318
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,180
You memorized it.

319
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,516
Now keep repeating it to make it stick.

320
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,772
<i>Amami, Alfredo.</i>
<i>Quant'io t'amo. Quant'io t'amo. Addio.</i>

321
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,399
I memorized it fast.

322
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,445
That's right.
She's good at memorizing scripts quickly.

323
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,448
You can memorize. I'll give you that.

324
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,992
You see a passcode just once,
and you know it.

325
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,664
I want a reward since I passed.

326
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:05,915
Such as?

327
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,131
Why not?

328
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,216
Is it too public here?

329
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,676
Let's go kiss in the dark.

330
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,305
Yeah, sure. Why don't we do it here?

331
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,390
Oh my.

332
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,768
Mm. You're so adorable when you're afraid.

333
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,104
Oh?

334
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,317
Since you see me as cute,
I want to ask something.

335
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,530
Since we've arrived in Italy
and shooting has begun,

336
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,367
Cha Mu-hee has been looking
very happy, so…

337
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,619
so why are you still here?

338
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,248
Hmm…

339
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,171
It's a way to keep seeing you.

340
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,299
Don't joke with me.

341
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,467
You're not even cute.

342
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,139
Oh, you want me to say something not cute?

343
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,601
She can recall all of it.

344
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,727
The accident back then.

345
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:10,897
Accident?

346
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,402
I don't remember anything about it.

347
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,571
Even how my parents died.

348
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,410
The truth is, she saw it
and remembers every detail.

349
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,995
She lies and pretends
she doesn't know anything.

350
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,041
She pretended to smile
when she was little to hide her sadness.

351
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,711
They found it freaky
and weird and hated her.

352
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,928
I could tell you what Mu-hee doesn't know.

353
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,306
Before I went to your house that night,

354
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,893
I confronted her relatives.

355
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,020
You saw her family?

356
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,442
Yes, I dropped a few major F-bombs
in front of God.

357
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,536
Ho-jin, lighten up.
I didn't drop real bombs.

358
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,955
Don't take it literally. I didn't swear.

359
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,750
It was a Catholic church,

360
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,460
so I couldn't swear.

361
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,627
I wanna go to heaven.

362
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,760
And don't say she better be thankful
her family took her in.

363
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,887
She's been saying that her whole life.

364
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,139
I had a right to tell them off.

365
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,453
What's this? Forcing me to repent?

366
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,789
It's the kindness you want.

367
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,749
Just take it.

368
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,584
Way to go.

369
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:01,966
Let's go.

370
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,371
Kindness makes me wanna kill you.

371
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,211
She's becoming more violent.

372
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:44,175
<i>"I felt like I might die</i>
<i>if someone was kind to me."</i>

373
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,011
<i>"For whatever I've done wrong,</i>

374
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:51,224
<i>it felt like kindness might kill me."</i>

375
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,773
Kindness can be scary.

376
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,986
If you believe
it's going to end eventually,

377
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,739
there's nothing more terrifying
than kindness.

378
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,751
<i>Amami, Alfredo.</i>

379
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,755
<i>Quant'io t'amo.</i>

380
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,300
<i>Quant'io t'amo.</i>

381
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,218
<i>Addio.</i>

382
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,182
What's that? Was that Italian?

383
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,309
But how?

384
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,644
They're opera lyrics.

385
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,315
Love me, Alfredo,

386
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,610
as much as I love you.

387
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:47,822
Good

388
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,033
bye?

389
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,707
Oh, what does that mean?

390
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,626
They're opera lyrics.

391
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,669
"Love me, Alfredo,

392
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,840
as much as I love you. Goodbye."

393
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,721
Whoa.

394
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,058
I just spoke Italian,
and I was speaking it right?

395
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,518
Yes. That's what happened.

396
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,730
So cool!

397
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,736
You must really love that movie.

398
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,783
Next time, let's go see
that opera you memorized

399
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,409
from these seats.

400
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,792
He wants to see the opera
in the movie you like.

401
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,461
Maybe you can see it together sometime.

402
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,131
Wonderful. Yes. I look forward to it.

403
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,028
That was easy.

404
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,991
One line, and he wants to date me
and see an opera from a film.

405
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,742
You don't like operas.

406
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,787
Watching something in a language
you don't understand

407
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,539
will make you fall asleep.

408
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,501
You've seen that opera before? With who?

409
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,922
She wants to know.

410
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,298
Not me. Cha Mu-hee.

411
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,633
Really?

412
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,344
She'll need to ask me herself
if that's true.

413
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,264
She's too embarrassed to be near you.
She can't talk to you.

414
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,307
She talked to me all day.

415
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,185
That's 'cause you're her translator.

416
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,563
You know she's good at that.

417
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:47,567
She says, "Ho-jin!"
Then she says anything that comes to mind.

418
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,068
She can't talk right now.

419
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,697
Joo Ho-jin.

420
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,908
Who did you see that opera with?

421
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,618
What's that?

422
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,455
A camera for pictures.

423
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,915
I have no idea how to use it,
but it cost a lot.

424
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,043
Did you use Mu-hee's credit card?

425
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,461
No, it's Hiro's.

426
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,129
Oh.

427
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,089
Why would you have that?

428
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,258
I stole it. That's why.

429
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,222
Did I mishear you?

430
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,309
P… please tell me
you didn't steal anything.

431
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,728
Yeah, I did.

432
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,024
Why would you do that?

433
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,111
This way, Hiro owes her a huge favor.

434
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,491
The camera is his prized possession.
When he sees it's missing, he'll get sad.

435
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,910
She'll find it super fast,
and he'll be grateful.

436
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,620
It won't end with the opera.

437
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,331
Here. Take it for now.

438
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,499
<i>I'll </i>keep it?

439
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,750
You're here to help her.

440
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,337
Keep an eye out and see when
it'll be good for her to find it.

441
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,588
No way.

442
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,673
You want me to lie and cover your theft?

443
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,800
I won't. I refuse.

444
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,140
What will we do, then?

445
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,143
The police could get a call from him.

446
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,687
What about the security camera?

447
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,107
They'll see me in it.

448
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,860
She might get cuffed
and sent to the station.

449
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,612
You don't want that? Do you?

450
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:24,330
Tomorrow's a day off,
so please raise your glasses.

451
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,706
- To the crew!
- Cheers!

452
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,624
Let's drink!

453
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,209
Cheers!

454
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,212
You said Hiro isn't around tomorrow night?

455
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:36,092
He was invited to a photography exhibit
around here by a friend of his, I believe.

456
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:39,178
Mm. Makes me so jealous.

457
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,973
Oh! We'll have to have our own party.

458
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,475
Yong-u can find
a trendy restaurant for us.

459
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,810
Ji-sun, where's your ring?

460
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:47,687
Oh.

461
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,273
Did you lose it or something?

462
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,858
No, I've got it.

463
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,193
I just take it off when I wash my hands.

464
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,781
You scared me. Be careful not to lose it.

465
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,576
I lost mine once,
and I almost got divorced.

466
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,790
Oh, honey. Seriously? You need to help me.

467
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,042
Put the camera back before you get caught.

468
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,961
No way.

469
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,754
I wanna act like I found it.

470
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,469
What is it?

471
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,475
What? You're cuddling?

472
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,896
Stay still. Don't move.

473
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,108
Right foot.

474
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,402
Move your right foot.

475
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,404
Left foot. Okay.

476
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,033
- This is all so yummy.
- Mm. It melts in my mouth.

477
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:44,911
So good.

478
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,955
Wait. Is that Joo Ho-jin?

479
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,081
Huh?

480
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,625
Joo Ho-jin?

481
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,711
That's him.
Yes, he was wearing that coat today.

482
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,048
That was really Ho-jin?
There was someone else.

483
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:00,509
It definitely looked like
a young woman under his coat.

484
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,596
- She must be pretty.
- Maybe she's Italian?

485
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,807
Please, let's hope they didn't see us.

486
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,784
No cuddling. Come on.

487
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,118
Enough.

488
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,539
Things will get more awkward
if she ends up in jail!

489
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:35,169
Honey, we need to protect her.

490
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,928
She's nothing but a thug.

491
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,307
<i>We're going to where we filmed yesterday.</i>

492
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,101
<i>He might have lost</i>
<i>something important there,</i>

493
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,936
<i>so we all have to look for it.</i>

494
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:04,782
Huh?

495
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,786
- I found this.
- That's just the lens cap.

496
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,162
Keep looking.

497
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,456
Let's find it tonight.

498
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,680
I'll look over there, okay?

499
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,015
Okay.

500
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,540
Why am I doing this for her?

501
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,593
She took my photo.

502
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,306
No, the lens was covered the entire time.

503
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,224
Or was it?

504
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,938
She fiddled around with it.

505
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,192
Just think. It was on.

506
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,943
Or was it off?

507
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,614
I found it!

508
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,284
Here it is!

509
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,664
I'll take it to the lobby.

510
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,758
I found it!

511
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,219
Oh!

512
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:54,767
Oh.

513
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,937
Wha… uh…

514
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,773
You found it?

515
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,274
Let me look.

516
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,237
Um, this is… good.

517
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,405
Looks fine.

518
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,322
This too.

519
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:10,825
Checks out.

520
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,035
Nothing here looks broken.

521
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,580
Oh, um, great.

522
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,999
Glad it's not broken. Good.

523
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:25,673
Um…

524
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:30,136
<i>She's too embarrassed</i>
<i>to be near you. She can't talk to you.</i>

525
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,432
Let's talk…

526
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,144
about operas.

527
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,859
So <i>Carmen </i>is less, well, boring
than <i>La Traviata</i>.

528
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:50,531
I zoned out while watching <i>La Traviata,</i>
but <i>Carmen </i>was very good.

529
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,159
Is that so?

530
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,664
But <i>Carmen </i>isn't the opera
in <i>Pretty Woman</i>.

531
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,542
Ah.

532
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,587
Then just go see that.

533
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,797
The person I went with really liked it.

534
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,259
Anyway, I'm glad you found the camera.

535
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:13,971
Wait a sec.

536
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,232
Who was that person with you?

537
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,695
Well,

538
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:33,199
is the person you saw it with kinda…

539
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,701
kinda like me? I mean, maybe?

540
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,621
We just might like
the same types of things?

541
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,171
I went with an author
I worked with on the project.

542
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,465
It was a book about operas.

543
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,092
His age was

544
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,929
about 50 or so. He was a man.

545
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,390
What do you think?
You and my friend can have the same taste?

546
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:00,893
Yes.

547
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,354
I bet we can.

548
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:06,232
Yeah, sure. I'm like a middle-aged man.

549
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,318
That's good.

550
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,279
The opera will be to your taste.

551
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:21,038
We haven't talked like this in ages,
but I hear your voice every day.

552
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:25,584
I've kept an eye on you this whole trip.

553
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,175
Oh.

554
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,428
You mean you've seen me on the monitors?

555
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,768
- How's the hotel you're staying at?
- Mu-hee, where are you?

556
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,709
Did you find it?

557
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,419
You found the camera?

558
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,546
Here.

559
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,884
This is really precious to me.

560
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,346
Thank you for finding it.

561
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,265
I'm very thankful.

562
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:24,810
Don't say thank you.
It's all right. I got you.

563
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:25,894
Everyone looked for it.

564
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,772
She said, "It's okay.
We all found it together."

565
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,499
<i>You've seen that opera before?</i>

566
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,585
Who was that person with you?

567
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,840
I guess I ended up talking to her.

568
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,428
Do Ra-mi did it deliberately

569
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,472
by stealing the camera?

570
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,436
<i>La Traviata will be playing here soon.</i>

571
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,775
I'd like to get tickets to it.

572
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,526
But before I do,

573
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,403
I'd like to ask you something.

574
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:21,825
Last night,

575
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,411
I saw you were out with a woman.

576
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,417
I saw you as well and ducked,
but you must have spotted us.

577
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,213
Were you able to see who I was with?

578
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:36,965
No, I wasn't.

579
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:41,261
Everyone I was with
thought it was your Italian girlfriend.

580
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,057
I did catch a glimpse of her shoes.

581
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,688
<i>She was wearing the same ones Mu-hee wore</i>

582
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,564
when she was filming yesterday.

583
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,821
Were you with her? Was that Mu-hee?

584
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:02,950
No, it wasn't.

585
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,536
That person's someone else entirely.

586
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,162
No one knows her.

587
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,503
Very well, then. Sorry.

588
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,737
This is the photographer
who took Hiro's photos when he started.

589
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,575
The camera we were looking for
was a gift from her

590
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,202
to congratulate him
on his accomplishments.

591
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,205
It's a gift with a lot of memories
for him, so thank you.

592
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,375
Yes, I'm so thankful it was found.

593
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,046
I heard you were the one who found it.

594
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,673
Thank you.

595
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,508
Oh, you're welcome.

596
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,720
So how's your trip to Italy with Hiro?

597
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:05,888
Was it fun?

598
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,184
If it weren't
for my exhibition, I'd want to join too.

599
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,394
But I guess I can't since it's a shoot.

600
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:18,025
Hmm. Do we think we need
to save Mu-hee from her?

601
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,154
I'm sure Hiro and Mu-hee don't care.
They've been hitting it off.

602
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,323
I wouldn't worry about that chick.

603
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,825
- There's booze there!
- With free-flowing champagne!

604
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,368
Ooh, let's go!

605
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,295
Do you want some champagne?

606
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,550
Mm.

607
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,855
There's a problem at the winery.

608
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,066
It's urgent.

609
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,318
What's the matter, Mr. Park?

610
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:04,071
There, uh, might be
a fire at our location.

611
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,324
Apparently, they canceled everything.

612
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,159
Our winery is impacted as well.

613
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,328
Then what can be done about it now?

614
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:14,081
I'm afraid we'll need to look
for another spot to shoot.

615
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,167
An olive farm, for instance,
or a superstore that sells wine.

616
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,715
He says there aren't any wineries
available for us.

617
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,844
Oh, I know a guy who operates
a travel booking site.

618
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,387
Wait a sec.

619
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,598
I read an essay that your fiancé wrote

620
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,894
about an acquaintance of his
who operates a large winery in Italy.

621
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:36,895
Uh…

622
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,481
Yes. I know her.

623
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,276
Call him. It's so urgent.

624
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,777
Ask for the show, please.

625
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,572
- It's our only hope.
- Please, Ji-sun.

626
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,208
Ah, hello?

627
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,711
Yeah, it's me.

628
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,297
I hope it works out. It would be great.

629
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,091
- What's taking so long?
- This needs to work out with Ji-sun.

630
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,050
Please!

631
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,598
It's done. The owner said
we can make our way there.

632
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,600
Oh, there is a God!

633
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,268
He's our savior!

634
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,687
My Ji-sun, your fiancé saved us all today!

635
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,565
I thought I was gonna die from stress.

636
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,859
- I need a drink.
- Oh, I need one too.

637
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,111
This is yours.

638
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,530
You were stressed too.

639
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,991
Uh, thank you.

640
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,514
You invited a Korean reality TV crew
to film here?

641
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,642
I couldn't say no.

642
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,311
It's a chance to see my boy again,
so that's why I said yes.

643
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:01,855
In that case,

644
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,816
it'll be nice for you
to see your son again.

645
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,276
Yes.

646
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,779
But, uh, I'm also scared.

647
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,740
It's been many years,
and I've hurt him very deeply.

648
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,921
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

649
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:30,258
So you came alone today.
Why is your girlfriend not with you?

650
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,304
You thought she was my girlfriend?

651
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,891
Well, yes. You both looked so in love.

652
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,185
Or was I mistaken?

653
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,062
Yes.

654
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,982
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Ah.

655
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,401
Then she won't join you here anymore?

656
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,153
That's too bad.

657
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,614
I was hoping today,
I'd get my lucky seven.

658
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,575
What do you mean?

659
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,375
Every time she came here,

660
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,918
she drew one of these.

661
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,422
These are

662
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,882
four-leaf clovers.

663
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,136
I recognized her. I know she's famous.

664
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,723
I've seen her in some interviews,
but I didn't wanna bother her,

665
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,641
so I pretended not to recognize her.

666
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,019
I haven't told anyone she's been here.

667
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:23,895
I appreciate that.

668
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:28,400
I thought I might ask her for an autograph
once she gave me a seventh clover,

669
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,402
but I didn't get it.

670
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,406
She must really want her wish to come true

671
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:37,242
if she's collecting
so many four-leaf clovers.

672
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,665
She thinks that if she just keeps
on collecting more of these,

673
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:47,711
all of her wishes
will finally be fulfilled.

674
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,844
Wow, I get so anxious
when I meet someone new.

675
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,638
Oh, where's Yong-u?

676
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,151
The Northern Lights.

677
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,011
You know, I am

678
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,472
seeing the aurora borealis thanks to you.

679
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,199
I miss it so much.

680
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:58,568
I could have sworn the zombie was crying.

681
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:01,988
What's up with her?

682
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:13,375
MS. CHA MU-HEE
HONEY

683
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,510
She's supposed to be at the gallery.

684
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,844
Ho-jin!

685
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,331
Cha Mu-hee?

686
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,005
Did you think I was her?

687
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,553
You need to go to the gallery.
Why did you show up again?

688
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,763
It's only because I missed you, honey.

689
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,560
Oh, the party today was so fun.

690
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,520
The camera going missing worked.

691
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:19,232
It's because I laid the groundwork
with the love confession opera song.

692
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,360
Thanks to my guy.

693
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:26,197
In that opera, it's not a confession.
It's about leaving.

694
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:29,576
Huh?

695
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,579
Wait, that can't be right.

696
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,622
It's at the end of the movie,
<i>Pretty Woman</i>.

697
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,125
It's a happy ending.

698
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:41,004
It ends with them kissing in love,
so they wouldn't play a goodbye song.

699
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,505
Making out isn't a tragedy.

700
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:45,633
Well, I think it means
the happy ending isn't actually real.

701
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:48,845
In <i>La Traviata</i>, the aria is sung
just before the lovers part ways,

702
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,138
and then the woman dies.

703
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:52,849
So

704
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,311
the ending she believes to be true

705
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,605
was only a delusion?

706
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,527
In reality, she'll never, ever be happy?

707
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,905
It's also wrong to believe
you'll never, ever be happy.

708
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,200
You said it's impossible for her. Right?

709
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,746
Do Ra-mi, you have to let go of this

710
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,374
if you want a happy ending
that exists for real.

711
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,172
To finally get a happy ending,

712
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,299
I'll have to stop
meeting you this way, honey.

713
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,178
This setup is part of her delusion.

714
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,266
How is this an aspect of her delusion?

715
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:41,064
I told you I was doing what she really
wanted to do, but couldn't.

716
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,818
Honey, I keep coming to see you…

717
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,155
because she really wants to see you.

718
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,117
That's the truth.

719
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,578
She still has feelings for you.

720
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,626
You said from the start

721
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,212
that you've been manifesting because

722
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,506
she's afraid her secret
will be discovered.

723
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:08,633
That's right.

724
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,427
And it's you, Joo Ho-jin.

725
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,512
She's mostly afraid
that you'll find out the truth.

726
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,810
Then, I'm one of the reasons

727
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:20,937
you've appeared?

728
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:30,738
Let me also tell you another thing
Mu-hee could never, ever say to you.

729
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:34,534
As a kid,

730
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,953
she saw her mom and dad die,

731
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:40,290
even though she's always been pretending
she has no memory of it.

732
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,750
This is because…

733
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,802
…her mom murdered her dad,

734
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,638
then tried to kill her too.

735
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,523
She pretends she's forgotten everything,
but that's not true.

736
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:06,774
She knew

737
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,570
a child who witnessed
these horrible things

738
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,946
could never, ever find love.

739
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,161
That's why she became this crazy psycho.

740
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,455
She's terrified, walks on eggshells.

741
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:21,748
She thinks people hate her,

742
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,751
which has her go back and forth,
making up stupid lies.

743
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,712
She desperately wants to be loved,
then believes she never can be,

744
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,172
so she runs away.

745
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,425
She does have a crush on you too.

746
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:35,261
She pushed you away
'cause she didn't think she could do it,

747
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,764
but she wants you to keep liking her too.

748
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,141
Crazy psycho.

749
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:16,135
Ho-jin, you're a very kind, honest man…

750
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,809
with that pure heart of yours.

751
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,603
Leave this girl.

752
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,816
Then I can go away.

753
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,947
When you leave her…

754
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,076
and the painful delusion vanishes…

755
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,831
she'll be fine again.

756
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,376
That's our happy ending.

757
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,978
Just love me, dear Ho-jin.

758
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,025
Just like I love you.

759
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:17,947
Goodbye.

760
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:26,497
<i>Every time I fall into your embrace </i>

761
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,833
<i>I feel like </i>

762
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:35,673
<i>It's the place</i>
<i>I've always wished and dreamed of </i>

763
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,260
<i>Something's changed </i>

764
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,471
<i>When you smile </i>

765
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:46,726
<i>I would stay forever and more </i>

766
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,394
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

767
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,980
<i>Until you find out…</i>

768
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:06,871
<i>I'm not hiding anymore…</i>

769
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,558
<i>Someday…</i>

770
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:45,284
<i>When you're calling my name</i>

771
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:50,998
<i>There's only you and me </i>

772
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:58,798
<i>Just like my dreams come true…</i>

773
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:58,524
<i>Every time I fall into your embrace</i>

774
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,943
<i>I feel like</i>

775
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:08,034
<i>It's the place</i>
<i>I've always wished and dreamed of…</i>
