1
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:14,305
<i>Well, I don't know</i>
<i>who I'll be traveling with yet.</i>

2
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,058
<i>They wouldn't tell me anything.</i>

3
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,982
<i>The mystery makes this trip</i>
<i>that much more thrilling.</i>

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,361
<i>It's as if something</i>
<i>that only happens in a movie</i>

5
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,071
<i>is happening to me.</i>

6
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:34,576
<i>Anyway, I'm really</i>
<i>very nervous and excited.</i>

7
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,165
<i>Wow! </i>

8
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,253
<i>Hold on to this. It's hot.</i>

9
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:03,605
<i>The reason every moment</i>
<i>of our journey has been beautiful…</i>

10
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,275
<i>is that you</i>

11
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,944
<i>were a part of the scenery.</i>

12
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,415
<i>where the lead characters</i>
<i>attend the opera.</i>

13
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,836
<i>Do you know the film </i>Pretty Woman
<i>starring Julia Roberts?</i>

14
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,841
<i>Next time,</i>
<i>let's go see that opera you memorized.</i>

15
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,762
<i>It's good.</i>

16
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,555
<i>It's a mix. It's a mix.</i>

17
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,807
Kanpai.

18
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,808
- Kanpai.
- Kanpai.

19
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,482
<i>Oh, it went there.</i>

20
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,781
<i>Beautiful.</i>

21
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,159
<i>So much that I can't look away.</i>

22
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,829
<i>I…</i>

23
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,126
<i>really like you, Cha Mu-hee.</i>

24
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,587
<i>Okay.</i>

25
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,548
<i>Thank you.</i>

26
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,342
<i>Me too.</i>

27
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,192
We did it.

28
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,527
Mm.

29
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,447
That was a first cut.

30
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,533
What do you think? Romantic, isn't it?

31
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,245
Just in case you're worried,

32
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,331
audiences are used to
fake on-screen romance.

33
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,584
No one really expects
any of it to be real.

34
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,919
Unless you start dating
and end up in a scandal.

35
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,213
You two aren't a couple, right?

36
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:58,720
Also, to be clear,
we think the show's in really great shape.

37
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,848
But if you want us
to change some things, we can.

38
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,559
We don't want anyone's feelings
to be hurt.

39
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,229
There's no point in us
taking advantage of real feelings.

40
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,651
I'm fine with it. I've got no complaints.

41
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,363
Wh… what? When did you learn English?

42
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,448
Just now.

43
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,742
Wow, Hiro!
Look at that! Did you hear that?

44
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,087
Well, the truth

45
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,592
is that when I met you for the first time,
I immediately liked you.

46
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,220
And then when

47
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,640
I found out that you were
Jin-suk's brother, I was, uh…

48
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,351
I was embarrassed and felt awkward.

49
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,479
You must have known
that I had feelings for you.

50
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,648
I had to be very careful around you too.

51
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,860
I didn't want you to know either.

52
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,657
Does that mean…

53
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,534
Ho-jin, you… were into me?

54
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,370
I was.

55
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,124
I never had imagined this would be
something I'd share with you.

56
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,128
But since we're comfortable talking,

57
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,465
the zombie film
that felt like it would never end,

58
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,261
it's, uh… it's finally over for good.

59
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,222
The zombie film?

60
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,019
It'll be at least another two hours.

61
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,565
I'll need that long to explain everything
without any misunderstandings.

62
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,652
I should begin with what happened
on that island.

63
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,697
Let's do it. So the photo taken of you

64
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,032
on the island,

65
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,285
Mu-hee was with you then?

66
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,288
Yeah, that's right.

67
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,751
That was actually the day
that she and I met for the first time.

68
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,631
You said you wanted revenge,

69
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,259
so I thought you were going
to ask to change things.

70
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,177
Thanks for saying it's fine.

71
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,096
Don't bother thanking me.

72
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,514
That's not my revenge.

73
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,141
It's a different thing.

74
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,227
Tell me, what is it?

75
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,690
I'm going to "review" everything.

76
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,026
- What?
- Mm.

77
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,277
No, not that.

78
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,363
I'm going to reveal everything.

79
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,284
Okay, about what?

80
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,663
I'm going to spill the beans
and just tell him

81
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,749
that you never had any interest in me.

82
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,334
Tell who?

83
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,461
Are you playing dumb?

84
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,839
That guy who speaks so many languages.

85
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,675
I will tell him everything.

86
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,926
You mean Ho-jin?

87
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,053
Mm.

88
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,429
He knows.

89
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,390
He already knows.

90
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,643
- He knows?
- I told him everything.

91
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,940
And I even… asked him to help
make things work with you.

92
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,195
So wait,
you said everything to the guy you like?

93
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,363
Are you

94
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,156
simple-minded?

95
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,657
No.

96
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,992
I'm not dumb or anything.

97
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,577
I'm just crazy.

98
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,916
Just imagine that I'm like Do Ra-mi.
Totally unpredictable.

99
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,920
I just wanted to tease you,
but you're no fun.

100
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,341
Hiro,

101
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,259
you're amazing.

102
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,888
On screen,
you're even more handsome, you know?

103
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,056
I know.

104
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,479
I kept thinking while we were filming,

105
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,606
how I'd like a relationship
with a man like you.

106
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:43,778
All I'd have to do would be to stand there
and enjoy amazing and beautiful views.

107
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,615
No anxieties. No problems.

108
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,329
Just living happily ever after
with you until the very end.

109
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,292
Yes. That's why Do Ra-mi, uh…

110
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,920
No, that's why

111
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,256
<i>I </i>acted the way I did with you.

112
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,890
It's all my fault.

113
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,977
I wanted you to like me.

114
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,520
I strung you along.

115
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,441
So I'm really sorry.

116
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,402
And thank you.

117
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,904
You were…

118
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,661
the real-life version
of the prince I was dreaming of.

119
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,248
A beautiful escape from reality.

120
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,625
<i>You'll be okay…</i>

121
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,256
Did you get that?

122
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,885
I don't know.

123
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:53,222
- I don't think so.
- Oh, you understood. You did.

124
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,225
You're kind of a genius.
How did you learn English so fast?

125
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,852
You're really great.

126
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,524
When I met you
by the clock tower in Italy,

127
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,195
and when you asked me if I liked you,

128
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:12,283
I've wondered what might have been
if I'd just been honest and said yes.

129
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,162
I regretted not having done so.

130
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,919
- I'm so bitter about that.
<i>- So babe, I promise</i>

131
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:27,840
<i>Forever, I'll never leave…</i>

132
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,550
Hmm. I'm really sorry.

133
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,555
I wish I could understand Japanese.

134
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,147
You're…

135
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,526
pretty dumb.

136
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,111
What?

137
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,993
<i>So stay close…</i>

138
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,871
My mom's picking me up here.
I'm going to go that way.

139
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,541
Okay. I'm going to catch a taxi.

140
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,043
Goodbye, then.

141
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,255
Take care.

142
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,263
<i>So babe, I promise</i>

143
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,683
<i>I won't ever leave</i>

144
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,644
<i>When you're down and falling</i>

145
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,272
<i>Know that I'll be there…</i>

146
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:44,000
<i>Forever, I'll never leave… </i>

147
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:56,596
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

148
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,434
I heard you're looking
to donate some antique books

149
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,644
which belonged to your dear friend.

150
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,479
As you know,

151
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,982
the university's library
would be an ideal place.

152
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,192
I've been talking it over
with your friend.

153
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,155
I wasn't expecting
that you'd want to get involved, Mr. Kim.

154
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,407
- That's great.
- Well, you see--

155
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,576
Oh, wait.

156
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,370
That's not the reason we're here.

157
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,999
I wanted to ask you
certain questions about someone.

158
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,417
Your youngest brother?

159
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,294
Sure.

160
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,131
What would you like to know about him?
He passed away a long time ago.

161
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,800
Did he leave behind a young daughter?

162
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,512
And that's the child you adopted.
Is that right?

163
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,640
And her name is…

164
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,352
It's, uh, Cha Mu-hee.

165
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,858
Yes, her name's Mu-hee.

166
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,904
Well, something does seem
a little bit strange.

167
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,947
My friend over here said

168
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,241
your little brother died
when he was young.

169
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,536
- From a serious illness.
- Yes, you said from a serious illness.

170
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,332
But Cha Mu-hee told me
her parents died in an accident.

171
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,416
Huh.

172
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,212
Well, Mr. Kim, um, how do you know her?

173
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,005
Are you friends with Mu-hee?

174
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,343
Yes, yes.
We've seen each other many times.

175
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,678
We've shared a meal together

176
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,805
and even attended
a musical event with each other.

177
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,349
That's right. We were both there.

178
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,894
Mu-hee was with the grandson
whose mother owns the antiques you want.

179
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,563
- They make a cute couple.
- That's enough.

180
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,857
They're very important to us.

181
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,402
His grandson is like the son I never had.

182
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,445
I have concerns,

183
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,990
and I hope you don't take any offense.

184
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,909
You say you're like a father to him.

185
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,161
Please tell him this. "Stop seeing her."

186
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,872
"Stop seeing her"?

187
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,501
I know she's adopted, but she's now

188
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,378
like a daughter to you, right?

189
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,340
We adopted her
because she's part of the family.

190
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,509
But we didn't want to.

191
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,511
That child was impossible.

192
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,681
We adopted her only because we had to.

193
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,059
I just arrived.

194
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,896
I'm at the station near my house,
but it's already so late.

195
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,232
It's not that late.

196
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,401
There aren't too many people around.

197
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,779
It's past midnight.

198
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,866
Aren't you booked for something
early in the morning?

199
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,577
Are you very tired?

200
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:29,373
Hmm. Well, you were working all day
and started early.

201
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,666
You're tired.

202
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,505
But, uh, didn't you sleep on the train?

203
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,966
Forget it.

204
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,552
Taking a nap on the train isn't real rest.

205
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,848
If you're really too tired,
then it's okay.

206
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,862
I slept enough on the train,
and I've got energy, so here I am.

207
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,864
Thanks for meeting me.

208
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,742
You knew I was here? Did you see me?

209
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,078
You sounded pretty disappointed,
so I figured you were here.

210
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,750
It's because you came back late.

211
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,545
I came to see you
so we'd have time together. Even a little.

212
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,589
Let's go.

213
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,510
Why is your hand so cold?

214
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,470
Were you waiting for a while?

215
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,972
But you were going to leave?

216
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,768
Yes. Um, I hadn't told you I was here,

217
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,728
so I was gonna go.

218
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,189
Cha Mu-hee. Hmm.

219
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,278
Please pay attention.
I want you to hear this.

220
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,534
Even if I never sleep on the train,

221
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:50,079
I always want you to come see me.
That's how much I like you.

222
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,670
Though if I don't sleep for four days,
I might die.

223
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,008
Where do you wanna go?

224
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,761
There's a lookout I wanna take you to.

225
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,436
<i>The birds are flying</i>

226
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,022
<i>I heard it in the sky</i>

227
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,985
<i>Something they want to imply…</i>

228
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,444
I love it here.

229
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,696
Wow.

230
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,489
The view's great, isn't it?

231
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,285
Too bad we can't see the stars better.

232
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,662
Do you wanna see them?

233
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,665
I know of a great place to see the stars.

234
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,710
- It's in Seoul?
- Yeah.

235
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,879
It's called Dark Sky International.

236
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,215
Dark Sky International?
Something like that exists?

237
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:48,262
Its mission is to protect the night sky
from any sort of light pollution.

238
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,723
This was the first Asian country
to be officially preserved

239
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,434
as a dark-sky zone,
so we can see the stars.

240
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,685
Oh!

241
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,064
Is that like the Michelin Guide
giving stars to restaurants?

242
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,566
Yes, yes.

243
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,735
It's a hotspot for the stars.

244
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,487
You can even see the Milky Way from there.

245
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,323
The Milky Way?

246
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,743
I've heard about it,
but I've never had a chance to see it.

247
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,786
- Let's go see it?
- Of course.

248
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,916
We saw the Northern Lights,
and now we'll see the Milky Way.

249
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,752
Oh, I just hope the weather's good.

250
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,670
I'll collect four-leaf clovers.

251
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,839
Yes. Go and do your best.

252
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,216
Ho-jin, I've been thinking.

253
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,510
You're taller than me.

254
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,512
It makes you closer to the sky.

255
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,350
So you'll be able
to see the stars better than I will.

256
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,392
You sure?

257
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,560
Let's check.

258
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,271
How is it?

259
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,107
<i>Ah, cheers, my fears…</i>

260
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,319
- Hey!
- You okay?

261
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,571
- Can you see them better?
- That was fun.

262
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,156
I see them better.

263
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,991
Oh!

264
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,995
<i>So many words are shining</i>
<i>Like the big stars</i>

265
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:01,293
<i>And I pick one from the sky</i>

266
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,712
<i>Stuck in my throat</i>

267
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,340
<i>Round and round</i>

268
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,301
<i>I wanna speak out</i>

269
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,054
<i>But no one's there</i>

270
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,139
<i>Echoes of my voice</i>

271
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,059
<i>Answer alone</i>

272
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,853
<i>Tell me the truth</i>

273
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,690
<i>What don't I see?</i>

274
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,775
<i>Stuck in my thoughts</i>

275
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,444
<i>I walk till I fade</i>

276
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:33,117
<i>I feel the love in the morning sun</i>

277
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,747
<i>But why am I blue all again?</i>

278
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,959
<i>Round and round, my life just goes on…</i>

279
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,754
- Everyone has their glasses?
- Absolutely.

280
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,881
To Ji-sun for breaking off her engagement.

281
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,799
Yes.

282
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,010
Cheers!

283
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,387
There's no need to be embarrassed.

284
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,556
Breaking off an engagement is badass!

285
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,640
I'm a badass?

286
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,518
Even if you break off an engagement
ten times, you're still our hero.

287
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,645
- Of course.
- Don't get divorced like her.

288
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,273
Nothing's wrong with that.

289
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,525
Do you want me to introduce you to a guy?

290
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,236
How about a guy
who owns a building in Seoul?

291
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,198
If you like tall and good-looking guys,
it's a match.

292
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,283
Wanna meet him?

293
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,952
- Ji-sun doesn't need our help.
- Yup.

294
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,456
She's surrounded by so many hot guys.

295
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,083
Ji-sun, you should date a celebrity.
That'd be great, right?

296
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,502
- A good-looking older one.
- Yes.

297
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:31,717
It's okay. There's this one guy I met,
and I already like him.

298
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,968
Really?

299
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,056
Really! He's tall, so handsome,
and much younger than me.

300
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,891
Did I tell you that? He's younger?

301
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,810
- You're a cougar!
- You got yourself a younger man!

302
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,687
Let's go! Do you have pictures of him?

303
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,190
- Let's see.
- I wanna see this young, hot guy.

304
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,567
- You wanna see him? Okay.
- Show us. Let's see him.

305
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,777
Let me show you, then.

306
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,029
- She's gonna show us.
- Let's see him!

307
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,575
Oh?

308
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,702
Kim Yong-u?

309
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,829
But I'm looking at him on the phone.

310
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,414
How's he standing there?

311
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,461
Hello, ladies.

312
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,631
I'm the new guy she's dating.
The younger, handsome boyfriend.

313
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,800
Oh.

314
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,594
- He's so good-looking.
- Well, hello there.

315
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,472
Hot.

316
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,692
- Hey.
- How'd you know I'd be here?

317
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,112
You told me you're meeting
your friends around there.

318
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,072
I did a loop around the whole area.

319
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,366
So then, why did you come over here?

320
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,537
I came to tell you something very urgent,

321
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,747
but it turns out I have great timing.

322
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,504
It was nothing.

323
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,423
I said Jin-suk and I are done.

324
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,635
My friends were trying to be positive,

325
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,387
and I may have shown off.

326
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,304
You know.

327
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,223
Yes, showing off.

328
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,060
It's good for me, hmm,
as the one who gets shown off.

329
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,524
Thanks so much.

330
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,154
What is it? What's your urgent thing?

331
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,078
Ji-sun…

332
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,123
will you

333
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,375
marry me?

334
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,298
What?

335
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,516
Let's get married.

336
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,655
This is amazing! Come on!

337
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,324
Say yes already!

338
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,242
The answer's yes!

339
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,411
- Will you accept his proposal?
- Hey!

340
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,787
- Stop it!
- Marry him!

341
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,456
Marry him!

342
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,957
Marry him!

343
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,375
Marry him!

344
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,462
- She's gonna say yes!
- They're running away!

345
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,505
Go and get married, you love birds!

346
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,591
- Wow!
- Love birds!

347
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,971
It's what I came up with.
I know it's sudden.

348
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,266
I don't want us to break up.

349
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,102
Did I say I was breaking up with you?

350
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,440
I'm getting transferred.
I'm moving to the UK.

351
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,235
I'll be working with an athlete.

352
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,906
I want this opportunity,
so I'm not turning it down,

353
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,533
but I don't wanna lose you.

354
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,954
Do you think without you around,
I'm going to cheat or something?

355
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,289
You wouldn't do that.

356
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,836
I can't ask you to follow me,
so at least marry me.

357
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,837
I won't.

358
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,591
We don't need to get married.
That would be a little rash.

359
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,722
Let's just go together.

360
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,017
Once I'm done with work on the show,

361
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,770
I had already planned
on taking a long break,

362
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,398
at least for a year-long sabbatical
to study abroad.

363
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,275
I was going to do this for myself,

364
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,235
even after I ended the engagement.

365
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,863
I thought about studying overseas.

366
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,074
I could switch my plans to somewhere else.

367
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,993
But you never shared any of this.

368
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,956
Well, I have been wondering
if I should leave or not.

369
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,544
If it would be better to stay.

370
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,547
I wondered if I was overthinking it.

371
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,258
Hmm.

372
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,802
I'm so grateful you thought about me.

373
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,898
Someone told me
you're good at British accents.

374
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,567
I was shocked.

375
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,693
I'm bilingual.

376
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,653
I speak Scottish, my friend,

377
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,822
and I speak Cockney faintly.

378
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,242
How about the Queen's accent?
I think you could pick that one up.

379
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,161
Pleasant day!

380
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,204
Your Royal Highness.

381
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:38,940
I'm sleeping without having to take
any medications, and Do Ra-mi is gone now.

382
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,653
But why has she stopped coming to see me?

383
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,948
I thought about it a lot.

384
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,659
Is it because
I finally shared a big secret

385
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,704
I've been keeping to myself
with someone I really trust?

386
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,540
Could that be the reason why she's gone?

387
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,875
What kind of secret?

388
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,211
Well, it's just a childhood incident.

389
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,672
Is Do Ra-mi from your childhood?

390
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,091
Could it all be related?

391
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,595
She couldn't have existed
when I was a kid.

392
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,640
Or could she represent
someone else from your childhood?

393
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,226
She only came to see you
after the film was made.

394
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:19,022
Could the person you're seeing
be someone who is like Do Ra-mi?

395
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,323
<i>I'm pretty sure it was Do Ra-mi,</i>

396
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,659
<i>but the doctor said it might not be.</i>

397
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,829
<i>You've met her,</i>
<i>and she said her name's Do Ra-mi, right?</i>

398
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,665
She said it all came
from your own mind, Mu-hee.

399
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,168
Maybe she called herself that
because you believed it.

400
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,546
<i>She looked like me,</i>
<i>so I thought she was me.</i>

401
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:46,216
<i>She was also very scary</i>
<i>and always criticized me.</i>

402
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,968
Are you still with the doctor?

403
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,344
No.

404
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,388
I'm buying Yong-u's present.

405
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,766
He's like a little brother to me,
and he's leaving.

406
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,519
- Are you at home right now?
<i>- I am.</i>

407
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,855
A guest is supposed to come over soon.

408
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:00,856
<i>A guest?</i>

409
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,649
<i>Your friend, the writer?</i>

410
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:03,608
Ah.

411
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,611
Not Young-hwan.
I'll say more later when we're together.

412
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,697
Later? Not now?

413
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,365
All right, in the evening.

414
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,212
You could have emerged for many reasons,

415
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,757
but it may have to do with
that dark and sad past of hers.

416
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,802
A deep kind of pain.

417
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,358
Would you have this in a larger size?

418
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,819
- Yes, we do. I'll go get it.
- Thank you so much.

419
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,286
You're buying a gift?

420
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,798
Ah.

421
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,469
I heard your grandfather
had a great collection,

422
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,555
but seeing it, it's even more impressive.

423
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,141
It's much more than what I was expecting.

424
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:22,312
Is there some information
you have to tell me in person?

425
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,022
Ah.

426
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,816
I had hoped to convince you
to make a donation first.

427
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,901
It's for my foundation.

428
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,655
These belong to my mother,
and I can't just donate them.

429
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,865
Ah.

430
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,159
That's what I thought.

431
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,912
I guess Mu-hee has implied
that we had mistreated her.

432
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,706
Well, you must have mistreated her
when she was little

433
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,874
to jump to that conclusion.

434
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,670
We were quite strict with her.

435
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,923
She's a cunning girl
who told us a lot of lies.

436
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,424
She always said whatever suited her.

437
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,469
Sounds like she was clever
and had to adapt in order to survive.

438
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:59,224
She couldn't be honest with you
because she was living in a house of lies.

439
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,227
Mm.

440
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,943
As a child,
you weren't as greedy as you are now.

441
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,279
Suddenly, you're buying things
you can't afford,

442
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,655
now that you're somewhat famous.

443
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,243
I'm not just somewhat famous.

444
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,412
I've earned a lot of money.

445
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,582
I can afford things. All of it.

446
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,626
You remind me so much of her.

447
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,337
Of whom?

448
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,674
As we speak,

449
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,385
your uncle is meeting with Ho-jin
to ask for a contribution.

450
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,180
You will come up in their conversation.

451
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,309
Your boyfriend's family
could be a great help to us.

452
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,520
Don't buy items that you can't afford.

453
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:49,065
Just 'cause it looks like
things have been going well for you.

454
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,196
Hold on.

455
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,957
Mu-hee's mother isn't part of our family.

456
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,880
My brother and that woman never married.

457
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,467
She tried her best to use their kid
to stop him from leaving her,

458
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,803
but when that plan
didn't work out how she wanted,

459
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,598
she made a terrible choice
to try and ruin everything.

460
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,518
That's the kind of genes Mu-hee carries.

461
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,730
It's a shameful part of our history

462
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,732
that we need to keep hidden.

463
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,029
I understand
that you and Mu-hee are close.

464
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,200
I wanted to meet with you
to make you aware of what I know.

465
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,119
You didn't have to come and say all this
because I've already been warned.

466
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,581
Mu-hee has already said everything
I need to know.

467
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,628
That girl told you everything?

468
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,421
My boyfriend already knows.

469
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,006
I told him everything.

470
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,593
You already told him?

471
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,387
Yeah, I did.

472
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,763
I explained it all.

473
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,057
You told him everything?

474
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,353
Hmm.

475
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,983
I knew it.

476
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,737
You do remember everything
that happened to them.

477
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,073
Back then, on your birthday.

478
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:28,081
I said I didn't… that I didn't know

479
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,167
because I was so terrified.

480
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,461
I thought you would kick me out if I did.

481
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,507
Yes, I know everything.

482
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,887
<i>Mu-hee,</i>

483
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,390
<i>happy birthday.</i>

484
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,518
Mu-hee,

485
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,729
have a piece of cake too.

486
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,274
We can all finally be happy together.

487
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,737
<i>She put poison</i>
<i>in her daughter's birthday cake.</i>

488
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,989
She wanted them all to die.

489
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,076
Maybe Mu-hee refused and tried to run.

490
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,537
She fell off the balcony of the condo.

491
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,958
She kept saying
she remembered nothing of that day.

492
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,045
I thought it'd be the best for her.

493
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,548
No, you turned your back on her.

494
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,092
She's been alone

495
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,513
and burdened with these awful memories

496
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,224
since she was little. Her whole life.

497
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,309
I felt sorry for her,

498
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,937
but she's the daughter of a killer
who ruined our life.

499
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,362
This is a photo of her mother
that I've held on to.

500
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,785
I only kept it to show Mu-hee
if she ever asked to know more.

501
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,413
Do you see why being with Mu-hee
is a terrible reminder?

502
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,459
None of it was my fault.

503
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,586
Why did you hate me?

504
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,421
You've hated me for so long.

505
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,051
We were afraid.

506
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,720
You terrified us.

507
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,350
So you remember everything.

508
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,228
So, do you remember your mother too?

509
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,149
Well, then.

510
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,152
You wouldn't forget your mother.

511
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,530
You look at that face every day.

512
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,323
It's there in the mirror.

513
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,494
You've never forgotten your mother,
have you?

514
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,063
My mom…

515
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,029
<i>looked like me, so I thought she was me.</i>

516
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:49,574
<i>She was also very scary</i>
<i>and always criticized me.</i>

517
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,253
<i>That face could only be Do Ra-mi's.</i>

518
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,976
<i>It was my mother.</i>

519
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,729
<i>Do Ra-mi</i>

520
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,148
<i>was my mom.</i>

521
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,488
Finally, you recognize my face.

522
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:31,866
Here.

523
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,202
We can all be happy together.

524
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,245
Eat some cake.

525
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,835
No, please.

526
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:47,173
The little bird died
after eating just a few crumbs,

527
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,716
and Dad died too.

528
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,760
Do you want to be alone?

529
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,556
Why?

530
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,767
There's no one left.

531
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,561
No one in this world
will love you, Mu-hee.

532
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,023
You'll never find love or happiness.

533
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,109
I won't eat any.

534
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,008
Mommy?

535
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,945
<i>I couldn't</i>

536
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,699
<i>completely run away</i>
<i>from my mother that day.</i>

537
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,244
<i>The words she said about me</i>

538
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:02,081
<i>have kept playing</i>
<i>in my head over and over again.</i>

539
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,709
<i>They've followed me everywhere.</i>

540
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,594
<i>So once again, with all of my strength,</i>

541
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,055
<i>and for the very last time,</i>

542
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,349
<i>I have to force you to go away.</i>

543
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,519
One more time to finally make sure,

544
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,855
I will leave you alone

545
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,025
and go away forever.

546
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,661
<i>Mu-hee,</i>

547
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,830
<i>I love you.</i>

548
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,261
Cha Mu-hee? Are you awake?

549
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,370
Oh, you have no idea
how worried I was about you.

550
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,415
You've been here for three days.

551
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,711
Oh, come on. I'm fine.

552
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,256
The doctors told me
they didn't find anything wrong.

553
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,592
Oh, I let Ho-jin know you're good.

554
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,928
He's on his way and should be here soon.

555
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:39,846
Thank you.

556
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:42,890
Hey.

557
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,393
Oh no. I haven't bathed or washed my hair.

558
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,396
It looks like she's back. Thank goodness.

559
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,398
If you hadn't, Ho-jin would have died.

560
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,568
He wanted to stay here,

561
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,404
but with reporters outside
and staff coming in and out,

562
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,781
he stayed home, but didn't sleep or eat.

563
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,169
Hiro!

564
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,963
Ms. Cha Mu-hee is awake.

565
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,215
Really? Is she okay?

566
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,801
I spoke to Mr. Kim Yong-u on the phone,
and he said she's well.

567
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,056
I knew it.

568
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,726
There's no way
a zombie would die so easily.

569
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,479
Oh no. I'm exhausted.

570
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,481
Hey, are you okay?

571
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,527
You've spent three days
going at it with that punching bag.

572
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,739
I was worried you might collapse too.

573
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,116
I won't collapse from this!

574
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,456
Take this off me.
I don't have the strength to do it myself.

575
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,675
Your hands are trembling.

576
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,761
- I'm fine.
- You shouldn't overexert yourself.

577
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,683
This is all that zombie's fault.

578
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,061
When I see her,
I'm going to get my revenge.

579
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,855
Why are you always going on about revenge?

580
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,127
My mother and I look so much alike.

581
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,172
She's not the same person as you,
and you'll never be like her. Not one bit.

582
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,344
I know.

583
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,225
Mu-hee.

584
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,479
I need to tell you
one thing you don't know.

585
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,911
That day,

586
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,332
on your birthday, all those years ago,

587
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,376
a neighbor reported your fall.

588
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,129
So when the police entered your home,

589
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,090
they found both of your parents,

590
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,842
and they saved them.

591
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:08,637
Um…

592
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,434
Your parents are alive.

593
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:21,400
The father you thought had died
is healthy and lives in another country.

594
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:25,029
You've known him as the youngest uncle.

595
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:25,946
He survived.

596
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,828
Why would no one tell me?

597
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,750
Even as a kid,
I never spent much time with Dad.

598
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,545
That's why I don't remember his face.

599
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,255
After what happened,

600
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,966
your father's side of the family
lost contact with your mother.

601
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,594
I know she's still alive.

602
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,933
Why would they lie?

603
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,978
Why would they say both died that day?

604
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,568
Because you said
you didn't remember the incident.

605
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,863
So they decided to cover up everything.

606
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,867
Your father's family kept you in the dark.

607
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,841
They're both alive.

608
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,730
Wonderful.

609
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,607
Wonderful, Hiro.

610
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,943
<i>That was just incredible.</i>

611
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,279
<i>And what you did</i>
<i>with the action sequence is…</i>

612
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:13,697
<i>Wow.</i>

613
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,616
<i>Wow.</i>

614
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,542
I desperately wanted to join this project,

615
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,043
so I shot that in a hurry.

616
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,962
Thank you for your kind words.

617
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,424
<i>Well, I'm very flattered, Hiro.</i>

618
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,801
<i>And I'll be honest,</i>

619
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,886
<i>knowing how popular you are in Japan,</i>

620
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,723
<i>I was surprised</i>
<i>when you asked to audition.</i>

621
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,986
I prepared some words
to say on my own without an interpreter.

622
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,365
Even though I'm a big fan of your movies,

623
00:42:56,865 --> 00:43:00,077
I couldn't even ask
for an audition because

624
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,539
I was scared of being rejected.

625
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,625
But I've learned one thing.

626
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,671
If I don't fight for something
I really want,

627
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,382
I will be left with

628
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,718
nothing but regret.

629
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,178
This time,

630
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:22,433
I will not run away from the fight.

631
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:25,019
<i>That's very touching. Thank you.</i>

632
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,687
You've changed, Hiro.

633
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,440
You've matured.

634
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,427
After what happened,
your father couldn't bear to see you.

635
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,639
We had no other choice but to take you in.

636
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,183
I didn't come here to accuse you.

637
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,434
I let it go.

638
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,272
I'm here to ask you for a favor.

639
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:17,279
My goal is to find my mother,
and Dad is the one who knows her.

640
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,991
He is the closest person to her,
and he would know where she is.

641
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,329
Ask him, please.

642
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,083
He could help me find her at least.

643
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,961
You're planning to see your mother again?

644
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,424
I just need to see her in person.

645
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,344
I wanna be free and let go of all of it.

646
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,972
I understand.

647
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,270
I know, but still,

648
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,439
I can't help but worry.

649
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,026
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

650
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,736
I can always use Papago.

651
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,906
Although everyone speaks English there,
so I won't need to.

652
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,950
I could still go.

653
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:07,246
Just as… as moral support,
if you need me to be with you.

654
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,168
I've said to you

655
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,713
that we can't ever have

656
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,632
a real happy ending together, Ho-jin.

657
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,679
So you offering to join me is sweet,

658
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:28,851
but kind of unnecessary and ridiculous
since we are going to break up.

659
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,774
I don't want us to break up for good,
you know?

660
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,902
So I think that we should…

661
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,075
break up right now,
and we can do it right here.

662
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:55,502
I'll come back and I'll threaten you
and force you into dating me again.

663
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,173
So then, you'll have to give in,

664
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,717
and I'm sure
we'll be happy together forever.

665
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,853
I don't ever give in to threats.

666
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,481
You better be prepared.
I know I can take it.

667
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,566
Yes, I will.

668
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,948
I wonder if she's okay.

669
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,786
Ho-jin? Do you mind
if I take some of these sauces?

670
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,538
They're better than my mom's.

671
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:13,872
Sure, go ahead.

672
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,166
And this one too?

673
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,045
Oh, how about this one? It's so good.

674
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:23,382
- Take them all.
- Do you have a bigger one?

675
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:25,801
It's there by the sink.

676
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,719
- The sink?
- I'll find it for you.

677
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:28,804
No, I've got it.

678
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,308
I know where it is,
so you don't have to go searching.

679
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:36,728
- Found it.
- You did?

680
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,480
- Good.
- It's this container.

681
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,148
- Take it all.
- Hey. There's another thing.

682
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,567
- You can have that too.
- I…

683
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,568
Take it.

684
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,364
You're picking up some weird habits
from Ji-sun, dude.

685
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:50,242
<i>The birds are flying…</i>

686
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,661
Why'd you put that bag here?

687
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:57,165
<i>Something they want to imply</i>

688
00:47:59,001 --> 00:47:59,918
I'll take that.

689
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:04,339
They're books I'll be donating.
The university library wants them.

690
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,134
I have to think about
what to do with the rest.

691
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:11,930
- So many paintings and antiques.
- Figure it out now while you're here.

692
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:16,852
Hey, those pieces are expensive.
I can't sort them out in just one trip.

693
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,688
I'll keep visiting.
It's better if I take my time.

694
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,107
This is a great house,
and you're using it for storage?

695
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:23,817
So what?

696
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,986
Are you planning on selling it?

697
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,654
Are you moving once you get married?

698
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,618
Oh, this one.

699
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,079
May I take this book with me?

700
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,540
- It's yours.
- Really? Thanks!

701
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,959
- Oh!
- What about this?

702
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,502
Could I also take this with me?

703
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,962
Yes, take that too.

704
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,339
It's a first edition Dickens.

705
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,342
- Oh no. You can't take the Dickens.
- Huh?

706
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,593
- Let me have it.
- Give it back.

707
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:52,888
- You've already given it to me.
- Why are you so greedy? Give it back.

708
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,890
You don't even look after them.

709
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,309
- I will, especially this.
- Let go! Hey!

710
00:48:57,392 --> 00:49:00,228
You're playing with my heart.
Just let me keep this book.

711
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,773
You can't ask to keep
a first edition Dickens.

712
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,107
Do you know how much it's worth?

713
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,943
- I love this book.
- Give it back.

714
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,444
- No!
- Please.

715
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,947
Should I sell this house and move away?

716
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,407
Mr. Kim! It's mine!

717
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,827
Cha Mu-hee said she likes this house.

718
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,418
<i>I greet the breeze</i>

719
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,088
<i>And nod to the trees</i>

720
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:31,760
<i>I hear the winds reply</i>

721
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:39,851
So are you spending New Year's Eve
with your A-list girlfriend?

722
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:40,894
Stop it.

723
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:44,439
This year, we've already planned
to celebrate it together.

724
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,983
Do you wanna join us?

725
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,360
- Yes, of course.
- Good. Great.

726
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,823
- Will everyone be coming this year?
- Yeah, of course. They're all coming.

727
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:56,159
- Okay.
- Maybe you can bring your girlfriend.

728
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,619
She's more than welcome.

729
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,621
I can't.

730
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,456
- Why?
- We're not together.

731
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,250
No way, man.

732
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,127
How do you always get dumped?

733
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:09,881
I'm leaving.

734
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,758
Okay.

735
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,427
Drop in a bit later.

736
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,887
- Don't wallow alone.
- Got it.

737
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,986
It was great because I was great.
I'm the best.

738
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,696
- I wouldn't go that far.
- Everyone!

739
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:36,533
Today, we gave the studio our final cut.

740
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,744
<i>Romantic Trip!</i>

741
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,749
We were so close to missing our deadline.

742
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,292
We would have been fined.

743
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,254
My hands were shaking
as I typed the captions.

744
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:50,714
You'll be shaking again.

745
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,467
When the show comes out
and we get the ratings,

746
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,761
you'll have shivers run down your spine.

747
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,597
Whatever the ratings, our show is fun.

748
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,475
Of course you're not worried.
You're off to the UK.

749
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,894
You'll be asleep
when the ratings come out.

750
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,646
- Oh! So good!
- Look at that!

751
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,442
That's why I'm buying tonight.
Drinks for all.

752
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,447
It's been great working together.
I'm going to miss you.

753
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,116
Thank you so much, everyone.
Shall we raise a glass?

754
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,910
- Let's toast!
- To everyone!

755
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,913
- Everyone, cheers!
- Long time no see.

756
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,706
Good. You're here.

757
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,833
- Welcome.
- I heard you finished, and it'll air soon.

758
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,585
- Good work.
- Don't worry about it.

759
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:29,711
We did great.

760
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,215
- Our show is gonna be a hit.
- Yeah, sure.

761
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,675
Drink up. It's on me.
I still have the card.

762
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,802
- Amazing!
- Okay!

763
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:40,514
So you show up like this out of nowhere
and offer to pay the bill for everyone?

764
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,265
Wow, I'm really shocked!

765
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,434
You better not take
the credit for our work.

766
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,228
- I'd never.
- We know him. He will.

767
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,021
And for the next season,
he'll jump right in.

768
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:51,900
This is how he survives in this industry.
Leaves us and comes back when it's good.

769
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,319
- Happy holidays!
- Happy holidays to everyone!

770
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,071
Cheers!

771
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,823
Cheers!

772
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:12,838
<i>You see the ray of light</i>

773
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:16,091
<i>Come down here over me</i>

774
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:24,182
<i>And now you blow a kiss</i>

775
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:28,562
<i>From the palm of your hand</i>

776
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:35,902
<i>The rain is falling down</i>

777
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:41,616
<i>Just gently through my mind</i>

778
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:46,705
<i>We're dancing on the clouds</i>

779
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,373
<i>Don't know how…</i>

780
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,416
<i>Honey,</i>

781
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,377
<i>let's see the stars together.</i>

782
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,255
Will you look at that.
What a powerful threat.

783
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,643
<i>Welcome to our observatory,</i>

784
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,520
<i>and thank you for visiting tonight.</i>

785
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:15,358
<i>This location is the first one in Asia</i>
<i>to be certified by Dark Sky International</i>

786
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,695
<i>as a dark-sky preserve,</i>
<i>which protects the beauty of the night sky</i>

787
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,906
<i>from artificial lights</i>
<i>and light pollution.</i>

788
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,950
<i>Here, you can observe celestial wonders</i>
<i>like the Milky Way</i>

789
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,703
<i>and see shooting stars</i>
<i>just with the naked eye.</i>

790
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,539
<i>As the lights go out</i>
<i>and the darkness settles,</i>

791
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,124
<i>your eyes will adjust slowly,</i>

792
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,336
<i>and the stars will begin</i>
<i>to appear one by one.</i>

793
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,881
<i>We hope you share this beautiful,</i>
<i>unforgettable evening</i>

794
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,467
<i>here at our observatory</i>
<i>with someone special.</i>

795
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,020
Have you come here to see the stars?

796
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,620
I need you to do
a good job translating for me.

797
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:12,666
He could be mad at me
because I got here late.

798
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,627
Please translate with all your heart.

799
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,258
I've missed you a lot.

800
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,678
<i>I've missed you a lot.</i>

801
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:29,140
Ah. He doesn't like German.

802
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,477
How about Japanese?

803
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,733
I've really missed you.

804
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,737
<i>I've really missed you.</i>

805
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,117
He still doesn't understand?

806
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,253
I really missed you, Ho-jin.

807
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,506
I missed you so much, honey.

808
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:14,436
Hmm.

809
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,648
Why aren't you speaking?
You must understand.

810
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,236
You're not saying anything.

811
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,240
Are you angry, Ho-jin?

812
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,581
I'm just at a loss for words.

813
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:35,957
I couldn't find any.

814
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,337
Have you come to see the stars?

815
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,262
I also have a bouquet of clovers.

816
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,892
This is so we'll have good weather.

817
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,527
If you're mad, please go ahead and swear.

818
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,655
Swear if you don't wanna talk to me.

819
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,659
Or you can use
a language that's universal.

820
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,163
I will.

821
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:17,499
It's a good option.

822
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,126
That will work.

823
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,043
<i>Finally,</i>

824
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,464
<i>our happy ending is here.</i>

825
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,216
<i>Hold on.</i>

826
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,802
<i>Let's change the music</i>

827
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:57,140
<i>because our ending is perfectly happy.</i>

828
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,782
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

829
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:16,970
<i>Bring me all your love</i>

830
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,565
<i>Bring me </i>

831
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:17,655
<i>All your love</i>
