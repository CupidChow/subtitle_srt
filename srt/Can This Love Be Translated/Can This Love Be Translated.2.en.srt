1
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,564
Are you available, sir?

2
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,274
Yes, sir. Good evening.

3
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,317
Please let me get that.

4
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,778
- Whoa, you have a lot. Oh, careful.
- Yes.

5
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,656
You must've been on a long trip
for quite a bit of time.

6
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,325
- I'll grab that.
- I've been away for three months.

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,994
The weather's gotten a lot warmer.

8
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,456
Oh, it's so hot these days.
I guess it's expected this time of year.

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,457
Leave it.

10
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,626
A famous guy has just arrived.

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,545
Sir, over there.
He looks like a celebrity.

12
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,089
I gave a ride to someone well-known.

13
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,425
You know Lee Jung-jae?
The guy who starred in <i>Crooks?</i>

14
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,509
Ah, yes.

15
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,386
His son's a handsome guy.

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,890
Lee Jung-jae was going on
about him being a singer or an actor.

17
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,476
Yet when looking at his face,
his son's just not handsome enough.

18
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,977
He doesn't have it.

19
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:01,895
Ah.

20
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:05,023
Have you been around a celebrity
in real life, sir?

21
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,365
<i>Now you're wondering what role I played.</i>

22
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,618
I get it. It was a small part.

23
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,621
A person with no luck,
who's never had love or success.

24
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,289
Let's bet for real?

25
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,875
<i>I win the bet, you follow me.</i>

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,142
LOTS OF NEW EXPERIENCES
ON SET FOR THE QUIET WOMAN!

27
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,143
Oh.

28
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,312
She's shooting a new movie.

29
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,022
CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU ALL TO SEE IT

30
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,864
CHEESE CATS I MET ON THE STREET

31
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,581
She shared that picture
without asking for permission.

32
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,252
"Papago."

33
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,254
"I'm thankful to him."

34
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,177
9,999 FOLLOWERS

35
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,428
Okay, then.

36
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,472
FOLLOWING

37
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,390
10,000 FOLLOWERS

38
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,933
10,000?

39
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,519
Did I make that happen?

40
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,485
<i>This is Papago.</i>

41
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,363
<i>As per the terms of our bet,</i>
<i>I'm following you.</i>

42
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,532
<i>Sorry for leaving you like that.</i>

43
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,325
<i>Good luck with filming.</i>

44
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,495
<i>I hope you get your big break</i>
<i>and your festival begins.</i>

45
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,666
Wow, there must be a celebration.

46
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,585
They're setting off fireworks.

47
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,295
Yes, they are.

48
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,798
It is a celebration.

49
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,531
DO RA-MI, CHA MU-HEE

50
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:33,546
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

51
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,850
<i>I wanna switch off my head</i>
<i>For a while…</i>

52
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,107
No, no, whoa. No way!

53
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,192
What the…

54
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,449
<i>Let me sink in my quiet melancholy</i>

55
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:47,287
<i>Sometimes it's fine</i>
<i>To lean into the lonely</i>

56
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,372
<i>Perfect light, perfect stage</i>

57
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,792
<i>Oh, please, turn on the lights for me</i>

58
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,752
<i>I'll be dancing alone</i>

59
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,840
<i>Dance! Feel alive!</i>
<i>I would dive into the dark</i>

60
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:02,385
<i>I love to be alone</i>
<i>So leave me alone</i>

61
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,012
<i>Dance! Feel the vibe!</i>

62
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,139
<i>I might be a narcissist</i>

63
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,598
<i>I love to be alone</i>

64
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,976
<i>Just leave me alone</i>

65
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,686
<i>Somebody to love</i>

66
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,646
<i>Somebody to hurt</i>

67
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,692
<i>I'm exhausted by all of them</i>

68
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,527
<i>Where should I go?</i>

69
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,237
<i>Well, don't give a "uh"</i>

70
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,366
<i>Lately, I don't overthink for myself…</i>

71
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,790
<i>Like adolescence</i>

72
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,042
<i>It's getting tough</i>

73
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:38,713
<i>So I gave up on this early</i>

74
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,465
<i>Just leave me alone</i>

75
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,553
<i>The Netflix original film </i>The Quiet Woman

76
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,973
became an overnight sensation
as soon as it dropped.

77
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,226
<i>The main character</i>
<i>Do Ra-mi's wild, crazy dance</i>

78
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,771
<i>went viral with over 100 million views,</i>

79
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,814
<i>spawning tributes all across the world.</i>

80
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,944
<i>But the actress who played the part</i>
<i>was so dedicated to her role</i>

81
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:06,074
<i>that she became unconscious</i>
<i>in the final days of filming.</i>

82
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,494
<i>Now fans all across the world</i>
<i>are praying for her recovery.</i>

83
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,412
Do Ra-mi! Do Ra-mi!

84
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,183
My guest tonight went from unknown actress

85
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,144
to the scream queen
of modern horror films.

86
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,522
Now she's become an icon of hope

87
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,817
after making a splendid comeback
after overcoming a major injury.

88
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,319
- Okay.
- Please welcome to the <i>All Night Show</i>

89
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,530
the star of the South Korean film
<i>The Quiet Woman.</i>

90
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,823
Cha Mu-hee!

91
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,995
Feels like a miracle walking in.

92
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,163
Welcome to the show.

93
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,540
- Thank you.
- Wait.

94
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,341
Welcome.

95
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,017
Please give Do Ra-mi
a big round of applause.

96
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,145
Please give her a big round of applause.

97
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,608
Cha Mu-hee, please introduce
yourself to the audience.

98
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,403
Uh, please
introduce yourself to the audience.

99
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,073
Ah, hello. I work as an actress
from South Korea.

100
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,283
I'm Cha Mu-hee.

101
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,909
Nice to meet you.

102
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,999
I just wanna say
that was really great. They loved you.

103
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,543
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

104
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,421
- Happy New Year!
- You too!

105
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,971
Mu-hee, you were so cool out there.

106
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,098
Amazing! Awesome! What's wrong?

107
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,308
Take this ring off.

108
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,851
I need to go to the bathroom,

109
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,229
but I can't go with all this jewelry
worth over 100,000 bucks.

110
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,898
What about the outfit? It's Chanel.

111
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,775
Oh, you're right!

112
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,236
Oh shoot! Oh no! I sat down in this.

113
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,327
Mu-hee, you need to get used to this.

114
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,745
"Chanel?" You're Do Ra-mi.

115
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,456
You wear the shit out of this!
That's the attitude.

116
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,665
I guess.

117
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,792
Is this life even real?

118
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,922
What are you saying?

119
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,007
These last few weeks have felt unreal.

120
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,425
Is this real, Yong-u?

121
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,053
Or did I die in another world?

122
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,349
And then I woke up, and now I'm in heaven!

123
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,062
Wow, you're super happy now.
Are you happy?

124
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,688
Yes, I'm happy!

125
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,524
The sun's out, and I love it.

126
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,903
If this isn't really real,
then I'd rather just die now.

127
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,614
This is real.

128
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,283
You're Do Ra-mi, the movie star!

129
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,536
You go ahead
and pee with that ring on, queen.

130
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,084
Oh, Mu-hee, before you change,
you need to take a selfie.

131
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,753
Your fans are waiting for you, girl.

132
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,756
- Okay.
- And get some rest.

133
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,143
I have over ten million followers now.

134
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,189
Before my accident, I just had 10,000.

135
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,315
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

136
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,240
Is something wrong?

137
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,242
Are you feeling all right?

138
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,287
Ah, yes.

139
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,333
I'm okay. Just fine.

140
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,677
I was nervous, so I got a little dizzy,
and then I got a bit flustered.

141
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,142
Hello, I'm home.

142
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,645
Welcome back, Mr. Joo.

143
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,605
Mr. Kim brought guests again.

144
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,607
Again?

145
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,611
This place is full of old books,
paintings, and antiques.

146
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,945
So many old things.

147
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,989
- I think of it as a museum.
- Impressive.

148
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,241
Oh, yes, there's so much here.

149
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,410
It's great. It's so amazing here.

150
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,999
He published my first novel,
but we were more than workmates.

151
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,376
We were friends too.

152
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,752
And back when he was alive,

153
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,880
this house was like my second home,
you know?

154
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,716
- Yes, please look around. Don't be shy.
- Yes.

155
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,635
Ho-jin! Come over here.

156
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,055
He's the grandson.
The son of his daughter.

157
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,390
- Ah.
- Watch what you say.

158
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,141
He speaks every language.

159
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,351
Ah, hello.

160
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,144
- Nice to meet you.
- Say hello.

161
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,021
They're professors
from a Taiwanese university.

162
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,775
They're going to check out the books
and stay for a few days.

163
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,820
See, I told you he'd let us stay here.

164
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,906
Ah, I'll take care of them.

165
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,283
Don't worry and don't mind them.

166
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,494
- Mr. Kim.
- Oh, just give me a moment.

167
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,414
Let me show them something
really valuable, okay?

168
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,748
Could we have a word?

169
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,836
You've been using my house regularly
for your guests without asking me?

170
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,797
You leave it empty
while traveling around the world.

171
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,175
It's better to have people here
than to shut it up like this.

172
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,179
Your grandfather
always liked having people over,

173
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,348
and you don't need to attend to them.

174
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,516
As the current homeowner,

175
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,685
I just don't like having
so many strangers around.

176
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,356
Well, wow, no.

177
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,734
When your grandfather passed away,

178
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,153
I thought he would leave the house
to his grandchild.

179
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,905
I also thought
he would leave me all these books.

180
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,158
Instead, he left it to his only child,
your mother,

181
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,577
who doesn't have
any interest in this stuff.

182
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,747
Since you're here,
will you give my mother a call

183
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,958
and have her take these books
and other things that fill up this house?

184
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,418
She needs to take it all.

185
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,171
How can she
when she's not even in the country?

186
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,256
We can send it
in a shipping crate by boat.

187
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,050
If you do that, I'll make a report
to the Korean Heritage Service

188
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,386
for taking valuable assets
out of the country.

189
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,598
Then what do you expect me to do?

190
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,100
This place can't be on the market
with all of this stuff.

191
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,977
I can't keep living
in this huge house alone.

192
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,607
That's why I keep inviting guests over,
so you're not alone.

193
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,609
Goodness gracious, you're needy.

194
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,907
Please listen,
and pass on this message to her. Okay?

195
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,910
You can tell her to come here
before the end of the year

196
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:06,994
and deal with this stuff.

197
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,623
Oh, well, your mother will have to
return to Seoul for that to happen.

198
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,125
Whoa! I found it!

199
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,836
Oh!

200
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,129
This is it.

201
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,510
How about getting engaged?

202
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,511
What?

203
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,930
Well, she came back
for your grandfather's funeral.

204
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,933
- She'll show up for her son's wedding.
- Can't exactly get married alone.

205
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,142
True.

206
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,436
You need a lady to do that.

207
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,439
Oh. Hey, are you dating a celebrity?

208
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,191
What are you saying?

209
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:41,153
A girl at the publishing house in Japan
asked if you knew the famous Do Ra-mi.

210
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,781
She wondered if you came to Japan
with her or something.

211
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,493
There's this photo, and it could be you.
Here, take a look.

212
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,911
I have no idea.

213
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,288
This is it.

214
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,795
- Uh…
- Okay, stay still. Let me see.

215
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:58,796
Ah…

216
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,674
Ah, the resemblance is uncanny.

217
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,219
Spill the beans.

218
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,683
Just a meaningless picture.
We weren't traveling anywhere together.

219
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,394
This post means nothing.
Keep that from my face.

220
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:25,406
So, tell me again. The person in, uh,
Do Ra-mi's Instagram post is not you?

221
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,075
No. I already told you it isn't.

222
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,287
I got a call from Shunji, who's in Japan.

223
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,914
He asked,
"Are Do Ra-mi and Ho-jin dating?"

224
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,916
"Did they come to Japan together?"

225
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,295
I've never dated Do Ra-mi.
We've never gone anywhere together.

226
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,838
We don't know each other.

227
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,881
Ah!

228
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:46,760
I already told my family back home
that Do Ra-mi is my friend's friend.

229
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,388
Don't tell anyone that.
I'm not dating her.

230
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,724
There's nothing
that's friendly with her, okay?

231
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,435
- I don't know.
- Stop laughing.

232
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,605
- But I don't buy it.
- He's really a terrible liar.

233
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,986
What are you looking at?

234
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,654
Hey, does this…

235
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,865
this guy look like anyone you know?

236
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,533
You just see a profile.

237
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,243
Mm… Hmm.

238
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,954
Has the same height and build.

239
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,335
Strangers wouldn't be able to tell.

240
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,588
But everyone who knows you
would say it's totally you.

241
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,968
People who know could tell?

242
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,188
Hey, come gather around!

243
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,357
Let's count down the new year. Yeah!

244
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,526
Let's turn on the TV.

245
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,865
<i>Actress Cha Mu-hee is also in attendance</i>

246
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,076
<i>at this year's</i>
<i>midnight bell-ringing ceremony…</i>

247
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,161
Do Ra-mi's part of
the bell-ringing ceremony?

248
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:58,457
Yes, of course. Do Ra-mi is
the talk of the town these days.

249
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,460
So Cha Mu-hee is the name
of the actress who plays Do Ra-mi?

250
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,296
<i>Let's count down for our dreams</i>
<i>to come true in the new year.</i>

251
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,382
Nine, eight,

252
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,759
seven, six,

253
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,678
five, four,

254
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,681
three, two, one!

255
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,603
Happy New Year!

256
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,983
I'm gonna get fit this year!

257
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,094
Good!

258
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,430
Let's do a glamorous shot
with an elegant vibe.

259
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,935
Okay.

260
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,195
Mu-hee. The pictures we took today
will be on the cover of <i>Vogue.</i>

261
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,740
It will be published
in five Asian countries.

262
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,284
And <i>Vogue Singapore</i>
will send a journalist.

263
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,202
She'll interview you another time.

264
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,457
Uh, if she's Singaporean,
will the interview be in Mandarin?

265
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,043
I don't have much experience
speaking Chinese.

266
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,212
Don't worry. She speaks Mandarin,
but we hired an interpreter.

267
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,424
- Ah.
- It'll be great.

268
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,185
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

269
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,198
"Are you feeling better now,
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?"

270
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,927
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

271
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,929
Oh, sorry.

272
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,307
- Please, could you say it again?
- "It's so nice to see you."

273
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,810
"We were worried about you.
How are you doing?"

274
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,649
Good. I recovered,
and my health is fine now.

275
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,402
Oh wow.
It's a real pleasure to see you too.

276
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,200
Could you say that to her?

277
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,871
"Thanks for asking.
I'm feeling much better now."

278
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,331
"It's a pleasure to meet you too."

279
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:45,958
That's great to hear.

280
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,837
Your fans in Singapore were giving you
so much love and support.

281
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,213
Would you like to say hi to them?

282
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,216
Ah…

283
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,260
I've never been there, but I'd love to go.

284
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,554
I've watched a few YouTube videos
about it.

285
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,681
It does seem like such a lovely place.

286
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,558
I hope to spend time there soon.

287
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,821
You really should. Please do.
We welcome you anytime.

288
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,740
But talking about traveling,

289
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:23,620
your fans are really curious
about this issue.

290
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,667
Who is the gentleman in one
of your Instagram photos from Japan?

291
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,336
You even hashtagged "thankful" to him.

292
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,008
There's a picture
from your trip to Japan on Instagram.

293
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,510
Who's the man
you mention you're thankful to?

294
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,304
The fans can't sleep without knowing.

295
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,853
Oh.

296
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,731
Yes, I see. That man? He's…

297
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,238
Well, he's someone I quickly met
who was helping with giving me directions.

298
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,283
He knows Japanese and other languages,
so he's just a guy who was kind.

299
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,666
Oh, I see.

300
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,169
Well, he was pretty handsome,

301
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,255
so I guess some of your fans
might have expected something

302
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,216
more romantic between you two?

303
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,847
There's hope the relationship
is romantic and is leading somewhere.

304
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,974
It's the fans' wish.

305
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,851
They want a romantic connection.

306
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:32,397
Well, he's someone
who I happened to have run into.

307
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,900
He was just some guy.
It really meant nothing.

308
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,616
But, well, sometimes,
it can be a nice fantasy.

309
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,246
The thought of traveling
and encountering a stranger.

310
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,748
Someone who's charming and helpful.

311
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,461
It can give me
a hint of the butterflies, yes.

312
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,879
Thanks for asking.

313
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,645
Hey, Mr. Joo.

314
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,816
Oh, well, where's Ms. Cha Mu-hee?
I need time to speak with her.

315
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,567
Oh, she asked for you to join her.

316
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,653
She's waiting in the parking lot.
Let's go this way.

317
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,613
I can wait here.
I only have a few words to say.

318
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,531
It'll take a minute.

319
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,408
We have to go to the next item
on her schedule.

320
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:28,537
- You can talk to her on the way there.
- No, wait, Yong-u, uh, it won't take long.

321
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,164
- Hey, watch your head.
- Ah.

322
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,380
- Uh, here.
- I'll talk to her another time.

323
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,382
Hop in, Mr. Joo. She's right here.

324
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,470
All right, go ahead.

325
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,848
- We don't have much time. Go on.
- Uh…

326
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,694
Sorry. I haven't had a chance to eat yet.

327
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,196
Well, have you had lunch?

328
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,700
Uh, I'll eat later. Thanks.
So please go ahead and eat.

329
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,577
I've eaten enough already.

330
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,788
Oh. Well, then,
all I see is a small salad.

331
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,582
Is that enough to sustain you?

332
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,793
The daily schedule's very full,
so I quickly eat in the car.

333
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,296
If I eat a lot when I'm working,
I get bloated.

334
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,466
I had no idea we'd see each other again.

335
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,260
I was totally shocked to see you
when I turned around.

336
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,056
Sorry for startling you.
I really wanted to speak to you.

337
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,391
Trying to book this gig was difficult.

338
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,686
So I asked a fellow interpreter
for a favor.

339
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,900
The job today was actually assigned
to another translator?

340
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,276
However, you wanted to see me?

341
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:42,861
Yes.

342
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,575
Why though?

343
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,285
Uh, well, you see, um…

344
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,374
There's something
I really need to ask you, Mu-hee.

345
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,375
I, uh…

346
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,417
We're here!

347
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,797
My next gig is right next door.

348
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,133
Since we have a lot of stuff,
we had to drive over.

349
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,302
Oh, let me tell you why
I came to see you today.

350
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,303
Sure.

351
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,224
The day we met in Kamakura, can you, uh…

352
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,978
- Let's go. We're really late.
- Ms. Cha Mu-hee has arrived.

353
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,524
Sorry, that other interview went over,
so I need to go.

354
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,402
Could you wait? It'll take two hours.

355
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,570
Would that be okay for you
to hang around for a while?

356
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,864
I'm so sorry.
Can you give us one more minute?

357
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,324
Seriously? You're 40 minutes late.

358
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,660
- Ah, okay. I'll stand by.
- Gosh, I'm really sorry.

359
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,954
Yes, we'll head right up
to the green room.

360
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,207
It's a talk show hosted by Jun Hyun-moo.
You can watch from the set.

361
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,708
I'll let Yong-u know.

362
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,256
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to see you.

363
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,556
Ah.

364
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,103
She'll come out from there.
You can just stay here and watch.

365
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,729
Ah, sure. Thanks.

366
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,151
Uh, yes, hello?

367
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,028
Oh, that day? Uh, excuse me for a moment.

368
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:07,988
Okay.

369
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,407
I don't think that day will work.
Sorry. Yeah.

370
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,075
<i>Yong-u, are you there?</i>

371
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,747
<i>Yong-u, were you able</i>
<i>to bring Mr. Joo Ho-jin in?</i>

372
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,502
<i>Yong-u? Hello? Huh?</i>
<i>He seems to have disappeared again.</i>

373
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,088
<i>Mu-hee, who was that guy</i>
<i>in the van with you?</i>

374
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,426
<i>Was he the interpreter from the interview</i>
<i>you did before this one?</i>

375
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,889
<i>Yes, but I met him in Japan. Very briefly.</i>

376
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,267
When I heard his voice from behind,
I got startled,

377
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,186
and my heart started racing.

378
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,481
Mm-hmm. That makes sense. I saw your face.

379
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,567
I thought you had
quite a funny expression, if I may say so!

380
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,487
I keep having memories of us together.

381
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,822
<i>I even thought about trying to find him.</i>

382
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,032
<i>We had an odd connection,</i>

383
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,242
<i>and meeting today like this</i>
<i>makes me giddy.</i>

384
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,329
<i>Do you think this job is just</i>
<i>an excuse, and he just came to see you?</i>

385
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,580
<i>I can't believe that.</i>

386
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:02,667
Mm, he's very good-looking,
and he has a nice voice.

387
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,504
Did you notice his eyes
and his smile? OMG!

388
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,089
<i>He had dimples when he said,</i>
<i>"Ms. Cha Mu-hee." Am I right?</i>

389
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,425
<i>He's really smart and has good manners.</i>

390
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,093
<i>Tell me more.</i>

391
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,013
<i>What exactly happened</i>
<i>between you two in Japan?</i>

392
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,098
<i>The short answer is nothing.</i>

393
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,352
<i>You said there's a connection.</i>
<i>He wouldn't have bothered otherwise.</i>

394
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:24,439
<i>You can tell us the truth. We need to know</i>
<i>if there was some action or not?</i>

395
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,192
<i>Hey, why's your face so red?</i>
<i>It got flushed all of a sudden.</i>

396
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,445
- <i>It's hot in here. That's all.</i>
- <i>Your cheeks are on fire!</i>

397
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,782
She woke up from a coma
to find out she's become a global star.

398
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,409
Our guest for today is top actress
Ms. Cha Mu-hee,

399
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,079
better known as Do Ra-mi.
Welcome. Nice to meet you.

400
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,372
Nice to meet you.

401
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,375
You're in high demand.
It's almost impossible to book you.

402
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,544
- Thanks for joining me today.
- Thank you for having me.

403
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,628
Of course.

404
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,923
You became a global sensation overnight.
It must have been shocking.

405
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,466
Do you get recognized everywhere now?

406
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,637
No, not at all. It's not what you'd think.
I don't get recognized when I'm out.

407
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,932
What makes me the character
requires a lot of makeup.

408
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,893
- Do Ra-mi has a very dramatic look, so…
- Oh, uh-huh.

409
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,437
Then you should walk around
with white powder on your face.

410
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,730
You really should.

411
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,400
You know, lots of people
would recognize you, then.

412
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,027
Here's a discussion
we really have to have.

413
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,364
You were filming when you had a fall
during the last day of the movie, right?

414
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,365
What happened?

415
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,993
On the last day of filming,
I performed a scene

416
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,829
when the stunt wire got disconnected,
and I fell.

417
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,290
It was an accident,
but I was in a coma for about six months.

418
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,207
Oh dear.

419
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,501
It felt like that entire time
I was sleeping.

420
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,544
I had closed my eyes.

421
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,214
And when I woke up,
it was as if I had a long dream.

422
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,133
Now, many things are different.

423
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,926
- So much has changed.
- What a story.

424
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,250
Excuse me.

425
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,260
Uh, hi there.
Do you know where Cha Mu-hee is?

426
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,805
Well, since the shoot's over now,
I guess she already left.

427
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,976
She left already?

428
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,821
- Ms. Cha Mu-hee?
- Let's get out of here.

429
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,750
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
It must've been boring.

430
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,293
No, it was actually fun.

431
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,171
I had no idea so many people work on set.

432
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,465
There's even more for movies.

433
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:01,096
Just in case, is it okay for you
to walk around like this?

434
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,767
Uh, no one really recognizes
Cha Mu-hee yet.

435
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,644
If I say "Do Ra-mi," they'll know.

436
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,690
Are you cold? That coat isn't warm, is it?

437
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,943
It's a new collection
that hasn't hit the stores yet.

438
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:19,030
They sent it to me in advance
so I'd wear it, even if I freeze to death.

439
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,074
Ah, marketing.

440
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,867
You're a walking mannequin.

441
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,579
Well, I'll take that. It's all so new.

442
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,837
You've had a long day.
We'll wrap this up quickly so you can go.

443
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,131
Sure, although
I would love to eat something.

444
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,716
Can we go and grab some good food?

445
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,344
Grab food to eat together?

446
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:47,976
We were on our way to have a yummy meal,
but we never got around to it.

447
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,729
I wanna have dinner with you
to make up for it.

448
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,485
All right, then.
It was wrong of me to leave that way.

449
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,320
I'll pay tonight, since I left.

450
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,330
There's a restaurant that's close.

451
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,541
The walk over there will be cold,
so put that on.

452
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,669
Okay, thank you.

453
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,269
Since we have a special guest tonight,

454
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:35,106
I would like to share this bottle of wine
from my homeland of Italy.

455
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,066
- It's on the house.
- That's not necessary.

456
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,193
We won't be drinking.

457
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,696
We're not planning on staying long.

458
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,740
Thank you for the gesture.

459
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,992
It's up to you.

460
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,495
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Yeah.

461
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,788
Thank you.

462
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,668
Are you a lightweight? What's wrong?

463
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,671
No, not at all. I can hold my liquor.

464
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,883
I just don't wanna drink
'cause I don't wanna waste my time.

465
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,844
Yours or mine. You had a busy day,
so we won't be staying long.

466
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:07,847
Ah.

467
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,976
Oh, you mentioned
that you had something to say, right?

468
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:13,937
What is it?

469
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,065
Yes, you uploaded the photo
you took in Japan on Instagram, right?

470
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,817
Uh…

471
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,443
Oh. Yes.

472
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,612
You saw the post on Instagram, then?

473
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,241
You need to delete
that picture you uploaded.

474
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,576
What?

475
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,454
The lady from <i>Vogue </i>brought it up,
and everybody saw it.

476
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,541
That's why I… want you to take it down.

477
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,420
Ah, you…

478
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,674
Wait. So,

479
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,719
you took on the translating job today

480
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,598
just so you could tell me
to delete that photo on Instagram?

481
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,350
Yes.

482
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,061
I had no way of meeting you otherwise.

483
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,397
Uh, okay.

484
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,691
You could've asked me right away

485
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,443
when we saw each other
after the first interview.

486
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,445
Oh, I wanted to do that.

487
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,447
You were extremely busy.

488
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,869
I hadn't realized

489
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:15,206
this was regarding a photo
featured on a social media platform.

490
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,668
I didn't think you'd try to find me
due to Instagram.

491
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,920
Sorry for seeking you out.

492
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,882
However, I never
gave you my permission to post it.

493
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,342
Why would you think that it would be okay
to put it out there?

494
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,596
It didn't even show your full face.

495
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,849
That journalist didn't recognize you,
even though you sat behind me.

496
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,935
Everyone who knows me can tell it's me.
There have been misunderstandings.

497
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,730
Where's my friend?
So many ridiculous misunderstandings.

498
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,566
Delete it right now
so we can get this over with.

499
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,111
I heard you!

500
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,407
I'll delete it for the effort
you went through to find me.

501
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,376
But are you sure you can handle it?

502
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:01,878
Why is that?

503
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,632
Look.

504
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,761
This one has a million likes
and 60,000 comments, you see.

505
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,596
Now, if I go on and remove it,

506
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,599
questions will naturally come up,
and people will be curious.

507
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,981
You said you hardly use those sites.

508
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,776
Then you don't understand
how social media works.

509
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,529
Deleting and unfollowing
have huge implications.

510
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,156
Delete a post? "They broke up."

511
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,450
People will think
something happened with us.

512
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,664
So, for example, they would think

513
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,166
that the man who dumped you
after your big break was me?

514
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,045
You said people who know you
already think it's you.

515
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,673
It'll cause more unease for you.

516
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,510
You might go down
as the man deleted by Do Ra-mi…

517
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,096
Hang on. Let's not be hasty.
Let me give it more thought.

518
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:00,645
Could you change the date
that this was shared on?

519
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:01,980
Can that be, uh…

520
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,564
Can that be done?

521
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,149
Can you do that?

522
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,741
Dumb question.

523
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,201
No one can do that.

524
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,420
But you want it removed due to the date?

525
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,551
Yes. This post was made
without thought or concern.

526
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,887
I don't want anyone to know I was there.
Especially not her.

527
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,514
She must not find out, Mu-hee.

528
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:41,352
Oh, so that person
who you went to the island for,

529
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,146
she doesn't know you were there?

530
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,564
You didn't meet her that day?

531
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,737
You left me to see her.

532
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,572
I made a point to not go to her.

533
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,700
Wait. You didn't go to see her
when you had a chance?

534
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,369
I guess not.

535
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,456
I guess I'll never change.

536
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,213
And that meal.

537
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,841
That yummy meal was wasted.

538
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,892
Cha Mu-hee, you've changed in many ways.

539
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,395
But I was happy to see you.

540
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,816
It seems like you're in the middle
of your festival, like you wanted.

541
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,487
Thanks a lot.

542
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,787
Well, as you know, we missed out
on that special meal back then,

543
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,705
so you can pay for tonight.

544
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,466
Thanks. This meal was really good.

545
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,429
My van's coming to pick me up.
Do you want a ride?

546
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,014
No, I live in the area.

547
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,933
I prefer to walk any chance I get.

548
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,935
Okay, good night, then.

549
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,794
I just want my scarf.
You won't be cold in the van anyway.

550
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,671
I'm walking home.

551
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,047
Ah!

552
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,772
Did you do the translator gig today
just to see me?

553
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,692
It looks like that photo
might have been an excuse?

554
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,111
Because now I got my big break,
you wanted to say hi,

555
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,156
and were curious to see
what life's like now and how things are?

556
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,241
Ah. You could think of it that way.

557
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,870
It's a bit tiring,
getting famous and stuff.

558
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,204
I got two calls the other day.

559
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,039
It was a childhood friend
I didn't even know,

560
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:10,001
and the landlady of an apartment
I used to rent years ago.

561
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,085
Isn't that strange?

562
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,628
I did wonder about you,

563
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,630
even though we only ran
into each other once.

564
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,884
Yeah, I get it.

565
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,555
So go ahead and decide what you wanna do
about that photo, and let me know.

566
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:25,141
Oh, you don't have my number, don't you?

567
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,560
Would you… like to?

568
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,396
I'll contact your manager
and leave you a message.

569
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,233
Hey, please pick up when I call you.

570
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,945
I've called and texted, but you're just
impossible to get a hold of.

571
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,656
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'll put your contact info in my phone.

572
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,700
I don't usually pick up calls
from unknown numbers.

573
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,452
You have my business card.
Pick up my calls.

574
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,746
- Sure.
- I'll think about the Instagram post.

575
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,539
Then I'll let your manager know. Okay?

576
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,709
I'll be going, then.
Bye, and best of luck.

577
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,294
Okay, bye.

578
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,047
So how do you know each other?

579
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,716
Oh, he came by the hospital.

580
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,260
Wait. He visited me when I was in a coma?

581
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,303
Yeah.

582
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,056
- Uh, maybe twice or three times?
- Oh, when?

583
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,183
When you were in the room
with seven other people.

584
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,769
I shared a room with seven people?

585
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,480
I thought they put me
in a private one in a nice ward.

586
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,317
<i>Well, actually,</i>
<i>before you blew up as Do Ra-mi,</i>

587
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,610
<i>you were in the standard ward.</i>

588
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,320
<i>Not the best, but not terrible.</i>

589
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,114
<i>The insurance covered your hospital</i>
<i>and caregiver fees,</i>

590
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,784
<i>but the studio and the agency argued</i>
<i>over who was in charge</i>

591
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,662
<i>if you never woke up,</i>
<i>and they threatened to sue each other.</i>

592
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:31,249
It was a big mess.
I was gonna quit if you hadn't woken up.

593
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,961
The translator gave me his business card,
but I didn't save his number.

594
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,421
Here you go.

595
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,923
There it is.

596
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,601
He knew I was in the hospital, Yong-u?

597
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,855
<i>A bunch of news articles came out</i>
<i>about what happened.</i>

598
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,065
<i>He must have seen them.</i>

599
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:00,027
<i>But honestly,</i>
<i>public interest faded very quickly,</i>

600
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,654
<i>and no one wrote a follow-up.</i>

601
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,948
<i>I figured he was curious about you</i>

602
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,993
<i>since there was no way to tell</i>
<i>if you were going to make it.</i>

603
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,494
<i>Some people are like that.</i>

604
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,079
<i>I assumed you guys were close.</i>

605
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,373
No, not at all.

606
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,959
I had only met him once before.

607
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,632
<i>I'm glad. It's nice to see you.</i>

608
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,220
<i>I wondered about you, too,</i>
<i>even though we only met once.</i>

609
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,522
Yes. Okay. Let me take a look,
and I'll call you back. Bye.

610
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,403
Now, where did I put that?

611
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,161
If she removes it, it'll create interest?

612
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,913
I'll be the man who got ditched.

613
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,895
<i>The thought of traveling</i>
<i>and meeting a stranger,</i>

614
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,105
<i>someone who's charming and helpful,</i>

615
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,109
<i>it can give me</i>
<i>a hint of the butterflies, yes.</i>

616
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,622
Thanks for coming along and helping me.

617
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,375
- This trip wouldn't be as fun without you.
- Oh, sure.

618
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,043
Yeah, likewise.

619
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:42,755
This is a lucky charm,
said to connect those who belong together.

620
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,591
If you and I are meant for each other,
we'll meet again someday.

621
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,678
Okay, I'm almost there.

622
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,808
All right, will do. Who is she again,
the one you want me to meet?

623
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,304
Ji-sun!

624
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,892
Thanks!

625
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,645
- Whoa. You look so pretty today.
- I do? Great.

626
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,564
Oh, hey, Ho-jin. Here.

627
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,779
Hi.

628
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,122
Ho-jin.

629
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,915
If I save his number,

630
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,377
Instagram will put him
on my suggested friends list.

631
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,547
If I look through all of the comments…

632
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,801
I could just track and find her.

633
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:11,802
Who do you wanna find?

634
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,722
Just this girl
whose birthday is on April 8th.

635
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:19,768
I wanna see how great and amazing
she must be to land such a…

636
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,772
…awesome, kind guy
who's wrapped around her finger now.

637
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,690
Why though?

638
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,693
Did that girl scam Mr. Joo
and take his money or something?

639
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:28,611
Mr. Joo?

640
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,154
Ah, well,

641
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:33,491
I address certain people officially,
just to be a bit more professional.

642
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,201
It's just to show respect.

643
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,204
You call me Mu-hee, not Ms. Cha? Why?

644
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,705
Because you and I are close.

645
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:43,250
Oh, speaking of, he just texted me.

646
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,961
He wants you to delete it.

647
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:50,174
- There's nothing more? That's all he said?
- Yep.

648
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:54,386
<i>Please let Ms. Cha Mu-hee know</i>
<i>I prefer to have the photo deleted.</i>

649
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,599
So then, once I delete it, it's over.

650
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,953
Good. She deleted it.

651
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,047
MR. JOO HO-JIN

652
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,015
<i>Did she get worse after</i>
<i>she was transferred to a different room?</i>

653
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,517
<i>I'm worried.</i>

654
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,771
<i>I saw that Ms. Cha Mu-hee</i>
<i>was transferred to another room.</i>

655
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,147
<i>Is she better now?</i>

656
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,446
Why did he have to be so nice to me?

657
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,199
Now I can't forget him.

658
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:07,001
Shoot, and now
I even memorized his number.

659
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,213
And now, I can't forget it.

660
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,217
<i>Hello?</i>

661
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,145
Oh, yes, hello?
This is Cha Mu-hee calling.

662
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,563
<i>Oh, hello.</i>

663
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,566
I wanted to let you know
that the photo has been deleted.

664
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,735
- It's now off the socials.
<i>- Yes, I saw it.</i>

665
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,278
Ah!

666
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,238
Good. You saw it.

667
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,531
Well, glad you did.

668
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,575
That was quick.

669
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,371
So, uh…

670
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,707
The reason why I also made this call

671
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,794
was to try and…

672
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:35,756
Well, I just found out, um,
you visited when I was unconscious.

673
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,300
I thought I should call you
to say thank you for that.

674
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,512
I just found her, Mu-hee!
The girl whose birthday is on April 8th.

675
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,014
I went through the comments on his posts,
and I found her.

676
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,808
No way. It's Producer Shin Ji-seon.

677
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,935
<i>She's famous.</i>
<i>You know Producer Shin Ji-seon, right?</i>

678
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,897
Oh, sorry.

679
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,281
Oh, Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

680
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:06,370
Uh, you didn't happen
to hear that, did you?

681
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,372
<i>You went and looked her up?</i>

682
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,229
You must think I'm a

683
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,149
stalker and a psycho
because I looked her up,

684
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,234
and I wanted to clarify that.

685
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:40,404
I wanna explain myself,
so I had us drive here.

686
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,657
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

687
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,617
How did you go about finding her?

688
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,454
Well, I, uh…

689
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,581
It's kind of easy to do on the socials.

690
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,542
You know, 'cause everyone leaks
sensitive info online.

691
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,544
We found her when we went through
all the comments

692
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,671
that her friends left her on Insta.

693
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,966
You found her
by going through the social network

694
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,760
of someone you don't even know?

695
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,763
I can't believe you're so curious.

696
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,516
Oh, but…

697
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,728
Well, if you put it that way, I'm…

698
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,606
Yes, it was odd and pretty intrusive.

699
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,192
So, I'm sorry.

700
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:22,279
Now that you know who she is,
do you wanna know more?

701
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,865
Oh. Uh…

702
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,408
Well, I'd rather not.

703
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,119
I feel embarrassed,
and I wanna go back inside.

704
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,873
So I'd like to stop doing this
if that's okay, Ho-jin,

705
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,334
and go into this cozy car
that's waiting for me.

706
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,418
Thank you.

707
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,629
I also can't guarantee

708
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:42,216
that I won't be checking out
that girl's Insta account anymore.

709
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:45,385
I'm a bit nosy. I can't help it.

710
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,137
You're right, okay?

711
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,100
Whatever, Mu-hee.

712
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:56,063
I shared that story with you,
even though you're… a total stranger.

713
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,316
Everybody's somewhat curious, I guess,

714
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,568
so… you should go.

715
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,737
You were also curious

716
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,824
to find out how I was doing,
even though I'm a stranger to you.

717
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:13,747
You wanted to know if I was okay
while I was in the hospital, I heard.

718
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,501
So that's why I…

719
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,169
I…

720
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,755
That's why I'm so grateful to you.

721
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,218
So,

722
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,846
I did actually call earlier

723
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:33,559
to let you know I appreciate
how much you worried while I was sick.

724
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:39,439
Yet, here I am apologizing
because I was being nosy.

725
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,943
You should head in.

726
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,612
Yeah, as for her Instagram,

727
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,200
I won't… I'll promise
not to check it that much, okay?

728
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,495
I don't believe you.

729
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,664
I know how obsessed you are
with Instagram.

730
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,165
You have zero self-control.

731
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,585
What do you want me to do about it?
Delete my account?

732
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,628
You would do that
with ten million followers?

733
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:09,303
Well, uh, tell me everything right now,
and I promise I won't stalk her.

734
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,305
And don't ask any questions.

735
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,307
I will not share anything
out here with you,

736
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:17,102
like why I'm so curious about you
and any of your past girlfriends.

737
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,198
Fine. Let's go talk inside.

738
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,619
We'll satisfy your curiosity,

739
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,913
which you possess
for reasons you can't explain.

740
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,414
At least we'll have heat.

741
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,525
In case you're wondering why I live here,
I'll just tell you now.

742
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,194
This is my house.

743
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,155
I inherited this house
from my grandfather.

744
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,323
Ah.

745
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,450
This is such a huge home.

746
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:16,787
Don't bother asking how large this is
or how much it's worth.

747
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:21,041
I wouldn't ask those kinds of questions
because, by looking at this place,

748
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,542
I can tell it's fancy.

749
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,631
Ah, this is nice and hot.

750
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,137
Do you like drinking coffee?

751
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,516
I'll be shooting a coffee ad soon.
Would you like to have some sent to you?

752
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,600
- I get it for free.
- No.

753
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,227
I'll see it and buy it myself. Thanks.

754
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,228
Sure.

755
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,065
Well, do you have
any nieces or nephews or kids?

756
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,818
Kids have become obsessed with Do Ra-mi.
Want signed posters?

757
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,319
I don't have any nieces or nephews.

758
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,281
Ah, you don't have
any kids in your life. Okay.

759
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,616
That's too bad.

760
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,456
I also have Do Ra-mi merch and stuff.

761
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,291
- Do your parents like Do Ra-mi?
- Cha Mu-hee.

762
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,502
I say whatever comes
since this is awkward.

763
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,921
I don't know what to say.

764
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,049
Now that I'm inside,
my feelings are all over, I guess.

765
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,264
You said the thought of meeting someone
on a trip gives you butterflies, right?

766
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,393
I was on a trip when I first met her.

767
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:25,897
Was it the same place,
that island we went to?

768
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:29,359
We promised to see each other again,
but we didn't,

769
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,904
and I thought that was the end of things,
but I ran into her again.

770
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:36,074
She was the… girlfriend of someone close.

771
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,076
Oh. I…

772
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,537
Well, does she still not know

773
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,706
that you have romantic feelings
for her after all?

774
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,709
I hope she doesn't.
I've buried them deep inside.

775
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,423
Oh, but what if

776
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:55,510
you had gone to see her
on that island for her birthday?

777
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,889
Would… you… have told her
and everything would've changed?

778
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,269
It's a pretty pathetic "what if" scenario.

779
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:05,812
But I might have.

780
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,117
Then, Mr. Joo Ho-jin…

781
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,537
if on that day

782
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:27,250
we'd gone for that dinner together
instead of being separated by the train…

783
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,922
would things between us have,

784
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,091
well, uh,

785
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,468
changed too, you think?

786
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:56,113
The time I met you, I didn't just happen
to accidentally drop by that island.

787
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:01,201
When that woman asked me
for the island as a present, I have…

788
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,328
I've made it there that day every year.

789
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:10,085
She's never found out,
and I didn't plan to tell her my feelings.

790
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,753
On that day, though,

791
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,840
I planned to let my feelings go.
Just one day.

792
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,177
So that's why you asked
to have it deleted, I guess.

793
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,306
It showed the date.

794
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,518
To you, it's just a photo
that's like a nice souvenir,

795
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:27,811
but to me, it's…

796
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,981
it reveals a secret
that no one must find out about.

797
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,113
If we had spent the entire day together

798
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,575
and I hadn't rushed off
to see if I could find her…

799
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,663
I don't think it would have changed
anything between us at all.

800
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,373
It'd be the same.

801
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:54,880
Ah.

802
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:57,632
I see.

803
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,347
I went down a rabbit hole on Insta

804
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,975
and stumbled on a tearjerker of a movie

805
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,352
that

806
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,354
I'm not part of.

807
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,576
Cha Mu-hee.

808
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,666
Don't be worried. These aren't tears.

809
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,918
I have a runny nose.

810
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,295
Ah, your nose is running.

811
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,089
It runs when I'm outside in the cold
and then go inside where it's hot.

812
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,007
Ah, I see.

813
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,467
- It's just my nose.
- I understand.

814
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,885
- Why won't it stop?
- Here.

815
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,889
Stupid and silly. That's all.
Nothing to look at.

816
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,759
Ah.

817
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,309
Here. For your trash.

818
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:39,109
It's okay. I don't wanna leave behind
this snotty piece of tissue.

819
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:44,030
I want you to know this because
I want to avoid any misunderstandings.

820
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:48,034
The reason I said all that stuff about
curiosity and the train tracks and all

821
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,912
is so I could make sure you're not,
you know…

822
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:51,997
Know what, Mu-hee?

823
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,292
I was just a bit curious

824
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,585
whether you had feelings for me.

825
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,129
Maybe I was just concerned.

826
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,422
That's it, really.

827
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,049
Concerned?

828
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,176
I was in an awkward spot.

829
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,722
What if you use that
to coerce me into going out with you?

830
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,473
It's a realistic concern.

831
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,309
I'm a star now.

832
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,230
Well, as you know,

833
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,648
I just became a huge star,

834
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:22,694
so I can't exactly date or get involved
in a relationship right now. You know?

835
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,114
Ah, I see.

836
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,325
So the way you put it,

837
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:32,120
I have to understand
that I wish things were different with us.

838
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,374
Okay.

839
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,918
I will never…

840
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,714
ask you

841
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,675
to go out on a date with me.

842
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,721
Even if someone tries to coerce me.

843
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,682
Also, I'll apologize.

844
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,268
If I made you worried
by appearing out of nowhere,

845
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,145
I'm sorry.

846
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,482
We'll promise
to never see each other again.

847
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,402
Does that help reassure you?

848
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,078
About what I said,

849
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,039
I, uh… I'd like to explain.

850
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:19,125
It's like my runny nose.
I didn't want that. It's…

851
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,962
The things I said meant nothing.
It spilled out 'cause I was uncomfortable.

852
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,089
I'm sorry.

853
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,552
There's no point in apologizing
to someone you'll never meet or see again.

854
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,266
We've told each other
our secrets as strangers.

855
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,395
Let's leave it at that and call it a day.

856
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,730
We don't owe each other anything.

857
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,194
So that's it, I suppose. It's over now.

858
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,699
Um…

859
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,662
So, I guess this is goodbye forever.

860
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:02,460
All right.

861
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,296
I'll get going.

862
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,048
So long.

863
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,259
Take care, Ho-jin.

864
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:18,768
I won't ask to walk you out,
but I can still root for you.

865
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,569
Your anticipated festival
has finally arrived.

866
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,946
Congratulations.

867
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:33,408
I'll be watching from a distance
and cheering you on.

868
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,828
Thank you very much.

869
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,469
Ah, it's started raining.

870
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:58,433
<i>I guess this is goodbye forever.</i>

871
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:20,914
It's all right.

872
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:24,000
Once I close my eyes and open them again,

873
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,836
it'll pass, and I'll be okay.

874
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,690
<i>The globally renowned actors</i>

875
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,944
<i>who delivered outstanding</i>
<i>and passionate performances this year</i>

876

877
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:57,867
<i>Just now,</i>

878
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,037
<i>Cha Mu-hee, who caused a global sensation</i>

879
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,791

881
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,445
<i>Wake up.</i>

882
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,376
I'll help you.

883
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:21,594
Let's walk together.

884
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,364
Before the conference begins tomorrow,

885
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:44,534
there will be a brief meeting
for the professors.

886
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,453
Please interpret at that meeting too.

887
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,581
Sure. I'll meet you in the lobby
tomorrow morning.

888
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:52,166
Thanks for your hard work today.

889
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,251
Good night.

890
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:21,904
Cha Mu-hee?

891
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,711
What are you doing here?

892
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:40,840
Are you okay?

893
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,511
Something's wrong, and I don't know what.

894
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,057
I, uh… Well, I'm going crazy.

895
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,482
My festival is over…

896
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,944
and there's nothing I can do about it.

897
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,880
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?
