1
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,221
Welcome!

2
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,851
Hey! We finally got to the restaurant.

3
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,144
It's packed!

4
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:22,605
Now that we made it, let's start asking
the customers about their meals!

5
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,275
Hello. Whatcha eating?

6
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,402
The Momo-chan Ramen
that they're famous for.

7
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,946
That's right.
It's the store's top-selling item.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,407
It's Momo-chan Ramen! Smells great!

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,992
Huh? Did you pick that ramen too?

10
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,827
That's what the place
is famous for after all.

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,830
Ah, I wanna eat one too! Looks good!

12
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,000
This is Momo-chan Ramen.

13
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,216
And believe it or not,

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,053
it was a South Korean chef
who came to Japan and developed this dish.

15
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,387
Kim Yu-jin.

16
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,765
Here you go.

17
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,184
Wow, looks great!

18
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,186
What was it that brought a chef

19
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,730
from a prestigious hotel
in South Korea to Japan?

20
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,981
The answer?

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,691
His beloved wife, Eiko.

22
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,526
Mmm. Delicious.

23
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:15,325
My wife and I are constantly trying
to develop new flavors.

24
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:20,455
My husband's dream is to open
a Momo-chan Ramen branch in Korea.

25
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,999
Thank you very much.

26
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,628
I KNOW THE CHEF, HIS EX IS A CELEB

27
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,088
WHO?
YOU TROLL, DON'T LIE

28
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,130
DO RA-MI

29
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,673
HE'S CHA MU-HEE'S EX? FOR REAL?

30
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,342
RECEIPTS OR IT DIDN'T HAPPEN

31
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,314
Careful.

32
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,364
This is where I was staying.
Nice and quiet here.

33
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,658
When I swing by Italy,
I try to book this place.

34
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,166
Lucky. Key was still here.

35
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:09,712
I didn't know you were staying here.
Seems a lot nicer than the hotels.

36
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,533
Oh.

37
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,828
The key was in the lockbox,

38
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,038
so this is how you left the place
when you checked out.

39
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,707
But everything's clean.

40
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,834
Guess you keep things neat.

41
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,837
I feel better keeping it simple.

42
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,965
I wouldn't know how to do that.

43
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,385
I spill stuff. I'm messy.

44
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,137
I know.

45
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,181
It's all right.

46
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,682
I can clean for two.

47
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,478
If you don't dry your hair,
you'll get sick.

48
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,816
This place is old.
It's gonna take some time to heat up.

49
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,493
I think, um, I wouldn't impose and stay
if it wasn't so hard to find a cab.

50
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,329
I'd just go back to the hotel.

51
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,957
Italy really doesn't play around
with cabs, huh?

52
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,295
I'll grab a cab in just a sec.
Shouldn't be too long with the app.

53
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,546
Not now.

54
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,340
Uh…

55
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,552
My hair.

56
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,931
I can't leave
before I've dried my hair properly.

57
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,475
Otherwise, I'm gonna catch a cold
like you said.

58
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,435
Or I

59
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,188
could go.

60
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,023
Uh, n… no.

61
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,287
Hold on. Let me make you
something warm to drink.

62
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,807
Coffee or hot cocoa?
Do you have a preference?

63
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,686
Uh, whichever's sweetest.
I'd really appreciate that.

64
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,104
All right.

65
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,868
<i>Mu-hee, where you at?</i>

66
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,538
<i>Seems like Ho-jin never got on a plane.</i>
<i>You guys together?</i>

67
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,833
<i>Yeah.</i>

68
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,668
<i>It's snowing outside,</i>

69
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,212
<i>so Ho-jin is keeping me company</i>
<i>at his place.</i>

70
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,172
<i>I'll be back when it stops snowing.</i>

71
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,093
<i>You crazy?</i>

72
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,100
<i>Whatever, just stay.</i>

73
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,729
<i>Congrats, Mu-hee.</i>

74
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,579
Hey, Ho-jin.

75
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,544
I, uh…

76
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,089
I was…

77
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:45,303
I've noticed this is right across
from the café we met at.

78
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,846
Why did we never talk here?

79
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,521
Well, it would've been
so much easier to meet up here instead.

80
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,648
Maybe not.

81
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,817
You said you remember everything,

82
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,820
so you know what she did to me.

83
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,326
I want a reward since I passed.

84
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,338
The things I've done to you.

85
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,884
Does the… bite still hurt?

86
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,843
You okay?

87
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,263
Uh… Yeah, your bite hurt a lot for sure.

88
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,182
It was painful.

89
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,726
I'm so sorry.

90
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,105
She was kinda aggressive.
Thanks to her, I know everything.

91
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,066
I know all about your issues

92
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,610
and what troubles you.

93
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,241
With all of that, you still want me?

94
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,579
You know what type of girl I am.

95
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,627
If I say I get you
and that I totally accept you,

96
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,795
would you believe it?

97
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,299
I wish I could say I'm comfortable too.

98
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,387
I wonder if that
places pressure on you though.

99
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,556
I'd also feel miserable if I said no.

100
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,809
If I said I completely,
wholeheartedly believe you,

101
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,395
it would be a lie in itself, I think.

102
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,690
I'm a professional interpreter.

103
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,567
You're harder to understand
than Chalcatongo.

104
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,360
Chalca…

105
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,529
tong, what?

106
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,283
You see, it's a language considered
as the most peculiar in the world.

107
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,163
Gotcha. What I say
is difficult to understand.

108
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,748
That's true.

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,585
Do Ra-Mi showing up

110
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,254
basically allowed me to understand you.

111
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,091
None of this really matters.

112
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,845
We're gonna break up eventually anyway.

113
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,309
Whether I get sick of you
and end up going,

114
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,519
or you feel disappointed in me and leave.

115
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,313
This, too, will end.

116
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:05,234
Start with that in mind so we don't expect

117
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,446
to understand each other completely,
you know?

118
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,493
Uh, that could be true.

119
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,330
Look, Ho-jin.

120
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,667
Are we really destined to break up?

121
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,212
You mean it?

122
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,091
Then pick a date.

123
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,218
Oh.

124
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,012
I'm…

125
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,639
I think that

126
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,017
we can last for at least 30 days or so.

127
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,519
What do you think, Mu-hee?

128
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,231
Yeah, me too.

129
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,650
I do see us lasting at least that long.

130
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,653
Um, let's try this for a month, for sure.

131
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,719
- Huh?
- What?

132
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,054
Uh…

133
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,391
What happened?

134
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:22,103
Crap. The power went out
'cause we had too many heaters on.

135
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,193
Well, the building's almost
a hundred years old,

136
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,946
so the wiring's not up to date.

137
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,593
Then what now?

138
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,930
I don't know.

139
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,852
What do we do?

140
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,023
I can take you back.

141
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,322
I, uh…

142
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,078
Uh…

143
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,002
I wanna be with you.

144
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:58,509
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

145
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,242
I'm sorry. Let's get going. It's starting.

146
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,043
Stop it.

147
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,422
No more.

148
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,968
I know.

149
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,096
I know who you're attracted to.

150
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,353
I've known for a long time now

151
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,231
that you like someone else.

152
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,030
Go.

153
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,493
Goodbye,

154
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,454
zombie.

155
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,320
What's up with Ho-jin
swapping his flight all of a sudden?

156
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,658
It could be his girlfriend made him stay.

157
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,829
I tried to ask him if he had a girlfriend,
but no response.

158
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,289
Really?

159
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,125
Did we interpret things wrong?

160
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:41,463
Hmm. Listen up. So you mentioned
there's a… a lady he pursued for a while.

161
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,840
Did that work out?

162
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,011
Jin-suk only said there was a girl,
so I don't know much about her either.

163
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,349
Well, why are you so interested
in other people's love lives?

164
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,686
He would be an amazing person
for noncelebrity casting.

165
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:59,773
He's just perfect.
I bet it'd be a good show.

166
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,860
Something bad just happened to us.

167
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,361
Bad like what?

168
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,240
This post claims that Cha Mu-hee
was hooking up with a married guy.

169
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,867
What?

170
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,826
Let me see.

171
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,661
PHOTO EVIDENCE OF CHA MU-HEE'S AFFAIR

172
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,331
THIS RAMEN CHEF WHO WAS ON TV
IS CHA MU-HEE'S EX

173
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,167
THEY EVEN MET IN JAPAN
WHILE HIS WIFE WAS PREGNANT

174
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,711
Apparently, Cha Mu-hee
used to date a top ramen chef

175
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,630
who became a store owner in Japan.

176
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,715
Rumor has it they were together

177
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,259
while the missus
was carrying the man's child.

178
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,179
- Oh my.
- Who is this guy?

179
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,892
Ah, this is a picture Mu-hee
took of him while in Enoshima.

180
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,978
Looks like it was taken
near his restaurant on April 8th.

181
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,522
And his missus was pregnant then.

182
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,232
8th April?

183
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,443
You sure it was posted on that day?

184
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,070
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute. Hold on.

185
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,321
What? What am I missing?

186
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,865
That's my birthday.

187
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,659
Oh, really?

188
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,536
Well, um, this picture here

189
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,538
looks a bit peculiar.

190
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,209
It could be of someone else since it's
a side profile shot they're looking at.

191
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,544
The post was deleted before she got big.

192
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,714
It's sus if you erase posts or unfollow.

193
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,716
It's like evidence.

194
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,470
She was there that day?

195
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,515
Exactly. Why'd she choose to be there?

196
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,725
It really makes her look bad.

197
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,686
Which means

198
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,604
this will impact the show.

199
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,315
It's probably nothing serious.

200
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,401
- I can look into it a little more.
- Hmm.

201
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,529
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>may I have your attention, please.</i>

202
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:32,616
<i>Welcome on this</i>
<i>Korean Airlines flight 001, Incheon.</i>

203
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,786
<i>On behalf of the crew, I ask</i>
<i>that you please direct your attention to…</i>

204
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,252
Hiro.

205
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,548
You should get ready for the airport.

206
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,759
You slept here?

207
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:52,928
Hiro.

208
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,348
Hiro.

209
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,442
Hiro?

210
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,360
Hiro!

211
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:49,860
<i>I went to get us food.</i>
<i>There's some water in the fridge.</i>

212
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,642
What did you get? Any juice?

213
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,685
Mu-hee, you gotta leave now.

214
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,314
- Why?
- Nanami called and said Hiro collapsed.

215
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,357
What?

216
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,734
I'm needed to interpret right now.

217
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,112
But you can still make it
to your flight if you leave now.

218
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,080
What the heck is all this?

219
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,167
I was just sleeping,
and you stuck a needle in my arm?

220
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,920
You even called a doctor.
What did you think I'd done?

221
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,922
I apologize.

222
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,758
I know you're not as tough as you look,

223
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,386
but you wouldn't act so foolish
over heartbreak.

224
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,929
I jumped the gun.

225
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:03,308
I forgot I had taken my allergy meds
and had a few drinks. That's all.

226
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,935
And Joo Ho-jin?

227
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:08,230
Why'd you call that guy?
This is so embarrassing!

228
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,025
Now that I think about it,
this must be embarrassing for you.

229
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,571
Then why don't you stay passed out?

230
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,948
Don't be ridiculous.

231
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,033
But

232
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,744
he should have flown back by now.

233
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,329
Why is he still here?

234
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,833
I don't know.
I haven't had the chance to ask him.

235
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,629
Here he comes.
Would you like to ask him yourself?

236
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:43,223
The doctor says it was a side effect
of the antihistamines he took.

237
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,186
He also says there's no need to worry.

238
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,897
Once the IV is done

239
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,483
and he's rested, he should be fine
to catch his flight today.

240
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:54,902
Thank you.

241
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,864
Has he slept the whole time
without waking once?

242
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,742
Yes, he has.

243
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,037
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

244
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,372
Hello?

245
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,806
Why are you still here?

246
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,146
Good morning.

247
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,317
Are you feeling all right?

248
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,028
I'm all right.

249
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,700
Your flight was yesterday,
so why are you still here?

250
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,912
Did you meet Cha Mu-hee yesterday?

251
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,791
I did.

252
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,801
You're probably under the impression

253
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,763
that yesterday, you interpreted
my first confession to her.

254
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,016
But in reality,

255
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,187
I had already told her many times before…

256
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,526
…though she hadn't understood
because I'd told her in Japanese.

257
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,114
If…

258
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,660
she and I spoke the same language

259
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,539
and if she could understand
everything I had said

260
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,458
and my feelings toward her…

261
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,838
do you think I could have

262
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,925
won her over before you did?

263
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,971
To be honest,

264
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,224
I also had trouble
understanding her words.

265
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,936
I came close to giving up many times,

266
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,814
but, luckily enough,

267
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,526
a wonderful interpreter appeared

268
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,655
who helped me understand her.

269
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,241
An interpreter?

270
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:08,869
Yes.

271
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,249
Get well soon.

272
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,712
This is bad. Something's come up
on Ms. Cha Mu-hee's end.

273
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:19,796
Hmm?

274
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,007
It's a scandal.

275
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,884
Already?

276
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,344
Not with you!

277
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,929
- Then who? Me?
- Not you either, Hiro.

278
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:28,930
Huh?

279
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,935
People are saying she had an affair
with a married man.

280
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:35,937
An affair?

281
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,902
Oh man, answer your phone.

282
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,698
People believe I had an affair?

283
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,784
But I'm the one he cheated on.

284
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,744
That fucking son of a bitch!

285
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,871
Ruining my life even now! Asshole!

286
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,379
<i>The complete guide to Do Ra-mi's affair.</i>

287
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,047
<i>She allegedly had an affair with the chef</i>

288
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,508
<i>of a ramen restaurant</i>
<i>who has a Japanese wife and a baby.</i>

289
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,219
<i>His wife was pregnant around the time</i>
<i>Cha Mu-hee is suspected</i>

290
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,720
<i>to have met him in Japan.</i>

291
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,971
<i>As the affair rumors grow,</i>

292
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,475
<i>Cha Mu-hee posted a story on Instagram</i>
<i>with the caption, "My blood is boiling."</i>

293
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,894
<i>Was it an affair,</i>
<i>or was the man two-timing her?</i>

294
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,521
<i>Opinions are still divided.</i>

295
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,232
<i>She visited a ramen shop</i>
<i>and posted a photo with the family</i>

296
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,733
<i>while keeping the store anonymous.</i>

297
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,861
<i>She didn't throw her ex under the bus,</i>
<i>which means they're still on good terms.</i>

298
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,823
<i>So it seems she wasn't having an affair.</i>
<i>Pretty cool, huh?</i>

299
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,369
Things have been crazy
since we made it back from Italy.

300
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,371
Luckily enough, it might be dying down

301
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,040
since a K-pop scandal
replaced ours in the news.

302
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:41,169
Yeah. She posted a friendly photo
with her ex and his wife.

303
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,381
There's people who still believe
that she had an affair though.

304
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,843
There's not much we can do about trolls
who post and drop mean comments.

305
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:52,305
But, I mean,
isn't Mu-hee pretty easygoing?

306
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,766
She seems to be close
with her ex's wife, even.

307
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,476
They're not though.

308
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,770
Apparently, the ex cheated on Mu-hee
with that woman.

309
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,063
What?

310
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,607
She thought bringing it up
might fuel the fire.

311
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,401
So she said he was just an acquaintance

312
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,820
since that's the most simple way
to finally stop it all.

313
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,029
What an ass.

314
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,157
Mu-hee must've been mad.

315
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,118
She must have felt so… so angry.

316
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,246
Wait a minute.
You managed to learn this, how exactly?

317
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,372
Was it Yong-u?

318
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,790
Huh?

319
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,417
Yeah.

320
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,628
So the man in the picture
she took back then in Japan,

321
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,381
if that's not the chef, who is he?

322
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,104
Hello.

323
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,613
Oh.

324
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,787
When you met Eiko, right.
The man from Enoshima?

325
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,206
He looks just like me.

326
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,959
There's no resemblance at all.

327
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,171
We're similar enough
to where they couldn't tell.

328
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,258
But you saw Ho-jin.
You know they look different.

329
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,802
Don't we look alike?

330
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,097
Mm, I don't really remember,

331
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:20,810
but I think you both have thoughtful eyes
and a regal air about you.

332
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,646
You do?

333
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,565
But saying you two look alike
makes it seem as though

334
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,528
she's dating a man who resembles you
because she's still not over you.

335
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,988
Tell her you don't look alike,
so she won't be upset.

336
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,408
- It's a pass from her. Yep.
- You see?

337
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,371
Why are you here? What do you want?

338
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,498
I'm on a business trip

339
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,459
and wanted to… to personally thank you.

340
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,127
Mu-hee.

341
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,631
The way you promoted
the restaurant online went viral.

342
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,840
I appreciate it.

343
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,009
Thank you very much.

344
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,973
Also, I just finished
this ramen pack to push for sales online.

345
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,017
I brought some for my friends to try.

346
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,020
Could you try
and share it again on Instagram?

347
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,315
Seriously?

348
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,984
Sorry.

349
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,073
I'll go change his diaper, then.

350
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,003
Given the situation,
we had to tell the world we were buddies.

351
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,254
However, we're not.

352
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,507
I'm the dreadful ex who two-timed you,

353
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,010
vanished, and just found somebody else.

354
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,511
Yeah, that's right.

355
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,848
You better get lost. Your ramen packs too.

356
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:41,683
Sorry.

357
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,603
I came back because it's serious.

358
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,148
To tell you the truth, my boy's sick.

359
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,568
I need to make more money for his surgery.

360
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,823
He's had a heart problem since birth,
you know.

361
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,410
I'm being shameless here
'cause I was hoping you'd help.

362
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,998
She said it was her

363
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,041
ex-husband's.

364
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,042
Mm.

365
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,170
She got pregnant during her divorce.

366
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,463
I don't know.

367
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,507
Eiko wasn't doing too well,
and neither was the kid.

368
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,594
So I said you should still give birth.
I'll take care of him.

369
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,682
So after all that, I ended up a dad.

370
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,144
Mu-hee.

371
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,441
As your responsibilities grow,

372
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,943
your ego matters less too.

373
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,169
Seriously? You wanna guilt-trip me now?

374
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,255
But you're the one who lied to me.
You gotta be kidding.

375
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:55,965
That's true.

376
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,134
I'm a complete jerk.

377
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,762
- But I'm not a traitor.
- What?

378
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,349
The whole time we were together,
you thought I was gonna leave you.

379
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,436
I ended up abandoning you,
so you were right.

380
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,729
So I'm not a traitor.

381
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,356
Sure.

382
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,025
Yeah, I was panicking

383
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,485
because I predicted it.

384
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,445
Lao Tzu said that

385
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,115
if you feel troubled,

386
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,576
maybe better futures
are all you can focus on.

387
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,037
As your ex,

388
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,497
you had love,

389
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,915
but I lost you

390
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,209
'cause the future just spooked you.

391
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:35,422
Don't be so fearful with your guy
and be a little more present too.

392
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,341
Please stop with the advice.

393
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,677
I'm a bad person who can't help but worry.

394
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,139
I'm being quite serious
now that you're well-known.

395
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,727
Everybody's digging for information
about us, and even Eiko's ex too.

396
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,354
If the tabloids are this nosy,

397
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,023
it's about to get a lot worse
for your boyfriend.

398
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,276
I figured you'd feel anxious about that.

399
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,739
There's some big downsides
to becoming famous, aren't there?

400
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,076
Sorry.

401
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,713
Don't say a word if I write about it.

402
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,509
I hope you make enough.

403
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,597
Don't forget the hashtag
Momo-chan Ramen. Thanks.

404
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,806
Thank you very much!

405
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,814
She shows up, makes a scene,
and says she's a family member.

406
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,443
And then an affair?

407
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,155
She did respond and denied it all.

408
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,786
Like mother, like daughter, huh?
Blood explains everything.

409
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,081
Isn't her father's blood
running through her veins too?

410
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:52,999
Hey.

411
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,379
Mu-hee really does resemble
that woman a lot.

412
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,465
Undeniably so.

413
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:08,389
I do know Mr. Cha,
chairman of the Myeongjin Foundation.

414
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,100
I used to do a lecture at that university.

415
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,938
Are there family issues
I should be warned about?

416
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,982
His brother died a while back, didn't he?

417
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,569
Mm-hmm, yeah.

418
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,073
Chairman Cha told me he had two brothers.

419
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:30,036
The second eldest is now in charge
of a business in China, I think.

420
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,706
But I hear the youngest died quite young.

421
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,501
I believe he died in a terrible accident.

422
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,379
What kind of accident was it? Do you know?

423
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,257
I don't know any details, unfortunately.

424
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,716
Just ask Mr. Oh about it.

425
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,719
He'd be likely to help you
since they went to school together.

426
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,726
But why are you so curious
about that family?

427
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:59,732
Ah! Cha Mu-hee is a member
of that family. Am I right, Ho-jin?

428
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,318
I saw a post online.

429
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,532
So you gonna tie the knot?

430
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,868
Meet the future in-laws?

431
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,411
Please don't get ahead of yourself.

432
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,080
Oh.

433
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,457
So you started dating finally?

434
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,793
Yes.

435
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,711
Oh!

436
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,549
That's great. Congratulations.

437
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:31,806
But, uh, is Cha Mu-hee doing all right?

438
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,474
There's been bad press.

439
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,018
Don't tell me you saw that.

440
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,646
Rumors has it she dated a married guy.
That's not true, right?

441
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,107
Of course not. You believe that stuff?

442
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,775
No.

443
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,486
A lot of people say it's true, you know.

444
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,571
Look at me.

445
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,325
People can claim whatever they want.
It's not true though.

446
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,203
"The truth isn't for us to decide."
It's from your own book, Young-hwan.

447
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,497
How can you publish these words

448
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,042
and just believe
manipulative gossip like that?

449
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,170
Yeah, no. I didn't think it was true.

450
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,797
And yet you still bought
she'd pull something like that.

451
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,633
Don't worry about it if it's not true.

452
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,051
I'm pissed off!

453
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:11,554
It's irresponsible to gossip!
That's how these rumors spread!

454
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,224
Stop riding my back.
I didn't do anything wrong.

455
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,769
You know you represent
the brightest minds as a writer…

456
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,522
…and that even you could be
manipulated easily

457
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,483
by baseless speculations

458
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,318
is, I mean,

459
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,362
extremely disappointing.

460
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,533
I'm sorry about that.

461
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,494
I…

462
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,829
just…

463
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,539
I'm sorry.

464
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,958
I apologize.

465
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,461
It's time to go home now.

466
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,173
Hey, y… you wanted to talk
to Mr. Oh about something.

467
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,384
He's coming over for a drink in a bit.
Just stay.

468
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,178
- I'll make his acquaintance on my own.
- Why?

469
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,389
I'm a loose cannon?

470
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,891
So you won't finish a game of "Go"
with your old friend?

471
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,063
Be careful.

472
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,197
I was pretty close to winning the game.

473
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,034
He left. Did you have a fight?

474
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,996
Oh, come on, ma'am.

475
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,665
Do you believe
I would pick a fight with a man

476
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,500
who's young enough to be my son?

477
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,501
Really?

478
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,462
I was just scolded

479
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,423
for being a loudmouth.

480
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,468
Oh well.

481
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,346
He can't exactly pick fights
with every person

482
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,265
who starts gossiping about her.

483
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,936
He must be frustrated.

MR. JOO, DID YOU LAND OKAY?

488
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,751
I DID. DON'T WORRY. IT'LL ALL WORK OUT.

<i>Ho-jin, I don't think</i>

494
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,713
<i>it's about to get a lot worse</i>
<i>for your boyfriend.</i>

495
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,768
You should rest.

496
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,154
As advised, we put a notice
of legal action on all the forums,

497
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,323
and most of the comments
have been taken down.

498
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,909
- Kim Yong-u.
- Yeah?

499
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,453
You sure Mu-hee and the guy
don't know each other?

500
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,497
The man in that Japan trip picture.

501
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,040
Um…

502
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,085
She said he's just a guy
she happened to meet there.

503
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,339
- Is he famous?
- No, he's some regular guy.

504
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,883
- Huh.
- Yong-u.

505
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,262
If this type of story goes viral
during a time like this,

506
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,932
it might make things difficult for her
and the nobody. You know that, right?

507
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,225
Mu-hee is very aware, too,

508
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,352
and has not spoken to him
at all because of it.

509
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,812
She's being extremely cautious.

510
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,188
Just be careful, man.

511
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,942
Oh yeah.
A sports agency reached out for you.

512
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,863
I know sports management was your goal,
so you'll move over soon.

513
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,782
Thank you so much.

514
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,869
No problem.
Don't bow when it's just the two of us.

515
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,496
Wait till my sister hears about it.

516
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,915
- So which champion will I work with?
- You're gonna love this.

517
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,792
Listen, you're going to Europe!

518
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,086
- A European athlete?
- Yeah!

519
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,215
Will I fly to Europe immediately?

520
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,467
Yeah, sure.
First, let's prepare your visa.

521
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,846
And then, you should hit the gym
and get in shape. Get it? Get it?

522
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,347
- Uh, Uncle, about that.
- Hmm?

523
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,601
Uh, could I get, like, three months?

524
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,769
No, wait, maybe six months?

525
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,646
Come on, Yong-u.

526
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,607
You got a girl?

527
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:40,406
Well, it's still quite new.
I'm worried Europe might ruin it.

528
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,993
You think going in six months won't?
How do you know that?

529
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,623
I mean, it's not like
she doesn't want us to work.

530
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,042
Yong-u. Nephew. Listen up.

531
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,294
You focus on one target.

532
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,005
Your dream, or love. Pick one.

533
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,508
You only get one dream per man, okay?

534
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,206
Why did he pick my birthday to go there?

535
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,935
Hey, Mu-hee?

536
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,736
It's the same passcode.

537
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,905
I remembered it.
I figured I'll wait inside.

538
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,616
It's been a while, honey.

539
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,077
Honey?

540
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,709
It's Do Ra-mi.

541
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,130
I'm here 'cause we need to talk.

542
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,426
You must be surprised
since I showed up all of a sudden.

543
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,347
But then, I have been here before,
so I'm not worried at all.

544
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,557
I don't really care, but you're…

545
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,101
you're wearing this gown again?

546
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,812
Oh, this.

547
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,316
Do Ra-mi wore this when she was here.
I'm trying to look more like her.

548
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,110
Hmm.

549
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,156
Tell me. The suspense is killing me.

550
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,288
I'm saying this on behalf of Mu-hee
because she'd never tell you.

551
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,415
What's that?

552
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,334
Well…

553
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,713
Hey, Ho-jin.

554
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,758
No, I, uh…

555
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,427
Honey, this might

556
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,181
very well upset you and complicate things.

557
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,850
Not much we can do.

558
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,727
The decision's made already.

559
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,105
Given everything going on.

560
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,816
But I wanna believe you can take it.

561
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,652
You're acting awkward. Long intro.

562
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,237
It's Mu-hee-esque.

563
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,905
It's Do Ra-mi-esque.

564
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,244
I'm sorry, Do Ra-mi.

565
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,621
I was mistaken. You're pretty ugly to me.

566
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,207
And Mu-hee's pretty, no matter what.

567
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,084
Whenever she smiles.

568
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,877
She looks pretty when she cries.

569
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,712
She's pretty even when she's angry.

570
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:27,466
But Do Ra-mi is sorta grim.
No matter what she does.

571
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,718
Do Ra-mi and Mu-hee
are practically the same.

572
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,013
That's enough.
Ugly Do Ra-mi, just spit it out.

573
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,308
I'm prepared to hear what you have to say.
I don't mind at all.

574
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,399
It's okay.

575
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,653
Break up with her now if you want to.

576
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:58,164
You even refused
to follow me on Instagram, Ho-jin.

577
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,667
Now people will start poking around

578
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,920
and obsess about you 'cause we're dating.

579
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,592
People think we had an affair this time.

580
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,512
In the future,
they might accuse you of worse things.

581
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,057
I think the best thing we can do now…

582
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,312
is to

583
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,607
end things between us.

584
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,030
No.

585
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,160
I don't get ashamed or afraid
because of gossip,

586
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,578
and I have nothing to hide.

587
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,915
They won't manipulate me like that.
They can't harm me like that.

588
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:48,422
You'll be fine for now,
but it could affect you later.

589
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,132
Why should I care?

590
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,510
We'll break up eventually anyway.

591
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,599
For the time being,

592
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,976
let's not worry

593
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,188
and end it over things like that.

594
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:16,492
Thanks for coming here
just to give me some useful advice.

595
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,995
But, Do Ra-mi, I think it's time to go.

596
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,249
I wanna see Mu-hee
if you don't mind, okay?

597
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,714
Can we agree that

598
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,967
Do Ra-mi came to see you tonight?

599
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:39,390
I feel ashamed 'cause admitting I'm Mu-hee
is embarrassing.

600
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,934
Now I can't say that I zoned out.

601
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,477
That would sound crazy.

602
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,312
I actually don't mind.

603
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,648
I've become pretty used to it.

604
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:52,987
Isn't this

605
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,156
a little awkward?

606
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,159
Like…

607
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,371
Uh, I'm not used to

608
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,957
transforming when I'm with you, Ho-jin.

609
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,251
- Huh?
- My transformation.

610
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,919
Ah, I see.

611
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,339
I don't know how.

612
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,467
I'm, uh…

613
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,470
Why don't you

614
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,431
transform by

615
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,642
taking off that silly robe you're wearing?

616
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,354
Ah… right.

617
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,026
Oh, right.

618
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,695
Uh…

619
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,864
Trans…

620
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,742
formation…

621
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,456
Hey, Ho-jin.

622
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,877
Oh, hey, Mu-hee!

623
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,921
Why are you cracking up? Excuse me?

624
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,222
I missed you, Mu-hee.

625
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,141
I was worried about you.

626
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,481
But I've been missing you more.

627
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,198
My transformation queen.

628
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,204
<i>Hey, Ho-jin. Are you on the train?</i>

629
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:28,165
- Yeah, it's leaving soon. And you?
<i>- I'm on my way to the editing room.</i>

630
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:31,460
<i>I could've checked the footage later,</i>
<i>but Yeong-a wanted me to come today.</i>

631
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,755
Otherwise, I'd go to Busan with you today.

632
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,550
I'd be too busy
to hang out with you anyway.

633
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,511
The conference is too long.

634
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,888
I mean, I wasn't gonna
actually follow you, Ho-jin.

635
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,473
I'd love to see Busan. That's all.

636
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,727
The meeting will likely run long,
so I'll get home late.

637
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:55,234
But if it's gonna be too late,
just stay there overnight.

638
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,404
No. Then I wouldn't be able to see you.

639
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,448
I'd really miss my Mu-hee.

640
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,075
I'll take the last train.

641
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,163
Well, all right.

642
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,667
Um, I wish you a safe trip.

643
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,170
I'll message you when I get there. Bye.

644
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:26,056
If he wasn't coming back,
I would've gone to Busan tonight.

645
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,897
Cha Mu-hee is here.

646
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:38,318
Mu-hee, are you all right?
I can't believe all of this.

647
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,987
Either way, I'm glad it's over.

648
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,989
Sorry for the chaos.

649
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,032
What happened was terrible.

650
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,325
- Sorry.
- Hmm.

651
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,286
You didn't deserve this mess.

652
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:49,913
Thanks for coming.

653
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,374
Um, well,
it'll be good to catch up with you

654
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,002
before we finish editing the part
we shot in the castle.

655
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,713
- Mm.
- Hiro is also gonna be here today.

656
00:45:58,672 --> 00:45:59,673
Hiro's going to be here?

657
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,679
Did he get upset
'cause of the commotion I've caused?

658
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,097
He didn't.

659
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,684
Actually, Hiro helped
to make sure you'd be okay.

660
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,519
He covered up your scandal in Japan

661
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:16,482
by releasing marketing articles
way before it got any chance to spread.

662
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,610
He did that so it would seem like
made-up gossip too.

663
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,403
He helped me?

664
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,323
Oh.

665
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,408
I appreciate that.

666
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:30,287
You know, I was gonna talk about
Hiro's confession of love

667
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,830
that happened that day.

668
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,833
Is it appropriate to include that?

669
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,670
Oh, but it…

670
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,550
it's not like it meant anything important
beyond the project.

671
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,013
It did, Mu-hee.

672
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,642
He actually meant it.

673
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,727
You didn't know?

674
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,694
Hiro! Hello!

675
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,154
- Welcome.
- Hello.

676
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,419
<i>The train will be departing soon.</i>

677
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,338
<i>Please have your ticket ready</i>
<i>as the conductor…</i>

678
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,464
Ho-jin?

679
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:26,969
Ji-sun.

680
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,854
- You going to Busan?
- Yeah, I've got an event there.

681
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,982
I see. I'll help my parents
take care of a few things.

682
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,400
Ah.

683
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,218
Hiro.

684
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,848
I was wondering if you're… all right.

685
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:14,766
Are you okay?

686
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,270
- Mm.
- Mm.

687
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,192
I heard you helped me out.

688
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,695
Thank you.

689
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,912
Seems it's impossible.

690
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,539
"Okay, thank you"
isn't really a conversation.

691
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,961
I wonder when Nanami's coming in?

692
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,936
Did he really mean what he said back then?

693
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,982
I'm not sure how to bring it up.

694
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,154
Castle.

695
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,322
Castle.

696
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,617
Love… Really?

697
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,536
That make sense?

698
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,999
This isn't the best method to ask him.

699
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,212
Ask me.

700
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,093
I understand most of what you said.

701
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,054
I've been trying to make progress.

702
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,730
Okay, but, uh…

703
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,486
Is it possible you picked up
what I just said?

704
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,990
Castle, love, really?

705
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,076
I meant it.

706
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,959
Strange how we bump into each other.

707
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,840
Back then, this is how we met
all those years ago.

708
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,217
Flying to Japan that time.

709
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,428
That's right.

710
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,267
This is a miracle given the odds.

711
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,645
I can't help but ask you…

712
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:26,606
What?

713
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,526
Enoshima.

714
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,406
The birthday present I told you about.

715
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,241
You know which one?

716
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,125
I'll answer your question.

717
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,760
The truth is, I really did

718
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,679
like you.

719
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,561
What were you doing

720
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,355
in Enoshima on my birthday?

721
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,611
Ho-jin, did you… have a crush on me?

722
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:28,126
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

723
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,881
<i>This love is bittersweet</i>

724
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,760
<i>I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours </i>

725
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,887
<i>Close to me, close to me, close to me</i>

726
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,181
<i>I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours </i>

727
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,024
<i>Bittersweet</i>

728
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,352
<i>This love is bittersweet</i>

729
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,148
<i>I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours </i>

730
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,150
<i>Close to me, close to me, close to me</i>

731
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,527
<i>I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours </i>

732
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,370
<i>Bittersweet</i>

733
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,656
<i>This love is bittersweet</i>

734
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,327
<i>Say it to me, say it to me</i>

735
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:41,968
<i>I'll light it up</i>
<i>The way you walk to me</i>
