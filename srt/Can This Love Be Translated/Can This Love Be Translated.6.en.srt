1
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,441
<i>Aurora borealis is the light created</i>

2
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,986
<i>when Earth,</i>
<i>forever unable to reach the Sun,</i>

3
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,613
<i>draws in minute traces of solar plasma</i>

4
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,283
<i>through the power of its magnetic field.</i>

5
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,460
<i>Perhaps this brilliant, mesmerizing light</i>

6
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,047
<i>is nothing but a sad, momentary delusion.</i>

7
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,091
<i>The Earth is yearning to touch the Sun.</i>

8
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,261
<i>It believes that even a collision</i>
<i>with those tiny particles</i>

9
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,056
<i>means they have made a connection.</i>

10
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,909
<i>That night,</i>

11
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,037
<i>for the first time,</i>

12
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:23,124
<i>I desperately hoped my delusion</i>
<i>would become a reality.</i>

13
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,880
<i>But the Earth cannot touch the Sun,</i>

14
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:33,259
<i>and auroras do not appear</i>
<i>in the sky over Seoul.</i>

15
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,402
Joo Ho-jin,

16
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,321
let's go back inside.

17
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,616
Or how about we stay
until the lights fade away.

18
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,578
No, let's not.
I really don't wanna see them disappear.

19
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,917
We saw them together, like I promised.

20
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,877
Isn't that enough?

21
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,982
It's almost gone.

22
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,779
Why are you still here?
I told you to get lost.

23
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,740
Are you scared because I threatened
to kill you earlier?

24
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,285
Uh, well, it was scary,

25
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,121
but I'm out here waiting
because I'm not sure what to be scared of.

26
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,291
Look, all you need to do
is act like you don't know anything.

27
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,293
Oh.

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,003
But I'm not a good liar.

29
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,508
The wedding is off,
and I don't want anyone to find out.

30
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,428
Ah. People will though.

31
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,307
Is there a problem here?

32
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,643
Huh? You started
this whole mess, Shin Ji-sun.

33
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:13,526
You're not scared of me at all.
You're just mocking me, aren't you?

34
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,362
I have great reflexes
since I used to be an athlete.

35
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,740
This phone still works.

36
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,283
Mm, you're getting a call.

37
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,328
You should take it.
It really was a mistake.

38
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,209
Did he cheat on you?

39
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,588
Seems like he's begging you
to take him back, but don't do it.

40
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,133
An affair is irredeemable.
It's a point of no return.

41
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,469
Hmm. Is that so?

42
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,388
If someone's cheating,
that's crossing a line, right?

43
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,437
Jin-suk.

44
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,814
I can't tie the knot with you.

45
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,233
I've been cheating.

46
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,653
So don't ever call me again.

47
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,446
We are done now.

48
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,368
<i>You're </i>the one?

49
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,036
<i>You </i>cheated?

50
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,955
I'm going to, here on out.

51
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,373
Cheat.

52
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,425
You can't get it open?

53
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,469
Old hotels in Europe are like this too.

54
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,054
The doors get stuck easily.

55
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,891
You… just kind of pull it. It'll work.

56
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,062
You must be tired.

57
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,731
The shoot was super long today.

58
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,317
Oh no, I'm getting puffy 'cause I'm tired.

59
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,486
I can see this shoot
was particularly tough.

60
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,154
Yep.

61
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,324
I was freezing,
and I didn't know what to say

62
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,827
because the aurora borealis
didn't show up.

63
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,914
So I started a fire and made some
roasted potatoes and some marshmallows.

64
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,833
It turned out pretty good, actually.

65
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,002
I still have a food baby
from all these potatoes.

66
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,380
Why didn't you split them with Hiro?
Was he acting up again?

67
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,215
It's not that.

68
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,802
Hiro's pretty careful about his diet
because he gains weight easily.

69
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,013
Nanami said that I shouldn't bring it up.

70
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,764
I see.

71
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,267
And she also explained why he's like that.

72
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,728
It's 'cause he's been allergic
to all sorts of things.

73
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,813
On top of suffering from dry eyes.

74
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,733
Also, I noticed his hands were cold
when I held them.

75
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,027
I thought it was just me.

76
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,030
You were holding hands?

77
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,326
Why won't this open?

78
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,870
So I'm gonna look out for him from now on.

79
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,122
Come on!

80
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,042
That's why I ate all the marshmallows
by myself and didn't share.

81
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,586
He seemed to be grateful
and gave me a smile.

82
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,296
He's called "Prince Charming."

83
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,631
Makes sense to call him that, I think,

84
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,384
'cause he has a cute smile, you know?

85
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,094
Ah, why won't this door open?

86
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,557
- Huh, it's really not opening?
- Ah, no, I got it.

87
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,519
Oh, and when he grins, he's got dimples.

88
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,563
Where?

89
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,150
It's right about here.

90
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,447
Would that be considered a dimple?
Dimples should be more visible than that.

91
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,786
Why won't this open?

92
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,412
Did someone break this door?

93
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,628
Oh, it worked!

94
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,296
Thank goodness!

95
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,548
I banged my head. Ouch.

96
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,675
Get some rest.

97
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,344
Thank you.

98
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:27,887
Oh.

99
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,599
Hiro says he likes <i>japchae,</i>
with plenty of mushrooms.

100
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,851
Could you teach me how to make that dish?

101
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,520
I don't know how.

102
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,272
- I thought you knew how to make it?
- I never made that dish before.

103
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,275
YouTube might have a recipe for it.

104
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,443
Yeah, look it up. Uh…

105
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,280
You should go in and get some rest
'cause you ate too…

106
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,284
too many marshmallows by yourself
and your face is puffy.

107
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,878
Who are you gonna cheat with, then?

108
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,839
Hmm,

109
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,801
could be any guy over 21. Anyone will do
as long as he's single, right?

110
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,139
For real? Anybody will do?

111
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,766
It's not like I wanna be
with someone I have feelings for.

112
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,271
Well, if you're not looking
for a man to start over with,

113
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,022
why do you wanna cheat so badly?

114
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,024
Once I really cheat,
I can return to Jin-suk.

115
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,236
It's a fine line.
It's gonna be over for good that way.

116
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,533
Hey, you know,
you shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

117
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,870
It's not my problem,
but still, this is messed up.

118
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,875
Is it? Should I ask someone out
that I already know?

119
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,626
That would be more dignified?

120
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,380
Ask somebody you know?

121
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,007
Wait a minute.

122
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,468
You don't mean Ho-jin by that, do you?

123
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,428
Do you?

124
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:54,432
Your mind can be a little lost right now,
but you're not that crazy, right?

125
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,772
He's not the right man for this.

126
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,983
He doesn't fit my criteria.

127
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,027
Your criteria?

128
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,072
'Cause I won't do it
with someone I could eventually like.

129
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,491
Or even love.

130
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,410
Or anyone I once had feelings for either.

131
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,164
I used to

132
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,333
like Joo Ho-jin.

133
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:29,258
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

134
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,473
Why aren't they opening the gate?

135
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:39,101
In-su, you talked to them earlier.
Were you able to figure it out?

136
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,146
I'm telling you, they said
we don't have a valid permit.

137
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,315
We're running out of time.
What should we do?

138
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:47,151
Ho-jin's on the line,
so let's figure out what's going on.

139
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,530
The Ministry of Tourism thought
we were supposed to shoot tomorrow.

140
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,031
- What?
- Oh shit!

141
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,326
Man, Producer Kim has done it again!

142
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,619
That idiot. This is great.

143
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,248
They said the head office is over there.
We should ask the people that work there.

144
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,377
We need to get this before the park opens
and people arrive. Should we ask them?

145
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,796
Yeah. Joo Ho-jin,
can you show her where it is?

146
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,130
Yeah.

147
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,590
Can you let the cast know?

148
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,008
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

149
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,762
Hey, can you please tell the cast

150
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,847
we've been delayed
for at least 30 minutes?

151
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,182
Sure. Got it.

152
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,225
Great.

153
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,527
<i>I used to like Joo Ho-jin.</i>

154
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,738
They're complicated.

155
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,616
What's happening over there?

156
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,203
She was a dying zombie
yesterday. I guess she's been revived.

157
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,293
Taking photos again?

158
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,670
You like photo?

159
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,175
Don't walk around by yourself.

160
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,469
There are bears in Canadian forests.

161
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,553
Bear.

162
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,889
Uh, word for…

163
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,099
F…

164
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,311
A panda! A panda!

165
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,313
Bear! Grr!

166
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,275
- What's that?
- Uh…

167
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,195
Chomp! It'll bite you like…

168
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,198
Oh, bear? A bear?

169
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,450
Yeah! Bear. Yeah, you get it!

170
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,868
Bear, dangerous.

171
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,662
That was nothing like a bear.

172
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,123
Plus, you're more dangerous than a bear.
You're a zombie.

173
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,084
Oh.

174
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,086
Why are your hands so red?

175
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,004
You sure get cold easily.

176
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,007
Aren't you freezing?

177
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,386
- What are you doing?
- Hand warmers are crucial.

178
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,721
You want mine?

179
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,317
Take 'em. They're warm.

180
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,530
I have a bunch of them on me.
I'll be okay.

181
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,034
I brought this.

182
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,452
Uh…

183
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:44,995
Sugar-free!

184
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,331
No sugar. No fat. No fat.

185
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,375
Candy.

186
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,835
- <i>Ame</i>?
- Yes, <i>ame</i>.

187
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:54,922
Oh, it's called <i>"ame"</i>
in Japanese, right?

188
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,925
We may not speak the same language,

189
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:02,596
but things that are sweet and keep us warm
are totally universal, right?

190
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,439
Nanami said that you glowed
when you were with me.

191
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,192
Since we're alone, I can check for sure.

192
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,987
Even without words,
one can sense these things.

193
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,656
Uh…

194
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,575
Wait, wait.

195
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,039
You wanna tell me something?

196
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,001
Talk to me through this.

197
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,556
Glowing.

198
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,229
<i>Sparkles.</i>

199
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,608
Sparkles? Sparkling?

200
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,902
What is?

201
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,040
So <i>this </i>is what was glowing.

202
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:12,958
Hmm?

203
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,754
What about my earrings? What?

204
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,308
Man, that was close!

205
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,936
Imagine if I'd asked her if she likes me.

206
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,395
What would've happened?

207
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,381
So there really are bears around here.

208
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,802
Chomp! It'll bite you like…

209
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,480
- One, two, three!
- Let's get a picture.

210
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,108
- Cheese!
- Come on one, two, three.

211
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,652
Ah, awesome!
My daughter's gonna be so happy.

212
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,737
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

213
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,948
Oh, this feels good.

214
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,869
I have seen your movie, like, three times.

215
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,788
- My dad is a huge fan of yours too.
- Best day ever!

216
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,748
One, two, three.

217
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,666
Hi.

218
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,590
Oh, we're saved. Man, seriously! Phew.

219
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,800
- Let's get it done, then.
- Mu-hee!

220
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,552
Thank you so much.

221
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,513
- Do Ra-mi is the best!
- Thank you.

222
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,056
Oh. Mu-hee, stay here.

223
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,601
They'll pick you up.
Everyone's gonna drive through here.

224
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,436
- Let's go, Ho-jin.
- Yeah.

225
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,027
Can you… stay here?

226
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,367
You… you promised
to teach me Japanese earlier.

227
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,578
Ho-jin, don't leave yet, please.

228
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,996
Just stay here, all right?

229
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,960
Guys, I'll stay if that's okay.

230
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,713
- Mm.
- Okay, then. Hmm.

231
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,805
Ah!

232
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,851
Now you want me
to teach you some Japanese.

233
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,272
No, you said that…

234
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,653
Uh, you're scared of her,
so I'm here to protect you.

235
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,031
Thanks for your concern, but I…

236
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,575
I'm not uncomfortable
in this situation anymore.

237
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,664
I'm not some… ridiculous little boy
who's chasing a girl who doesn't love him.

238
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,499
So it's not that bad?

239
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,962
I thought you had trouble sleeping
and spent your nights awake, worrying.

240
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,427
Hey, wait.

241
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,517
<i>- </i>Is the sun blinding you?
- It is.

242
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,518
I'll shield you.

243
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,647
Careful.

244
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,191
- We'll walk this way.
- Okay.

245
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,152
I really like Canadians.

246
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,280
They're so warm and friendly.

247
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,910
Is it because they live in such a nice,
quiet place with lots of fresh air?

248
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,038
It only seems that way
because the park isn't open yet.

249
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,001
Usually, it's crowded and loud.

250
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,171
Have you already been here before, Ho-jin?

251
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,175
Yes, when I was a kid.
I used to live in the US with my family.

252
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,178
You head that way,
there's a small waterfall.

253
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,763
Oh! A waterfall?

254
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,516
It's not far. About a 20-minute walk?

255
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,936
- Do you wanna see it?
- Yeah, let's do it.

256
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,027
- Oh.
- Be careful.

257
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,954
What is it?

258
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,332
Sorry, I can't find it.
Maybe I went the wrong way.

259
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,376
You have no sense of direction.

260
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,962
How would you remember
a path you took as a kid?

261
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,548
If we keep going, we'll miss the shoot.
Let's go back.

262
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,925
Where are you going? Just follow me.

263
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,762
But… we came from over there.

264
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,725
Or is this it?

265
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,814
So majestic.

266
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,363
Is the waterfall over there?
Right by the mountain?

267
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,824
Uh, yeah.

268
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,410
I think so, I guess.

269
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,829
How about over there?

270
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,332
Where?

271
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,584
Oh, right by the mountain. That's it!

272
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,629
There! That's the waterfall!

273
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,671
I don't see it.

274
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,381
Just pretend you can see it.

275
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,674
Yeah, sure I can see it.

276
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,470
Look, all this water is coming
from the waterfall.

277
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,101
Wow, a waterfall!

278
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,062
If you insist any kind of falling water
constitutes a waterfall,

279
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,481
that would mean
that tap water is a waterfall too.

280
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,734
Yeah. That makes this a waterfall.

281
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,072
No one in the world
would call this a waterfall.

282
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,782
So that means

283
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,661
it's just a waterfall
for you and me, Ho-jin.

284
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,122
Fine, then. It's our waterfall.

285
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,666
Ah!

286
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,084
Wow!

287
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,003
Waterfall water feels so nice and cool.

288
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,834
Do Ra-mi made me do it.

289
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,253
She… she forced me.

290
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,131
I said be careful.

291
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,477
Do Ra-mi?

292
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,567
Thanks for all your hard work, everyone!

293
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,739
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Woo-hoo!

294
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,075
- Yeah!
- Oh, you're a natural at this!

295
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,202
You're good.

296
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,287
But here. You gotta do this. And then…

297
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,413
Smack!

298
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,168
Carefree like nothing happened.

299
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,794
Oh no.

300
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,547
Like this. Yeah, that's it.

301
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,883
Got it? Got it?

302
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,552
They don't even speak the same language.
Look at that.

303
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,639
<i>Nigiru? </i>What does that mean?

304
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,474
Hey, over here!

305
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,560
In this desperate moment of crisis,

306
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,897
I'd like to present to you
these powerful warriors of our production

307
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,023
coming to avenge us!

308
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,608
Welcome! Whoo!

309
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,497
Okay, let's resume the match!

310
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,998
Let's crush them!

311
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,917
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

312
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,272
You did it!

313
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,567
How'd you manage that?

314
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,778
Joo Ho-jin!

315
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,530
Joo Ho-jin!

316
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,198
Joo Ho-jin!

317
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,741
Joo Ho-jin!

318
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,410
Joo Ho-jin!

319
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,412
You can do it!

320
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,706
Push that one away, and the game's over.

321
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,916
If ours stops in the middle, we win.

322
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,793
Carefully now.

323
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,128
- Mm.
- Go!

324
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,421
- Come on!
- Let's win this thing!

325
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,547
Yeah!

326
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,339
It's all right. It's all right.

327
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,299
Good job. It's okay.

328
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,300
Ah!

329
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,095
Good job, everybody! It was a close one!

330
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,765
Joo Ho-jin! Joo Ho-jin!

331
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,224
Joo Ho-jin!

332
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,280
Joo Ho-jin!

333
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,700
Joo Ho-jin! Joo Ho-jin!

334
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,535
Joo Ho-jin!

335
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,453
Really?

336
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,996
Everyone!

337
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,541
Hiro-san says to commemorate
the crew's victory,

338
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,210
he's covering our drinks tonight!

339
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,003
Woo-hoo!

340
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,550
Hiro! Hiro! Hiro!

341
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,179
Hiro! Hiro! Hiro! Hiro!

342
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,057
<i>Arigato!</i>

343
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,824
You said he hated losing,
but he seems to be having a good time.

344
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,704
but you don't seem too mad about losing.

345
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,416
It was so much fun
that I didn't mind losing.

346
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,753
He said he had a lot of fun.

347
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,757
Me too.

348
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,177
See you again in Italy.

349
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,110
Mm. Goodbye.

350
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,365
Thank you for your hard work.

351
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,452
- After you.
- Thank you.

352
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,499
You didn't like Ms. Cha Mu-hee at first,

353
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,127
but while filming,
you seem to have changed your mind.

354
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,378
No.

355
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,631
I hate that zombie even more now.

356
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,469
Thanks to her, I've become a joke.

357
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,348
- Get out of here already.
- Joo Ho-jin!

358
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,350
- For God's sake.
- Joo Ho-jin!

359
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,268
Jeez.

360
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,271
Um, could I…

361
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,901
could I maybe ask you for another favor?

362
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,947
Joo Ho-jin, are you
looking to get married?

363
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,910
We've got a show planned.

364
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:58,580
A dating variety show,
and I think you… you're a great fit.

365
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:02,375
I, uh, would love to have you on it.

366
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,630
I really can't help you with that.

367
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,631
Oh, oh.

368
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,799
So it's a no, then.

369
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:14,137
Well, Shin Ji-sun spoke to me about it,
and she said you'd definitely say no.

370
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,723
You have someone
you've liked for a bit, right?

371
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,769
It's what she told me. Is that right?

372
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,734
Is, uh, that a "no"?

373
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,112
Oh! Oh my.

374
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,323
I should get that. It's ringing.

375
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,574
Excuse me.

376
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,410
Ah, I shouldn't have asked him.

377
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,165
Maybe you're just imagining
things. Or you dreamt it.

378
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,171
Hello?

379
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,965
Can I have your attention, please?

380
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:55,720
Uh, thanks to everyone who worked hard
during the shoot despite the cold weather.

381
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,645
Uh, I'll be leaving
before the rest of you,

382
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:07,023
um, since I have another gig in Seoul.

383
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,652
I'll see you again in Italy.
Thank you again!

384
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,298
You going back to the hotel?

385
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,884
Our call time isn't till 8:00 a.m.,
so you can stay out longer.

386
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,637
No, that's okay.

387
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,974
Okay. Wait right here. I'll get the car.

388
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:59,135
Why did the TV turn on?

389
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,948
<i>Surprise. It's me.</i>

390
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:23,993
<i>You look pretty shocked.</i>

391
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,665
<i>You've been talking about me</i>
<i>with that guy.</i>

392
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,252
Whatever. Get lost!

393
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,713
<i>You're being shy.</i>
<i>You got to kiss him thanks to me.</i>

394
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:45,098
<i>Follow me.</i>
<i>I got something fun to show you.</i>

395
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,089
Joo Ho-jin!

396
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,174
<i>Now.</i>

397
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:23,011
I'm gonna start by asking a few questions
Cha Mu-hee needs answered.

398
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,141
So Mu-hee is leaving tomorrow,
but you haven't messaged her?

399
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,894
It seems like you don't even care
if she's here or not.

400
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:46,034
Why… are you acting
as if that hot kiss never happened?

401
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,162
Just pretending you don't even care?

402
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:58,087
Ah, you said you'll never ask her out,
even if somebody threatened you,

403
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,130
is that right?

404
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,054
Are you going to keep that promise?

405
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,396
Shin Ji-sun stole your heart?

406
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:25,573
Oh, please stop.
Stop asking him stuff like that!

407
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,537
Come on, say it.

408
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,333
Does Cha Mu-hee

409
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,877
mean anything

410
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,879
to you

411
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,339
at all?

412
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,446
You better answer me, Ho-jin.

413
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,824
Don't make me wait too long.

414
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,350
You already know the answer.

415
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,978
Why are you acting like this?

416
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,402
Cha Mu-hee is a girl
who'll never be loved.

417
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,697
That was decided long ago.

418
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,014
Did you not get enough sleep last night?

419
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,809
No, I didn't. I'll sleep on the plane.

420
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,811
Here.

421
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,190
Can you see the Northern Lights in Korea?

422
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,609
No way. That would be insane.

423
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,865
Yeah, that'd be insane.

424
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:00,228
Cha Mu-hee, I'll drive you to the airport.
Get in.

425
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,438
Yeah.

426
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,117
<i>The birds are flying</i>

427
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,285
<i>I heard it in the sky</i>

428
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:20,540
<i>Something they want to imply…</i>

429
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,084
Mu-hee!

430
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,919
Where are you going?

431
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,008
Oh, man. What's going on?

432
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,388
<i>Stuck in my throat</i>

433
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,974
<i>Round and round</i>

434
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,685
<i>I wanna speak out</i>

435
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,312
<i>But no one's there</i>

436
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,065
<i>Echoes of my voice</i>

437
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,609
<i>Answer alone</i>

438
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,238
<i>Round and round, my life just goes on</i>

439
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,953
<i>And now you blow a kiss</i>

440
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,997
<i>From the palm of your hand…</i>

441
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,498
It's Cory Lane.

442
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,335
A Canadian singer.

443
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,755
A well-known singer-songwriter.

444
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,510
Oh, he's pretty famous, isn't he?

445
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,889
I feel like I've heard this song.

446
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,477
<i>Don't know how to waltz…</i>

447
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,521
Aren't you tired?

448
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,357
You must've been up late
drinking and stuff.

449
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,358
Not so much, actually.

450
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,652
I went back to the hotel.

451
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,571
I figured you had gone to bed early, so…

452
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,824
Oh.

453
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,452
I see. Right.

454
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,789
<i>So don't let your heart run away…</i>

455
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,915
I, um…

456
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,459
I slept very little.

457
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,005
I mean, I felt so restless.

458
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,132
How could you pressure me like that?

459
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,468
Then leave me hanging there
like nothing happened.

460
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,845
Is this about the gun?

461
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,723
<i>Can't get you off my mind…</i>

462
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,809
Uh, no, that's…

463
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,727
Yeah.

464
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,937
I mean,

465
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,731
it was as if you'd shot me in the heart.

466
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,402
How could you
shoot me like that and leave?

467
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,531
You know I'm terrible with directions,
and you just left me there.

468
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,032
I felt so helpless.

469
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,408
Yeah, sorry.

470
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,662
I did mention Do Ra-mi
was the one who did it.

471
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,706
I felt so bad, so I basically left

472
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,834
'cause I didn't know what to do.

473
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,586
I'm aware you're spontaneous

474
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,964
and you prefer
to sort things out afterwards

475
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:37,009
by pretending that… nothing happened.

476
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,055
I figured I'll drive you back,
so you don't fool me.

477
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,598
Just like you did before.

478
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,810
You didn't seem
to care about it at all though.

479
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,938
I couldn't sleep at all either.

480
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,402
Please don't go, Mu-hee.

481
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,159
I, uh… I'm trying to figure this all out.

482
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:10,126
I'm… the type of person
who needs time to figure things out

483
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,752
before making an important decision.

484
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,511
Which is why I'm willing to do
something I swore I'd never do.

485
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,681
I'm gonna talk to Ji-sun.

486
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,731
I don't want to be
a person who's playing people.

487
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,705
You know…

488
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,668
I've been losing sleep myself since then.

489
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,302
I won't pretend everything's all right
and just go on like…

490
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,223
nothing happened, you know?

491
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:29,330
You should take a nap
until we get to the airport.

492
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,125
I don't want to.

493
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,508
This Cory Lane is a good singer, isn't he?

494
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,221
<i>Farewell to loneliness</i>

495
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,556
Are you on a later flight as well, Ho-jin?

496
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,685
Do you have any plans?
Want to go sightseeing?

497
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:54,188
Yeong-a is buying lunch
for the whole curling team later.

498
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,400
Ah, you're the king of curling.

499
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,988
Then what are you doing after lunch?

500
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,781
I haven't decided.

501
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,574
Oh!

502
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,329
I'll call you
once I figure everything out.

503
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,083
Oh, you might already be
on the flight then.

504
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,711
Okay. I guess, let me call you later

505
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,629
when you land, okay?

506
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,551
Okay.

507
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,222
Don't forget to call.

508
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:33,060
<i>So don't let your heart run away…</i>

509
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:38,941
<i>Farewell to loneliness…</i>

510
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,737
The weather is great.

511
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,742
This song is perfect!

512
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,912
<i>Can't get you off my mind</i>

513
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:13,100
<i>Your lovely, tender smile</i>

514
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,897
<i>Keeps running through my mind</i>

515
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,691
<i>How would you know</i>

516
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:27,114
<i>If I could be the one?</i>

517
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,951
<i>So please come closer</i>

518
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:40,044
<i>We're dancing on the clouds</i>

519
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,922
<i>Don't know how to</i>

520
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,674
<i>Waltz</i>

521
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,281
Hey you.

522
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,575
Mu-hee, what are you doing?

523
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,452
I'm listening to music.

524
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,372
The song that was playing
in Joo Ho-jin's car.

525
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:20,418
It's by a singer he likes, so we decided
that it's gonna be our song.

526
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,546
Mu-hee, this isn't about the song.

527
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,298
Yong-u.

528
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,093
Don't worry. Please relax a little.

529
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:37,893
She's not getting married.

530
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,858
She spoke to her fiancé and called it off.

531
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,777
I was able to eavesdrop on the phone call
when she told him it's over.

532
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,410
Oh, really?

533
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,914
Joo Ho-jin has no idea.

534
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,917
He's about to find out.

535
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,837
I'm going to talk to Ji-sun.

536
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,800
It's hard to move on when the person
you like becomes single all of a sudden.

537
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,262
You think he likes you that much,
and this won't matter at all?

538
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,641
Do you?

539
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,189
Oh, then I was worried for no reason.

540
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,942
If he said he likes you that much,
there's nothing to worry about.

541
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,694
He won't change his mind.

542
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,410
I better go.

543
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,790
Honestly, I'm way too petrified to ask.

544
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,960
I have to go see him
before he talks to her.

545
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,672
Wait up!

546
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,424
Oh my God.

547
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,622
I think this could be our song
from now on. It's so gorgeous.

548
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,707
You'll think about me
whenever you hear it.

549
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,876
And I'll think about you.

550
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,096
There you are.

551
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,098
Are you here to buy records?

552
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,892
- Yeah.
- Mm.

553
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,228
I wanted to buy a new book.

554
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:47,648
Uh, do you have any recommendations
I can read on the plane?

555
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,900
Ji-sun.

556
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,904
I was wondering if you've got time
to talk in private.

557
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,116
I've been wanting to… talk to you.

558
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,286
Hmm. I know.

559
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,663
I need to talk to you too.

560
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,165
Let's do it.

561
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,669
- That looks good.
- I'm buying today.

562
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,130
- Soup for everyone.
- Oh!

563
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,007
No lobster. Keep it simple.

564
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,967
Come on, Ms. Cho.

565
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,470
- How about some steak?
- No way, get noodles instead.

566
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,223
There aren't any noodles on here though.

567
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:25,394
Oh. Mu-hee, I didn't know you were here.
Did you miss your flight?

568
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,646
Ho-jin was supposed to have lunch here?

569
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,732
- Where is he?
- Oh.

570
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:34,236
He didn't come with us.
He stopped at the bookstore instead.

571
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,286
You didn't know
I called off the wedding, Ho-jin?

572
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,456
So Jin-suk didn't call you?

573
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,128
I thought you were just
acting like you didn't know.

574
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,089
He hasn't called me. It's kind of weird.

575
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,634
He used to call me
whenever you guys were arguing.

576
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,762
But I thought, well,
perhaps the argument was so serious

577
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,555
that he didn't wanna tell me.

578
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:07,895
Jin-suk would bug you a lot
when we had problems we couldn't resolve.

579
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:11,398
I think I've relied on you a lot myself.

580
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,778
But you won't have to
smooth things over any longer.

581
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:19,239
I think it's better for you
to pretend you just don't know.

582
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,411
Is that what you wanted to discuss?

583
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,288
- Let's go have lunch now.
- Ji-sun.

584
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:27,956
Hmm?

585
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,172
What a beautiful movie.

586
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,090
I just love a happy ending.

587
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:01,759
But…

588
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:05,929
But what? You're just
a side character who got in the way?

589
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,098
Oh, or maybe a villain, right?

590
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,058
And the waterfall?

591
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:13,270
What about the song
we listened to in his car?

592
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,275
I mean, those moments
were a part of the story,

593
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,985
but that's not how it ends.

594
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:24,072
So maybe you should just move on.
You look pathetic otherwise.

595
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,784
If you get in between them,

596
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:31,330
this prearranged plot is gonna play
in your head over and over again.

597
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:34,708
Does this make you feel sad,
rejected, hurt?

598
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:39,338
I would just pretend
that nothing happened.

599
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,134
Just like when you were a child.

600
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:45,886
You're good at that.

601
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,772
Yeah. Do what you did back then.

602
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:59,858
Pretend you haven't seen it.
You don't know it's not true.

603
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,860
Run away!

604
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,749
- Oh my God! I'm so sorry.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

605
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,543
- Are you okay?
- I said I'm okay.

606
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,794
Do you need something?

607
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,421
What's wrong?

608
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,302
Mu-hee is here.

609
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,639
Uh… Ho-jin!

610
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,658
I'm going crazy.

611
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,202
Cha Mu-hee!

612
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,793
What's going on?
Why aren't you on your way to Seoul?

613
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,256
I'll catch a later flight.

614
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,842
- You don't have to worry about me.
- Where's Yong-u?

615
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,554
He's waiting at the airport. I better go.

616
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,055
No, wait a sec, please.

617
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,394
Let's wipe this off, then we'll talk.

618
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,653
Shin Ji-sun isn't getting married.

619
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,033
You know that.

620
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:32,826
You talked to her.

621
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,288
Yes, I know.

622
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,128
Well, that's great.

623
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,131
What?

624
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,759
From now on, it'll be much easier for you.

625
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,053
No more running away and avoiding her.

626
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,764
I hope you can make it work now.

627
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,397
You missed your flight just to say that?

628
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,609
I'll head to the airport now.

629
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,153
You should just go back inside.
She's waiting.

630
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:15,035
You say whatever pops up in your mind
when you're frustrated.

631
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:16,870
Look, Mu-hee,

632
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,040
tell me what you really mean,
and don't run away.

633
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,669
<i>Yeah. Do what you did back then.</i>

634
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,295
<i>Pretend you haven't seen it.</i>

635
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,922
<i>You don't know it's not true.</i>

636
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:27,839
Run away!

637
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,759
Do you…

638
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:36,139
not like me at all, is that it?

639
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,107
That's it.
That's all I needed to tell you.

640
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,027
It hurt my pride,
so I figured I'll try harder.

641
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:53,281
I wanted to make you
fall for me just once.

642
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:58,453
But the wedding's off,
and her presence makes this ridiculous.

643
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:05,794
I missed the flight because I rushed over,
hoping to see you before she could.

644
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:07,796
Ho-jin…

645
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,050
were you upset I was leaving at all?

646
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,010
Were you?

647
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,224
I guess…

648
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:24,479
…I am too late.

649
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:30,569
Remember how Do Ra-mi manipulates me
like an online troll.

650
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,783
She keeps laughing at me.

651
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,622
And she says you'll never like me.
It's just not gonna happen.

652
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,292
That's why…

653
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:51,631
I'll try to deal with the fact
that I can't be with you, and move on.

654
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,302
It's too painful.

655
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,930
I can't do this to myself.

656
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,774
I'll just get my heart broken.

657
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,321
I don't know how to come back from that.

658
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,579
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

659
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,085
I made you feel like a fool
the whole time. Forgive me.

660
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,837
I'm over it now.

661
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,011
You don't have to feel
sorry for me any longer.

662
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,055
I have cleared the air with Ji-sun.

663
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,515
I'm accepting it now.

664
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,062
Have you been able to figure things out?

665
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,106
I don't feel comfortable sharing that

666
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,525
considering our situation.

667
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,822
You've been so open about your feelings.

668
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,032
Crying, laughing, and everything.

669
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,828
I found that baffling, yet fascinating.

670
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,916
I was very worried about you,
but I tried to be open as well.

671
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,171
I tried to take care of you, Mu-hee,

672
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,091
but now I'm realizing

673
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,969
your emotions have been controlling me.

674
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,723
We should stop right here, Mu-hee.

675
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,105
It's like

676
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:34,151
when we met, and we were standing
at the crosswalk near the tracks.

677
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,948
You were standing
on the other side of the tracks…

678
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,786
and I ended up
telling you to go after her.

679
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,416
Goodbye.

680
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,964
So farewell, Joo Ho-jin.

681
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,219
Don't make it seem like
it didn't matter to you.

682
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:04,931
I've been wronged.

683
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,854
I was about to cross the street…

684
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,024
'cause I wanted to be with you.

685
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,495
So Do Ra-mi was wrong, and you were right?

686
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:30,749
I hope that's the case.

687
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,126
'Cause I'll still root for you.

688
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,357
<i>Keep in mind</i>

689
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:02,447
<i>I'm never gonna leave your life</i>
<i>Ever long…</i>

690
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,673
<i>You'll be okay… </i>

691
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:45,115
<i>So stay close…</i>

692
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,076
I was losing my mind.

693
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:51,246
I changed our booking to a flight
with a layover in Japan. We gotta hurry.

694
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,623
Mu-hee.

695
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,503
I…

696
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,716
I messed it all up.

697
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,195
Did he do it again?

698
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:26,948
Wow.

699
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,702
How dare he.

700
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,788
Who does he think he is?

701
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:38,585
<i>So stay close…</i>

702
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:58,730
<i>So babe, I promise I won't ever leave</i>

703
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,869
<i>I didn't try to smooth things over</i>

704
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,204
<i>between you and Jin-suk</i>

705
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,082
because you asked me to.

706
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:21,669
As long as your relationship
was still working,

707
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,214
I always felt safe
in my own world that I created.

708
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:31,763
But someone has entered my life
and turned it upside down all of a sudden.

709
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,517
<i>I tried pushing her away,</i>

710
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,061
<i>out of fear that</i>
<i>my whole world would fall apart.</i>

711
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,606
<i>But she showed me the bright side of life.</i>

712
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:49,072
<i>Forever I'll never leave </i>

713
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,961
<i>I won't ever leave</i>

714
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:26,693
<i>Forever I'll never leave</i>

715
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,739
Are you okay?

716
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,041
Are you okay?

717
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,253
You haven't budged since earlier.

718
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,965
Are you unwell?

719
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,748
TWO WEEKS LATER, SOUTH KOREA

720
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,416
As you asked,

721
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,753
I didn't let the production team know
you came to South Korea.

722
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:30,507
As for Ms. Cha Mu-hee,

723
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:34,677
she'll be attending a concert
sponsored by an advertiser.

724
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,015
I know you didn't ask me to,

725
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:41,684
but I thought
I'd check her schedule just in case.

726
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,645
A concert?

727
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,649
She went to a concert
without a care in the world?

728
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,110
After what she did to me?

729
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,631
That woman. Is she an actress?

730
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,508
Huh?

731
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,386
I believe she is.

732
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,806
Ah, Mr. Kim,
I don't know if you've heard of her.

733
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,058
Do Ra-mi. It's…

734
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,101
Cha Mu-hee?

735
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,852
Ah, that's her name.

736
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,272
Oh, you know her?

737
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,440
- Sure, I do. Cha Mu-hee.
- Oh, really?

738
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:31,526
Oh.

739
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,447
This concert

740
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,449
will be interesting.

741
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,332
Good evening.

742
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,273
"Good evening."

743
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:14,402
"I am Roberto Vancini,
the Ambassador of Italy to South Korea."

744
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:19,490
"Thank you for attending this concert
that commemorates the 140th anniversary

745
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:21,618
of South Korean-Italian
diplomatic relations,

746
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,745
hosted by the Italian Embassy."

747
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:39,135
"I hope tonight's
musical journey will take you to Italy,

748
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:43,431
and I hope it will be a delightful
and memorable experience."

749
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:44,641
"Thank you very much."

750
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,733
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?
