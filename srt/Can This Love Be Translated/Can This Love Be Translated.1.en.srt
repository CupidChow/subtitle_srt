00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,755
Oh no, that won't work.

178
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,758
You're the only one
who interprets my gibberish well,

179
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,843
no matter how much crap I spew.

180
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,305
Mm, so you must delay your trip for me.
Could you?

181
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:43,309
Hey, isn't it enough that you dragged
a busy person to Japan and put me to work?

182
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,102
That's too big of an ask, sir.

183
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,650
So, we'll go for sushi at the airport
and a drink.

184
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,486
Mr. Kim, listen.
You need to cut out your drinking.

185
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,739
You confused the protagonist's names
at the talkback.

186
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,576
The husband of the main character
is Nam Hyeon-su. It's not Park In-cheol.

187
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,245
Was Yeong-suk's first husband,
Nam Hyeon-su?

188
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,247
The one who wrote it doesn't know?

189
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,917
I was shocked,
but had to contain it while translating.

190
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,046
All right, I hear you. You roll with it.
I'll treat you, then. Let's go, okay?

191
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,714
The next time, buy me sushi.

192
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,466
I have things to do
while I'm still in town.

193
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,884
Really?

194
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,720
You're going somewhere nice alone?

195
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,472
Really? Meeting someone?

196
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,515
Going on a date?

197
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,517
Mr. Kim, I hope you have a safe trip back.

198
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,436
You're going on a date, aren't you?

199
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,148
[laughs] I was concerned
you had no luck in love whatsoever.

200
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,734
If you're going on a date,
share those cookies with her!

201
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,361
- They're sweet!

The leaflets in Korean
seem to have run out.

Wow! You speak Italian.

00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,996
We've never met a Japanese person
who speaks Italian.

the tone, to make it a little tougher?

Mm, he's Chinese?

271
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,756
I thought he might be Korean.

your voice female, then.

00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,889
It's very important you translate well.

275
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,726
Can this app curse?

276
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:45,898
Fuck.

277
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,153

You do. You're Korean?

I didn't wanna eavesdrop--

287
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,516
It must have been fun
to pretend to be Chinese.

288
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,559
I never pretended that I was Chinese.

289
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,146
Yes, you did.
You're reading that pamphlet in Chinese.

290
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,525
I'm not pretending. I read them.
I collect language brochures.

Don't be ridiculous.

00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,949
You're a Papago app on legs?

00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:37,866
Look, I have…

What happened to him?

301
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,251
He has an allergy.

302
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,504
Something in his snack earlier
must have triggered a reaction.

303
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,713
[in Japanese] An ambulance.

304
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,383
Please tell them
a boy is having an allergic reaction.

305
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,300
Okay.

309
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,181
This one.

310
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,433
You'd better take this with you
to the hospital.

311
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,434
Okay.

312
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:08,230
[in Japanese] I called an ambulance.
But the alleyway here is narrow.

313
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,023
It may be a while before they arrive.

314
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,818
[in Italian] She says
the alley's too narrow,

315
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,611
so the ambulance might take a while.

316
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,989
- I'll carry him to the main street.
- Okay, honey.

317
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,116
Uh, I'll carry him.

318
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,034
- Thank you.
- [man] Thank you.

319
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,789
[in Japanese] Tell the ambulance
to meet us at the main street entrance.

320
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,707
[Momo] Okay.

321
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,711

[uneasy music continues]

00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,346
He must be Papago, for real.

[animated tense music playing]

326
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,479
[in Italian] Excuse me.

327
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,030
I let the paramedics know
what's going on with Paolo.

328
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:02,618
Give me a call if you need
additional interpretation at the hospital.

329
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,660
Thank you so much.

330
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,121
- [in Japanese] Take care of him.
- Got it.

[in English] Thank you.

334
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,973
I'll take my things.

335
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,270
[Mu-hee] Uh…

336
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,688
Can you help me, please?

337
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,983
This is a big emergency.

338
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,238
The Papago app was my first choice,
but a human voice would be better

339
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,908
'cause AI… AI can't be heartfelt
in authentic ways.

340
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,494
A lover's quarrel isn't something
I wanna be a part of.

341
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,414
I knew it. You heard everything.

342
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,291
- Fuck bitch.
- F…

343
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,168
You heard me curse too, didn't you?

344
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,211
I didn't mean to.

345
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,260
Using a stupid AI to win the man I love
would be very wrong.

346
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,387
So please help me.

347
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,847
Getting dumped is bad enough.

348
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,226
But through Papago, it's even worse.

349
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,400
Okay, fine. I'll volunteer.

350
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,735
Just… no swear words. Not with me.

351
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:24,908
[speaking Japanese]

352
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,662
[in English] Mr. Yu-jin went to Tokyo,
so he's not here.

353
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,205
Went to Tokyo?

354
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,542
He knew I was coming and went into hiding?

355
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,212
I wonder if those two
might be lying to me.

356
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,215
- [whimsical music playing]
- Well, but you want me to say that?

357
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,426
Please, don't.

358
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,096
Could she tell us when he'll return?

359
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,180
[speaking Japanese]

360
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,766
[speaking Japanese]

361
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,691
[in English] She can ask his girlfriend
to come out and talk.

362
00:21:59,026 --> 00:21:59,860
What?

363
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,237
[Momo in Japanese] Eiko,
can you come out here for a moment?

364
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,950
[in English] She's… she's not the one
he wants to pursue.

365
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,286
But… but it fits!

366
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,747
[jaunty music playing]

367
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,291
He uploaded a photo of her
with a hashtag "new start."

368
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,877
I mean, tell me that's not her?

369
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,472
You picked the wrong one.

370
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,140
Wait.

371
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,184
Oh no.

372
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,686
I thought he was with the younger one.

373
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:37,898
[music fades]

374
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,193
[Momo sighs]

375
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,032
Oh. Well, no.

376
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,994
Could you ask her, please,

377
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,080
how far along she is?

378
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,456
[speaking Japanese]

379
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,459
[speaking Japanese]

380
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,087
[in English] Seven months along.

381
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,840
He left me almost three months ago.

382
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,384
Seven?

383
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,429
[sighs] I'm so crazy. What a…

384
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,723
What a fucking bastard!

385
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,768
[door opens]

386
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,061
[in Japanese] Excuse me.

387
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,816
Is she Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

388
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,026
Uh, probably.

389
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,112
I have something I'd like to say to her.

390
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,988
Could you pass it on for me?

391
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,617
[sighs]

392
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,120
[Mr. Joo in English] Wait!

393
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,746
Excuse me!

394
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,164
[Mu-hee sighs]

395
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,335
I got something for you to translate.

396
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,255
At this restaurant,
the chef is a hashtag two-timing cheater,

397
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,173
man whore, and a pathetic jerk!

398
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,092
Cheaters must die.

399
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,803
You there. I curse you,
and I hope your business closes!

400
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,889
I won't translate profanity or curses
that might hurt others.

401
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,809
I don't wanna be involved further.

402
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,979
The woman back there
asked me to tell you this.

403
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,442
[intriguing music playing]

404
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,986
[in Japanese] The father of my child

405
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,029
is my ex-husband, not Yu-jin.

406
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,451
[chuckles] Even though
I knew it was selfish,

407
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,537
I wanted to rely on his kindness.

408
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:22,085
But if Ms. Cha Mu-hee
is able to change his mind,

409
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,338
I'd happily let him go.

410
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,007
[music fades]

411
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,719
[in English] She said I could have him?
Maybe you misunderstood?

412
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,554
I heard exactly what she said to me.

413
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,723
Why would she…

414
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,809
Maybe she's playing a trick on me
by saying that, and she's…

415
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,977
What does she actually want?

416
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,645
I repeated what she told me.

417
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,939
I mean, why would she say that to you?

418
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,357
It's just so weird.

419
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,693
Um, why would she be nice
when her life sucks?

420
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,361
I only pass on what people say.

421
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,822
I don't judge them
or think about their meaning.

422
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,408
Oh, fine. Then I'll go back for more info.

423
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,826
- Come, Papago.
- That's enough!

424
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,537
Cha Mu… Mu-hee?

425
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:03,084
It seems that man and you broke up,
so there was no… no infidelity.

426
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,669
The baby isn't even his.

427
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,171
The two of them must be--

428
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,255
In love?

429
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,216
That's what you're saying?

430
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,636
- I hate that.
- Exactly.

431
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,348
You make this anything more,
and you'll be the bad guy.

432
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,309
If I'm a crazy bitch,
that's none of your concern.

433
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,354
- I need you to interpret for me.
- I don't want to, Mu-hee.

434
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,564
If you wanna be crazy or bad,
that's on you.

435
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,441
I'm not gonna take part
in hurting someone.

436
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,611
You don't need an interpreter
to have your misguided anger

437
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,154
accurately conveyed.

438
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,989
Might as well use a language
that's universal.

439
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,452
Best of luck to you.

440
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,957
You've said you wouldn't judge me,
yet I'm somehow the villain?

441
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,459
[melancholy music playing]

442
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,337
Their love's good and pure,

443
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,423
so everybody else can go to hell, right?

444
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,682
He told me it was over for good.
Then he was gone.

445
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,143
He's done this before,
so I thought he'd return.

446
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,814
Then three months later, he shared a post
talking about a fresh start.

447
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,607
So I came here to find him.

448
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,696
You can judge it as crazy,
but this is love too.

449
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,574
I don't want to end it like this.

450
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,873
Just help me finish this
with a little dignity.

451
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,379
I ask you to translate for love.

452
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,507
Please help.

453
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,639
- [in Japanese] Hey, Yu-jin.
- [music fades]

454
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,767
Yes, everything is fine here.

455
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,353
You'll be back tonight?

456
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,147
[chuckles]

457
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,232
No, I wouldn't want you to hurry.

458
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,068
Come back tomorrow as scheduled.

459
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,528
Yes.

460
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,781
Okay, see you tomorrow.

461
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,367
[disconnect tone]

00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,620
[knocking at door]

463
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,833
[sighs] Sorry, but we're closed…

464
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,385
[in English] I see
that you might have a kind heart.

465
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,598
But well, there's something
I need to ask you.

466
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:27,520
[translating in Japanese]

467
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,233
[in English] When your boyfriend
and I were together,

468
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,236
from time to time,
he would disappear on me and

469
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,781
leave me for weeks on end.

470
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,950
Was he spending time with you instead?

471
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:44,245
[Mr. Joo translating in Japanese]

472
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,248
[scoffs softly]

473
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,251
[in English] Wow! So, I'm right.

474
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:54,547
But, of course,
he betrayed me and cheated a lot.

475
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,095
[Eiko speaking Japanese]

476
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,476
[in English] He comforted her
and helped in her time of need.

477
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,897
Well, she can't say
the man's a saint for cheating.

478
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,191
He's helping because she's a charity case?

479
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:16,069
Maybe he held on
because he feels sorry for her.

480
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,862
[jaunty music playing]

481
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,739
I'm assuming you're saying things
out of anger,

482
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,199
and I won't translate them to her.

483
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,285
Please be kind and keep some dignity.

484
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,374
[Mu-hee clears throat]

485
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,047
Still, though,
he returned to me afterwards.

486
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:40,802
But now he'll feel stuck with the baby
and you both clinging to him.

487
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,305
And, no,
I wouldn't even bother taking him back.

488
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,979
Since you've refused to translate,
tell her, "Congratulations."

489
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,235
Your love's off to a bad start, but I, uh…

490
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,904
I wish you the best.

491

[music stops]

492
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,664
[speaking Japanese]

493
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,918
[in English] There's something
she wants to explain to you.

494
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,089
[in Japanese] Actually,
Yu-jin and I have been dating

495
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,675
since he was studying in Japan.

496
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:25,430
But his heart was stolen by another woman.

497
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,188
She was abandoned by her family

498
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,816
and had no one to turn to,
helpless in a miserable situation.

499
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,402
It was as if

500
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,949
she was the tragic heroine of a movie,
weighed down by a burden of misery.

501
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,578
Every time, I would try to make him stay,

502
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,665
but he still left,
saying he couldn't leave her alone.

503
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,003
[in English] Who

504
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,172
is she talking about?

505
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,258
[translating in Japanese]

506
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,220
That woman is you.

507
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,307
[in English] Tell me what she said.

508
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,185
Please tell me.

509
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,147
[Eiko in Japanese] The one
who used their misery to be loved

510
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,650
is you.

511
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,861
[melancholy music playing]

512
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:27,408
Even after realizing her man betrayed her,
she still came all this way. [laughs]

513
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:32,038
She must have been really lonely
to throw away her pride like this.

514
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,751
- [in English] Just, well--
- Don't translate, Papago.

515
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,047
I refuse

516
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,424
to understand this woman's words

517
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,718
and give her any satisfaction.

518
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,220
So what do you want?

519
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,680
[sighs]

520
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,931
I'm not sure.

521
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,184
Oh no, I think I'm about to cry.

522
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:59,065
If I cry in front of that woman,

Following a famous actress
makes me nervous.

697
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,869
Why would you be nervous?
No one would call me famous.

698
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:37,953
Well, you might be.

699
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,665
You have mentioned earlier you might
blow up and become a huge star.

700
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,752
Then strangers would see my account. No.

701
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,046
[laughs]

702
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:50,424
You seem to say things,
well, in very flattering ways.

703
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,218
[laughing]

704
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,386
Let's head back down.

705
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,015
The observatory has a beautiful view.

706
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,476
However, if we go,
we'll be late for dinner.

707
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,395
This is your second time here?

708
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:04,813
Yeah.

709
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,732
And you're here again?

710
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,275
Alone?

711
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,945
This island's legendary.

712
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,029
[soothing music playing]

713
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,865
The dragon god of the sea
fell in love with a fairy from the heavens

714
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,576
and created this land
to give as a gift to her.

715
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,286
Oh! Hmm.

716
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,455
The dragon god was invested.

717
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,666
I came here with someone before

718
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:26,126
who wanted this place
as a present for her birthday.

719
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,838
Today's her birthday, so I'm here
to see how much I've missed her.

720
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,927
She wanted an island for a birthday gift?

721
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,222
So you came here wishing to be with her.

722
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,224
You're talking about love. Who is she?

723
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:43,602
[melodic ukulele music playing]

724
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,523
What's wrong?
You know everything about my love life.

725
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,191
It's fair to tell me yours.

726
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,610
I'm under no obligation to share
that with a stranger. Why would I?

727
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,487
Actually, because we're strangers,

728
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,906
you're free to speak
since you'll never see me again.

729
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,951
You know everything about me,
so don't get embarrassed.

730
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,624
I knew her a long time ago.

731
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,751
And even then,

732
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,962
I was fooling myself.

733
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,797
I misunderstood her like you did.

734
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,383
Oh no!

735
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:17,845
So, then, she confessed
in a roundabout way

736
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,597
and thought you were saying no.

737
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:25,436
You didn't offer for her to come this year
since it's her birthday today?

738
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:29,106
She has somebody in her life
that she celebrates with now.

739
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,274
[gasps]

740
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,990
So let's get going.

741
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,162
[Mu-hee] Uh…

742
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:44,788
Hey, wait up.

743
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:45,873
[music fades]

[Mu-hee breathing heavily]

746
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,810
I think we're almost there.

747
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,854
We could ask someone for directions.

748
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,606
Japanese is a language you know.

749
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:11,565
No way.

750
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,528
I know where we're going.

751
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,240
Just this way. Two more blocks there.

752
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,200
But…

753
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,494
We're going in circles.

754
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,079
[train crossing warning]

755
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,997
- My phone says it's this way.
- Stop. Stay there.

756
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,505
The restaurant isn't far.

757
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,382
It's down this way, not back there.

758
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,426
- It's this way. I'm correct.
- Let's bet for real?

759
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,970
I win the bet, you follow me.

760
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,139
Because reaching 10,000 followers
is that important?

761
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,767
Yes. To me, it is. You agree to the bet?

762
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,769
[chuckles]

763
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,317
Hey! Excuse me. Do you live here?

764
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,528
- Hi. I need to find this place.
- [phone ringing]

765
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,904
[Mu-hee] It's a restaurant.

766
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,531
- Hey, Jin-suk.
- [Mu-hee] Is it that way?

767
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,782
I'm traveling.

768
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,827
In Japan? I'm asking
because today is Ji-sun's birthday,

769
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,995
but we had a fight, and I can't find her.

770
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:10,165
She put up a photo on Instagram.
It might be in Japan.

771
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,293
Could you take a look and let me know
if you can maybe find her?

772
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,713
[wistful music playing]

773
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,135
- [in Japanese] It's that way.
- [in English] This way? [laughs]

774
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,636
Thanks for the directions.

775
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,721
[laughs]

776
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,433
Hey! You! The restaurant's this way.

777
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,976
So, I win. [laughs]

778
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,981
[music fades]

779
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,567
Something wrong?

780
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,819
The woman who wants the island…

781
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,821
I just heard she came here today.

782
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:41,864
[gasps]

783
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,699
Terrific!

784
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,160
Hurry up, then. Go be with her. I'm fine.

785
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,331
This opportunity's a gift.

786
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,877
Don't waste it on me,
or you'll end up alone again, Ho-jin.

787
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,048
This time,
don't act like you don't get her.

788
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,259
Then things can change.

He's gone.

Oh, well.

794
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,885
It's a shame.
I don't know how to reach him.

795
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,396
I hope he follows me.

Today's our last day of shooting.

but I still don't understand
what the movie is about.

861
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,428
Is this a horror flick or a comedy?

862
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,557
The director is a genius.

863
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,684
No one would even dare judge his vision.

864
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:24,354
This is your first big role.
I'm honestly worried about your career.

865
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,940
Even the name of your character is weird.
Do Ra-mi.

866

"Do Re-mi," maybe.

867
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:34,573
If anyone thought this movie'd be a hit,
they wouldn't have cast me for the lead.

868
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,160
I have to give it 100%.

869
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,121
Today may not be the last day.

870
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,082
There was an issue,
and they might not be able to shoot.

871
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,293
Seems like the director
and the stunt guy clashed.

872
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:50,380
We still have to do the setup,
