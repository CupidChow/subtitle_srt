1
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,604
Oh!

2
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,232
I've always wanted to try one of those.

3
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:26,943
Is that right?

4
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:33,742
Mmm.

5
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,455
Mmm.

6
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
This is really good.
What's "delicious" in Japanese?

7
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,338
- Uh, <i>oishi.</i>
<i>- "Oishi? Oishi."</i>

8
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,808
<i>Oishi, </i>right?

9
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,936
<i>- Oishi.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

10
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:17,744
Oh, no.

11
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,768
- You need to.
- Hiro, come on.

12
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,707
Cha Mu-hee handles things so well.

13
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,460
Even though Hiro is acting like a diva,
she sees the best in that guy.

14
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,212
You're right.

15
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,340
No matter what Hiro says, she's smiling.

16
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:15,510
I don't think he's funny at all
if you ask me.

17
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:19,055
If she's faking that smile,
Cha Mu-hee's a truly talented actress.

18
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,438
Was the hot dog that good?

19
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,152
I've worked with you for over five years,

20
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,321
but today's the first time
I've seen you finish junk food.

21
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,949
I know, right?

22
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,994
I downed that whole mountain of calories.

23
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:45,790
I was just copying her "delicious,"
but ended up finishing the whole thing.

24
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,209
If you enjoy the food,
the calories don't count.

25
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,502
Just look at it that way.

26
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,172
That woman's a bit strange, you know.

27
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,424
She's always smiling.

28
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,802
Even when I act cold and distant,
she keeps smiling.

29
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,345
God knows what's so amusing.

30
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,517
And she gives me stuff like this.

31
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,937
She's up to something.

32
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,856
You reckon?

33
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,859
It looked like she was just
genuinely enjoying herself.

34
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,944
Genuinely enjoying herself?

35
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:15,862
With me?

36
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,030
Yes.

37
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,116
It looked like she was on a date
with a guy she likes.

38
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,787
In moments like that,

39
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,665
there's something different
about a woman's smile.

40
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,626
I guess you could say it glows.

41
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,961
She was glowing?

42
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,548
Because of me?

43
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,826
A four-leaf clover.

44
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,160
Hmm.

45
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:47,996
Oh.

46
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,253
Her legs will fall asleep
if she stays like that.

47
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,111
Oh, wow, she found one.

48
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,499
She's so happy.

49
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,092
<i>Did you have a good day?</i>

50
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,471
<i>You looked like you had</i>
<i>a lot of fun on that date.</i>

51
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,973
<i>Yes, I had a lot of fun.</i>

52
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,560
<i>I ate delicious food and took some photos.</i>

53
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,773
<i>But watching the sunset</i>
<i>was my favorite part.</i>

54
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,446
Aren't you cold?

55
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,282
I can tolerate
hot and cold weather pretty well.

56
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,076
It doesn't feel cold at all.

57
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,332
Normally, I don't like the sunset.

58
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,209
It makes me feel sad.

59
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,004
Today's so beautiful and magical.
I love it.

60
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,010
<i>What's different about today?</i>

61
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,641
I've been alone a lot,
and the sun going down reminds me of that.

62
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,144
I think I'm happy
because I'm with someone.

63
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,565
Of the many sunsets I've witnessed,

64
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,528
today is by far the most beautiful.

65
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,989
<i>I guess you'll always remember</i>
<i>this moment.</i>

66
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,117
<i>Perhaps forever.</i>

67
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:03,714
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

68
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,550
I'm just wondering.

69
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:09,220
From now on, will Producer Park be filming
the interviews instead of Producer Kim?

70
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,305
Producer Kim has already left.

71
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,391
He's on a plane to Seoul already.

72
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,392
Oh?

73
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,603
An emergency came up,
so he had to go back there.

74
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,523
I… I hope that everything will be okay.

75
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,774
Ah, it's…

76
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,776
I won't go into the details,

77
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,737
but you don't have to worry
or think about it.

78
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,532
And just so you know,
the production crew has no idea.

79
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,702
Another producer is going
to come here quickly.

80
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,121
Until the new producer arrives,
we'll keep this between us.

81
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,038
Sh.

82
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,292
Will we be filming more, or should we wait
until the new producer gets here?

83
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,794
- Oh--
- No, no, no. Tomorrow's shoot is canceled.

84
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:46,257
Uh, are we still going to see
the aurora borealis?

85
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,758
That won't be canceled, right?

86
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,510
Mm-hmm. The Northern Lights.

87
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,846
It's the main reason
we're shooting in Canada.

88
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:55,433
- We have to get the shot.
- Of course! Can't leave until seeing it.

89
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,517
Absolutely!

90
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,395
Seeing the aurora borealis
can't be guaranteed, Mu-hee.

91
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,191
Uh, this time of year,
the probability is around 60%.

92
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,067
Since tomorrow's shoot is canceled,

93
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,987
our chances to actually catch it
have been reduced significantly.

94
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,114
If we're lucky, we'll see a glimpse of it.

95
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,657
- Oh?
- Yeah.

96
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,285
Don't worry.
Luck's on our side. I know it.

97
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:18,331
We'll see the Northern Lights.
I believe it.

98
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,124
- Huh?
- Don't be a downer.

99
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,586
What can we do?

100
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,713
30%? Those are decent odds.

101
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,052
Aurora borealis is kinda hit or miss.

102
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,637
No point in worrying about it.

103
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,515
They said it's unlikely.
I really wanna see it.

104
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,558
And I was hoping we'd see it together.

105
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,354
Well, you can sleep in late tomorrow
'cause we're not working.

106
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,397
Wait, hold on.

107
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,317
We won't be shooting tomorrow.
Let's grab a drink tonight, then.

108
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,570
Go get the soju
and some instant noodles, Yong-u.

109
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,489
Why would you pair soju
with instant noodles?

110
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,199
I have better food in my room.

111
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,034
Let's go. We'll have a night in.

112
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,869
Wait, in your room?

113
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,541
Sure. Um, why not?

114
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,504
Wait a minute. I'll change
into something more comfortable.

115
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,800
I'm only going there to drink.

116
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,475
I'm not there to exercise.

117
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,317
Too clubby? Like I'm headed out?

118
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,280
Where are my clothes?

119
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,044
Oh, hey.

120
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,507
Soju is in the fridge.

121
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,593
Thanks.

122
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,441
Why don't we ask Ho-jin to join us?

123
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,277
Is he in his room? Does he want a drink?

124
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,778
He's not here.

125
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:13,779
What?

126
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,116
He wanted to use his free time
to go to a bookstore.

127
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,703
He's read all these books already,
and now he's out to get some more.

128
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,912
That guy's awesome.

129
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,629
That's Joo Ho-jin for ya.

130
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,090
He reads tourist pamphlets
in different languages.

131
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,218
How do you like your squid?

132
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,220
Medium rare?

133
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,543
<i>Congratulations.</i>

134
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,213
<i>Your books are selling</i>
<i>like hotcakes in Canada.</i>

135
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,048
<i>I hope you get rich.</i>

136
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,610
<i>I heard this place is</i>
<i>a popular local spot.</i>

137
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,029
<i>That's why I wanted</i>
<i>to try the hot dogs here.</i>

138
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,617
<i>Here you go. Enjoy.</i>

139
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,910
<i>Thank you.</i>

140
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,919
- Thanks for waiting.
- Oh.

141
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,296
- Hope you enjoy it.
- Thank you.

142
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,383
Oh wow.

143
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:07,977
Oh!

144
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,895
This is so great.

145
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,037
Hmm. His vision's pretty good.

146
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,712
This one's in Korean.

147
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,341
What kind of books do you like?

148
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,605
Joo Ho-jin, you're back already.

149
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,607
Yeah.

150
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,156
I had a few drinks with Yong-u
since we're not shooting.

151
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,616
But we cleaned up.

152
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,994
When he gets drunk,
he falls asleep right away. He's out.

153
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,662
Just leave him like that.

154
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,508
Well, I'll get going.

155
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,426
All right, see you.

156
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,845
Have a good night.

157
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,820
Those are my glasses, I think.

158
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,740
Was he checking me out or what? Weird guy.

159
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,076
Did he want me to stay?

160
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,538
Well, he could have just
asked me to stay for a drink.

161
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,122
Goodness.

162
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,548
- Cha Mu-hee.
- Oh, shoot. Yes?

163
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,882
You left your phone.

164
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,676
Oh! Thanks.

165
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,761
And please give me my glasses back.

166
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,682
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't know.

167
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,561
I accidentally left with them on.
I was just reading a book.

168
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,813
I borrowed them because my vision is bad.

169
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,567
They are the right prescription.
I even forgot I was wearing glasses.

170
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,403
They're nonprescription glasses
for protection.

171
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,575
Ah! You have good vision. I'm glad.

172
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,661
They're a little bent.

173
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,749
Uh…

174
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,295
Want me to lend you that book
because you liked it?

175
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,463
There's a version of this

176
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,092
where borrowing the book
would make it less embarrassing.

177
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,469
Okay, please get it.

178
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,805
I'll get it. Just a second.

179
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,773
I forgot the key.

180
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,905
There is no 24-hour concierge here.

181
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,003
No one's awake to help us. It's too late.

182
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,758
Yong-u is still out. I tried calling.
He gets like this when he's drunk.

183
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,136
You should go back to your room.
Sleep a little bit.

184
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,139
You're just going to stay out here?

185
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,309
I saw a sofa I can sleep on
in the hallway.

186
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,521
Well, I'll wait for an hour or two.
He might wake up.

187
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,359
All right, I'll try calling him again.

188
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,534
My key.

189
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,706
I also left the room key inside.

190
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,584
I hope you're just messing with me.
It's a real problem.

191
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,044
Seriously.

192
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,640
You're sleeping here tonight?
It'll get too cold.

193
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,809
It'll be fine.

194
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,144
Go and knock on the writers' room door.

195
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,689
I will. Good night, then.

196
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,675
Oh, I'd better just stick around here too.

197
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,927
Yong-u should be awake in an hour.

198
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,346
I don't wanna be rude and wake up Ms. Cho.

199
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,274
I didn't really read that novel earlier.

200
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,608
What's it about?

201
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:17,369
It's kind of a, uh, mystery novel
they turned into a movie.

202
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,163
Oh, I'm sure that book's great.

203
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,040
Yeah, it's pretty good.

204
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,334
One of the characters gets killed,
but there's no murderer.

205
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,086
And that's the big reveal. Ah!

206
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,881
You spoiled the best part!
Damn it, Ho-jin.

207
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,091
You wanted to read the book?

208
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,386
No, please keep going.

209
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,515
In a peaceful, crime-free village,
a minor event changed it all.

210
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,145
An unmarried guy committed a petty crime

211
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,688
and got ostracized.

212
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,357
Everyone in the village shunned him.

213
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,736
One day, he gets beaten to death
by a widow, his neighbor.

214
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,571
They're trying to find out why.

215
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,573
They start by examining the villagers.

216
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,617
One by one. Then, bam!

217
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,538
- And, well…
- I wasn't scared at all.

218
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,083
Really? You were just acting scared,
were you?

219
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,841
In the end, the dead guy gets resurrected.

220
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,967
You're making that up.

221
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,594
- I swear it's all true.
- You're lying.

222
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,299
- Oh.
- Oh, you're up.

223
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,553
I must have fallen asleep. I was so tired.

224
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,013
What about Yong-u? Is he awake?

225
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,474
Were you able to get into your room?

226
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:03,934
Not yet.

227
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,021
- I'd better go wake him up, then.
- There's a market in town.

228
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,235
You're welcome to join. Wanna go together?

229
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,655
Yeah, sure. I'd love that.

230
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,994
<i>Stuck in my throat</i>

231
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,788
<i>Round and round</i>

232
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,624
<i>I wanna speak out</i>

233
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,918
<i>But no one's there</i>

234
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,629
<i>Echoes of my voice</i>

235
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,299
<i>Answer alone</i>

236
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,051
<i>Tell me the truth</i>

237
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,888
<i>What don't I see?</i>

238
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,890
<i>Stuck in my thoughts</i>

239
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,684
<i>I walk till I fade</i>

240
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,770
<i>I feel the love…</i>

241
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,440
- Wanna try an apple?
- These look good.

242
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,901
<i>But why am I blue…</i>

243
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,904
Ho-jin, I got carrots.

244
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,157
<i>Round and round, my life just goes on</i>

245
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,669
<i>I greet the breeze</i>

246
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,339
<i>And nod to the trees</i>

247
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,675
<i>I hear the winds reply</i>

248
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,177
Miss!

249
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,014
You can't walk under the ladder.
It's considered bad luck.

250
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,516
Something bad might happen.

251
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,730
I'm sorry.

252
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,321
Why did the woman at the market say that?

253
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,491
Walking under an open ladder
is considered bad luck here.

254
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,368
People take it seriously.

255
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,454
Is that so? What am I gonna do now?

256
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,793
Should I throw salt over my shoulder?
I'm superstitious. It's gonna work.

257
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,171
I had a feeling you'd believe that.
I saw you found a four-leaf clover.

258
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,799
You did?

259
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,468
I really hope to see the aurora tonight.

260
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,096
A four-leaf clover can bring you luck.

261
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,348
Lucky enough to see the aurora borealis.

262
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,643
So I was gonna get seven. Lucky seven.

263
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,312
I wanna find them by the end of today.

264
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,399
So far, I have five.
Fingers crossed, okay?

265
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,820
If I don't find them in time,
we won't be able to see it.

266
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,616
I understand, but does that mean
if we don't see the lights,

267
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,076
it'll be all your fault?

268
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,622
Hey, what makes you say that?
That's kind of cruel.

269
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:35,252
Why? You put that on yourself,
saying it was on you if we see it or not.

270
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,629
I just agreed with you.

271
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,424
It doesn't help if you agree.

272
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,217
Just empathize instead.

273
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,219
You could comfort me by saying,

274
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,722
"No, Cha Mu-hee,
it wouldn't be your fault."

275
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,808
Or "I believe in you!
Yes! You'll find 'em tonight."

276
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,020
Just say, "You can do it! I know you can!"

277
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,064
So an aurora

278
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,860
is a luminous event that occurs
when charged particles collide

279
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,654
with, uh… with the atmosphere on Earth.

280
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,991
For the record, let me tell you,
the clovers have nothing to do with it.

281
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,326
What a relief.

282
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,785
And also,

283
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,163
as for finding two more,

284
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,498
I wish you luck, okay?

285
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,506
I get it. You don't believe in this.

286
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,549
I thought so, okay.

287
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,969
Honestly, anticipating anything
brings feelings of anxiety.

288
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,056
That sort of energy is a waste
and doesn't change things.

289
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,351
Isn't it natural to be anxious
when things might not work out?

290
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,355
Still, you can believe
and start with that hope.

291
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,148
It could really happen.

292
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:44,237
Isn't that how your mind works
when you start anything, Joo Ho-jin?

293
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,743
What I'm saying is,

294
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,623
I want to find seven
and show you how beautiful the lights are.

295
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,084
Don't be so skeptical. Have faith, okay?

296
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,588
All right, then. I hope we see it.

297
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,761
KIM YOUNG-HWAN

298
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:08,929
<i>For real?</i>

299
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,098
<i>Don't just say that! I'll be hurt!</i>

300
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,433
<i>This deadline's killing me.</i>

301
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,852
<i>Hey, send a photo. Give me an update.</i>

302
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,063
If he had started writing earlier…

303
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,815
What's going on?

304
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,151
Praise doesn't help someone
who's already famous

305
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,820
and could have a Nobel Prize soon.

306
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,490
He still wants more.
He craves support and constant love.

307
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,327
I need five minutes.

308
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,414
Grab your things and go.
I'll join you. Gotta run a quick errand.

309
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,351
He said he'd be real quick.

310
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,646
Why is he taking so long?

311
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,237
Ah, yes. I got lost.
Now I know where to go.

312
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,238
A short walk and…

313
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,948
You got lost again?

314
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,703
Sometimes your head's in the clouds.
You can be pretty zoned out.

315
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,372
You leave your room key, go the wrong way…

316
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,167
I won't deny that
since I'm trying to find you right now,

317
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,627
but give me a second.

318
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,630
Tell me. What does the place look like?

319
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,340
Uh…

320
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:09,966
Oh.

321
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,968
Well, the Calgary Tower is close.

322
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,888
Then wait by the tower
and keep breathing deep breaths,

323
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,349
and I'll come rescue you, princess.

324
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,476
Princess?

325
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,149
Wait, it's the other way.

326
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,179
Joo Ho-jin!

327
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,606
I can't believe it's you!

328
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,525
Shin Ji-sun?

329
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:12,445
I can't believe I'm meeting you by chance.
I was thinking it couldn't be you.

330
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,949
What a surprise.

331
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,534
Why are you here?

332
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,786
I've taken over Jeong-su's place
as the producer.

333
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,289
I came straight from the airport.

334
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,832
Oh, so you're replacing him.

335
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,250
Yes.

336
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,879
I'm glad this happened. Do you have a car?
I have to go meet with writer Cho later.

337
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,298
Yes, it's close.

338
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,303
Cha Mu-hee!

339
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,818
Hi, there. It's nice to meet you.
I'm the new producer, Shin Ji-sun.

340
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,991
Hi, I'm Mu-hee. It's nice to meet you.

341
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,827
Look forward to working with you.

342
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,960
She was coproducer for
the South Korean season of <i>Romantic Trip.</i>

343
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,047
A famous producer from South Korea
with succesful shows under her belt.

344
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,299
A female producer named Shin Ji-sun.

345
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,384
And the shoot?
Are we starting immediately?

346
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,972
Shooting starts tomorrow,
which means you have today off.

347
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,016
I'd better work out all day,
then hit the sauna.

348
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:27,395
I got fat from sharing food
with that zombie. That zombie.

349
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:33,943
It's true that
you tend to gain weight very easily.

350
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,156
Tell her you don't eat much
out of fear of gaining weight.

351
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,284
I don't want to reveal my weakness
to that zombie.

352
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,121
By the way,

353
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,542
did it really seem that way
to you, Nanami?

354
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,629
It doesn't look like
you've gained much, no.

355
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,714
- I'm talking about Cha Mu-hee.
- Cha Mu-hee?

356
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,468
Oh. Did my comment
about her liking you bother you?

357
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,137
No, it's not that. I'm just worried.

358
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,724
I think I'd better keep my distance
and treat her more coldly.

359
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,519
Yes, for her sake.

360
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,278
I stepped out of the airport,
and I was so cold. I had to get clothes.

361
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,781
I asked the cab driver to stop
so I could buy warmer stuff.

362
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,992
Then I looked around and, suddenly,
that's when I spotted you.

363
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,244
Isn't that great?

364
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,287
At nighttime, it's cold here.

365
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,373
But if you need me
to get you anything, I will.

366
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,543
I didn't do a good job packing.
I need lots of things.

367
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,752
I got here in such a hurry.

368
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,047
With you here, I can relax and not worry.

369
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,173
Hmm.

370
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,593
So glad I found you.
What brings you both out so early?

371
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,723
Oh, we just went shopping for groceries.

372
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,725
At the store?

373
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,478
Even here,
you have to go buy bread, milk, and eggs?

374
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,981
You're as organized as ever, Ho-jin.

375
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,941
You're someone we can count on.

376
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,696
Well then, Mu-hee,
Ho-jin must've made food for you.

377
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,322
He's a good cook, right?

378
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,575
Oh.

379
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:07,495
Well, I don't know.
I haven't been able to try it.

380
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,289
You can just ask him to cook for you.

381
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,416
He knows his way around a kitchen.

382
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,879
All this talk of food is making me hungry.
How long before we get to the hotel?

383
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,423
Well, it might take another half hour.

384
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,175
Wanna go to a restaurant instead?

385
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,719
Oh, that's fine. I'll eat at the hotel.

386
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,890
It's because you stood under the ladder.

387
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,475
Now you have bad luck.

388
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,022
You look so sad.

389
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,441
The "happy you" won't last.

390
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,528
Just the lonely one.

391
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:46,117
So you lied about the key
so you could be with the guy you like.

392
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,746
It was in your pocket.

393
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,372
The whole time.

394
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,097
I know you're curious.
Something's up with the wedding, right?

395
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,476
Why are you here? What's going on?

396
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,989
Come on. Tell me. Why is she here?

397
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,368
What's going on with her wedding?
It's her wedding. Tell me!

398
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,125
What… what about your wedding?

399
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,503
What's that?

400
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,173
Um, why did you come to Canada

401
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,093
if your, uh… your wedding
is scheduled for next week?

402
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,805
Ah, yes. Uh…

403
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:53,184
They needed someone to come quickly,
and I was the only person available.

404
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,228
So I packed my bags, and here I am.

405
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,985
Is Hiro at the same hotel?
Would it be okay if we go there now?

406
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,737
I have to say hello to him.
I should go right away.

407
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,832
My manager knows I'm here.
He's on his way.

408
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,418
You two go ahead
since you have work to do.

409
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:21,588
Oh. We would have dropped you off first
if you had told us.

410
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,258
I'm sorry. We'll see you later
at the hotel, I guess.

411
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,427
Ho-jin, let's get going.

412
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:32,807
Hey.

413
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,853
Take your jacket.

414
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,607
I don't need it. You hold on to it.

415
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,987
You're gonna be okay, Ho Jin?

416
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,532
You ran away, and she still followed you.

417
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,286
You didn't know she was planning
on coming here, did you?

418
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,622
I really didn't know.

419
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,545
I'm not gonna wear it. Take it back.

420
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,444
<i>He really didn't know.</i>

421
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,448
I'm aware of that.

422
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,577
<i>He didn't know she was coming,</i>
<i>but he also didn't comfort you.</i>

423
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,748
<i>Which means you're nothing to him.</i>

424
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,218
Has it been a fun experience?
How's the shoot going?

425
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,302
What about your wedding?

426
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,554
You're here even though
you're getting married next week?

427
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,764
Are you guys all set?

428
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,519
What's left to prepare right now?
We have the ceremony, and then that's it.

429
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,312
Jin-suk's fine with that?

430
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,774
He didn't mind at all that… you came here?

431
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,359
You know Jin-suk.

432
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,153
He listens to me
and just keeps going on as always.

433
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,571
Why would he say anything now?

434
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,492
<i>Let's just get it over with.</i>

435
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,706
If we don't do it now, we never will.
Both of us will get cold feet.

436
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,717
So tell me, why do you wanna do this?

437
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,511
Hmm? You said you wanna get married.

438
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,688
Forget it.

439
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,857
Thinking about all this
gives me a headache.

440
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,568
Anyway, we're working together now.

441
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,363
I look forward to this project
with you, Ho-jin.

442
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,076
Hiro's assistant, Nanami,
speaks English very well.

443
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,163
Please ask her if you need help
and if any problems come up, okay?

444
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,664
Mm.

445
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,208
Oh, thanks for the tip.

446
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,420
Yes, I'm at the hotel, Ms. Cho.

447
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,691
There's one more left to find.

448
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,630
It's the zombie.

449
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,470
Oh.

450
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,809
Why are you here?
Everyone's waiting over there.

451
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,227
They wanna see you.

452
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,772
What are you doing here?
Why did you come here?

453
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,109
Meeting. Your meeting.

454
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,862
Over there. You have people waiting.

455
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,489
Waiting. Now waiting.

456
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,158
Meeting?

457
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,952
You came to meet me?

458
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:21,869
Waiting.

459
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,454
You were waiting for me?

460
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,499
Why?

461
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,877
Ugh, I have no idea what he's saying.

462
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,170
Look.

463
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,590
We're colleagues who only meet for work.

464
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,425
You can't crash my day off like this.

465
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,845
That's too much.

466
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,931
He seems like he's in a rotten mood.

467
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,148
I don't have the bandwidth to handle this.

468
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,899
Go ahead.

469
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,893
The aurora borealis shoot
is tomorrow night.

470
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,230
There's no guarantee though.

471
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,067
You need to be lucky to see it.

472
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,783
So I've been trying to find
a bunch of these.

473
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,788
I want to see the aurora borealis

474
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,458
with the person I like.

475
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,088
But…

476
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,846
the girl he likes has arrived,
and she'll be at the shoot.

477
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,312
I collected a bunch of four-leaf clovers
for good luck.

478
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,239
Now he'll end up
seeing the Northern Lights with her.

479
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,791
So that's why…

480
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,171
I don't want the Northern Lights
to appear anymore.

481
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,929
Even though it's good for our shoot
and the story of our show.

482
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,396
I am still hoping they won't show.

483
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,279
Sorry.

484
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,697
I'm sorry.

485
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,163
I should head out now.

486
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,917
Thank you for listening.

487
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,046
Thank you. <i>Arigato.</i>

488
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,678
Aurora.

489
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,513
Clover.

490
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,390
I'm sorry.

491
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,558
Thank you.

492
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,437
I have absolutely no clue.

493
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,233
What could she be so sad about?

494
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,330
Hi, I'm, well, Jeong-su's replacement.

495
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,082
You can call me Ji-sun.
Glad to be working with you.

496
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,668
Shin Ji-sun! Shin Ji-sun! Whoo!

497
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,421
Shin Ji-sun! Whoo! Shin Ji-sun! Yes!

498
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,631
Shin Ji-sun! Whoo! Shin Ji-sun!

499
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,716
Yes. Yes, good!

500
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:07,595
Also, we have a chance
to see the Northern Lights tomorrow night.

501
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:11,849
The forecast says the sky will be clear
and our chances to see it are high.

502
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,267
It's never been this good.

503
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,394
So tomorrow, we're all gonna see it.

504
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,854
Go, aurora borealis!

505
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,484
Aurora! Whoo! Aurora! Go!

506
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,153
Aurora! Yeah! Aurora! Whoo!

507
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,405
Aurora! Aurora!

508
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,200
Whoo! Aurora! Aurora! Yay!

509
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,786
Oh, where's Hiro tonight?
He's not here with you?

510
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,331
Oh, he happens to be at the hotel.

511
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,208
He needs to do his evening workout.

512
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,213
Aurora.

513
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:43,923
Clover.

514
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,550
I'm sorry.

515
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,761
Thank you.

516
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,892
It's really bothering me.

517
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,479
Aurora.

518
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,231
Clover.

519
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:01,941
I'm sorry.

520
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,402
Ho-jin, try this. It's good.

521
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,322
- Joo Ho-jin, have another bite.
- Thank you. It looks good.

522
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,157
Yummy.

523
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,159
By the way,

524
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,663
I heard Producer Shin
is getting married to your brother, right?

525
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,249
It'll make her your sister-in-law?

526
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:21,252
Ho-jin and I have known each other
for a long time, so it's fine.

527
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,130
Good. You're having a small wedding
on Jeju Island.

528
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,715
That means going to South Korea
before Jeju.

529
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,552
You'll need to travel two days
to get to your wedding.

530
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,138
So who's replacing Ji-sun when she leaves?

531
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,558
In Canada, I'm in charge.
I'll stay here while we're here.

532
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,561
Really?

533
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,816
Our families are
the only ones planning on attending.

534
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,902
It's really a small party,
so we can have it a week later.

535
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,405
I see. You're pushing it back?

536
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,282
Great! Works out well for us!

537
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:54,368
If the wedding happens
when we're all back in South Korea,

538
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,328
we can attend and celebrate,

539
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,498
especially since
the younger brother's here.

540
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,376
You've postponed your wedding
to fill in last minute?

541
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,670
Ji-sun, your work ethic's remarkable.

542
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:07,673
<i>How is it that you can like</i>
<i>the same woman for such a long time?</i>

543
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,008
Isn't that incredible?

544
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:13,429
You asked if I felt like an actor
in a romantic movie,

545
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,599
but this movie is not romantic at all.

546
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,142
It's rather terrifying.

547
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,811
If I had to pick a genre for it,
it'd be horror.

548
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,771
- Horror?
- Yep.

549
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,484
You mean, like <i>The Quiet Woman</i>
with Do-Ra Mi?

550
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,653
Even though I hope it'll die,

551
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,115
it stays alive
and just starts over and over again.

552
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,409
It keeps following me
even when I'm done with it.

553
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,077
I really wanna get it over with.

554
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,205
Like a zombie that you try to kill,

555
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,790
but it comes back to life
to chase after you again.

556
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,793
I always think, "I want this to end,"

557
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,378
but I can't do it.

558
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:50,299
Yeah, that must be scary.
It must be terrifying.

559
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,967
It keeps haunting me.

560
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:56,639
I hope I can escape
and be done this time, once and for all.

561
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,432
I've been trapped.

562
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,063
<i>I can't believe this guy!</i>
<i>Your brother's crazy!</i>

563
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,649
<i>When he asked me to officiate,</i>
<i>I had to prepare a whole speech.</i>

564
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:10,528
<i>How dare he send me a text like that!</i>
<i>Suddenly the ceremony's postponed!</i>

565
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,946
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

566
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,324
So, uh, my brother
hasn't called you personally?

567
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,492
<i>Not at all.</i>

568
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,452
<i>Wait, is it nighttime over there?</i>

569
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,622
<i>Oh, I'm bugging you</i>
<i>in the middle of the night! I'm sorry.</i>

570
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,249
<i>Please, go to bed.</i>

571
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,543
I will. You should rest, Mr. Kim.

572
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:26,877
Okay.

573
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,580
Look at him.
She's just fine, and he's moping.

574
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,833
I hate this.

575
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,309
You're exhausted
'cause you thought this would be over

576
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,519
once the wedding finally happens.

577
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,646
So why is she here?

578
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,523
Did they have a fight?

579
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,026
Have you asked her?

580
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,738
I, um, didn't ask,
but there's a problem, I think.

581
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,198
It'll pass eventually.

582
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,451
Ji-sun is the type of person

583
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,537
who can handle and love my brother
and accept his free spirit.

584
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,041
Ah…

585
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,086
I guess she's… she's a great woman.

586
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,007
You think her getting married
will change how you feel?

587
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,343
She'll be in your family.
You'll see her constantly.

588
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,386
What happens if the truth comes out?

589
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,929
Things have gone too far.

590
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,474
Don't you think clearing the air
before they get married

591
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,310
would be the most healthy
and ethical thing to do?

592
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,022
Mu-hee, are you trying to console
and encourage me again?

593
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,941
I'm gonna be fine,
and this isn't really helping right now.

594
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:18,322
No, uh, I feel bad for you
because you couldn't escape from her.

595
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:21,784
Then stop getting in my way
and move aside so I can run away.

596
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,121
What if you ran with someone else instead?

597
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,916
To protect you from her and keep you safe.

598
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,168
Have another person nearby
so you can avoid her

599
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,545
and have someone by your side
because you're scared.

600
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,173
Don't you think I've tried
to be close with someone else?

601
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,014
Please go away.

602
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,768
Unless you wanna be used
and fill in for her as a rebound.

603
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,774
You're so mean.

604
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,736
Just stay in that zombie-like love
until you die.

605
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,722
NA JIN-SUK

606
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,891
- It's so pretty!
- Absolutely!

607
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,268
And to think
this almost wasn't going to happen.

608
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,395
We'll put the monitors over there.

609
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,148
Let's double-check the setups.

610
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,905
Looks like it's gonna snow.

611
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,242
And it's cloudy.
Not sure if we'll see the aurora borealis.

612
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,537
If we won't see it, that's it, then.

613
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,625
I hope there's plenty of snow tonight.

614
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:48,258
Mu-hee, Nanami is going to translate
for you tonight. Just this once, okay.

615
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,552
Oh, why?

616
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,138
Ho-jin's refusing to work tonight,
or what?

617
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:57,601
No, Ho-jin got into an accident
on the way here. It's nothing serious.

618
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,645
- What?
- What kind of accident?

619
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,562
Did he get hurt?

620
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,564
No, everyone's fine.
It was a fender bender.

621
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:06,443
He said it'll take a while to deal with,
but he didn't want us to be delayed.

622
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,112
We'll have to make do
with Nanami's interpretation

623
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,238
for tonight's shoot.

624
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,074
Hmm.

625
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,453
I hope he was okay
if it was just a fender bender.

626
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,917
Mu-hee, don't worry about it.

627
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,962
She said he wasn't hurt.
I'll give him a call to double-check.

628
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,588
I believe it's my fault.

629
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:30,050
I really hoped everything would be ruined.

630
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,762
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

631
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,978
We're ready to start shooting.

632
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,312
- Okay.
- Ready.

633
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,730
Good, let's start.

634
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,900
Nanami, you just need to make sure
they can communicate. Thanks.

635
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,027
Ay. I mean, yes.

636
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,711
The weather isn't good.

637
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,593
<i>Uh…</i>

638
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,513
<i>He says it looks like it's about to snow.</i>

639
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,565
Oh, um…

640
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,025
Snow.

641
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,359
Snow.

642
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:35,282
Ah, it looks like it's going to snow.

643
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,784
Mm.

644
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,423
Okay, let's wrap up tonight's shoot.

645
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,176
Bummer, we didn't see the aurora borealis.

646
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,803
- No Northern Lights?
- It's just not easy to catch it.

647
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:01,183
Okay, well, if we wait one more hour,
could we see it then?

648
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,061
- It's such a shame, otherwise.
- No, we can't. It's already 1:00 a.m.

649
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,188
Look at the sky.
There's no way we'll see it.

650
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,689
Wrap up. Everyone will catch a cold.

651
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,941
- Disappointing.
- It's already gotten so late.

652
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,070
We'll head back to the hotel.
Let's gather everything.

653
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,863
But we're here and set everything.

654
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,198
It's so sad.

655
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,658
I can stay behind
and shoot the aurora borealis

656
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,868
if it happens later.

657
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,369
It can be used as stock footage.

658
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,462
Are you also disappointed
that we didn't see the lights?

659
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,631
No, glowing.

660
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,637
You said that she glowed
when she was with me.

661
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,601
Of course! Yes!

662
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,812
Sure, I'm very ambitious.

663
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,814
I'm gonna blow up
and become really famous.

664
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,567
She seemed different today.

665
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,697
My interpreting probably fell short.

666
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,199
Your interpreting?

667
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,283
Yes.

668
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,495
I guess I failed
to convey your words accurately.

669
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,248
Ms. Cha Mu-hee

670
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:11,128
always heard you talk to her
through somebody else.

671
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,424
You're right.

672
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,136
She always heard someone else in her ear.

673
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,564
So it wasn't me?

674
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,530
PAPAGO♥

675
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:41,158
<i>I heard</i>
<i>you got into an accident. I'm worried.</i>

676
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,325
<i>Are you okay?</i>

677
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,503
<i>Please let me know,</i>
<i>no matter how late it gets.</i>

678
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,172
<i>I'll stay up and wait.</i>

679
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,066
<i>Please let me know when you're back.</i>

680
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:29,289
Shin Ji-sun,
I have a late-night snack for you. Oh.

681
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,543
She went somewhere?

682
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,087
Oh.

683
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:40,634
NA JIN-SUK

684
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,220
- No!
- <i>Ji-sun, don't hang up. Listen.</i>

685
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,638
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

686
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,933
<i>Let's get married</i>
<i>like we said we would. Please.</i>

687
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,976
<i>- It's not over yet.</i>
- Oh.

688
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,397
You heard that?

689
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,860
- Mm.
- Don't you dare tell this to anybody.

690
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,695
If you do, I'll murder you.

691
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:12,999
<i>I just got back.</i>

692
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,794
<i>Are you still awake?</i>
<i>Do you want to meet me outside?</i>

693
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,346
Joo Ho-jin!

694
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,186
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

695
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,438
Yeah, I'm okay.

696
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,400
I was running late
because the other driver got injured.

697
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,194
Oh, good. I'm so sorry.

698
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:43,363
For what?

699
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,241
I cursed you 'cause I was angry.

700
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:49,286
Do Ra-mi appeared,
said mean things about you, we danced.

701
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,455
It's my fault you were in that accident.

702
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:54,666
I'm really sorry.

703
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,960
It was the other guy's fault.

704
00:54:57,043 --> 00:55:00,213
He bumped into me and drove straight ahead
without looking at the road.

705
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,633
So, don't worry
because your curse did nothing.

706
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,056
Although what's been helpful was
the four-leaf clover.

707
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:13,935
They're beautiful.

708
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:51,348
You know, I am seeing the aurora borealis
thanks to you.

709
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,144
Well, I'm humble,
but I do deserve some credit for this.

710
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,022
Although I put the clovers in the garbage.

711
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,150
Which means they didn't bring us any luck.

712
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,277
That's not true.

713
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,363
There is still one left.

714
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,539
You still have it?
You kept it instead of throwing it away?

715
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,792
I saw how much effort
you put into your collection.

716
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,960
How could I throw it away
without your permission?

717
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:30,428
I guess, um,
we get to see the aurora borealis

718
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,263
'cause I wanted to see it so badly.

719
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:34,766
I helped

720
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,518
just a little bit.

721
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,400
You looked for a clover?

722
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:46,444
I was able to spot it
while the accident was sorted out.

723
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,489
I was pretty excited to see it too.

724
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,121
Our dream has come true.

725
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,665
It's nice to see it together.

726
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:04,087
It's so pretty.

727
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,307
Shall we get back inside?
It's getting late.

728
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:18,101
Let's stay a bit longer, Ho-jin.

729
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:22,772
We've been here for a while.

730
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,357
Uh…

731
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,900
Well…

732
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,028
The Northern lights rarely appear.

733
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,406
What if we never get a chance
to see this again?

734
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,491
We should stay here until we pass out.

735
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,508
She had her key card.

736
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:13,948
Do you mind staying here
just a little longer?

737
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,535
Okay, let's stay.

738
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,872
We won't get another chance, right?

739
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,172
Joo Ho-jin,

740
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,549
I heard this story somewhere.

741
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,428
There was a woman who taught her boyfriend
how to use chopsticks.

742
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,723
He wasn't good at it, so she taught him
how to use them properly.

743
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,225
Then she told him,

744
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,643
"If we ever break up,

745
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:44,979
you will be reminded of me
whenever you use chopsticks."

746
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,982
It's a true story. That's what he did.

747
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,319
That's brainwashing, what she did to him.

748
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,115
We're seeing the aurora borealis together.

749
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,535
So from now on,

750
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:00,912
you will think about me

751
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:03,206
whenever you happen
to see the Northern Lights.

752
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:13,716
Don't be scared.

753
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,762
The aurora borealis
will never occur in Korea.

754
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,181
Aren't you relieved?

755
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:57,218
Knowing her,
she'll do it in South Korea too.

756
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:04,267
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

757
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,124
Oh!

758
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:32,712
Three leaves.

759
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,132
She makes it look so easy.

760
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,099
Oh! A four-leaf clover!

761
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,270
Hey! Look!

762
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:50,813
I found one!
