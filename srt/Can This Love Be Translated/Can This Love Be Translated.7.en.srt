1
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,241
<i>The birds are flying…</i>

2
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,952
Ho-jin, glad you're here.

3
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,996
Ah, he's been drowning in his sorrows.

4
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,914
There.

5
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:45,795
Hey.

6
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,089
Let's go, okay?

7
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,966
Oh, Ho-jin.

8
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,303
You're crying in public.
It's embarrassing, okay?

9
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,345
Let's go. Get up.

10
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,767
Listen, she said
I broke up with her first,

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,351
but that's not entirely true.

12
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,270
That's not what happened.

13
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,813
She said I don't remember,

14
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,108
but I'm telling you,
I never did anything like that. I swear.

15
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,860
I know. Let's just go.

16
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,612
Tell me about it on the way home.

17
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,654
Come on. Get up.

18
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,657
Why would she say something
like that to me?

19
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,367
I'm losing it! What should I do?

20
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,244
Keep walking. Walk straight.

21
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,871
- Okay, sure.
- This way.

22
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:20,830
One, two…

23
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,540
<i>My life just goes on</i>

24
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,637
Hey.

25
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,724
You feel better? I'll drive you home.

26
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,520
- Take this.
- No.

27
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,022
Um… I don't want it.

28
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,114
Ji-sun would come
and get me whenever I got drunk.

29
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,710
What?

30
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,464
Mm-hmm. When my heart is broken,

31
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,635
I share my pain
and my sadness with everyone.

32
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,223
That makes you feel better?

33
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,182
Mm.

34
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,688
Yeah, when I express my feelings,
I always feel better, you know?

35
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,234
But people like you hold back
and just act like it's all good.

36
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,820
You try to fix it by yourself.
I just don't get it, man.

37
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,989
That's true.

38
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,866
I deal with it my way.

39
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,662
Why would I burden someone
with my emotions?

40
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,750
I don't understand you. You're so cold.

41
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,466
I'm just hiding my feelings.
Doesn't mean I don't have them at all.

42
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,392
It's easier to deal with them alone.

43
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,828
You're posting on Instagram?

44
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,831
Make sure the sponsored watch brand
is really visible.

45
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,709
Hey, listen, Mu-hee.

46
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,755
Nanami reached out to us earlier.
Her and Hiro just arrived in Seoul.

47
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,548
All right.

48
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,092
He has a gig in Seoul or something?

49
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,845
She asked if you were free by any chance.

50
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,639
Maybe he wants to meet up with you?

51
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,432
With me? Why?

52
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,893
You two were on the same plane.

53
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,811
Did something happen on that flight?

54
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,315
Oh.

55
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,567
We did see each other.

56
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,113
I was kind of in my own world.

57
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,242
I fell asleep after my glass of wine.

58
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,078
Maybe you have offended him
without realizing it?

59
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,623
You've been going crazy
over Ho-jin lately.

60
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,542
Seems like you're just losing it.

61
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,378
That's true.

62
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,381
I did act a bit crazy recently,

63
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,424
but it's all over now.

64
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,180
Well, if it's over, maybe you can stop
posting this depressing stuff?

65
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,100
These raindrops and black clouds,
you know?

66
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,769
I know you hope Ho-jin's gonna see it,

67
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,522
but I doubt he spends his time
on social media.

68
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,606
Hmm.

69
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,067
So, did

70
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,902
you talk?

71
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,862
I know you and Ho-jin have become friends.

72
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,617
No.

73
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,244
We haven't seen each other.

74
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,037
But sometimes, we just text.

75
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,414
What kind of texts?

76
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,499
Ah, you know…

77
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,336
Hey, wait, wait.
You can't just take my phone!

78
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,591
How do you know my password?

79
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,759
What?

80
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,177
You're moving in?

81
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,179
With him?

82
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,184
He's got a huge house, so I'm moving in.

83
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,521
We arranged it when we were in Canada.

84
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,566
I told him about my lease,
and he said I could move in.

85
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,152
It's for a few months
until I get myself settled.

86
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,905
Why wouldn't you tell me about this?

87
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,533
I didn't tell you
because I knew you'd react like this.

88
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,911
You would interrogate me
and ask me about him, what he's like.

89
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,205
We'll be shooting again soon.

90
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,540
You'll see him every day.

91
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,376
How can you work together
if you act like this?

92
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,677
I'm going to tonight's concert alone.
Don't come with me.

93
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,595
What?

94
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,223
It's a gig, and the concert
is sponsored by a client.

95
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,975
You'll meet with the agency staff as well.

96
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,020
You said I wasn't supposed
to interrogate you.

97
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,147
So leave before I cut your head off.

98
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,524
Fine, just go alone, then.

99
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,860
But at least message me later.

100
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,246
Now I feel like I'm lying outside
in the rain.

101
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,710
It would be nice and warm in his arms.

102
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,631
We can put things back together.

103
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,012
<i>So Do Ra-mi was wrong, and you were right?</i>

104
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,600
No.

105
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,436
I was wrong.

106
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,605
Run away!

107
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,859
Do Ra-mi was wrong.

108
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,656
It's my fault I ran away.

109
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,810
Hey, cut it out already.
I'm gonna get out of here. You'll see.

110
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:19,605
You hear me? You ran away on your own,
and you know that!

111
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,740
Hey, where are you?

112
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,825
You're running late?

113
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,078
Young-hwan and his publisher are here.

114
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,746
<i>Sorry, I can't make it.</i>

115
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,625
What?

116
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,087
You planned this whole thing.

117
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,550
You begged me to come because you said
you wanted to clear your head, dude.

118
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,469
You told me you need
to apologize to Young-hwan,

119
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,804
so you invited him and Mr. Oh.
Now what? You're bailing?

120
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:54,932
You're not coming now?

121
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,602
I'm at the airport.

122
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,145
I'm going to Santiago.

123
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,189
What?

124
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,273
<i>Ji-sun was right.</i>

125
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,526
I'm the one who broke up first.

126
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,070
JIN-SUK & JI-SUN

127
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,493
OUR STORY WILL BEGIN
UNDER THE CLEAR SKIES OF JEJU

128
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,078
You got exactly what you wanted
for the wedding invitations.

129
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,997
Do we need to do anything else?

130
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,124
We'll do whatever you want.
Just tell me, okay?

131
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,502
It's happening super fast,

132
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,420
and I won't be able
to do things the way I want.

133
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,633
Ji-sun, you keep bringing it up,
and you insist we do it soon.

134
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,928
Yeah, even though I don't know
if we'll be able to pull it off?

135
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,181
Let's just… get it over with.

136
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,228
If we don't do it now, we never will.
Both of us will get cold feet.

137
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,783
Babe, why do you… wanna do this?

138
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,577
Hmm? You said you wanted to get married.

139
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,055
I'm acting like a coward.

140
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,349
I'm embarrassed.

141
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,144
So, I, um…

142
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:27,275
I just need time alone
to think about what I did.

143
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,029
Have a safe flight.

144
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,158
Stop crying in bars, okay?
Stop drinking too much, Jin-suk.

145
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,785
Noted.

146
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,788
Ho-jin, dear, my wise little brother,

147
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,583
you better take your own advice.

148
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,792
My own advice?

149
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,252
What's up with that record?

150
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,005
I saw you staring at it all sad.

151
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,551
See ya.

152
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,803
I hope your trip sucks.

153
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,608
Oh…

154
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,735
- Good evening.
- Hello.

155
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:14,488
- Goodness, how are you? It's been so long.
- How are you?

156
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,324
Good, very good!

157
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,080
Kim Yong-u couldn't make it?

158
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,415
Something came up.

159
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:25,750
Oh.

160
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,379
The Italian ambassador is at the concert.
Would you like to say hello afterwards?

161
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,299
- Yeah, that's an honor.
- Ah, great. I'll arrange the meeting.

162
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,842
Thanks. Perfect.

163
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:39,138
Ho-jin, we have a situation.
Could you please help us out?

164
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,514
Sure. What is it?

165
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,434
Don't. I invited him here as a guest.

166
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,853
It'd be impolite to ask.

167
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:50,775
We don't have an interpreter,
so I'm unable to greet the theater staff.

168
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,443
They'll arrive soon enough.

169
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,904
- They're at Chungmu-ro.
- How far can it be?

170
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,906
Chungmu-ro is over an hour away!

171
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:01,285
You've been the ambassador for how long?
Yet you still don't know Seoul geography?

172
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,873
Isn't there anyone from the embassy
who can interpret for you?

173
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,960
I don't think they'll make it in time
with the traffic and all.

174
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,089
Uh…

175
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,300
Then would you like me to help?

176
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,135
That'd be lovely.

177
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,554
That would be fantastic.

178
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,640
- Thank you.
- No problem.

179
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:27,645
I prepared some opening remarks
for the concert.

180
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,605
Could you just help with those?

181
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,818
I'll just let the people I came with know,
and then I'll get ready.

182
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,444
Of course. Thanks a lot.

183
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,988
You're a lifesaver. Thank you.

184
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,921
Do you often come to the concerts?

185
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,840
I like them, but no. Do you?

186
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:56,841
This is my first one.

187
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,557
I'm starting to lose it.

188
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:12,523
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

189
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,601
Guess he's not coming.

190
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,067
Oh.

191
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,322
- Bravo!
- Amazing!

192
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,034
The ambassador's wife is a fan of yours.

193
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,953
When we're introduced…

194
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:08,871
Yes?

195
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,831
…there'll be an interpreter with us?

196
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,291
Yes, he'll be there.

197
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,835
They're waiting.

198
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,504
Hello, thanks for waiting.

199
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,348
Here is Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

200
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,778
"It's very nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming."

201
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,655
"We're big fans of Do Ra-mi."

202
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,245
Thank you so much for inviting me.

203
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,669
Mu-hee, you seem very tired.

204
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,797
It's okay. You don't have to come
to the embassy event.

205
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,383
The ambassador's wife invited you,
but it's fine.

206
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,471
Was this a different translator, this guy?

207
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,722
Sorry?

208
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,058
The interpreter
at the beginning of the event.

209
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,018
Um, it was a different person, right?

210
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,021
Oh, I wouldn't know, Mu-hee.

211
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,441
Was I just imagining that too?

212
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,236
Joo Ho-jin, where are you?

213
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,782
Are we still going to your house?

214
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,577
I had a call.
I couldn't get there on time.

215
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,997
Can you catch a ride
and come to my house with the CEO?

216
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,083
The CEO already left, so I'm stranded.

217
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,210
Wait. Just wait where you are.

218
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,838
The elevator's here.

219
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,759
I gotta go.

220
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,596
- Oh, Mu-hee, wait.
- <i>Going down.</i>

221
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,764
<i>The door is closing.</i>

222
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,808
Uh, get home safely!

223
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,935
Which floor are you going to?

224
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,566
Uh, I'm going… to the ground floor, sir.

225
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,902
- Thank you so much.
- All right, then.

226
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,822
You're Cha Mu-hee, right?

227
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,576
- Do I know you?
- Well, you're famous.

228
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,370
So I know who you are.

229
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,413
Ah.

230
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,000
And I was sitting
right next to you, Mu-hee. One seat over.

231
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,919
There was an empty seat in between.

232
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,213
- Ah, there was.
- Yes.

233
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,132
I hope you don't mind,
but I overheard you.

234
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,009
You're absolutely right.

235
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,346
It wasn't the same interpreter.

236
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,805
Oh?

237
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,850
I know the person
who was interpreting at the start.

238
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,853
The seat that was in between us?

239
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,523
That was supposed to be his seat.

240
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,234
He's someone I know well.

241
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,945
<i>Door opening.</i>

242
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,158
That's my friend right there.

243
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:52,910
Joo Ho-jin.

244
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,121
Glad you're here.

245
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,416
There were four of us
who were going to have dinner,

246
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,918
but two of them canceled.

247
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,004
Uh, I hope you'll join us
and fill an empty seat.

248
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,715
- You're welcome to stay.
- Ah, that's very nice of you.

249
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,009
But the owner of the house
hasn't invited me.

250
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,762
That doesn't matter.
This house almost belongs to me.

251
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,639
On paper, it's his.

252
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,766
But my guests are his guests.

253
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,934
Uh…

254
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,812
Because I'm starving,
I'll accept the free meal.

255
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:20,896
Terrific.

256
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,400
Don't mind the guy.
He's quiet, and he cooks well.

257
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,026
Think of him as a housekeeper.

258
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,992
Make yourself at home.

259
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,956
This place is a museum. You'll see. Yeah!

260
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,208
The first owner,
the person who decorated and built this,

261
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,043
traveled all around the world,

262
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,422
buying old art, antiques,
collecting porcelain.

263
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,466
Even old records.
You see the vinyls over there, Mu-hee?

264
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,427
This place needs to be showcased.

265
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,470
People would pay to visit it.

266
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,348
Oh, so I guess that was
Ho-jin's grandfather, am I right?

267
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,977
Yes! So, you knew that?

268
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,687
Have you been here before?

269
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,730
Oh.

270
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,857
Just briefly. Once.

271
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,734
Ah!

272
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,194
Then feel free
to relax and enjoy yourself.

273
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,699
Hey, my friend.
You going to start prepping?

274
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,577
Ms. Cha Mu-hee, what food do you like?

275
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,079
I like most kinds of food, actually.

276
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,581
But especially spicy food.

277
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,957
Spicy food?

278
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,835
You heard her.
What's spicy on the menu for tonight?

279
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,254
Jin-suk made the selection,
and he hates spices.

280
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,339
Really? Whatever.

281
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,051
Stir-fried octopus, then,
or braised monkfish.

282
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,136
- Mu-hee, sounds good?
- Very good. Thanks.

283
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,262
So be the chef.

284
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,139
I can't.
I don't have any monkfish or octopus.

285
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,307
- Cod, then.
- Sorry.

286
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,266
- Squid?
- Nope.

287
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,476
Blue crab?

288
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,145
- Can't make what I don't have.
- You do! Your fridge is always stocked.

289
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,939
You'll make spicy stir-fried squid.
That sounds good?

290
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,816
Stir-fried squid's great.

291
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,740
Very spicy.

292
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,664
He's a… good cook and a great guy.

293
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,625
- Of course.
- I see.

294
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,543
You know everything about him already.

295
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,504
You two are a match, I'd say.

296
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,298
- Excuse me. Sorry, one moment.
- Yes.

297
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,301
Yes. Hello, Mr. Oh?

298
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,457
Listen to me!
You can't come here! Turn around!

299
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,960
<i>But I'm almost there,</i>
<i>and I have the team leader too.</i>

300
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,294
<i>You told me to come.</i>

301
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,463
I know, I know,
but you can't come tonight!

302
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,984
Joo Ho-jin, may I do anything?

303
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,490
Should I cut this round thing?

304
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,785
Sit down, since you're Mr. Kim's friend.

305
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,503
Why did you come here, anyway?

306
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,632
Because my new friend invited me

307
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,093
for a meal together.

308
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,430
I'm super hungry.

309
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,267
Well then, you're super hungry
and want some food, okay.

310
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,146
I fail to see why you'd come
unless you're absolutely starving.

311
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,611
Oh wow!

312
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,113
What is this?

313
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,282
Oh! Smells so good.

314
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,785
It's broth with seaweed.
It hasn't boiled yet.

315
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,871
That's what it is.

316
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,457
So it's just like us.

317
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,379
We're broth with only seaweed in it.
Nothing's even begun.

318
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,555
Just please go sit in my living room.
It's too uncomfortable having you here.

319
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,894
You're not heating it?

320
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,438
It has to cool down first.

321
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,357
I'm using it as seasoning.

322
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,070
Um, look, Joo Ho-jin.

323
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,447
I know that

324
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,451
I took sips of broth
with nothing except seaweed in it.

325
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,162
It was me who turned off the heat.

326
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,542
Could we maybe have the water boil
instead of letting it cool?

327
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,838
It's a waste to stop
just after a little taste.

328
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,216
I think it's a shame.

329
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,847
I turned off the heat at the right time,
and it's cooling nicely.

330
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,975
No waste or shame. It is what it is.

331
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,520
It's just water with kelp to add flavor.
It'll be fine.

332
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,942
It's more than flavored water.

333
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,654
Okay?

334
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,781
I made a move by kissing you.

335
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,875
I was gonna fry that mushroom.

336
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,055
Should I try contacting Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

337
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,224
No. There's no need.

338
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,936
Once she finds out I'm in Seoul,
she'll get in touch.

339
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,357
Why not just reach out to her first?
You did come all this way to see her.

340
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,444
Nanami, I didn't come here
to meet that zombie.

341
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,987
I came to take photographs.

342
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,823
Look.
Aren't the fall night lights beautiful?

343
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,243
You can take pictures of fall scenery
anywhere in Japan.

344
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,456
It's different.
The cityscape is completely different.

345
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,958
- You can see it through the camera.
- Sure.

346
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,544
So you won't meet Ms. Cha Mu-hee
before you leave?

347
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,798
If she contacts me,

348
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:25,135
I guess I could see her while I'm here.

349
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,393
Mmm!

350
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,563
Spicy and absolutely delicious!

351
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,689
You're a great chef!

352
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,734
You should compete on a cooking show!

353
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,862
I went with him and his family
on that trip to Canada when he was young.

354
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,865
Mm. You've known each other for decades?

355
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,033
We're family.

356
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,161
You went to visit that park again?
The same one?

357
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,789
- It's where the shoot took place.
- Nice.

358
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,666
It was where we saw that double rainbow.

359
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,043
That waterfall.

360
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,925
I tried to find it… but couldn't.

361
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,178
That's too bad!
It was a special waterfall.

362
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,934
<i>It's just a waterfall</i>
<i>for you and me, Ho-jin.</i>

363
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,145
The waterfall water feels
so nice and cool.

364
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,082
Our little waterfall we saw

365
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,501
was pretty special too.

366
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,463
That wasn't a waterfall.

367
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,676
We agreed it was a beautiful waterfall.

368
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,262
I'm no longer in the mood
to go along with it.

369
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,931
You just keep on insisting
it was a waterfall, Mu-hee.

370
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,106
By the way,

371
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,442
you were at the concert.

372
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,696
Did you take the gig on purpose
because you knew I'd be there?

373
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,617
Why do you think that?

374
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,996
Why would I take on an assignment
knowing you'd be there?

375
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,040
You have done so before to meet me again.

376
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,542
The answer's no.

377
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,550
Then why didn't you sit down?

378
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,721
I didn't want you to be uncomfortable.

379
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,557
But why would you let Yong-u
move in with you?

380
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,100
I have to come here if Yong-u's here.

381
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,437
You've never been to his though.
That's what he said at least.

382
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,772
So you'd have no reason
to show up here either.

383
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,691
Very true.

384
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,110
That's fine.

385
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,533
You thought you could just come here,
assuming all that with such confidence?

386
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,872
I feel confident
'cause I wanna get you back.

387
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,665
I should

388
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,375
probably step back,

389
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,461
but instead,
I let this crazy demon take over.

390
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,754
She's controlling you!

391
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,088
So I just…

392
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,929
I got my hopes up
because of what you… said on that day.

393
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,313
You said you'd cross the tracks for me.

394
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,485
And I know…

395
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,823
That was a waterfall. I believe it!

396
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:10,151
Wow! Everyone needs to go
at least once in their lifetime.

397
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,570
Oh. We have though.

398
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,074
When that drone fell into a ravine,
we went to go get it.

399
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,369
Oh, that's right.

400
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,414
That wasn't fun.
I swore I'd never go there again.

401
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,041
- It looks amazing like that.
- Yeah, I know.

402
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,587
It's because it's a rom-com at a distance
and a tragedy from up close.

403
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,921
Am I right?

404
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,550
The real tragedy is the footage
we haven't been able to get to yet.

405
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,261
We've so much to do,
but my eyeballs wanna pop out.

406
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,347
Don't cry like a baby. I see a tear!

407
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,267
Yong-u, thank you so much
for bringing snacks.

408
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,686
And Mu-hee is fabulous, so don't worry!

409
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,022
Thank you. Good luck.

410
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,690
- I'll put these away.
- It's fine.

411
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,858
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

412
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,986
Leave the macarons for Shin Ji-sun.
She loves those.

413
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,738
It'll be an all-nighter again, right?

414
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,697
That's true.

415
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,866
Ji-sun will have more time
starting tomorrow.

416
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,200
Her fiancé went to Spain.

417
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,037
Spain? He's a writer, isn't he?

418
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,665
Yes, he posted on Instagram
that he's going to Santiago, Spain.

419
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,750
I wish I could be there.

420
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,210
We'll be in Italy soon.

421
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,671
It's a work trip.
You think we'll have fun?

422
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,565
NA JIN-SUK
#SPAIN #SANTIAGO #CAMINO

423
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:32,734
Mm.

424
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,365
<i>Thank you for your payment.</i>

425
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,533
<i>Print receipt.</i>

426
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,327
<i>You may now proceed.</i>

427
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,746
<i>Your transaction has been approved.</i>

428
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,790
<i>Please take all your belongings.</i>

429
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,689
Wow. She's making her way around town.

430
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,318
Thank you.

431
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,737
- To Yeonnam-dong, please.
- Of course.

432
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,995
Yes, hello?

433
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,580
I stopped by the editing room.

434
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,582
All good.

435
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,376
- The producers loved the coverage…
- Yong-u!

436
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,460
…they got of Mu-hee.

437
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,463
- The Canadian clips look great.
- Hey, my bag! Yong-u!

438
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,717
Italy's a different vibe than Canada,
so I'm looking forward to it.

439
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,510
They'll get fun footage for sure.

440
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,220
Hey, sorry.

441
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,389
I was on the phone with my CEO.

442
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,598
I couldn't hear you.

443
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,183
Thanks.

444
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,561
Is that your work outfit?

445
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,607
I mean this one.

446
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,944
Are you going to change
before going back into the editing room?

447
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,447
Sorry. I wasn't implying
you're cheating on him.

448
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,535
Well, these work shoes are comfortable.

449
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,914
Ah! One is for editing.
The other is for cheating.

450
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,292
Your plate must be full, working two jobs.

451
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,753
Did you hurt yourself?

452
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,810
An anterior talofibular ligament injury.

453
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,522
Anterior fibular what?

454
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,775
I was an athlete. I know injuries.

455
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,693
I'll wrap it up with tape.

456
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,236
If you let me.

457
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,634
- Are you okay?
- What?

458
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,135
Oh.

459
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,387
I thought I was fine,

460
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,556
but it hurts a bit
when I put weight on it.

461
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,267
Let me see.

462
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,118
Oh.

463
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,541
- Does that hurt?
- It does.

464
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,768
An anterior talofibular ligament injury.

465
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,937
Is that something serious?

466
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,024
It's a fancy way of saying
you twisted your ankle.

467
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,693
I knew you'd limp to work if you had to.

468
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,410
Which sport did you do
when you were an athlete?

469
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,536
I was a shooter.

470
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,246
For how long?

471
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,626
Until I started military service.
Then I got injured.

472
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,755
When I finished my service,
my mom's brother gave me a job.

473
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,801
Your mom's brother hired you?

474
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,221
That means the CEO of your company is--

475
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,349
Yes. He's my uncle on my mom's side.

476
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,061
Which makes you a nepo baby.
That makes sense.

477
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,690
I wondered why such a newbie
was working with Cha Mu-hee.

478
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,318
They put me to work right away.

479
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,154
Mu-hee was a nobody when we started.

480
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,617
Whenever she got a "no" after an audition,
I was always there to comfort her.

481
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,869
I'm sorry.

482
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,747
I take back my insults
and the other thing.

483
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,375
Then… take back what you said
about cheating.

484
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,631
I wish you hadn't told me anything.
Now I think about it when I see you.

485
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,803
You kept me company tonight
so I wouldn't have an affair?

486
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,847
And used my injury as an excuse?

487
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:13,890
Kinda.

488
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,435
Because I knew you were very hurt today.

489
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,355
But I'd rather be left in the dark.

490
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,607
So Jin-suk left, right?

491
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,074
You said you wanted to have an affair
so you'd never go back with him.

492
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,203
If you still have feelings for him,
just go to the airport and stop him.

493
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,874
You're so out of it. You lost your bag,
and you twisted your ankle.

494
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,502
Do you really want a meaningless affair?

495
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,629
You'll be alone
in an editing room all night.

496
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,881
It's so pathetic.

497
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,510
You're that worried for me, Yong-u?

498
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,389
Help me, then. That would be nice.

499
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,059
I know you like me a lot.

500
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,270
You've been hanging around,
hoping for a chance, right?

501
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,355
Do you wanna go for it?

502
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,321
All right.
What if I agree to help? What's next?

503
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,449
I'm a joke to you, is that it?

504
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,494
Shin Ji-sun, you're no joke.
I don't believe this is who you are.

505
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,412
Why not?

506
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,084
Before shooting,
you have to aim at the target.

507
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,044
And you have to really want it.

508
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,887
I'm going to aim and hit it
because if I miss, I'll get shot.

509
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,015
But you,

510
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,435
you're just not putting your heart in it.

511
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,273
That's why you won't pull the trigger.
Because you're doubting it, Ji-sun.

512
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,883
Thanks for your help, Yong-u.

513
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,516
You've pulled the trigger.

514
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,844
Should I contact Ms. Cha?

515
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,054
Don't.

516
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,598
No matter what, don't contact her first!

517
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,393
I'm not meeting that zombie
until she asks to see me.

518
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,313
Sure.

519
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,071
<i>Cha Mu-hee.</i>

520
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,657
<i>Why isn't she calling me?</i>

521
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:22,286
<i>After what she did to me</i>
<i>on the plane that day…</i>

522
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,915
You seem okay.

523
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,596
Hiro, it's too cold out.

524
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,781
Shall we eat too?

525
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,825
It'd warm us up.

526
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,327
No, thanks.

527
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,297
Ms. Cha Mu-hee

528
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,591
has not reached out.

529
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,974
Let's go back to the hotel.

530
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,523
TO CEO OH SEONG-CHEOL

531
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,067
TO CHA MU-HEE,
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE UNIVERSE

532
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,197
Hmm.

533
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,367
Here. Hmm.

534
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,496
I'll bring you Do Ra-mi merch and sign it
next time I see you, okay?

535
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,040
That would be great, my dear.

536
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,625
This is my latest book.

537
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,126
Thank you very much.

538
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,213
It's funny,
I never had a chance to meet a novelist.

539
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,422
You have met a novelist.

540
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,342
And there's another one.

541
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,469
What? Really?

542
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,181
Joo Ho-jin, you have written a novel?

543
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,308
Just one. I wrote a book in college.

544
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:11,687
It won a literary prize,
and it was even on the bestseller list.

545
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,233
I'd like to buy a copy of it.
Tell me the title?

546
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,486
- It's been out of print for years already.
- I have some at work.

547
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,947
You can come over to my writing studio.
I'll give you one.

548
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,157
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

549
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,827
I'd love to post a picture
of your autographed book.

550
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,247
Great! I'd be grateful.

551
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:33,417
I'll follow you on Instagram.
We should follow each other.

552
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,087
I was told if we follow each other,

553
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,006
your public profile might get chaotic,
and I wouldn't do that to you.

554
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,384
Oh, is that so? Hmm.

555
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,595
Then why do you and Ho-jin
follow each other?

556
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,389
But we don't follow each other.

557
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,932
Well, he follows you.

558
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,476
Tell her.

559
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,354
You've been following her.

560
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,815
- Uh…
- I saw it when I checked out your account.

561
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:00,653
So, uh… So you have…
You've been following me.

562
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,573
It was… the bet, you know?

563
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,576
I followed you
'cause we made a bet back then.

564
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,744
You see?

565
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,039
Oh, I see.

566
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,252
But I didn't know.

567
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,587
Really? You had no idea?

568
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,048
I have many followers on my socials.

569
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,725
Oh! You got buried, Ho-jin!
She had no idea!

570
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,687
It's just… I'm really sorry.

571
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,690
I should have followed back
because of the bet we made.

572
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,983
Well, we can't right now.

573
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,109
We don't have to.

574
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,737
- I don't need you to follow me.
- She offered. Just say yes. Accept.

575
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,696
That's it!

576
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,576
Are you finished?
If your tea cups are empty, you can go.

577
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,578
No, I still have some in my cup.

578
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,371
Here, Mu-hee, have another sip.

579
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,248
Sorry, but it's very late already.

580
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,333
Is it?

581
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,501
Oh, what time is it?

582
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,671
My favorite TV show is about to start.
<i>Love At First Sight.</i>

583
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,715
Let's watch it, then. I'm a fan too.

584
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:03,799
Great, let's do it.

585
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,260
I usually watch it by myself
and bawl my eyes out.

586
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,971
- Yeah, me too.
- We'll bawl while watching it together.

587
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,348
- Yep, let's do it!
- Great!

588
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,100
Oh, wait. I'm gonna need my glasses.

589
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,145
I think they're on your backseat.

590
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,366
Hmm.

591
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,660
Seems like you're having fun.
It's time to go home, Young-hwan.

592
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,830
Is it?

593
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,502
Well, I'm here already.
I might as well get going.

594
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,590
Now go back inside.
Don't leave Mu-hee by herself.

595
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:45,508
I get it. Stop.

596
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,928
At the concert, you bailed on us.
Your seat was empty.

597
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,933
You tried to avoid her?
Do you think she's that difficult?

598
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:04,110
You told me before that everyone on Earth
speaks their own language.

599
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,736
Mm-hmm.

600
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,740
And I am having a hard time
understanding her language.

601
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:17,039
I thought she was interested,
then she pushed me away.

602
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,793
I thought she rejected me,
so I avoided her.

603
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:23,045
And now she's here, acting like this.

604
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:29,051
Is she interested again,
or does she feel bad about what she did?

605
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,637
It's impossible to tell.

606
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,605
I don't wanna go back inside.
What do I say? I'm not sure.

607
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:46,026
It must be frustrating
not being able to understand her.

608
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,028
I see.

609
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,574
But are you just gonna give up now
because you don't understand her?

610
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,908
You're an interpreter.

611
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,788
It's an unfamiliar language.
You should probably just try to learn it.

612
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,248
The order of the words…

613
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,917
if she uses an exclamation point
or question mark.

614
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,086
All those things are different
from the way you speak.

615
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,840
Look for the deeper meaning
and translate it.

616
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,133
Do your best.

617
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,473
Good luck, my friend.

618
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:35,493
<i>The moon is shining bright</i>

619
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:40,831
<i>So softly through your eyes</i>

620
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,543
<i>We're dancing on the clouds</i>

621
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,004
<i>Don't know how to waltz</i>

622
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:55,179
<i>Your lovely gentle smile</i>

623
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,017
<i>Feels like a glass of wine</i>

624
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:05,564
<i>I see the dreams you hold inside</i>

625
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,568
<i>So don't let your heart run away</i>

626
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:15,115
<i>Farewell to loneliness</i>

627
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,203
<i>In every single night</i>

628
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:22,790
<i>Want you to know</i>

629
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:27,294
<i>Can't get you off my mind…</i>

630
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,505
The weather is great.

631
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,552
This song is perfect.

632
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,024
<i>Your lovely gentle smile</i>

633
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:53,862
<i>Feels like a glass of wine</i>

634
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:59,410
<i>I see the dreams you hold inside</i>

635
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:03,414
<i>So don't let your heart run away</i>

636
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:08,961
<i>Farewell to loneliness</i>

637
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:12,840
<i>In every single night</i>

638
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:16,552
<i>Want you to know</i>

639
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,263
<i>Can't get you off my mind</i>

640
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:23,267
<i>Your lovely tender smile</i>

641
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:27,730
<i>Keeps running through my mind</i>

642
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,608
<i>How would you know</i>

643
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:37,072
<i>If I could be the one?</i>

644
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:40,909
<i>So please come closer</i>

645
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:49,918
<i>We're dancing on the clouds</i>

646
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,921
<i>Don't know how to</i>

647
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,299
<i>Waltz</i>

648
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,645
Hi there. Everything all right?

649
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,939
I'm heading out. Thank you.

650
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,817
Where's Mr. Kim?

651
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,735
He had to go.

652
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,987
I didn't even say goodbye. I wish I had.

653
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,867
The food was yummy.
Really, it was so delicious.

654
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:22,951
Well, I'll go now.

655
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,370
Wait a minute.

656
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,584
Let me tell you something.

657
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,881
What are you hiding?

658
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,643
What is that?

659
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,396
That.

660
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,274
The book? It's what your friend
gave me earlier. That's all.

661
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,777
- There's something suspicious.
- What? These belong to me.

662
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,696
You're acting weird
and obviously hiding that.

663
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,780
- Show me.
- No.

664
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,948
What's that?

665
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:11,792
Wow!

666
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,382
Okay, I guess you must have X-ray vision.
How'd you know I stole it?

667
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,884
It was obvious by how you moved.

668
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,971
Look at that. I got it back.

669
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,604
You really have a knack for…

670
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,984
driving me completely insane.

671
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:42,656
Give it back to me
unless you wanna call the cops on me

672
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,907
'cause I just wanna leave.

673
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,094
What are you doing?

674
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,180
I bought it for you.

675
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,517
As a gift, when we were in Canada.

676
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,270
I didn't have a chance to give it to you.

677
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,731
Though it's no excuse for stealing it.

678
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:21,945
Well, thank you.

679
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,616
For the food, company, and gift.

680
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:29,411
Thank you for everything you've given me.
I won't forget it.

681
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:34,166
I'll repay you! Next time,
I'll buy you dinner and bring you a gift.

682
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:35,876
The next time?

683
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:41,882
Yong-u!

684
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,426
You said he was going to live here.

685
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,386
At the housewarming.

686
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,348
I can bring good food,
drinks, and a gift just for you.

687
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,309
See you next time, then.

688
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,901
Next time.

689
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,002
She forgot to take this.

690
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,856
I took the sleeve,
but I forgot the record.

691
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,862
I'm so stupid.

692
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:51,827
PAPAGO♥

693
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,424
<i>The record's still here.</i>
<i>You only took the sleeve.</i>

694
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,968
<i>Are you gonna steal it next time?</i>

695
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,054
I'm sorry. I forgot to take it
because I was in a rush.

696
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,974
This might be hard to believe,

697
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,268
but I didn't mean to leave it with you.

698
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,686
<i>Are you close by?</i>

699
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,482
Well, I'm… kinda far away already.

700
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,068
<i>Wait outside of your place.</i>
<i>I'll drive over to you.</i>

701
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,571
What? Huh?

702
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,114
You're coming?

703
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:32,075
Yeah. Yeah, just text me your address.

704
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,411
I'll be there soon.

705
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:36,872
Okay.

706
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,458
If it's a pain,
you don't need to come over now.

707
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,461
I'm already in the car. Should I get out?

708
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:45,756
No, don't. You're in the car,
you might just as well.

709
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,840
I'll be there soon.

710
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,926
<i>The birds are flying</i>

711
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,470
<i>I heard it in the sky</i>

712
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:55,807
<i>Something they want to imply</i>

713
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,519
<i>I greet the breeze</i>

714
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,189
<i>And nod to the trees</i>

715
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:06,360
<i>I heard the winds reply</i>

716
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:13,992
<i>A thousand languages</i>
<i>Start to whisper around my world</i>

717
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:25,212
<i>One quiet voice answers them</i>
<i>In gentle word</i>

718
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,510
<i>Stuck in my throat</i>

719
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:34,554
<i>Round and round</i>

720
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,890
<i>I wanna speak out</i>

721
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,893
<i>But no one's there</i>

722
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,187
<i>Echoes of my voice</i>

723
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,898
<i>Answer alone</i>

724
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,567
<i>Tell me the truth</i>

725
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,362
<i>What don't I see?</i>

726
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,531
<i>Stuck in my thoughts</i>

727
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,158
<i>I walk till I fade</i>

728
00:49:55,242 --> 00:50:00,831
<i>I feel the love in the morning sun</i>

729
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,749
<i>But why am I blue…</i>

730
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,751
Mu-hee.

731
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,773
Your family is here.

JOO HO-JIN

738
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,400
Hey, Ho-jin.

739
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,986
Hey, Yong-u, I couldn't reach you.

740
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,907
Uh, things have been busy,
and my phone died.

741
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,784
Have you been calling? Sorry, man.

742
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,121
Cha Mu-hee is not picking up either.
What if something happened?

743
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,747
You can't reach Mu-hee?

744
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,083
She's here at a photoshoot, getting ready.

745
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,753
- What?
<i>- She's in hair and makeup.</i>

746
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,048
Want to talk to her?

747
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,594
No, thanks. I'm just calling to check in.

748
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,139
Hey, did you see the article
that came out today?

749
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:25,725
It's a… touchy issue.
That's why she's not picking up right now.

750
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,019
Don't worry about her.

751
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,897
She's okay. She's gonna be fine, you know?

752
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,025
Okay.

753
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,420
PAPAGO♥

754
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,061
The company knows
things are bad with your family.

755
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,479
Why did they publish this?

756
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,858
The journalists went to my uncle's house

757
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,195
since I'm still registered at his address.

758
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,198
They went there,
thinking they'd see my parents.

759
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:25,160
They say you were born
with a silver spoon in your mouth.

760
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:27,162
There's no problem with that these days.

761
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,539
Your fans still love you.

762
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,666
They'll love you even more now.

763
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,501
I guess.

764
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,131
It's a relief.

765
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:41,551
Hmm.

766
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,471
Hey, Ho-jin called me.

767
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,974
He was worried.
He said he couldn't reach you today.

768
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,726
Were you supposed to see each other?

769
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,897
We were supposed to.

770
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,400
But we're not meeting.

771
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,861
I stood him up and didn't call.

772
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,377
You have no idea at all?

773
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,547
No memory of what happened
to your parents?

774
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,965
Are you sure, sweetie?

775
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,147
Stop smiling!

776
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:19,941
You're repulsive.

777
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,809
<i>That's me.</i>

778
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,480
<i>It was my birthday.</i>

779
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,567
<i>The house I lived in.</i>

780
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,653
<i>The flowers I had on the balcony.</i>

781
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,489
<i>And my sweet chicks.</i>

782
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,284
<i>Dad visited for the first time in a while.</i>

783
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,703
<i>He had a birthday present for me.</i>

784
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,166
- Mu-hee!
- Oh, Daddy's here!

785
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,752
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

786
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:23,505
- Thank you for the teddy bear!
<i>- Happy birthday to you!</i>

787
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,507
- I love it!
- Here you go!

788
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,676
You're the best, Dad!

789
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,899
Teddy bear, eat up.

790
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,026
You're so cute.

791
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,139
Mom?

792
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,256
This serves you right, you liar.

793
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,387
Your little scheme.

794
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,557
You lied and pretended
you don't remember a thing,

795
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,767
but now you're scared they'll find out.

796
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,732
You were so uneasy

797
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:08,193
when people started loving you.

798
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:12,280
Must be wrong, you thought.
And you were sure it wouldn't last.

799
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,496
It's because you're so broken.

800
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:27,212
That's why I'm here.
Do Ra-mi's the one that everyone loves.

801
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:53,071
Ms. Cha Mu-hee, are you ready?

802
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,030
Yeah.

803
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,625
She still hasn't
reached out. What should I do?

804
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:12,715
Just call her and set up a meeting.

805
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:16,886
I debated leaving,
but I'm just too curious.

806
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:23,893
- I'm curious too.
- About what?

807
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,814
What happened between you
and Ms. Cha Mu-hee on the plane?

808
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,201
This will do, I guess.

809
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:15,862
What are you watching?

810
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:21,200
The Do Ra-mi movie. I wanna add clips
in between shots of Mu-hee.

811
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,660
<i>Have a pleasant evening.</i>

812
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:25,913
Like that one.
I watched it before, but it's so scary.

813
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:28,750
Freaks me out.
A zombie killer. Terrifying.

814
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:30,918
So scary.

815
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,087
She kills a bunch of people in it.

816
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,799
Actually, Do Ra-mi herself
only kills one person.

817
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,011
It's the man she loved.

818
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,056
Young-hwan?

819
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,768
Are you here?

820
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:04,721
Uh, ma'am?

821
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,396
Today isn't our cleaning day.

822
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:16,107
Hello?

823
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,621
Cha Mu-hee?

824
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,499
Why are you here?

825
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,048
If I tell you to wait for me, Ho-jin,

826
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:44,469
you should do as you're told
and wait in the exact place I choose.

827
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:53,060
I've no idea what you're up to this time,
and I'm tired.

828
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:56,189
'Cause I'm not in the mood
to accommodate you.

829
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:57,523
Get out.

830
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:02,153
Awesome. So you still care.

831
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,407
Yesterday, I was only a thief.

832
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,658
What am I now?

833
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,286
Please tell me.

834
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:12,955
Are you sick or something?

835
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,001
You're polite again, I see.

836
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,252
That wasn't being polite.

837
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:21,839
It's who you are. You're kind,
which is why she likes you.

838
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:33,351
"I felt like I might die
if someone was kind to me."

839
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:38,689
"It felt like kindness might kill me."

840
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,534
I'm not like that.

841
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,662
I enjoy…

842
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,755
killing people.

843
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,426
Just tell me what you want.

844
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:10,263
Who are you?

845
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,685
Well, today I am…

846
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,272
Do Ra-mi.

847
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,660
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

848
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,660
<i>I wanna switch off my head for a while</i>

849
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:18,497
<i>You're always saying too much</i>
<i>Can't you just dial it down?</i>

850
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:22,293
<i>I wanna shut down my POV for a while</i>

851
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:26,047
<i>Your shadow lingers too close</i>
<i>I can't take it now</i>

852
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:29,926
<i>Let me sink in my quiet melancholy</i>

853
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:33,763
<i>Sometimes it's fine</i>
<i>To lean into the lonely</i>

854
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:36,849
<i>Perfect light, perfect stage</i>

855
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:41,187
<i>Oh, please, turn on the lights for me</i>
<i>I'll be dancing alone</i>

856
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:44,857
<i>Dance! Feel alive!</i>
<i>I would dive into the dark</i>

857
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:48,778
<i>I love to be alone, so leave me alone</i>

858
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,446
<i>Dance! Feel the vibe!</i>

859
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:52,365
<i>I might be a narcissist</i>

860
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,200
<i>I love to be alone</i>

861
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,869
<i>Just leave me alone</i>

862
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:00,748
<i>Dance alone, I'm dancing alone</i>

863
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:04,502
<i>Dance alone, don't ring the alarm</i>

864
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:08,339
<i>Dance alone, I'm dancing alone</i>

865
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:11,801
<i>Dance alone, don't ring the alarm</i>

866
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:13,761
<i>Somebody to love</i>

867
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:15,137
<i>Somebody to hurt</i>

868
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,392
<i>I'm exhausted by all of them</i>

869
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:20,851
<i>Where should I go</i>

870
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,229
<i>Well, don't give a "uh"</i>

871
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,816
<i>Lately, I don't overthink for myself</i>

872
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:32,655
<i>I'm growing up</i>
<i>But why can't I get used to this</i>

873
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,490
<i>Like adolescence</i>

874
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:35,616
<i>It's getting tough</i>

875
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:40,371
<i>So I gave up on this early</i>

876
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:42,164
<i>Just leave me alone</i>

877
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:45,835
<i>Dance! Feel alive!</i>
<i>I would dive into the dark</i>

878
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:49,714
<i>I love to be alone, so leave me alone</i>

879
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,382
<i>Dance! Feel the vibe!</i>

880
01:06:51,465 --> 01:06:53,300
<i>I might be a narcissist</i>

881
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:55,136
<i>I love to be alone</i>

882
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:57,805
<i>Just leave me alone</i>

883
01:06:57,888 --> 01:07:01,017
<i>Dance alone, I'm dancing alone</i>
