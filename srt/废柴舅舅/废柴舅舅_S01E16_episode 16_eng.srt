1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,520

2
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:11,501

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:15,999

4
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:21,999

5
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:26,542

6
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:33,626

7
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:37,999

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,120

9
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:50,000
 This is a work of fiction. Any similarity to actual persons, institutions, or events, is purely coincidental.

10
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:08,092
Uncle, your phone...

11
00:01:08,592 --> 00:01:11,399
It's not my ringtone.

12
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:23,199
Uncle, is something wrong at work?

13
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:27,942
What do you mean?

14
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:34,299
You urgently went to the office yesterday.

15
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:39,567
Nothing's wrong. Be quiet.

16
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:54,799
Good morning.

17
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,367
Should we all take one for our health?

18
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:03,967
What is it?

19
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:08,618
Take a deep breath.

20
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:12,618
Stretch your arms high up! To the right.

21
00:02:12,618 --> 00:02:13,618
To the right...

22
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:17,517
Elbows tight.

23
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:21,492
Now, stretch your legs. To the side!

24
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:27,142
Good, right to left. Make sure you brush well.

25
00:02:27,142 --> 00:02:28,492
No, J. King!

26
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:32,342
For your front teeth brush top to bottom.

27
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:33,842
Exactly.

28
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:36,342
Good job.

29
00:02:36,342 --> 00:02:38,817
Brush them clean!

30
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:43,842
I should've followed them on their honeymoon.

31
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:47,399
Is she going to be like this every day?

32
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,218
You think she's lovely and beautiful, too?

33
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:53,292
I thought it was just me.

34
00:02:57,117 --> 00:03:01,217
- They're using us to experience life as newlyweds. 
 - Exactly.

35
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:02,800
- Hurry up. 
 - Yeah.

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,718

37
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:08,818
- Okay. 
 - Just one more.

38
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:11,117
Up, up, be careful!

39
00:03:11,117 --> 00:03:14,099
- You messed up! 
 - It wasn't me!

40
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,767
You're all rested up?

41
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:20,318
I'm so annoyed.

42
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:22,799
Enough. Get up, please.

43
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:25,367
You heard her? Get up, get lost.

44
00:03:26,342 --> 00:03:29,292
- What are we doing? 
 - Cleaning, of course.

45
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,442
- What? 
 - What?

46
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:32,518
Whatever, you like cleaning.

47
00:03:32,518 --> 00:03:36,618
I'm not the old Min Jihoo anymore.

48
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:39,842
You've upgraded for the worst.

49
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:42,692
- Uncle? Does he get to play? 
 - What about him?

50
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:45,699
I'll clean, too. Just wait, I'm at the boss.

51
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,842
I've never been this far.

52
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:49,767
- That's a long fight. 
 - I know.

53
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:52,067
I almost killed them...

54
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,217
We're almost at the airport.

55
00:04:04,217 --> 00:04:07,799
 You're not on the plane yet?

56
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,242
- It's only been a day? 
 - It feels like days!

57
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:16,842
 I hope you have fun and spend quality time.

58
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:18,600
We're...

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,240
 in hell.

60
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:22,999
 Save us.

61
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:27,242
 We're imprisoned and being tortured.

62
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:32,167
What's wrong? I thought you'd be playing games all day.

63
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:34,799
 Not with me around!

64
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:37,999
They both finished their editorial homework.

65
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:41,367
They'll have to do 4 worksheets per subject before bed.

66
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:45,067
They'll finish an entire unit by the time you two get back.

67
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:48,267
Children, you've met your maker.

68
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:52,342
- What about Joonhyeok? 
  - I'm reading!

69
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:55,542
Dad, can you come back. Please, come back?

70
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,999
Mom! Take me with you!

71
00:04:57,999 --> 00:04:59,899
 Me too! Take both of us!

72
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,576
 Don't worry about the kids. Enjoy your time.

73
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:05,125
 We love you.

74
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:10,167
Have fun. See you in the next life.

75
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:14,167
Thanks, Hwaeum. I'll trust you then.

76
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:17,542
Hyeok, listen to Hwaeum and call me for emergencies.

77
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:20,199
What could happen? Just hang up.

78
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,242
You heard me. Get your worksheets.

79
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:25,592
- How many? 
  - Four.

80
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,442
Four.

81
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:28,999
Let's go.

82
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:17,767
 Your heart is dilated and dysfunctional.

83
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:22,842
 What do I do? Do I need to take pills?

84
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:26,367
 I have a concert in 2 weeks.

85
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:29,899
 Cancel it. You have to be admitted.

86
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,367
 What?

87
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:34,399
 You have dilated cardiomyopathy.

88
00:06:38,242 --> 00:06:40,117
Really not drinking?

89
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:42,299
I have practice tomorrow.

90
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,699
The sweetest taste after a hard day.

91
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:54,618
I told you to go easy. Are you tired?

92
00:06:54,618 --> 00:06:57,367
Tired? I'm so happy today.

93
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:00,217
Happy? You worked all day.

94
00:07:00,217 --> 00:07:03,960
How many kids should we have?

95
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:07,399
Really straight forward, again.

96
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:10,367
I just wanted one kid at first.

97
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:14,392
Since it's difficult to raise a child in Korea now.

98
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,567
But seeing Jihoo and Noeul... I need a son and daughter.

99
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,718
I think I need two.

100
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:22,867
Son's name: Seojoon. Daughter's name: Hyeri.

101
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:25,217
What is this? You already planned names, too?

102
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:29,599
Wang Seojoon, Wang Hyeri. What do you think?

103
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,592
I just want Hyeri.

104
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:38,192
I want a big family.  A bustling crowded one.

105
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,999
I want to argue over nothing and make up.

106
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:43,467
Watch TV together, eat together.

107
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:47,267
A normal healthy life.

108
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,799
A long and happy life.

109
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:52,599
With you...

110
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,399
That's the plan.

111
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:01,167
 What?

112
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:06,167
 What are you even saying?

113
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:14,467
 Dilated cardiomyopathy? What is it? Is it a heart disease?

114
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:17,120
 Haven't you suffered swollen hands and feet.

115
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,590
 Also, difficulty of breathing?

116
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:25,584
 My heart's racing.

117
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:28,192
 I'm nervous.My heart is beating so fast.

118
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,292
 You surprised me! My heart dropped.

119
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,767
 Why am I so nervous?

120
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:34,942
 It's hard to breathe. My chest hurts.

121
00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:44,799
 I've just had a lot on my plate. I've been nervous and worried.

122
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,899
 It's normal for your heart to race and feel uncomfortable when distressed.

123
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:53,842
 You need to be admitted. We'll have to do more tests.

124
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:58,420
 If medication doesn't work...

125
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:02,092
 you might need a heart transplant...

126
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:05,992
 You must be joking. I came out for a beer.

127
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:07,999
 You can't drink.

128
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:11,342
 Professor, we should request a VAD right now.

129
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:15,899
 Inform your family. You should be admitted.

130
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:21,467
 Seriously, what do you mean? This is messed up.

131
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:24,092
 I have a concert in 2 weeks.

132
00:09:24,092 --> 00:09:26,942
 You said you're my fan. You must know my situation.

133
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,217
 Singing is impossible.

134
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:32,292
 The worst could happen at any moment.

135
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:35,899
 That doesn't make sense. My heart can't take two weeks?

136
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,592
 I feel fine. I'm not in any pain.

137
00:09:37,592 --> 00:09:41,492
 Look at me. I'm completely fine.

138
00:09:41,492 --> 00:09:44,192
 And also. I can't cancel the concert.

139
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:47,317
 The tickets sold out. We sold out!

140
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:50,692
 It was difficult for Jihoo to get permission too.

141
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:53,467
 I also have to propose to my girlfriend there.

142
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,899
 Anyways, no. I'm doing the concert.

143
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,292
 I'll just go to a different hospital. So sorry.

144
00:10:25,817 --> 00:10:28,834

145
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,999

146
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,792
What do I do?

147
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:50,930
What do I do with you?

148
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,520
Geez.

149
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:09,250
Some people are cured naturally.

150
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,334
I'll eat healthy foods.

151
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:14,083
Yes!

152
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,834
I think the meds are working wonders!

153
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:18,734
My breathing is stable.

154
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:20,899
Perfect.

155
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:24,799
Just two weeks. No, just 13 days.

156
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,234
Hey, Wang Joonhyeok.

157
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:29,834
You can do it. Who are you?

158
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:31,709
J. King!

159
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:35,999
Died and came back as Uncle King! Go go!

160
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:39,000
Who are you talking to?

161
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:43,899
The inner me. We were talking. Want to meet him?

162
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:47,534
What are you doing up so early?

163
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,359
You don't like my cooking?

164
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:53,999
Starting today, I'm taking care of my health.

165
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:56,083
I mean, taking care of my figure.

166
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,292
You packed lunch?

167
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:01,859
Restaurants use too much salt.

168
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:05,359
Can I try some?

169
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:10,609
- It isn't seasoned. 
 - Try this.

170
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,799
- This isn't seasoned too. 
 - Forget it.

171
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:22,384
♪ Life brings you joy, life brings you pain ♪

172
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:25,499
♪ Just share your struggles... ♪ Oops.

173
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:31,809
Why am I getting worse?

174
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:34,009
Should we quit?

175
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:36,484
Hey... You're joking.

176
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:38,334
I'm not.

177
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:43,509
All my classmates are coming. What if I mess up?

178
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:46,183
If you aren't comfortable, it doesn't have to be live.

179
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:51,034
No, that's unacceptable. I'll just practice more.

180
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:57,083
Don't let negative thoughts and pressure take over.

181
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:02,009
If you focus on the emotion people won't even notice your mistakes.

182
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:08,426
You're acting too nice because we're on camera.

183
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:10,276
Hey!

184
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:12,359
Was it obvious?

185
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:16,209
We shouldn't think about it and film our natural selves.

186
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:18,059
Okay, okay.

187
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:24,584
For the talent show, should I do something besides the piano?

188
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:26,484
You don't have time to prepare.

189
00:13:26,484 --> 00:13:30,999
I saw other artists tap dance and stuff on YouTube.

190
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:35,134
Should we do a dance? Like a group dance?

191
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:38,459
Dancing makes you out of breath. No.

192
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,734
How about a comedy skit?

193
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:45,234
We're musicians. Do we have to do that?

194
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:48,959
Fan service is really important.

195
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,334
Everyone took time out of their lives to see us. We must entertain them.

196
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,384
You're born with it. All right, think of something.

197
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:02,209
What could we do... Oh!

198
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,734
How about magic? We can learn from Noeul.

199
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:09,584
I'll just lay down and you can saw through me.

200
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:11,459
Not bad.

201
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,484
Grab your guitar.

202
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:15,834
- Okay. 
 - Let's try it again.

203
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:24,334
Uncle, can we edit our new song?

204
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,659
Why?

205
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:34,134
Your vocal part sounds a bit buried.

206
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:39,109
I want to take out the guitar solo and focus on your vocals.

207
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:42,334
Shall we? Should we try?

208
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:46,609
Are you okay?

209
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:50,883
Just stomach pains. It's stuffy.

210
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:51,859
I'm okay.

211
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:55,284
How will you record later tonight?

212
00:14:57,659 --> 00:14:59,259
Hey.

213
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:02,609
Shall we sing at the recording and just play together today?

214
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:05,999
Oh. I'll just record by myself today.

215
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:08,834
Do it when you feel better.

216
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:11,509
It's going in the album. It has to be good.

217
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:13,334
Okay.

218
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,799
Take a deep breath.

219
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,709
Okay, don't be nervous. Imagine you're all by yourself.

220
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,659
Okay.

221
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:33,259
The phone.

222
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:43,860
♪ A coward who only shouts loudly ♪

223
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:54,534
Yes, Uncle King's phone.

224
00:15:54,534 --> 00:15:56,634
 Is Uncle King busy?

225
00:15:56,634 --> 00:16:01,699
Yes, you can leave a message with me. Who is this?

226
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:04,783
The hospital?

227
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:24,034

Excuse me. Turn off the music.

231
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:46,699
Nice, nice!

232
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:50,183
I need to speak with you.

233
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:53,584
Okay, let's take a break.

234
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:56,042
Good job, good job. Just like now, okay?

235
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:58,784
Just give me a moment. We'll do it again.

236
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:11,534
I just took a phone call on your behalf.

237
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:12,626
Huh?

238
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:15,792
They asked if I was family. I said we were dating.

239
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:17,309
Who?

240
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:23,384
The doctor, he's an intern. He said he's a fan.

241
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:25,999
Oh, really...

242
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:30,459
He asked if I was Uncle Queen. He told me to learn CPR.

243
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:32,334
He said the patient must take care of himself.

244
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:35,834
He said you needed a heart failure ID.

245
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:38,334
He's making a fuss.

246
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:40,883
When did you visit the hospital?

247
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:44,599
- Two days ago? 
 - Two days ago?

248
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,609
That's the wedding day.

249
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,799
We were together all day.

250
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:55,899
At night... When I said I was at the office.

251
00:17:55,899 --> 00:17:58,383
Why'd you go at night?

252
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:02,334
- Were you in the E.R? 
 - Huh?

253
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:04,676
- Let's go back now! 
 - It's not that serious.

254
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:07,401
What's not serious? We're going to the hospital!

255
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:10,275
Beanie! Beanie, it's not that bad.

256
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm not in danger right now or anything.

257
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,399
The intern doctor's a fan; he's overreacting, okay?

258
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,626
Don't tell Jihoo or my sister.

259
00:18:21,626 --> 00:18:25,899
I'll get treatment or get admitted after the concert.

260
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:27,451
Is the concert important?

261
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:31,599
I know, I know. But Jihoo's working so hard.

262
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,526
He's so excited about going on stage. How can I tell him?

263
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:36,375
They said you might die.

264
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,526
If we leave it, you could die at any moment!

265
00:18:38,526 --> 00:18:40,434
Hwaeum, Hwaeum...!

266
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:44,526
Doctors are always over-exaggerating.

267
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:48,525
Don't worry. Hwaeum, please?

268
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,299
Hwaeum.

269
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,600
Hwaeum!

270
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,900
Wow, this is cool.

271
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:03,526
Is something wrong?

272
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:07,501
I saw how she left. I think they're fighting.

273
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:10,626
Right? What should I do?

274
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:14,899
It's a positive sign that they care for each other.

275
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:18,375
You never know until you live together.

276
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,776
Hwaeum, it's not that serious.

277
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:36,283
Noeul, can you teach me the sawing magic trick?

278
00:19:36,283 --> 00:19:41,450
Sure! Should I cut your waist, your head?

279
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:46,151
It's a magic trick, right?

280
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:53,975
 The number you have dialed is unavailable...

281
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,776
Hey, Sis.

282
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:04,083
 Yeah, Hyeok. The kids aren't picking up.

283
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,609
They're both tired.

284
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:08,699
 I guess Hwaeum worked them hard.

285
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:12,626
She sure did. What time is it there?

286
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:16,999
 It's only an hour difference. Something wrong?

287
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:21,699
Just enjoy your trip. Don't worry about us.

288
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:23,551
What can you even do?

289
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:25,000
 That's true.

290
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,501
Don't worry. Just enjoy yourself.

291
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:30,899
How's my brother-in-law?

292
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:36,250
 Good. Stay healthy. I'm relieved Hwaeum's there.

293
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,434
Sis.

294
00:20:37,434 --> 00:20:38,976
 Yeah.

295
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:42,176
Are you happy?

296
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,300
 Yes.

297
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,300
That's all, goodbye.

298
00:20:58,426 --> 00:21:00,275
When's Teacher coming?

299
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:03,151
Uncle, did you guys fight?

300
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,651
Wait in front after school. I'll pick you two up.

301
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:10,676
Uncle, what's going on?

302
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:12,700
Nothing. What could happen...

303
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,999
We begin rehearsals on stage today. Be prepared.

304
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:17,500
Yes.

305
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,799
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

306
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,251
- Be careful of cars. 
  - Yes.

307
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:35,075
 The number you have dialed is not available...

308
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:42,342
 Please leave a message at the sound of the beep.

309
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:46,250
Beanie girl, it's me.

310
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,999
I went to your office. You didn't even go to work.

311
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:54,301
I'm at your home. You aren't here either.

312
00:21:54,301 --> 00:21:56,676
Where are you?

313
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:58,400
Are you...

314
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,051
avoiding me?

315
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,399
It's all right.

316
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,426
It'll be all right.

317
00:22:12,426 --> 00:22:18,551
Even if you leave me, I'll be all right.

318
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:20,751
Just let me know that you're safe.

319
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:22,801
I'm really worried.

320
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:31,459
I have rehearsals at 2. I'll be on stage.

321
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:34,760
If I don't pick up, assume I'm rehearsing.

322
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,200
Beanie girl...

323
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:45,399
I'm sorry.

324
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:50,250
I'm sorry I hid it from you.

325
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,976
Sorry...

326
00:22:54,776 --> 00:22:56,759
I'm sick again.

327
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,560
Just everything...

328
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:06,501
I'm sorry for everything.

329
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,425
She's still not answering? Go to her house.

330
00:23:29,425 --> 00:23:33,499
She's not at home or work. She won't pick up either.

331
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:36,299
She's constantly on the phone.

332
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:39,600
Well, it's over for you.

333
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:47,125
Uncle, whatever it is. Just beg and apologize.

334
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,625
I want to but she's gone.

335
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:55,176
Just wait, she'll show up if you were meant to be.

336
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,799
I don't have time to wait.

337
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:00,651
Are we ordering food for dinner?

338
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:03,000
Dad left me his card.

339
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,876
- What should we eat? 
 - Seafood salad?

340
00:24:05,876 --> 00:24:07,426
That doesn't taste good.

341
00:24:07,426 --> 00:24:09,125
You only like childish food. You don't get it.

342
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:13,599
- Let's get junk food. 
 - I don't want junk food.

343
00:24:23,626 --> 00:24:25,600
What's this smell?

344
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:29,525
- Is it miso soup? 
 - I think so.

345
00:24:29,525 --> 00:24:31,799
I guess we aren't ordering.

346
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,325
No ordering food! Never allowed!

347
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:36,300
Wash up and get ready for dinner.

348
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,401
What's all that luggage?

349
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:44,175
I've decided to live here.

350
00:24:44,175 --> 00:24:46,199
- Really? 
 - Wow.

351
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,976
J. King, can you move my luggage to the room?

352
00:24:54,751 --> 00:24:56,976
Let's give them some space.

353
00:24:56,976 --> 00:25:00,800
- You have your dad's credit card? 
 - Right here, just follow me.

354
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,576
- What are we eating? 
 - Seafood salad.

355
00:25:02,576 --> 00:25:05,375
- I want junk food. 
 - Then starve.

356
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:09,800
- I really can't eat any of that. 
 - Then starve.

357
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:18,499
Where were you? I looked everywhere.

358
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:22,050
You were on the phone all day. Why didn't you pick up?

359
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,026
I was really busy.

360
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:30,476
My friend is a cardiologist.

361
00:25:30,476 --> 00:25:35,876
I met up with him. I made appointments at various hospitals.

362
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:42,500
- You did? 
 - I also quit my job.

363
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,601
I also put my apartment up.

364
00:25:45,275 --> 00:25:46,726
Huh?

365
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:52,500
I'm taking care of you 24 hours a day.

366
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,125
I know how much you care about Jihoo.

367
00:25:59,776 --> 00:26:04,250
I can't ask you to give up on the concert.

368
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:11,275
I'll control your diet, your medication, and we'll exercise together.

369
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:15,999
I'll make your heart is functional again.

370
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:19,800
We'll finish the concert and live healthily.

371
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,625
I'll do my best to protect you.

372
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,800
I thought you left me.

373
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,176
You can if you want...

374
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,126
Where would I go?

375
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:38,325
I have nowhere else to go.

376
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:42,051
I'm glad.

377
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,251
I'm really happy.

378
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,326
I want to see you every day until I die.

379
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,726
But what if the worst happens?

380
00:26:53,726 --> 00:26:56,000
I don't want to be selfish.

381
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,725
We won't let that happen.

382
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:09,459
♪ As time passes by ♪

383
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:14,250
You can see how enlarged it is.

384
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,951
♪ We'll forget about each other ♪

385
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:23,851
♪ I want you... ♪

386
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,999
Give this to Uncle.

387
00:28:19,692 --> 00:28:21,484
This is handmade jam.

388
00:28:21,484 --> 00:28:22,999
What was this flavor?

389
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:25,250
It's mango and guava flavored.

390
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,751
It's really good on toast.

391
00:28:26,751 --> 00:28:29,334
- Looks delicious. 
 - It's premium jam.

392
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,999
- Try it in the morning. 
 - Yes.

393
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:34,799
What is it?

394
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,999
I love it. It looks fierce.

395
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:40,901
- It's yours. 
 - You know my taste.

396
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:45,918
- This is coffee for you. 
 - You didn't have to.

397
00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:48,718
- Luwark Coffee. 
 - What?

398
00:28:48,718 --> 00:28:50,999
It's very unique...

399
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:54,125
Cats eat the coffee beans. And then...

400
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,375
- Smells wonderful. 
 - Doesn't it?

401
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:58,626
- Yes. 
 - Then the cat...

402
00:28:58,626 --> 00:29:03,276
The cat eats the coffee then poops it out.

403
00:29:03,276 --> 00:29:05,626
- That's it, it's the poop. 
 - Right.

404
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:08,999
- Poop coffee! 
 - It's poop coffee!

405
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:11,025
It smells like poop!

406
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:13,651
And this is... coconut oil.

407
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,576
Good for rejuvenating your skin.

408
00:29:16,576 --> 00:29:19,551
You got me a gift, too?

409
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:21,799
Of course, you're family.

410
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:24,000
Thank you for looking after the kids.

411
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,175
Thank you.

412
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:30,550
Doesn't Joonhyeok look like he's lost weight?

413
00:29:32,925 --> 00:29:37,375
- Big Bro, you noticed! 
 - I see it now.

414
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,375
Only a week left until the concert. I've been dieting.

415
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:43,651
Only a week? Jihoo, are you prepared?

416
00:29:43,651 --> 00:29:44,501
Yes.

417
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:47,501
Teacher made us eat a low-salt diet, too.

418
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:48,776
You did?

419
00:29:48,776 --> 00:29:52,276
She did a parenting simulation on us.

420
00:29:56,999 --> 00:30:00,299
Do you have something to say?

421
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,876
Should I?

422
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,299
We decided to live together.

423
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:15,250
Congratulations!

424
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,000
Thank you.

425
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,175
Nice...

426
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:25,301
Oh, Joonhyeok, where's your car?

427
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:27,999
- What car? 
 - Didn't you have one?

428
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:30,000
The one I gave Sis to practice driving?

429
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,375
I thought she needed a new car but she doesn't want to buy one.

430
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,501
- I want to take it for a check-up. 
 - It really needs one.

431
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:41,525
That car was for practice. Don't drive it.

432
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:46,650
I don't think a check-up is necessary.

433
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:51,076
- Is it pointless? 
 - The engine is fried.

434
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:55,825
The engine is like the heart of a vehicle.

435
00:30:56,426 --> 00:30:58,276
Heart...

436
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,700
Even if we replace the engine it might not work.

437
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:07,025
Your heart is broken too, huh?

438
00:31:07,025 --> 00:31:08,500
Well...

439
00:31:09,699 --> 00:31:11,801
It'll die then.

440
00:31:14,699 --> 00:31:20,050
But why didn't I look into it properly before?

441
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,675
Why now, when it's too late?

442
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:24,901
Joonhyeok.

443
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,826
What's wrong?

444
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:40,299
Hwaeum.

445
00:31:41,226 --> 00:31:46,551
You're smart and studied a lot.

446
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:51,101
Why aren't you calculative and sly like your peers?

447
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:56,099
What's there to calculate? I'm happy, I love him.

448
00:31:56,125 --> 00:32:00,676
He should've proposed and prepared a wedding.

449
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:02,426
In our absence, he just went for it?

450
00:32:02,426 --> 00:32:04,899
I packed up and barged in.

451
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:09,151
I don't want to miss another moment without him.

452
00:32:09,925 --> 00:32:13,676
You care and love for my brother.

453
00:32:13,676 --> 00:32:15,999
I love you for that and I'm grateful.

454
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:20,125
But if you were my younger sibling instead of Hyeok,

455
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:23,600
I would be disappointed in you.

456
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,226
I'm glad you worry for me.

457
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:31,699
Thank you, Sis.

458
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:36,909
Don't just live together. Let's have a wedding after the concert.

459
00:32:38,451 --> 00:32:41,375
After the concert...

460
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,851
Why?

461
00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:52,999
What?

462
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,775
You're crying?

463
00:32:59,551 --> 00:33:01,425
Something's wrong.

464
00:33:04,175 --> 00:33:06,600
What's going on?

465
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,475
What is it?

466
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:15,001
I'm scared, Sis.

467
00:33:17,175 --> 00:33:19,901
I'm trying to be strong,

468
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,090
but I'm terrified.

469
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:29,400
Strong for what?

470
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:33,876
What's going on? What's scaring you?

471
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,951
How long has it been?

472
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,176
Why did this happen?

473
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:54,701
There's no cause.

474
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,176
So, I...

475
00:34:00,925 --> 00:34:04,851
He'll live if he gets an artificial heart?

476
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:13,875
Nothing is certain. But technology is advancing.

477
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:21,599
How could... Why did this suddenly happen?

478
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,901
Even heart attacks are sudden.

479
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,675
Could it happen to you?

480
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:41,125
However, after an artificial heart transplant,

481
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:45,625
you can go to an outpatient clinic and wait for a heart transplant.

482
00:34:47,676 --> 00:34:52,850
An artificial heart transplant is a serious operation.

483
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:57,400
It doesn't matter. He has to do it.

484
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,175
Jihoo will be disappointed if we cancel the concert.

485
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:08,375
Do you think he'll care about that when you're sick?

486
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:11,550
Do you know how hard Jihoo prepared?

487
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:17,776
Just a few days. Can't we wait a few days?

488
00:35:17,776 --> 00:35:19,675
Joonhyeok.

489
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,620
Hyeok.

490
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,960
Jihoo...

491
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:31,225
only wanted to do the concert for you.

492
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,900
Instead of for himself,

493
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:42,199
he just wanted to help you even more.

494
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:48,525
That's why... I allowed him to do it.

495
00:35:49,301 --> 00:35:52,299
You're a special uncle to him.

496
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:58,125
So, to Jihoo...

497
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:02,101
Your health is more important than the concert.

498
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:08,980
When will...

499
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:14,399
you tell Jihoo? Do you want me to do it?

500
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:18,026
I will.

501
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:21,476
I'll do it.

502
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:57,451
Say something.

503
00:36:58,626 --> 00:37:00,901
I can't believe it.

504
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:04,101
Me too.

505
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:07,626
Does it hurt?

506
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,501
No.

507
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:15,326
Sometimes... My chest feels uncomfortable sometimes.

508
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,699
I knew something was wrong.

509
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:21,775
You kept taking breaks and struggled to sing.

510
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:24,925
Should we just do it?

511
00:37:24,925 --> 00:37:28,151
It's coming up soon. Should we just do the concert?

512
00:37:33,676 --> 00:37:35,676
Hey.

513
00:37:35,676 --> 00:37:37,500
Don't cry.

514
00:37:38,401 --> 00:37:41,176
It hurts me when you cry.

515
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:47,251
Jihoo...

516
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm sorry.

517
00:37:56,676 --> 00:37:58,801
This is so unfair.

518
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,599
Why do these things happen to you?

519
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:07,900
You're right.

520
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,599
It is unfair.

521
00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:15,725
I could've done great.

522
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:19,276
I wanted to help you succeed.

523
00:38:20,025 --> 00:38:22,801
I know how you feel.

524
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,725
Thanks for worrying about me.

525
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:33,501
We can do it when I'm healthy. We'll make it big.

526
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:36,625
Promise me, you'll be healthy again.

527
00:38:38,676 --> 00:38:41,125
Will the surgery work?

528
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:44,250
It will! Really.

529
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,799
You won't die?

530
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:47,999
Why would I die?

531
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:52,599
Hey, Min Jihoo! I'm your uncle, Uncle King!

532
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,626
Did you know?

533
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:59,626
I'll have a battery around my waist.

534
00:38:59,626 --> 00:39:03,300
And a round machine on my chest.

535
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:08,099
- Just like Ironman. 
 - Isn't it cool?

536
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:10,825
You're already cool.

537
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:14,251
I agree with that statement.

538
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:18,250
Hey.

539
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,042

540
00:40:04,676 --> 00:40:06,500
Yes, Mr. Reporter.

541
00:40:07,676 --> 00:40:11,376
Dilated cardiomyopathy.

542
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:14,301
The concert is canceled but

543
00:40:14,301 --> 00:40:17,251
we're still releasing the album.

544
00:40:18,426 --> 00:40:21,826
The only solution is a heart transplant.

545
00:40:38,876 --> 00:40:42,876
Greetings! To our King's Family!

546
00:40:42,876 --> 00:40:45,999
My surgery was successful!

547
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:48,501
A round of applause!

548
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:52,375
Many were curious so here I am. I survived.

549
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:54,350
Ta-da!

550
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,501
You see our coward?

551
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:57,626
Hey, coward, say something.

552
00:40:57,626 --> 00:40:59,999
Our coward was really worried.

553
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,999
He kept crying.

554
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:03,751
Even when I've recovered.

555
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:07,125
Hit me, go ahead. I am Uncle King!

556
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:08,999
Stop talking and rest.

557
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,626
Then say something instead.

558
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:13,999
If I lose all my fans, it'll be your fault.

559
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:15,400
Fine.

560
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:19,776
He's breathing fine now.

561
00:41:19,776 --> 00:41:20,799
Super comfortable.

562
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:25,451
He'll be able to go home soon. Please don't worry.

563
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:28,426
Sorry that the concert was cancelled.

564
00:41:28,426 --> 00:41:31,600
Thank you for the love and support. Thank you, we love you.

565
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,000
Oh, that hurt.

566
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,876
I'm reading every single

567
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:38,925
supportive comment to my uncle.

568
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,076
I'll update you more next time.

569
00:41:43,076 --> 00:41:45,751
Like and subscribe! Uncle King!

570
00:41:45,751 --> 00:41:46,901
King!

571
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,350
What a shame.

572
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,475
The concert was supposed to be today.

573
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,899
At least his surgery went well. He's already out of the ICU.

574
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:58,000
I can't tell if he's lucky or unlucky.

575
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,601
Something crazy always happens to Jihoo's uncle.

576
00:42:01,601 --> 00:42:05,401
He has an artificial heart now. Does he wait for a real one?

577
00:42:05,401 --> 00:42:09,651
Yeah, but artificial hearts are advanced these days.

578
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:12,501
He can leave the hospital and go about his life.

579
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:14,250
What about singing? Can he still sing?

580
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,876
Isn't the heart really important to singing?

581
00:42:16,876 --> 00:42:19,726
That's why... I feel bad for him

582
00:42:19,726 --> 00:42:24,025
If we weren't so busy, I'd go see him.

583
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:26,326
Business is doing so well.

584
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:27,699
It's a blessing you're here.

585
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:32,051
Exactly. We have so many group orders and deliveries these days.

586
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:34,651
I can see. Look at your face.

587
00:42:34,651 --> 00:42:35,676
What?

588
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,500
- What's that? 
 - It's good for you.

589
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:39,426
Don't frown.

590
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:43,925
The front is all glass. All the sunlight gets in.

591
00:42:43,925 --> 00:42:46,925
Take care of yourself.

592
00:42:46,925 --> 00:42:50,226
And don't forget. You're single now.

593
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:51,275
Of course.

594
00:42:51,275 --> 00:42:56,250
I could meet someone at any moment. I'm always prepared.

595
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,276
Oh! Boss!

596
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:01,700
I heard he's out of the ICU.

597
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,201
Thank you so much for upgrading our room.

598
00:43:05,201 --> 00:43:08,000
Sodam's father asked his father to take good care of him.

599
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,826
Sodam's father now lives in her hands.

600
00:43:11,826 --> 00:43:14,300
Good job.

601
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,900
I've been so busy. I feel bad leaving the entire place up to you.

602
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,151
Boss, what would you have done without me?

603
00:43:22,151 --> 00:43:24,526
How did people react to the new yuzu donuts?

604
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:27,999
They love them! They all sold out!

605
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:29,418
I'm baffled, too.

606
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:32,899
Who knew the album would do so well?

607
00:43:32,899 --> 00:43:36,676
Some haters say you used your disease.

608
00:43:36,676 --> 00:43:40,551
I read it, too. How I'm faking a disease for sales.

609
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:44,475
Some even say the 72 hours I was missing was faked.

610
00:43:44,475 --> 00:43:47,126
Don't think about it. Focus on recovering.

611
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:49,225
I apologize for the hassle.

612
00:43:49,225 --> 00:43:51,075
Don't be.

613
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:55,300
You have quite the Uncle King variety show.

614
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,701
How famous will you get?

615
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:00,900
Doctors said no performances for now but...

616
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,576
I can sing once I recover some more.

617
00:44:02,576 --> 00:44:05,599
Really? That's great!

618
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,225
It's okay, it doesn't hurt.

619
00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:21,001
No shouting!

620
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:22,800
Too bad!

621
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,626
Okay!

622
00:44:25,734 --> 00:44:27,576
Blow it...

623
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,675
Mom is greeting the hospital staff.

624
00:44:39,675 --> 00:44:41,925
What do you want to do when you leave the hospital?

625
00:44:41,925 --> 00:44:46,426
I'm a musician. I want to work.

626
00:44:46,426 --> 00:44:49,167
I have to work, too. Shall we burn our artist flame together?

627
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:51,725
Sounds great two artists...

628
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:54,026
Whoa...

629
00:44:54,026 --> 00:44:55,676
Whoa! Wow!

630
00:44:55,676 --> 00:44:58,175
I just got inspired.

631
00:44:58,175 --> 00:44:59,201
What?

632
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:01,150
When I leave this hospital.

633
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,451
I mean, once I'm healthy!

634
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,226
Hmm?

635
00:45:05,226 --> 00:45:07,775
Let's use it as lyrics.

636
00:45:07,775 --> 00:45:11,776
- I like it. 
 - That's a really good idea.

637
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:12,576
Sounds fun.

638
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:15,875
Every time we visit the hospital, we can ask patients

639
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:20,050
what they would want to do, then write lyrics!

640
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:23,400
- I think it'll be a hit song! 
 - I think so, too!

641
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:29,334
Uncle. Uncle!

642
00:45:29,334 --> 00:45:31,620
Joonhyeok!

643
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,620
Uncle! Uncle!

644
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,375
 Because of the side effects, he won't survive on an artificial heart.

645
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:15,151
 His heart functions are deteriorating. He is in critical condition.

646
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:20,000
 A heart transplant is our only option.

647
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:25,899
 If a donor doesn't show up soon...

648
00:46:25,899 --> 00:46:29,751
What will happen?

649
00:46:30,426 --> 00:46:34,740
We can't promise his recovery.

650
00:46:53,426 --> 00:46:55,876
You must've been shocked.

651
00:46:55,876 --> 00:46:59,101
He must be disappointed.

652
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:03,599
He thought he was leaving.

653
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,599
Jihoo...

654
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:15,451
You should know...

655
00:47:15,451 --> 00:47:17,626
Mom,

656
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,599
I'm going to believe.

657
00:47:23,476 --> 00:47:27,826
Uncle is my Superman.

658
00:47:27,826 --> 00:47:33,150
Even when everyone doubted him, he succeeded.

659
00:47:33,925 --> 00:47:35,999
So I believe in him.

660
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:40,570
Nothing bad will happen to him.

661
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:50,399
Okay.

662
00:47:57,476 --> 00:48:01,125
Big Bro is so amazing.

663
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:02,750
Hmm?

664
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:06,050
He's really tall,

665
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:11,199
has broad shoulders, and he's handsome.

666
00:48:12,001 --> 00:48:17,451
He's rich, calm, and brave.

667
00:48:17,451 --> 00:48:19,751
There's no one like him.

668
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:22,070
There isn't.

669
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:27,876
If the worst happens,

670
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:32,940
find someone like him for my Beanie girl.

671
00:48:34,575 --> 00:48:39,451
She won't be able to meet anyone else.

672
00:48:39,451 --> 00:48:41,551
You're too charming.

673
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:44,576
You sound sincere.

674
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:51,030
I must really be dying for you to be so nice.

675
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:57,775
Don't...

676
00:48:58,526 --> 00:49:02,651
Don't be weak. You'll be fine.

677
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:06,451
Just in case...

678
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:09,475
We should prepare for the worst.

679
00:49:09,475 --> 00:49:14,599
I might recover. Or I might not.

680
00:49:15,799 --> 00:49:17,950
Let's see...

681
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:24,975
No man who drinks and acts up.

682
00:49:24,975 --> 00:49:27,000
And...

683
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:32,975
someone funnier than Big Bro.

684
00:49:34,799 --> 00:49:36,950
I'll look.

685
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:42,326
The album sales and copyrights...

686
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,600
You have Big Bro. Give them to Hwaeum.

687
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,200
Don't buy a car, keep mine.

688
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:55,676
You have a lot of stuff.

689
00:49:55,676 --> 00:49:59,426
I should've written them all down. You might forget.

690
00:49:59,426 --> 00:50:01,699
It's not that much.

691
00:50:03,975 --> 00:50:06,150
Tell Jihoo to come in.

692
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:09,951
He isn't here. He's really busy.

693
00:50:09,951 --> 00:50:14,725
Busy with what? When I'm hospitalized?

694
00:50:14,725 --> 00:50:20,999
Jihoo believes that you will recover.

695
00:50:20,999 --> 00:50:24,351
He believes that you're Superman.

696
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,850
Of course...

697
00:50:30,101 --> 00:50:33,175
He believes in me more than myself.

698
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:43,350
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

699
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:46,625
What? You're going to say something weird.

700
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:51,176
How'd you know? Smart kid.

701
00:50:51,176 --> 00:50:54,951
I know it's hard to talk. Stop talking.

702
00:50:54,951 --> 00:51:00,800
I would like to pass on my know-how, which is very useful in life.

703
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,399
First off.

704
00:51:02,399 --> 00:51:05,499
How to lie properly.

705
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:08,175
I know how to lie, too.

706
00:51:08,175 --> 00:51:12,584
Right, you're pretty good. Then pass.

707
00:51:12,584 --> 00:51:15,134
What should I teach you?

708
00:51:15,134 --> 00:51:18,576
Jihoo! How to leave early.

709
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,825
How?

710
00:51:20,825 --> 00:51:26,576
Your classroom takes a minute and a half to the nurse's office.

711
00:51:26,576 --> 00:51:32,301
During your walk don't blink your eyes even once.

712
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:34,401
By the time you arrive at the nurse's office,

713
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:36,799
your eyes will be red and tears will form.

714
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:38,576
Then just say this.

715
00:51:38,576 --> 00:51:42,326
"Nurse... I feel dizzy."

716
00:51:42,326 --> 00:51:46,475
That was an awkward performance.

717
00:51:46,475 --> 00:51:49,899
It's awkward but try it. It'll work.

718
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:52,899
If you want service at a restaurant,

719
00:51:52,899 --> 00:51:55,976
call everyone there auntie.

720
00:51:55,976 --> 00:51:59,760
- It'll work, too. 
 - Okay.

721
00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:07,025
I'm sorry.

722
00:52:07,025 --> 00:52:09,850
For not keeping my promise.

723
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:12,900
What promise?

724
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,699
When you got my money back,

725
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:18,576
you threatened me to become a famous musician.

726
00:52:18,576 --> 00:52:22,676
You're already a successful musician.

727
00:52:22,676 --> 00:52:25,351
- Yeah? 
 - Yes.

728
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:30,700
Then let me make a wish upon you.

729
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:34,551
I'll speak with Pinto Music on your behalf.

730
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:37,301
Sign with them after your voice goes through puberty.

731
00:52:37,301 --> 00:52:43,150
Work hard, practice, and feature for famous musicians and learn.

732
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:47,776
Then when you're 20. Debut right away with an album.

733
00:52:47,776 --> 00:52:55,351
Take over the Grapefruit Awards, K-Pop Festivals, then go for Billboard.

734
00:52:57,576 --> 00:52:59,175
What?

735
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:04,051
Can you fulfill my dreams that I couldn't?

736
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,001
- Are your dreams that huge? 
 - Is that wrong?

737
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:14,150
How about this. Let's just make music.

738
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:18,451
- I've prepared the lyrics. 
 - What lyrics?

739
00:53:18,451 --> 00:53:21,175
Lyrics to the great idea you had.

740
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:23,025
What you want to do once you recover.

741
00:53:23,025 --> 00:53:29,626
I walked around the hospital rooms and asked everyone.

742
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:31,499
Okay.

743
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:36,420
Once I recover a bit let's do this. I'll beg my doctor.

744
00:53:45,999 --> 00:53:47,175
Huh?

745
00:53:47,175 --> 00:53:51,400
How'd you know? When did you fly in?

746
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:56,799
My plan was to go to England and watch Son Heungmin play.

747
00:53:56,799 --> 00:54:01,451
Jihoo posted on YouTube that you were still in the hospital.

748
00:54:01,451 --> 00:54:04,326
- I came as soon as I saw it. 
 - Why?

749
00:54:04,326 --> 00:54:06,025
To see me before I die?

750
00:54:06,025 --> 00:54:11,225
No, to tease you for being terrified of dying.

751
00:54:12,175 --> 00:54:16,751
I... might really die.

752
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:19,600
Why do you think that?

753
00:54:20,351 --> 00:54:23,326
I feel like I've accomplished everything.

754
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,225
What did you accomplish?

755
00:54:25,225 --> 00:54:28,899
Getting your sister married and getting Jihoo back?

756
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:31,175
- That was your job? 
 - Isn't it?

757
00:54:31,175 --> 00:54:33,599
Of course not.

758
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,676
There's nothing you must do in life.

759
00:54:36,676 --> 00:54:40,275
Who's okay with dying after accomplishing something?

760
00:54:40,275 --> 00:54:45,975
God didn't have a master plan when he sent you to this world!

761
00:54:45,975 --> 00:54:49,399
You're still talking out of your ass.

762
00:54:49,399 --> 00:54:53,326
J. King, this is just a struggle.

763
00:54:53,326 --> 00:54:56,699
How blessed are you to be a musician?

764
00:54:56,699 --> 00:55:02,175
This struggle will help you become an even greater musician.

765
00:55:02,175 --> 00:55:06,092
You must feel pain to understand people in pain.

766
00:55:06,092 --> 00:55:09,659
When you wrote songs with intentions of just making it big

767
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:14,100
and earning money, it failed. Right?

768
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:19,150
Isn't it easy when you write music with sincerity?

769
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:25,950
Get through this struggle. Write songs for others who are.

770
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:31,326
I think God gave you this struggle for you to experience and learn.

771
00:55:31,326 --> 00:55:35,726
So stop acting like you're a cancer patient.

772
00:55:35,726 --> 00:55:37,950
Dust it off and get up.

773
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:41,850
You're right. Let me stop acting and get up.

774
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:45,350
Oh, not today. I'll get up tomorrow.

775
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:46,825
Put it back on. Help me.

776
00:55:46,825 --> 00:55:49,570
Hey, hey...

777
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,050

 Since that day Uncle's condition worsened.

804
00:57:56,651 --> 00:58:02,401
 I made up my mind to get on stage before it was too late.

805
00:58:02,401 --> 00:58:05,101
 On Uncle's favorite stage.

806
00:58:05,101 --> 00:58:07,650
 For what could be his last...

807
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:16,776
Greetings.

808
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:27,490
Thank you for sharing such a meaningful time with me.

809
00:58:40,999 --> 00:58:44,199
I think I lived a good life.

810
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,226
Everyone I wanted to see is here.

811
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:57,926
My doctor is here just in case an emergency happens.

812
00:58:58,551 --> 00:59:01,326
We also have an ambulance parked outside.

813
00:59:01,326 --> 00:59:04,225
If anyone here is sick besides me,

814
00:59:04,225 --> 00:59:09,870
please feel free to use it. It's already been paid for.

815
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:22,799
As you all know, my condition is terrible today.

816
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:27,150
I might run out of breath.

817
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:31,026
So if everyone could sing with me.

818
00:59:32,175 --> 00:59:34,650
I'd deeply appreciate it.

819
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:41,799
If you don't know the lyrics raise your hand.

820
00:59:41,799 --> 00:59:43,651
All right, everyone knows.

821

01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:31,699
 The most sensational rookie the music industry has ever seen.

830
01:01:31,699 --> 01:01:35,276
 Becoming 1st place in music shows in just 2 weeks.

831
01:01:35,276 --> 01:01:38,226
 Winning the Rookie of the Year and Grapefruit Awards.

832
01:01:38,226 --> 01:01:41,426
 Winner of the K-Pop Festival Popularity Award.

833
01:01:41,426 --> 01:01:46,551
 And the Asian Music Award's Top Artist.

834
01:01:46,551 --> 01:01:50,175
 Winning 3 trophies this year alone.

835
01:01:50,175 --> 01:01:53,600
 Please welcome, Min J.

836
01:01:58,501 --> 01:02:00,810
Nice to meet you.

837
01:02:04,042 --> 01:02:06,525
Hello.

838
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:11,175
You aren't really a rookie though, are you?

839
01:02:11,175 --> 01:02:14,426
I've been featuring since middle school.

840
01:02:14,426 --> 01:02:20,199
Nomix, Jelette, and even Top Crown. You're already a veteran.

841
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:25,426
In our industry, you were the buzz as Uncle King's nephew.

842
01:02:25,426 --> 01:02:29,599
We can't talk about Min J. without bringing up Uncle King.

843
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:35,175
What does your relationship with Uncle King, mean to you?

844
01:02:35,175 --> 01:02:39,676
He's the reason why I'm here today.

845
01:02:39,676 --> 01:02:45,551
If it wasn't for him, I probably couldn't have become a musician.

846
01:02:45,551 --> 01:02:50,000
Oh, where is he now?

847
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,001
Uncle...

848
01:03:06,451 --> 01:03:10,999
 Uncle became stupid...

849
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:16,599
Uncle!

850
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:25,501
Hyeri! Be careful! Don't run.

851
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:29,199
No! no! no!

852
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:33,775
Min Jihoo! You were about to give my daughter a kiss!

853
01:03:33,775 --> 01:03:36,367
Stupidly in love with his daughter...

854
01:03:36,367 --> 01:03:39,276
Wash your hands and brush your teeth first!

855
01:03:39,276 --> 01:03:41,900
Really? I haven't seen her in 2 months!

856
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:45,492
Hey! She has weak skin just like you! Don't you know?

857
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:48,067
Not me, just like you.

858
01:03:48,067 --> 01:03:52,599
Anyways, she can't be touching dirty stuff. Don't walk close to us.

859
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:56,050
- I'm dirty stuff? 
 - Did you bring her a gift?

860
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:59,699
Of course! Did you watch me on TV? I talked about you.

861
01:03:59,699 --> 01:04:01,676
Stop, don't do it!

862
01:04:01,676 --> 01:04:05,451
Is it fun to go on shows and call me stupid all the time?

863
01:04:05,451 --> 01:04:08,199
Don't come too close!

864
01:04:09,551 --> 01:04:14,775
How're you getting taller every time I see you?

865
01:04:14,775 --> 01:04:17,725
Uncle, what's my present?

866
01:04:17,725 --> 01:04:22,900
Not uncle, say Big Brother! Big Brother! Big Brother!

867
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:27,351
Big Brother said "uncle" was the coolest title.

868
01:04:27,351 --> 01:04:32,017
So I'm going to call him Uncle.

869
01:04:34,209 --> 01:04:35,917
He did?

870
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,575
Let's go...

871
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:41,126

872
01:04:41,126 --> 01:04:42,676
 Pass, pass it. Okay, Hyeri.

873
01:04:42,676 --> 01:04:45,767

874
01:04:45,767 --> 01:04:46,809

875
01:04:46,809 --> 01:04:48,792

876
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:50,076

877
01:04:50,076 --> 01:04:52,676

878
01:04:52,676 --> 01:04:55,830
 I can't see, move! Seriously!

879
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:03,000
Look at our Hyeri. Isn't she precious?

880
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,700
Come here, come here.

881
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,850
Sis, I know you're busy. Thanks for coming early.

882
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:11,800
I've prepared all day but I'm not even halfway done.

883
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,301
I can't see, move out the way! Seriously!

884
01:05:15,301 --> 01:05:18,050
Leave them be. They haven't seen each other.

885
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:22,951
You must be busy raising Hyeri. We could've eaten out.

886
01:05:22,951 --> 01:05:27,192
Sis, I'm confident now. I've been practicing.

887
01:05:32,659 --> 01:05:36,599
Can you see if the seasoning is right?

888
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:41,750
It's okay just be honest with me.

889
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,600
Isn't it delicious?

890
01:05:44,234 --> 01:05:46,918
Let's eat out next time.

891
01:05:49,699 --> 01:05:52,700
Take care of Hyeri. I'll finish up.

892
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,699
Maybe a bit more soy sauce? It's good.

893
01:05:55,699 --> 01:05:58,560
Thank you, Sis.

894
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,350
Okay!

895
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:05,700
It's your daughter's birthday. At least act like you're helping.

896
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,000
I have you.

897
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,699
- Did you buy a cake? 
 - On the balcony.

898
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,425
Did you prepare six candles?

899
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:16,300
Stop double-checking. I bought the numbered candle.

900
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:21,476
I said get up! Go help, you too!

901
01:06:21,476 --> 01:06:24,699
Look how your aunt is treating a global super star.

902
01:06:24,699 --> 01:06:26,750
Okay, start. To the left.

903
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,270
Go that way from now on.

904
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:32,580
Towards the side, nice. Now pass.

905
01:06:41,309 --> 01:06:43,992
What's that smell?

906
01:06:43,992 --> 01:06:47,083
She burned it again. She always does.

907
01:06:48,301 --> 01:06:50,299
No...

908
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:53,025
You didn't even wash your hands!

909
01:06:53,025 --> 01:06:56,051
- My hands are dirty? 
 - Of course, they are.

910
01:06:56,051 --> 01:06:58,026
My apologies.

911
01:06:58,026 --> 01:06:59,859
Stop getting in my way. Go away.

912
01:06:59,859 --> 01:07:01,576
Yeah.

913
01:07:04,101 --> 01:07:06,599
Don't get in the way. Sit here.

914
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:09,199
Dad, where's Noeul?

915
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:11,201
Noeul? She didn't want to come.

916
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:14,399
She didn't? Or she can't?

917
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:17,250
How dare she? When her brother came?

918
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:21,025
She said she has to attend a special lecture.

919
01:07:21,025 --> 01:07:23,099
Oh, on criminal psychology?

920
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:27,975
They're analyzing a body mutilation case. She's excited.

921
01:07:27,975 --> 01:07:30,926
- Honey! 
 - Yes.

922
01:07:30,926 --> 01:07:32,999
Let's run away.

923
01:07:32,999 --> 01:07:34,825
Let's play outside.

924
01:07:34,825 --> 01:07:36,567
The food will take a long time.

925
01:07:36,567 --> 01:07:38,067
You two go. We all can't leave.

926
01:07:38,067 --> 01:07:40,726
- Just be back in an hour. 
 - Dad, come with us.

927
01:07:40,726 --> 01:07:42,467
Let's go together.

928
01:07:42,467 --> 01:07:46,151
If you stay any longer, your ears will start bleeding.

929
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:48,734
I think I should stay.

930
01:07:48,734 --> 01:07:53,000
I'd rather have bleeding ears than be killed for running off.

931
01:07:53,792 --> 01:07:55,601
I have nothing to say.

932
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:57,899
 - Honey!  
 - Yeah, coming!

933
01:07:57,899 --> 01:07:59,401
On my way.

934
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:01,476
Oh, my legs.

935
01:08:01,476 --> 01:08:03,150
What can we help with?

936
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:06,551
Oh, wait. Let's wash our hands.

937
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,576
- Run! 
 - Where are you going?

938
01:08:09,576 --> 01:08:11,200
Hyeri's dad! Hyeri's dad!

939
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,809
Hey! Where are you going? Min Jihoo!

940
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:21,200
A place full of memories!

941
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,183
It's been so long.

942
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:27,492
It's fun to visit sometimes.

943
01:08:27,492 --> 01:08:31,699
He's too stubborn and won't clean the place.

944
01:08:31,699 --> 01:08:34,099
Nothing's changed.

945
01:08:34,099 --> 01:08:36,999
It's exactly how it was.

946
01:08:37,709 --> 01:08:40,117
Only one thing changed.

947
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:42,700
Your height.

948
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:48,140
Want to warm up?

949
01:08:49,634 --> 01:08:52,399
Can you handle it?

950
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,790

♫  Even if I have nothing  ♫

990
01:11:19,384 --> 01:11:24,226
♫  I have nowhere to hide  ♫

991
01:11:24,226 --> 01:11:27,434
♫   I'm like a small larva  ♫

992
01:11:27,434 --> 01:11:32,367
♫  But my small...  ♫

993
01:11:32,367 --> 01:11:36,730
♫  racing heart  ♫

994
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:42,134
♫  keeps whispering to me  ♫

995
01:11:42,134 --> 01:11:47,910
♫  Telling me to fufill my dreams  ♫
