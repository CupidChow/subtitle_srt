1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,510

2
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:11,501

3
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:15,999

4
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:21,999

5
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:26,542

6
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:33,626

7
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:37,999

8
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,120

9
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:50,100

10
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:01,292
Wake up.

11
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:04,667
The sun is high, wake up.

12
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:09,867
I'm really busy but I'll play with you so wake up.

13
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:12,467
No, no. Sleep, sleep.

14
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:13,417
Sleep, sleep...

15
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:15,834
Get some sleep.

16
00:01:17,818 --> 00:01:19,700
I memorized it.

17
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,300
What?

18
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:29,718
Studying in your dreams again?

19
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:33,599
I thought I was at grandmother's.

20
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:38,567
I was rescued, right? I'm not dreaming?

21
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:43,099
This is reality. Need me to hit you?

22
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:46,467
- No. 
 - No?

23
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:49,092
Okay, go to sleep. I'm sorry...

24
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:55,542
Go to sleep...

25
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,899

26
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:05,300
How did he come straight home?

27
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,799
He isn't allowed to stay with non-custodial parents.

28
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,792
 The shelters are full.

29
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,792
They agreed staying with me was better than a foster home.

30
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:15,042
That's so amazing!

31
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:18,792
- I bet you hugged him all night? 
 - I can't remember the last time.

32
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:22,667
We stayed up just chatting. He's still sleeping.

33
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:28,167
Jihoo's father has a restraining order? He deserves it!

34
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:30,999
Noeul's dad sent us protection.

35
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:33,342
They might do something terrible.

36
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:34,776

37
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:39,199
If this is real, Jihoo's mom must have had a hard life.

38
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,867
Attempted murder of her own grandson?

39
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:45,417
She's a monster, no?

40
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,899
Have you heard anything about this?

41
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:50,918
Huh? We didn't talk about these things.

42
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:55,617
The elections are so close and this is such a big hit.

43
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:56,999
Why isn't Mingi's mom coming?

44
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:58,892
We need a plan in order to do something.

45
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:02,799
She's probably visiting her in jail.

46
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:13,142
Yes, Sis. Understood.

47
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:19,899
Mingi's mom wants us to comment that the news is fake.

48
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,999
Is it fake?

49
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:24,718
That isn't important. Just do it!

50
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,867
What's going on with you?

51
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,167
You be the Diamond. I'm moving away.

52
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,667
Oh, come on.

53
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:36,709
If you can't afford your lease ask Mingi's mom for help.

54
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:37,999
Forget it!

55
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:41,642
I'm already her personal servant. I don't want to owe her anything.

56
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:47,292
What're you waiting for? Start commenting!

57
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,999
"It upsets me that

58
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:58,042
nobody here was able to witness what I have."

59
00:03:58,042 --> 00:04:00,642
Was he that cool?

60
00:04:00,642 --> 00:04:02,417
Yes, completely.

61
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:06,392
- He had so many cool punch lines. 
 - Oh my, no way.

62
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:08,999
Can you reenact it? Min Jihoo?

63
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,592
Jeez!

64
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:12,317
"I'm here to take Jihoo!"

65
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:15,467
Then he got on his knees...

66
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:19,492
"The reason I'm doing this is for Jihoo.

67
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,692
I will get him back no matter what it takes."

68
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:23,999
And then? And then?

69
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:28,367
The climax was when he told my dad...

70
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:34,392
"You are banned from seeing Jihoo from now on."

71
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:35,892
So cool!

72
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:39,042
- You just gave me chills! 
 - Right? Me too.

73
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:40,242
Me too!

74
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:43,267
I thought I saw Uncle glowing like a hero.

75
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:47,242
I couldn't even hear what grandma or dad was saying.

76
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:50,717
Uncle looked like the biggest human being.

77
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:52,275
Why didn't you record it?

78
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:55,667
It could be recorded on the police body cam, right?

79
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,299
Teacher, here. Have some.

80
00:04:57,299 --> 00:05:02,109
Please just call me Hwaeum comfortably.

81
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:05,042
But Hyeok calls you "Teacher."

82
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:07,999
That's true, it's a bit cold.

83
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:10,592
Then should I call you "Beanie girl"?

84
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:13,042
- Sure. 
 - No, I can't.

85
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:15,176
Want some, Beanie girl?

86
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:18,067
Jingle, jingle.

87
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:23,492
Teacher, you come here really often.

88
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:28,930
I'm alone at home. But when I come here, it's nice because it's lively.

89
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:34,299
Am I here too often?

90
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:35,999
This is embarrassing.

91
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:38,792
I like it, you're lovely.

92
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,167
Jingle, jingle.

93
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,692
- Jingle, jingle! 
 - Jingle, jingle!

94
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:47,359
So is it okay for me to come often?

95
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,142
Sis!

96
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:53,899
Sure, come... often.

97
00:05:56,999 --> 00:06:00,042
- Jingle, jingle! 
 - Jingle, jingle!

98
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:07,467
Aren't you all our legal team?

99
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,799
Why the hell do we pay you all so much?

100
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:14,317
Get off your asses and get my mom out!

101
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:17,499
Why aren't you publishing rebuttal articles and news?

102
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:20,292
Little bastards...

103
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:24,567
Do something about Jihoo!

104
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:29,517
He was preparing for the Olympiad. Every day is so crucial!

105
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:34,242
All right!  Just wait a while and let me enjoy my food.

106
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:37,299
Tofu? You were only in for a day.

107
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:40,267
It's fun.

108
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,192
How dare Joonhyeok record everything.

109
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:49,292
Come to think of it, he planned it all along.

110
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:53,642
He should be terrified for pulling one over me.

111
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:59,167
But how come that woman didn't see this coming?

112
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:02,999
Your mom was taken to jail. She didn't know anything?

113
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,667
Exactly.

114
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:08,142
- Mom must be pissed. 
 - Yeah.

115
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,092
I'm excited about what'll happen.

116
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:19,699
It must've been rough, Mrs. President.

117
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:25,000
Prepare our legal team.

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,950
Let's go to the office.

119
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:30,999
Shouldn't you go home first and calmly prepare?

120
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:32,999
Calmy?

121
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:36,599
How can I be calm in this situation?

122
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:43,442
We've released many articles. It'll be over by morning.

123
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:50,999
What does Mingi's mom have over you?

124
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:53,899
Why are you being treated like this?

125
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:56,542
If that's why you wanted to see me. I'll just leave.

126
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:00,799
Okay fine. Always with the attitude...

127
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,292
It's my emergency money and some of my savings.

128
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,718
Pay me back slowly.

129
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:17,999
Our kids were friends in this neighborhood since they were 6.

130
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:22,667
You and I grew apart because we have our differences,

131
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:25,899
but I can't see you move like this.

132
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:28,692
Sechan's in an higher grade now.

133
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:31,999
I know how hard you save money,

134
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:36,042
how hard you persevered as a Momvely to gain an edge.

135
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:39,767
I know everything you do is for Sechan.

136
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,542
Jeez.

137
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:48,292
This is shameful.

138
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:50,542
Where is there shame for a mother?

139
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:53,899
There is nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to your kid.

140
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:58,417
Don't let your husband take it. Give it to your landlord.

141
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:00,442
Hurry.

142
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,292
What...

143
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:09,567
do you want from me?

144
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:11,342
Nothing.

145
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:15,420
You lied about cutting ties with Jihoo's mom, right?

146
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:17,242
No!

147
00:09:17,242 --> 00:09:20,292
Your pupils shake when you lie.

148
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:22,042
Go home!

149
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:26,317
I saw you two laughing together recently, too.

150
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:30,799
Why'd you join the Momvelies again?

151
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:33,567
You can deceive ghosts, but you can't deceive me.

152
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:36,792
Never tell this to Mingi's mom.

153
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,099
Promise me.

154
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:42,167
Why? What about her? Just tell me.

155
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:45,899
No thanks. I don't trust you.

156
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,667
- Whatever. 
 - Yeah, whatever.

157
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:51,567
I don't trust you either.

158
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:54,167
You're ridiculous.

159
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,792
Jihoo.

160
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:07,918
Want to grab a bite after your test at the center?

161
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:12,099
Sure, but I want Noeul to come, too.

162
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:14,718
Okay, let's do that.

163
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:19,509
Why?

164
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:24,942
All the news is about celebrities.

165
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,542
I'm sure they did that on purpose.

166
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:52,967
Yes, Reporter Seo. Of course, it's all false.

167
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:59,442
What kind of a grandmother would do that to her grandson?

168
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:04,192
I'm a person who can't even hurt a fly.

169
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:10,317
I guess she wanted to use my candidacy to get her son back.

170
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:14,818
She made it all up in order to take custody.

171
00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:15,999
Yes.

172
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:22,417
Oh, and about the radio podcast.

173
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:26,592
Jihoo hasn't been feeling well.

174
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:30,499
Let's do it after I get elected.

175
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:32,499
Yes, all right.

176
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,742
Our polls?

177
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,809
They're dropping.

178
00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:49,418
Don't be upset, Mrs. President.

179
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:55,699
Do I look upset to you?

180
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:57,992
I'm angry.

181
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:04,699
The man next to Jihoo's mom is quite smart and effective.

182
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:11,367
He even hired the finest law firm with an incredible win rate.

183
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:19,399
How can I help with your anger?

184
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:30,792
Oh my, I never thought Kim Sureun could do something like that.

185
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:35,542
It's always the quiet cat that climbs over the stove.

186
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:39,667
I thought she was a pure and innocent actress.

187
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:45,467
Look! Drugs, a DUI, and a married baseball player next to her?

188
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:47,999
Isn't that his second wife already?

189
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,999
Another divorce now.

190
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:55,042
There's too much news. I can't find one on Mrs. President.

191
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:58,542
This is outrageous, seriously unbelievable...

192
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:06,799
Don't we have to leave more comments?

193
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,567
Just do as we've been told.

194
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:13,342
What are you going to wear to the campaign ceremony?

195
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:16,367
Look at the situation. Do you think she'll throw a party?

196
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:18,799
All the more, she must.

197
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:24,117
We have to show strength and innocence through the party.

198
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:27,292
If Sis says we shouldn't. Let's convince her that we should.

199
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:29,667
- Good, agreed. 
 - All right.

200
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:32,792
Thank you.

201
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:38,499
We need more media coverage. It's beneficial to you too.

202
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:41,292
Yeah, sure.

203
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:44,492
But the timing is terrible right now.

204
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:48,317
Elections are too close for people to fact-check.

205
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:53,167
They'll say anything rather it be true or false.

206
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:57,342
A representative in another district is accused of killing his girlfriend.

207
00:13:57,342 --> 00:14:04,592
Prostitution, lobby funds, drunk hit and runs, corruption...

208
00:14:04,592 --> 00:14:07,999
Every candidate has cases going off around them.

209
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:10,999
People are... just used to it now.

210
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:14,718
People only care about celebrity news.

211
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:17,599
No one cares about politics.

212
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:23,742
If the people don't care, could our case just disappear?

213
00:14:23,742 --> 00:14:27,242
We can't ignore that possibility.

214
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,592
Besides, it's Mrs. Park next to the president, you know.

215
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:37,199
No one stands a chance against them.

216
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,600
Take care of yourself. They will retaliate.

217
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,650

218
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:02,367
That's not his home. He was kidnapped!

219
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:06,167
Your superiors? Someone was just taken from a parking lot!

220
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:10,417
How can you take a child back to his abusers?

221
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:13,867
Where's Jihoo? What's wrong with Big Bro?

222
00:15:14,342 --> 00:15:17,799
His ankle was crushed. He's in surgery.

223
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:20,151
How? Why?

224
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,899
A car blocked their way while leaving the center.

225
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:28,425
Men grabbed Jihoo so he tried to stop them.

226
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:32,480
They just ran over him.

227
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:35,667
What about the police?

228
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,792
The police? Did they see the CCTV?

229
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:40,742
Did they see the license plate?

230
00:15:41,342 --> 00:15:42,792
It's a stolen vehicle.

231
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,742
This is driving me crazy!

232
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:57,542
Jihoo!

233
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,800
Jihoo!

234
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,500
Where is he? Move.

235
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,667
Let go!

236
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:02,918
Give me my son!

237
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:04,792
How dare you!

238
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,567
Where's my son?

239
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:09,667
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

240
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:15,667
This is your fault for running away with Jihoo!

241
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:19,942
No, it's your fault for coming into my home!

242
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:21,999
Since I first saw you,

243
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:26,842
I knew you two orphan losers would disrupt my family!

244
00:16:26,842 --> 00:16:30,517
Is being an orphan my fault? Is it my brother's fault?

245
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:34,317
How can you hate someone for being an orphan? How?

246
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:37,683
What did I do to deserve any of this?

247
00:16:37,683 --> 00:16:40,042
 Keep trying!

248
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:43,892
 You'll never see your son again.

249
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:02,499
The court agreed to send him home.

250
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:05,767
I also contacted child protection services.

251
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:10,767
We should just begin Plan B.

252
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:16,499
Will you be okay?

253
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:20,142
Of course. I'm excited for it.

254
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:29,501
If...

255
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:32,167
Plan B fails, what do we do?

256
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:36,442
To succeed, we have to stay positive.

257
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:39,542
But what if?

258
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:43,099
Well if... something goes wrong.

259
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:45,342
I'll rescue you.

260
00:17:45,342 --> 00:17:48,167
- What? 
 - I'll rescue you.

261
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:53,542
- Well that solves everything. 
 - I'm serious.

262
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:55,600
Just count on me.

263
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,417
I'm nervous. My heart is racing.

264
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:03,542
Me too. Do you think she's ready?

265
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,899
Should I go help her?

266
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:19,467
Yeah, Sodam. I'm running late.

267
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:20,999
What?

268
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:24,199
I have to do something behind your dad's back.

269
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,017
Yeah, go to sleep.

270
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:28,699
See you later. Okay.

271
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:32,167
Oh my.

272
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:34,018
Hey!

273
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:35,417
What are you doing?

274
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:38,918
I didn't want to see my husband so I came for a walk.

275
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,518
Huh? Okay.

276
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:45,400
What're you doing behind your husband's back?

277
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,299
- It's nothing. 
 - That's Mrs. President's home.

278
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:55,042
Can you pretend you didn't see this? Please?

279
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:00,667
Yeah, Sodam's mom.

280
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:03,542
I'm going first to double-check.

281
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,426
Yeah, just come to Mrs. President's home on time.

282
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:08,151
Okay.

283
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,918

284
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,292

285
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:30,159
You look good. Go inside.

286
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:31,999
- Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations.

287
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:33,651
Nice to meet you.

288
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:35,000
Hello.

289
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,209
Hello, thank you.

290
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:41,699
We're making sure only invited guests are entering.

291
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:43,125
You...

292
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,125
Make sure Jihoo's locked up until it's over.

293
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:48,300
Don't worry, he's locked from the outside.

294
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,926
Just don't let the home inspector come in.

295
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:01,599
- Greetings, Sis. 
 - Welcome, come in.

296
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,351
- We're here. 
 - Hey.

297
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:06,709
Oh my? We have little guests, too?

298
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:08,551
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

299
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:10,676
I thought kids could help with the atmosphere.

300
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:14,275
Yes, Sis, it looks dull without some kids.

301
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:19,250
Well, they're here anyways. Make sure they aren't noisy.

302
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,192
Yes, Sis.

303
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:22,101
See you later.

304
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,375
Why'd you bring the kids?

305
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,776
Is it bothering you? I'm sorry.

306
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:30,818
Sechan wanted to see this mansion.

307
00:20:30,818 --> 00:20:32,899
Then I heard she was bringing Sodam.

308
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,551
Was I being thoughtless?

309
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:36,350
We'll be quiet.

310
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,818
Okay then. Go inside.

311
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:41,999
You couldn't dress him accordingly?

312
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:45,399
He doesn't listen to me anymore.

313
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:59,776
To everyone who has come to support my campaign,

314
00:20:59,776 --> 00:21:02,699
I am sincerely grateful.

315
00:21:02,699 --> 00:21:05,501
We recently faced a crisis but

316
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:10,676
I have used it as an opportunity to grow.

317
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:17,550
I hope everyone doesn't lose faith and continues to support me.

318
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:22,451
I will win at all costs.

319
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:26,375
And I will present you with the sweetness of victory.

320
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,126
Thank you.

321
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:30,042
Thank you.

322
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:34,999
Those are figs. You want one?

323
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:38,618
I'll be right back.

324
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:41,899
- Oh? There's chocolate. 
 - Wow.

325
00:21:43,776 --> 00:21:45,559
Son, I'm so sorry...

326
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,259
Hello.

327
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:49,250
We should wash it off in the bathroom.

328
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,317
Let's get inside to the bathroom.

329
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:53,999
Sis, this place is incredible.

330
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:58,901
If she gets elected, I think she'll give you what you wish for.

331
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm starting to believe you cut ties with Jihoo's family.

332
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,551
What? I rejoined Momvely long ago. You were still suspicious of me?

333
00:22:10,551 --> 00:22:13,325
Once a spy, always a spy.

334
00:22:13,325 --> 00:22:15,692
Come on, Sis...

335
00:22:15,692 --> 00:22:18,999
Why don't you have someone tail me then?

336
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:23,501
My husband really likes you. If you just spoke with him,

337
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:27,250
you would've known I joined with genuine intentions.

338
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,999
- Maybe I should have? 
 - Exactly.

339
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:31,799
Cheers, Sis.

340
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:38,526
How about a radio appearance with your grandson?

341
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:40,899
You have many articles but

342
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:44,301
listeners want to hear you explain yourself.

343
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:47,626
Well, Jihoo really isn't feeling well.

344
00:22:47,626 --> 00:22:50,626
- Can it just be me? 
 - Umm...

345
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:56,375
Instead of that. Can we do a short interview with him?

346
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,125
Shouldn't we prepare beforehand?

347
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:04,825
I'll be very careful with him and make him comfortable. So don't worry.

348
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:10,150
Everyone loved seeing you with Jihoo,

349
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,326
so you do know that these allegations are shocking to many, right?

350
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:17,599
What do you think, Mrs. Park?

351
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,301
If you're seen happily with Jihoo on a day like this,

352
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:25,183
it'll really help the controversy dissipate.

353
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:26,676
She understands.

354
00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:30,150
You should get him. I'll get the camera.

355
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,299
Okay.

356
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:37,899
Make sure he doesn't act up.

357
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:39,484
Dress him up and bring him.

358
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:43,875
He might not listen to me. I have no leverage now.

359
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:55,150
Jihoo, come out for an interview.

360
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:01,350
Jihoo, where'd you get a phone?

361
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,899
Let go! This is mine.

362
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,676
Oh my! Who are you?

363
00:24:05,676 --> 00:24:07,699
Park Sechan.

364
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:09,999
Why are you here?

365
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:12,150
I'm helping my mom.

366
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,367
I'm a helpful son to her.

367
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,125
Why'd you bring the kids?

368
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,376
We'll be quiet.

369
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,250
What's all this?

370
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,351
We should wash it off in the bathroom.

371
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:37,876
He had something spilled on his clothes. Where's the bathroom?

372
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,000
- It's on the second floor. 
 - Thank you.

373
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,999
You drive me nuts!

374
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,999
 Second floor, the second room to your left.

375
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:50,410
It should be here...

376
00:24:51,226 --> 00:24:52,750
Is that it?

377
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:58,650
How could they lock him...

378
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,975
Jihoo!

379
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:14,826
Huh?

380
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:16,825
Hey, Min Jihoo.

381
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,750
Jihoo.

382
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:29,250
I told you to wash your face. It's still dirty!

383
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,250
You're upsetting me!

384
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,167
It's all wet!

385
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,201
Let's go change.

386
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:45,401
- Jihoo! Jihoo! 
 - Uncle!

387
00:25:45,401 --> 00:25:46,651
Why are you here?

388
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:49,375
Shut up and just open this. How do you open it?

389
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,375
It's inside... A button, a button...

390
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:52,501
There's nothing here!

391
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,000
It's inside!

392
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,699
- No! 
 - What do we do?

393
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,151
Jihoo.

394
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:12,850
Jihoo! Jihoo!

395
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:17,959
Thank you.

396
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:20,499
Thank you.

397
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:33,250
- Yes, exactly. 
 - Indeed.

398
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,526
Mother...

399
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:38,399
Oh, right...

400
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:42,950
Jihoo's gone. They switched kids!

401
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,650
- What? 
 - What?

402
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:49,199
Do something! Find him!

403
00:26:57,718 --> 00:26:58,799
Good job.

404
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,126
Sodam, go play with Sechan.

405
00:27:02,876 --> 00:27:04,525
Go play.

406
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,192
What did you do?

407
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:12,475
- Did you do this? 
 - It was me.

408
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:14,376
What?

409
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:16,584
- What do I do? 
 - What?

410
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:18,542
- What's going on? 
 - Hey!

411
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:19,676
Excuse me!

412
00:27:19,676 --> 00:27:21,999
This is not the place for this!

413
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:23,999
What am I doing?

414
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:27,750
I'm dealing with trash who slept with my husband!

415
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,099
You little! You're going to die today!

416
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:33,342
You monster!

417
00:27:33,342 --> 00:27:36,125
Get off! Why aren't you stopping her?

418
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:40,250
- Why should I? 
 - Want me to expose you?

419
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:45,359
My husband has a criminal record! Now what!

420
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,484
It's better to just let it out than deal with you!

421
00:27:47,484 --> 00:27:49,484
How dare you threaten me!

422
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:50,909
You!

423
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:53,799
Come here, you brat!

424
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:54,999
- Hey! 
 - Come here!

425
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:56,626
- Stop! 
 - Get away...

426
00:27:56,626 --> 00:27:58,676
Do you all want to die?

427
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,599
Why you!

428
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,551
You... I'm going to kill you!

429
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:05,276
You!

430
00:28:06,876 --> 00:28:11,375
Have it your way! Let's both die here!

431
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:30,499
You okay?

432
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,625
- I'm okay. 
 - All right.

433
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:41,126
Just follow your mom. I'll be with you afterward.

434
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:43,526
You even prepared a Plan B?

435
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:46,499
Is there a Plan C?

436
00:28:47,275 --> 00:28:48,676
Ta-da!

437
00:28:48,676 --> 00:28:49,899
Plan C?

438
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:54,926
No, my junk food recipe.

439
00:28:58,526 --> 00:29:02,400
Even if we failed today, I'd still come every day.

440
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,776
I'll come after you every day until they're sick of me.

441
00:29:06,776 --> 00:29:09,301
You can't break a boulder with an egg.

442
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:12,199
But you can with drops of water.

443
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,899
I'm sorry.

444
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:20,999
I can't think of any other way besides consistency

445
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:24,499
to defeat your powerful grandmother.

446
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,551
You were right. I should've gotten famous.

447
00:29:28,551 --> 00:29:31,951
Then she wouldn't have been able to do this to us.

448
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,884
Why did you give this to me?

449
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:42,034
Later... Later on in life.

450
00:29:42,034 --> 00:29:44,876
It probably won't happen but...

451
00:29:44,876 --> 00:29:48,325
If I don't return one day,

452
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,399
don't wait for me.

453
00:29:54,426 --> 00:30:01,400
Don't wait around like a fool. Be brave and live your life.

454
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,659
How could I?

455
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:06,099
What do you mean how? I've taught you so much.

456
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:08,175
You taught me how to lie without morals.

457
00:30:08,175 --> 00:30:11,426
It's not lying, it's being flexible.

458
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:15,799
In life, there are times you have to be flexible.

459
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,099
Jihoo.

460
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:25,501
Just remember one thing.

461
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,125
Many people came to help you

462
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,609
when you needed it.

463
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:34,250
And a lot more will in the future.

464
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,426
Just remember how loved you are.

465
00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:40,950
Don't ever forget that.

466
00:30:47,401 --> 00:30:52,125
Damn, they just ran away like that?

467
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:02,275
How did this happen?

468
00:31:02,275 --> 00:31:05,501
You ruined my campaign ceremony!

469
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:07,401
My apologies, Mrs. President.

470
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:11,125
Are you in good condition? You couldn't see this coming today?

471
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,226
Look at her eyes. She's terrifying.

472
00:31:15,676 --> 00:31:17,951
I've had Jihoo's mom followed.

473
00:31:17,951 --> 00:31:21,399
I'll bring him back.

474
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,260
Of course.

475
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:37,199
Mom!

476
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,850
Jihoo!

477
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:45,751
Hey, you!

478
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:47,551
You bastard!

479
00:31:49,584 --> 00:31:50,918
Hyeok!

480
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:57,601
Get off! Let go!

481
00:31:57,601 --> 00:31:59,599
Shut your mouth!

482
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,234
Where's Uncle? Did you kill him?

483
00:32:03,234 --> 00:32:05,250
Send him on the first flight tomorrow!

484
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,750
What happened to my uncle?

485
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:11,999
How dare you! I won't go easy on you anymore!

486
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:14,999
Don't hit me! Why do you hit people!

487
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,250
I don't have a grandmother!

488
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,751
I don't have a father! You aren't my family!

489
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:20,799
Murderer! Devil! Monster!

490
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,850
Liar!

491
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:27,250
Take him to his room! Make sure he doesn't escape!

492
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:31,651
Where's my uncle? Give me my uncle!

493
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,801
He's lost his mind.

494
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:39,501
She's ruining my character.

495
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:44,799
Where's my brother?

496
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,751
Why are you asking me?

497
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:51,101
You know. You planned it!

498
00:32:52,175 --> 00:32:56,990
Your boyfriend is injured, your brother is missing, and your son was taken?

499
00:32:57,592 --> 00:33:00,426
And all you have is me to help?

500
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:07,000
Don't do this...

501
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,626
Tell me where he is. Please don't kill him.

502
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:13,999
I know there's good in you.

503
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:16,318
Don't cross that line.

504
00:33:17,651 --> 00:33:22,525
You should never have left that family.

505
00:33:22,525 --> 00:33:26,250
If you just obeyed them, the world would be yours.

506
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,650
Why'd you run away to our neighborhood?

507
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:33,876
Why'd you move here and ruin everything!

508
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:40,426
You try to lecture me? Showing me pictures of Chaeyoung?

509
00:33:40,426 --> 00:33:44,567
There are better ways to get your children back?

510
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:46,899
No, there isn't!

511
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:50,125
There's no point in acting kind and friendly.

512
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:57,375
You have to be ruthless to take what's yours in this world.

513
00:33:58,551 --> 00:34:01,675
Do you know why I serve Jihoo's grandmother?

514
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:07,000
I stand by the powerful. To win, to take what I want!

515
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:17,750
Which is why you'll be left with nothing.

516
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:24,550
You will have to go up against a lot more people now.

517
00:34:26,626 --> 00:34:32,501
No matter how many losers come at us, they can't beat us.

518
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:45,299
 Min Jihoo Rescue Plan B...

519
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,176
 failed.

520
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:56,250

521
00:34:57,734 --> 00:35:00,999
 The phone you have called is switched off...

522
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:04,999

523
00:35:12,751 --> 00:35:16,999
 The number you have dialed is unavailable...

524
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:39,459
 You were right. I should've gotten famous.

525
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:41,751
 Then she wouldn't have been able to do this to us.

526
00:35:41,751 --> 00:35:43,925
 Just remember one thing.

527
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:48,999
 Many people helped you when you needed it.

528
00:35:49,042 --> 00:35:51,683
 And a lot more will in the future.

529
00:36:00,918 --> 00:36:01,926

530
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:05,534
Execute Wang Joonhyeok Rescue Plan A, over.

531
00:36:05,534 --> 00:36:07,625
- What? 
 - Huh?

532
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:11,326
Min Jihoo! Hey, hey!

533
00:36:11,326 --> 00:36:13,426
Jihoo!

534
00:36:16,526 --> 00:36:18,900
Seriously...

535
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,699
Hey, Jihoo! Damn it...

536
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,830

537
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:38,099
Hey kid. Do you even have money?

538
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,550
Yes.

539
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,200
 This ring will help you when you need it.

540
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,617
 Okay?

541
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,575
Is this enough?

542
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:06,276
What? Jihoo's missing? Go to their house!

543
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,750
Hello.

544
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,125
Yes, Reporter Seo.

545
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:15,500
I already told you we can't go on radio.

546
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,751
What?

547
00:37:20,942 --> 00:37:24,699
Jihoo is where?

548
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:30,209
 Seo Yooshin's current affairs unravelling current issues.

549
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:34,900
Today we have Min Jihoo who wrote the cute letter.

550
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,325
 Shin Hwaja was supposed to appear together, right?

551
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:40,100

552
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:42,725
Let's begin discussions...

553
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:50,826
Oh my.

554
00:37:50,826 --> 00:37:52,375
It's Noeul's father.

555
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:55,725
He really wants to get in touch with you.

556
00:37:57,676 --> 00:38:02,667
Yes! She's home. I found her passed out.

557
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:04,834
See what?

558
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:08,284
 - I'll send you a link.  
 - Okay.

559
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:10,999
What is this?

560
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,125
 We're with Shin Hwaja's only grandson Min Jihoo...

561
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,701
Why is he there by himself?

562
00:38:19,701 --> 00:38:21,401
 There are numerous allegations surrounding Candidate Shin

563
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:22,626
Where is this?

564
00:38:22,626 --> 00:38:24,375
 We can finally get to the bottom of this.

565
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:26,399
He wen't by himself to expose her!

566
00:38:26,399 --> 00:38:28,999
He could end her!

567
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:31,125
 From the alcoholic chocolate...

568
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:34,050
Stop it right now!

569
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,125
Go handle this now!

570
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:41,699
 Can you tell us the truth behind all the rumors?

571
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:43,299
 Yes.

572
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:54,901
 My grandmother is...

573
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:01,825
 not a bad person.

574
00:39:06,275 --> 00:39:08,951
She may be strict but

575
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:14,509
she's never hurt me like the rumors say.

576
00:39:15,275 --> 00:39:18,999
 Not everything is true.

577
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,125
What?

578
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:22,042
What is he saying?

579
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:23,626
He was abused and almost killed!

580
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:24,799
 I understand so...

581
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:28,125
Did they threaten him? Why is he lying?

582
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:31,250
 That must be why you came here to speak.

583
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,125
 I'm sure the truth has been conveyed through your voice.

584
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,999
He's there for another reason.

585
00:39:37,551 --> 00:39:41,026
 I want to say something.

586
00:39:41,026 --> 00:39:46,225
 I don't have a phone or social media.

587
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:53,818
I'd like to ask a favor from all the listeners. May I?

588
00:39:53,818 --> 00:39:57,167
 Of course, go ahead. We're a visual radio.

589
00:39:57,167 --> 00:40:00,376
We're a visual radio. Can you speak towards the camera?

590
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:08,000
Please find my uncle.

591
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,750
My uncle has gone missing.

592
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,301
His name is Wang Joonhyeok.

593
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:17,626
 Everyone listening, please...

594
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:21,250
Please find my uncle, J. King.

595
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,359
I beg you.

596
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:35,851
Where... Where can you do such a wicked thing...

597
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:40,651
We already have a real-time comment. Look.

598
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:43,626
 You're the kid who moved to my neighborhood.

599
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:46,800
 When life was so hard and I wanted to die,

600
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,500
 Joonhyeok gave me the miracle of life. He saved me.

601
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:55,300
 He helped me start a new life.

602
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,425
 I sincerely hope you find him.

603
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:09,599
What is he trying to do?

604
00:41:09,626 --> 00:41:13,551
He knows even if he exposes her, he can't beat her.

605
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:16,799
So just give back his uncle?

606
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:19,351
It's the same plan as ours.

607
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:24,800
But do people even listen to radio stations these days?

608
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:35,999
Yeah, Hwaeum.

609
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,292
 It's me.

610
00:41:37,292 --> 00:41:40,899
I installed a tracking app on his phone.

611
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:41,751
Really?

612
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:45,799
I'm at the location his phone was turned off.

613
00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:47,899
Where are you?

614
00:41:47,899 --> 00:41:50,199
 I'll send you an address.

615
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:03,000
Are you stupid?

616
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,399
Go to your mother, why are you here?

617
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:07,901
Hey!

618
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:11,751
You'll kidnap me anyways.

619
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:12,626
Exactly!

620
00:42:12,626 --> 00:42:15,676
We went searching for you! Are you training me like a dog?

621
00:42:15,676 --> 00:42:18,826
Let me hear your thoughts.

622
00:42:18,826 --> 00:42:21,399
I won't run away.

623
00:42:21,399 --> 00:42:23,600
I don't have to go abroad.

624
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,501
Just give me back my uncle.

625
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:30,775
Allow me to live with my mom and uncle.

626
00:42:37,626 --> 00:42:43,125
You think you can bargain because you didn't expose me?

627
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:46,925
No, I'm asking.

628
00:42:46,925 --> 00:42:50,999
I will never do that for you.

629
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,099
Then, I'll ask again tomorrow.

630
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:56,276
I'll ask every day.

631
00:42:57,175 --> 00:43:01,976
Tomorrow, the day after. I'll ask every day.

632
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:05,451
Uncle said that...

633
00:43:06,526 --> 00:43:10,800
you can't break a boulder with an egg,

634
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:15,375
but you can with drops of water.

635
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:21,799
Seriously? He's in here?

636
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:25,999
His signal died at this address.

637
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,925
I think I know where he is.

638
00:43:28,925 --> 00:43:32,083
There's a cellar in the basement.

639
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:34,551
Oh my... That gives me chills...

640
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:39,125
Being in the basement of a house like this, is it some kind of safe room?

641
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,334
What..?

642
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:49,999
Huh?

643
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:52,499
Why...

644
00:43:52,501 --> 00:43:54,526
Not again...

645
00:43:54,526 --> 00:43:56,999
What storage is it this time?

646
00:43:56,999 --> 00:44:00,399
Why'd they tie my ankles?

647
00:44:00,399 --> 00:44:02,967
Dogyeong!

648
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,799
I don't even have my MacGyver.

649
00:44:08,799 --> 00:44:12,926
How can I escape this time? It's a big deal this time.

650
00:44:12,926 --> 00:44:14,999
Ignite the dust...

651
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:18,192
I can't even make an explosion here.

652
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:26,609
 The miracle began in an unexpected place.

653
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,651

654
00:44:36,959 --> 00:44:38,199

655
00:44:45,542 --> 00:44:47,042

656
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:54,167

657
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:56,751

658
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,250
No. I'm all right.

659
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,025
Did you report him missing?

660
00:45:08,025 --> 00:45:09,501
No.

661
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:12,126
I'm just sorry that I can't help.

662
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:18,025
You can help even from here.

663
00:45:18,025 --> 00:45:20,901
The internet is going crazy.

664
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:22,918
What? Why?

665
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,700
Someone looking for J. King has posted posters all over social media.

666
00:45:29,918 --> 00:45:31,476

667
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:34,851
Can you log into your favorite sites?

668
00:45:34,851 --> 00:45:36,250
Yeah, sure.

669
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,667
Then write a post.

670
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:42,601
Include Uncle's YouTube fan account and his SoriCloud address.

671
00:45:42,626 --> 00:45:43,999
Oh, wait.

672
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:46,125
I'll make a request at the Webtoon association.

673
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:49,751
There are a lot of people there! Hurry up and ask for help!

674
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:51,334
Okay.

675
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:56,751
Yes, yes. Yes, Mr. Reporter.

676
00:45:56,751 --> 00:45:58,000
Yes, exactly.

677
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,125
On social media. "Searching for J. King." That is correct.

678
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,125
He's signed to us, Pinto Music.

679
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:05,250
Yes, yes.

680
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,000
You'll write an article? Thank you.

681
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,999
Information? Let me think.

682
00:46:09,999 --> 00:46:13,751
He won Super Dream Voice 2.

683
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:17,799
Yes, of course. He's a talented singer-songwriter.

684
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:22,125
Yes, send me your email. I'll send you everything we have.

685
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:25,600
Yes, thank you. We appreciate it.

686
00:46:29,751 --> 00:46:31,999
Cut, okay.

687
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:32,999
Good work, everyone.

688
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:36,176
- Good job. 
 - Good work.

689
00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:37,751
That was great.

690
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:38,626
Did you watch?

691
00:46:38,626 --> 00:46:40,751
- It was amazing. 
 - I know, right?

692
00:46:40,751 --> 00:46:42,900
- Give me my phone. 
 - Yes.

693
00:46:43,626 --> 00:46:47,099
Sis! Sis, don't you know him?

694
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:50,950
Yeah, he's the guy who saved me.

695
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,400
You could've been in danger if it wasn't for him.

696
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:56,626
Where'd you get this photo?

697
00:46:56,626 --> 00:46:57,876
It's an article.

698
00:46:57,876 --> 00:47:00,751
He's been missing. It's blowing up on social media.

699
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,700
Missing? Really?

700
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,375
- He's a singer? 
 - Yeah.

701
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:13,459
Wow, he won Super Dream Voice.

702
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:16,817
He should've told me.

703
00:47:16,817 --> 00:47:23,726
10 years without recognition... and now he's missing...

704
00:47:23,726 --> 00:47:25,399
Oh no.

705
00:47:25,399 --> 00:47:28,125
I was supposed to post a photo we took together.

706
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:31,899
I totally forgot. Should I post it now?

707
00:47:31,899 --> 00:47:33,826
I think it would help.

708
00:47:33,826 --> 00:47:36,726
 Today's keyword is "Searching for J. King."

709
00:47:36,726 --> 00:47:42,100
 A child went on a podcast to look for his uncle...

710
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,099
 My uncle's good deeds became a miracle.

711
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:46,200
 The search for him has taken over social media.

712
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,450
 Actress and singer Suyoung posted a story about J. King.

713
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:55,876
 Social media have been covered in waves of missing posters looking for J. King.

714
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:59,999
 J. King warmed others with his personality through good deeds big and small.

715
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,501
 Even J. King's music has begun to trend.

716
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:03,626
Have a look...

717
00:48:03,626 --> 00:48:06,800
 All of his songs are top of the charts.

718
00:48:10,999 --> 00:48:12,000
This is ridiculous.

719
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,299
You didn't get any media coverage even when you went to jail.

720
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:18,526
The internet is going crazy.

721
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:23,000
Jihoo's mother is relentless.

722
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,551
If she doesn't stop, I'll lose my mind.

723
00:48:26,551 --> 00:48:31,959
I think she knows her brother is in our storage.

724
00:48:32,799 --> 00:48:35,900
Mom, what if...

725
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,800
the police come and search our home?

726
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,926
I already took care of that.

727
00:48:42,926 --> 00:48:46,725
We can't even get rid of him if she's always out there.

728
00:48:46,725 --> 00:48:49,375
People will lose interest.

729
00:48:54,751 --> 00:48:58,999
Mrs. President, I left something behind.

730
00:48:58,999 --> 00:49:00,700
Mrs. President!

731
00:49:07,301 --> 00:49:09,876
Hey. What're you doing here?

732
00:49:09,876 --> 00:49:11,250
Oh, I...

733
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:15,125
A person went missing. His phone signal was last seen here.

734
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:16,999
I think he's inside.

735
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:20,899
Whatever, stop. Get out of here.

736
00:49:20,899 --> 00:49:23,401
Can you search inside for us?

737
00:49:23,401 --> 00:49:26,250
What do you mean? I said get lost!

738
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:28,199
I'll arrest every one of you!

739
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,999
Arrest?

740
00:49:33,999 --> 00:49:38,275
The cop was on their side. He must be inside.

741
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:41,909
They'll never let him go. What should we do?

742
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:45,699
Let's build a fire to force the rabbit out.

743
00:49:46,459 --> 00:49:49,301
Teacher, are you okay?

744
00:49:49,301 --> 00:49:50,900
I think she's right.

745
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,150
Am I the only one who doesn't get it?

746
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:54,799
You want to burn their house?

747
00:49:54,799 --> 00:49:57,950
It's a metaphor. A metaphor.

748
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:12,584
How's Jihoo?

749
00:50:12,584 --> 00:50:16,800
How many days have passed?

750
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:19,551
Will you give up?

751
00:50:19,551 --> 00:50:21,999
What? No...

752
00:50:23,076 --> 00:50:26,600
I only tried twice... maybe three times.

753
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,651
Who would give up so easily?

754
00:50:30,651 --> 00:50:36,999
I'm going to come even after you're dead.

755
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:40,899
You want to run for the rest of your life?

756
00:50:40,899 --> 00:50:45,550
Who cares if we're on the run as long as we're together.

757
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,925
A few more days will change your mind.

758
00:50:47,925 --> 00:50:50,401
I am extremely hungry.

759
00:50:50,401 --> 00:50:55,676
You were surprised at the party, right?

760
00:50:55,676 --> 00:51:00,201
You never thought so many would help us, huh?

761
00:51:00,899 --> 00:51:03,999
Wait, don't go. Let's talk a bit more.

762
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:06,899
But, umm... I'm too thirsty to talk.

763
00:51:06,899 --> 00:51:12,399
Yeah, and... Where are we?

764
00:51:12,399 --> 00:51:14,476
Grandmother...

765
00:51:14,476 --> 00:51:19,400
how many people have you tortured down here?

766
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:24,399
Your mother must have been a terrible person.

767
00:51:24,399 --> 00:51:27,175
I think she didn't love you.

768
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:32,899
You can't love if you were never loved.

769
00:51:32,899 --> 00:51:34,899
You hated my sister for not having parents.

770
00:51:34,899 --> 00:51:40,100
It would've been great if you became her mother.

771
00:51:41,626 --> 00:51:49,576
You're running for congress because you want to be loved, right?

772
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:53,242
You know...

773
00:51:53,242 --> 00:51:56,675
You and I want the exact same thing?

774
00:51:56,675 --> 00:52:01,925
Musician, congresswoman... They both want people's hearts.

775
00:52:01,925 --> 00:52:04,001
But too bad.

776
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:08,126
You have nothing besides money.

777
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:12,426
You can't buy people's hearts.

778
00:52:12,426 --> 00:52:15,150
If you aren't sincere...

779
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,600
you're bound to lose.

780
00:52:21,776 --> 00:52:26,675
Sure. Let's see how it turns out.

781
00:52:26,675 --> 00:52:28,959
Grandmother...

782
00:52:38,051 --> 00:52:41,900
♪ I should be brave ♪

783
00:52:44,776 --> 00:52:48,600

784
00:52:51,526 --> 00:52:55,476

785
00:52:57,699 --> 00:53:01,617

786
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:08,250
 Bluebird. Berry classroom's bluebird.

787
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:11,526
 He's also the choir teacher.

788
00:53:11,526 --> 00:53:13,776
 Also, he was our security guard.

789
00:53:13,776 --> 00:53:16,651
 He always tried to teach us something.

790
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,700
- Mother, a few words. 
 - Yes, all right.

791
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:24,301
My daughter went missing one day.

792
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:27,301
J. King dropped everything and found her.

793
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:30,401
 At first he looked suspicious

794
00:53:30,401 --> 00:53:31,899
 and strange, but...

795
00:53:31,899 --> 00:53:34,075
 When he sang with his nephew on the intercom,

796
00:53:34,075 --> 00:53:36,050
 it touched my heart!

797
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:41,351
 He even got stabbed while trying to save a random citizen.

798
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:46,900
 He protected his nephew from renter discrimination.

799
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,199
 He's weird but a loving, caring person.

800
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:54,825
 Now that I think of it, he's a special person.

801
00:53:54,825 --> 00:53:56,475
Great!

802
00:53:56,475 --> 00:54:00,301
The missing uncle! J. King's neighbors!

803
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:03,999
 No wait, he's the national uncle. "Uncle King."

804
00:54:03,999 --> 00:54:08,325
 We are grateful to the residents who shared with us.

805
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:12,876
 Please give them your attention and pray he is found.

806
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:15,442
 Please spread the word.

807
00:54:16,999 --> 00:54:18,499
You came?

808
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:23,526
You aren't alone.

809
00:54:41,626 --> 00:54:42,876
Thank you.

810
00:54:42,876 --> 00:54:46,101
Thanks for coming.

811
00:54:46,101 --> 00:54:47,550
Thank you.

812
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,325
Thank you.

813
00:54:53,526 --> 00:54:56,900
How'd you bring everyone?

814
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,526
Did you tell them he's here?

815
00:54:58,526 --> 00:55:02,525
No, then they'd all climb the gate.

816
00:55:02,525 --> 00:55:03,776
Then?

817
00:55:03,776 --> 00:55:05,526
Jihoo's here.

818
00:55:05,526 --> 00:55:08,125
Just like how Jihoo waits for his uncle here,

819
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:12,601
we all came to wait for J. King here.

820
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:20,851
Let's all gather our strength and try to convince his grandmother.

821
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:25,160
I think that's secretly what Jihoo wants.

822
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Be careful...

823
00:55:57,851 --> 00:55:59,626

824
00:55:59,626 --> 00:56:00,999

825
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,634
 Search for our National Uncle continues as...

826
00:56:03,634 --> 00:56:06,651
 theories of death, kidnapping, and tragedy spread.

827
00:56:06,651 --> 00:56:09,001
 Amidst the spread of unverifiable rumors...

828
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:12,375
 - A request for a forced search...  
  - Unlike what grandmother predicted,

829
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:17,250
 Uncle's story was gaining more attention.

830
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:20,101
Rumors of confinement? This is so frustrating.

831
00:56:20,101 --> 00:56:23,399
 Police will soon dispatch to where his phone signal was...

832
00:56:23,399 --> 00:56:25,401
This is ridiculous.

833
00:56:25,401 --> 00:56:27,250
A national petition?

834
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,675
Mom, can you handle this?

835
00:56:29,675 --> 00:56:34,600
Don't just sit around! We have to figure this out!

836
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:39,850
It'll die down. Just be patient and wait.

837
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:42,275
Patient? Open your damn eyes!

838
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:44,599
That isn't dying down!

839
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:49,399
Mother, Jihoo's school called to check if he went abroad.

840
00:56:49,399 --> 00:56:52,776
Child services said they're coming here tomorrow. What do we do?

841
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:54,751
This is driving me crazy!

842
00:56:54,751 --> 00:56:58,001
Why are they all gathered in front of our home?

843
00:56:58,001 --> 00:57:00,000
You two are just sitting there?

844
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,270
More people are coming!

845
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:10,940

 This is the home of the missing uncle's nephew.

855
00:57:58,776 --> 00:58:02,676
 Founder of Gangto Money candidate for congress is

856
00:58:02,676 --> 00:58:04,799
 Shin Hwaja's mansion.

857
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,509
 Yes, here we can see

858
00:58:06,509 --> 00:58:09,699
 the Uncle's fans and family all gathered together.

859
00:58:09,699 --> 00:58:13,150
 They are waiting and supporting his nephew

860
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:16,925
 in hopes that people's interests won't fade away.

861
00:58:16,925 --> 00:58:21,199
 Let's speak with a fan holding up a candle.

862
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:24,001
 - Hello. 
 - Hello.

863
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,899
 You came all the way out here.

864
00:58:25,899 --> 00:58:30,326
 You must be extremely worried. How do you feel?

865
00:58:30,326 --> 00:58:33,999
 We sincerely appreciate everyone's support.

866
00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:39,475
 More than anything else, if the president shows the miracle of opening her heart

867
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:41,884
 Uncle King will be safe...

868
00:58:41,884 --> 00:58:46,599
 I have faith that he will come back safely.

869
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:48,999
 Mrs. President, please.

870
00:58:48,999 --> 00:58:52,109
 You have been in a custody dispute for a long time.

871
00:58:52,109 --> 00:58:55,575
 Although it was revealed through the media that it was an uncomfortable relationship...

872
00:58:55,575 --> 00:59:00,401
 Nonetheless, if you help Uncle King return safely,

873
00:59:00,401 --> 00:59:03,599
 wouldn't it mean something?

874
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:08,776
She sounds like she knows everything.

875
00:59:08,776 --> 00:59:12,100
That's right. Asking Mom to help sounds like

876
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,100
she's asking her to release him.

877
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,426
 We just heard from a fan asking Shin Hwaja for support.

878
00:59:17,426 --> 00:59:19,999
Mom, you've never been this famous.

879
00:59:19,999 --> 00:59:21,776
 Fans are trying whatever they can.

880
00:59:21,776 --> 00:59:24,759
 Shin Hwaja always preached about helping others...

881
00:59:24,759 --> 00:59:29,450
Let's turn this into an opportunity!

882
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:33,426
What're you doing?  Why?

883
00:59:33,426 --> 00:59:35,901
She's so annoying.

884
00:59:40,259 --> 00:59:43,026
You mustn't waver, Mrs. President.

885
00:59:43,026 --> 00:59:46,375
Just call the police and stop the search.

886
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:50,799
Things will die down in time. Then we can get rid of him.

887
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:52,526
Look outside.

888
00:59:52,526 --> 00:59:56,825
It's too late to get rid of him like that.

889
00:59:56,825 --> 00:59:59,699
This is just temporary attention.

890
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:03,451
People are drawn to dramatic scenarios.

891
01:00:06,275 --> 01:00:08,150
That's true.

892
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:11,175
No matter what I give,

893
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:16,776
how I fill up their pockets, no one has given me their heart.

894
01:00:16,776 --> 01:00:19,725
Now, they're chanting my name.

895
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,801
Don't mind it. It's absolutely nothing.

896
01:00:25,801 --> 01:00:30,425
I lost to a poor loser with nothing to lean on.

897
01:00:30,425 --> 01:00:35,375
You didn't lose. We haven't even begun.

898
01:00:36,426 --> 01:00:38,399
I know.

899
01:00:39,526 --> 01:00:42,050
But I think...

900
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:47,401
I could use this situation and turn it around to benefit me.

901
01:00:47,401 --> 01:00:50,099
Don't you agree?

902
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:53,100
You're wrong. That's a bad idea.

903
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:57,826
It's only been 72 hours. You'd risk everything on it?

904
01:00:57,826 --> 01:01:01,225
If you let him go, we don't know what he'll do.

905
01:01:01,225 --> 01:01:04,426
You'll lose the election for sure.

906
01:01:04,426 --> 01:01:08,000
I can't accept you losing.

 His nephew's grandmother, Shin Hwaja,

 sent her people and found Uncle King in a dumpster in the Jeongsol neighborhood.

 Unfortunately, Uncle King does not remember anything.

That's your opinion.

957
01:04:57,325 --> 01:05:01,325
We want exclusive custody and parental rights.

958

And I refuse to help your campaign even in the slightest.

959

You must be relieved I'm alive.

961
01:05:11,999 --> 01:05:16,626
You would have spent the rest of your life in prison.

962
01:05:17,526 --> 01:05:20,200
I'm really famous now.

963
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:24,401
I should monopolize on it while I can.

964
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:31,576

We can't talk about Min J. without bringing up Uncle King.

993
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:44,276
What does your relationship with Uncle King, mean to you?

994
01:07:45,201 --> 01:07:49,676
He's the reason why I'm here today.

995
01:07:49,676 --> 01:07:53,426
If it wasn't for him, I probably...

996
01:07:53,426 --> 01:07:55,551
couldn't have become a musician.

997
01:07:55,551 --> 01:07:59,551
Oh, where is he now?

998
01:08:00,899 --> 01:08:02,825
Uncle...

999
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,376
disappeared.

1000
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:27,760

1001
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:36,990

1002
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:05,200

1003
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,150
 - It's him, it's Uncle King. 
 - Hello!

1004
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:09,175
 - Study hard, okay? 
 - Uncle!

1005
01:09:09,175 --> 01:09:11,384
 Greetings, King's family!

1006
01:09:11,384 --> 01:09:14,799
 This is Uncle King's photoshoot set.

1007
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:17,467
 J. King's popularity isn't a bubble.

1008
01:09:17,467 --> 01:09:20,692
 I've done my part. Take responsibility.

1009
01:09:20,692 --> 01:09:21,599
 What?

1010
01:09:21,599 --> 01:09:26,559
 Just remind me from time to time that I'm not forgetting.

1011
01:09:26,559 --> 01:09:30,218
 It's like you enjoy being a piece of shit.

1012
01:09:30,218 --> 01:09:31,699
 I don't want to live with mom!

1013
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:34,399
 I said I don't want to live with her!

1014
01:09:35,484 --> 01:09:38,700
 How about doing it with Jihoo?

1015
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,399
 No.

1016
01:09:41,342 --> 01:09:44,350
 Just go for it without your mom knowing.

1017
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:48,825
 So everyone got together and deceived me?

1018
01:09:48,825 --> 01:09:51,080
 Surprise!
