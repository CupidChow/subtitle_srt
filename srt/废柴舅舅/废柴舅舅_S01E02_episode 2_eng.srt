1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,500

2
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:11,601

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,909

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,099

5
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:26,567

6
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:33,625

7
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:37,892

8
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,080

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,159

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:59,020

11
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:05,842
 There are many reasons as to why people make extreme choices.

12
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:11,242
 Losing hopes and dreams,

13
00:01:12,242 --> 00:01:15,117
 heartbreak too painful to bear,

14
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:21,992
 or maybe a deep secret coming to light.

15
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:27,825
 Or maybe, all of the above.

16
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,790

17
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:36,626

18
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:39,241
- Ms. Song! 
 - Hello.

19
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:41,266
It's the weekend. Why are you here?

20
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,933
There's a class meeting today, so I came just in case.

21
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:46,617
It has nothing to do with our school. Why do you bother?

22
00:01:46,617 --> 00:01:48,817
Always so passionate?

23
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,692
Well, what about you?

24
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:52,508
The principal called me in.

25
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:55,349
Your classroom's Momvely Diamond met with the superintendent separately

26
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,416
and requested a change in our school program.

27
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,598
Of course she did.

28
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:02,875
She really doesn't like our autonomy system.

29
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,098
Is she even allowed to do that?

30
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:07,266
She gets what she wants.

31
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:11,058
So stop with the career coaching program.

32
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:13,383
Just teach by the textbooks and go through them quickly.

33
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,766
You don't want to get on her bad side.

34
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,266
Well, I wouldn't have come to this school otherwise.

35
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:20,692
I warned you.

36
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:39,292
You know, Jihoo's father...

37
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:43,018
Why'd he dress up so fancy for a class get-together?

38
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,566
He looks good!

39
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,491
He looks better than the dad's wearing sweats.

40
00:02:48,491 --> 00:02:53,042
- He kind of looks like his wife. 
 - Really? They look alike?

41
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,592
Yeah, they say lovers tend to look like each other.

42
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,892
You guys look similar too. Don't you agree?

43
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,892
Who? Me?

44
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:05,098
What are you trying to say? Spit it out.

45
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,942
Not everything has a passive-aggressive double meaning, you know.

46
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,667
You look like an entirely different person dressed up.

47
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,718
Yup.

48
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,742
Don't get me wrong, I didn't dress up for you.

49
00:03:22,742 --> 00:03:25,641
Do you know how big of an opportunity I gave up to be here right now?

50
00:03:25,642 --> 00:03:27,516
I hate being around people.

51
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:29,891
My presence here is...

52
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:34,142
as noble as a bumblebee's sacrifice.

53
00:03:34,142 --> 00:03:36,242
Don't care, didn't ask.

54
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,950
Throw it, throw it! Nice!

55
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,718
Throw it, throw!

56
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,267
Hey, we got this!

57
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:58,099
Throw it a bit higher!

58
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,975
You did that on purpose, right?

59
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:17,192
You did it on purpose to mess with me.

60
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:18,891
- No. 
 - So that was real?

61
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,992
Don't you know how to do anything?

62
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:23,892
It's because I'm like you. Mom said that.

63
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:26,391
How could you say that after you ate my delicious cooking?

64
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:30,918
- All my talents are focused on music. 
 - Yeah? Well, so are mine.

65
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:34,718
I heard your music on YouTube.

66
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,192
And?

67
00:04:43,142 --> 00:04:44,517
And!

68
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,834
And?

69
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:48,892
Hey, and?

70
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:57,499
Just messing with me all day...  All day...

71
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,792
Nice!

72
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:13,042
Right in the face!

73
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,392
He hit me first with his eyes! He hit me first!

74
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:30,542
Guys, this is a rubber ball.

75
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:32,899
I didn't even throw it hard...

76
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:37,998
Jihoo, I'm sorry. I took it too far.

77
00:05:37,998 --> 00:05:39,867
I'm sorry, okay?

78
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:42,199
Should I get on my knees?

79
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,492
Please continue. Master, please continue.

80
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:49,142
Right! Back to the fun!

81
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:56,691
- My apology was not sincere. 
 - I know.

82
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:57,943
Where are you going?

83
00:05:57,943 --> 00:06:00,442
To wash my hands. We're about to eat.

84
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:03,267
- You're not going to wash them? 
 - I did earlier.

85
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:07,141
Please enjoy the food.

86
00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:09,892
Noeul, you too. Eat up!

87
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:13,516
Need anything else?

88
00:06:13,517 --> 00:06:16,442
You're Jihoo's father, right?

89
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:21,267
Nice to meet you for the first time.

90
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,516
Do all of you need glasses?

91
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:27,099
You can't recognize me? Because of my clothes?

92
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:28,391
What...

93
00:06:28,392 --> 00:06:30,142
Playground...

94
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:34,992
- Oh my! The pervert! Oops! 
 - Oh, the alcoholic?

95
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:37,717
I'm sorry, that was him?

96
00:06:37,717 --> 00:06:42,818
Why didn't you say so when we met. I heard you live in apartment 3507.

97
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,242
What?

98
00:06:44,242 --> 00:06:47,516
Why did you say you were a renter? You didn't have to be humiliated.

99
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:49,266
I didn't say anything.

100
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:51,399
Oh, my apologies...

101
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,098
You really looked like a renter back then.

102
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:57,299
What are you all talking about?

103
00:06:57,299 --> 00:07:00,766
Oh, you see, we thought Jihoo's father was a renter,

104
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:03,018
we kicked him out of the playground.

105
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:04,891
- You did? 
 - Yes.

106
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:08,192
I'm sorry to hear about the misunderstanding.

107
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:11,018
All parents are on edge when it comes to their kid's safety.

108
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:13,098
I apologize on behalf of everyone.

109
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,891
Who are you to apologize on behalf of them?

110
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:20,018
Oh my... I guess Jihoo's mom didn't explain anything to you.

111
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:25,118
If she signed up for the Royal Momvely, she should have read through our rules.

112
00:07:25,118 --> 00:07:28,766
Let me introduce her. She is the pride of the Seongjak district,

113
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:33,367
the president of our Royal Momvelies, Ms. Diamond.

114
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:34,766
Whatvelies?

115
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:36,467
Momvelies!

116
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:39,267
She's our Diamond member.

117
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:43,242
Is this like a triangle scam?

118
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:47,398
They have levels like sapphire, emerald. It's a triangle scam, right?

119
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:49,899
- No, it's nothing like... 
 - It's okay.

120
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:53,018
This is a class get-together. You don't have to be rude.

121
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:56,018
Enjoy your lunch.

122
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,718
Um, yeah.

123
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:02,417
Great meeting you.

124
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:08,516
What is she? Like the pope?

125
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:12,391
Look at their attitudes change from when they thought I was a renter.

126
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,734
What'll happen if they find out that I actually am a renter?

127
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,992
How will you survive in this harsh world by being such a weakling?

128
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:26,899
Hey, how the hell did your mother raise you?

129
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,098
I love guys who are so clean.

130
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,767
Me too. The other guys are so primitive, right?

131
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:45,667
You're so cool.

132
00:08:57,492 --> 00:08:59,098
Goodbye!

133
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:02,018
- Goodbye, everyone! 
 - Good job!

134
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:03,099
So what about tomorrow?

135
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:04,500
Is this yours?

136
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,059
No.

137
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,742
I think someone mistook your shoes for theirs.

138
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:13,517
Everyone left. I'll ask in the group chat.

139
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:17,392
If it was a mistake, there should be a pair of shoes left behind.

140
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,098
That's true. You're a smart one, aren't you?

141
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:26,241
This isn't an accident. Someone intentionally took them or hid them.

142
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:30,099
There's no point in asking in the group chat.

143
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:32,367
I think we should check the CCTV.

144
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:35,042
Any idea on who it could be?

145
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:40,366
Kill him. The insurance companies won't even know what happened.

146
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:41,641
It'll be clean.

147
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:43,441
- Noeul. 
 - What?

148
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:45,867
I'm sorry, she watches too much tv.

149
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:50,691
You can wear these slippers for now. I'll go through the CCTV and contact you.

150
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,267
Thank you.

151
00:09:58,517 --> 00:09:59,918
What're you waiting for? Put 'em on.

152
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:02,558
Jihoo Min can't wear other people's shoes.

153
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,641
How can a father be so clueless about his son? Strange.

154
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,099
Noeul?

155
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:09,592
What do you mean strange?

156
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:11,992
It's because my back hurts.

157
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:14,266
Don't worry, son. I'm used to carrying you all the time.

158
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,266
It'll be fine. Let's go, my son.

159
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:18,498
Say goodbye. Goodbye.

160
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:21,099
- Bye. 
 - Let's go, bye!

161
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,867
When's your mom coming?

162
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:28,098
I don't know.

163
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:30,442
Jeez, stop.

164
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,766
Go put on some shoes. I have to go to the department store.

165
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:37,892
I don't have shoes at home.

166
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:40,042
Why don't you have shoes?

167
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:43,199
Why don't you have shoes?

168
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:45,233
No matter how poor, you should have two pairs,

169
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:47,066
one that hides toes and one that doesn't.

170
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:50,742
Did you and your mom seriously run away at night or something?

171
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:53,299
We ran away at night.

172
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:55,198
"At night."

173
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:57,998
That's not the point!

174
00:10:57,998 --> 00:11:01,009
Why didn't you think of taking shoes?

175
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:05,091
Don't answer me.

176
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:06,898
You're not curious and you don't care.

177
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:08,592
That's it. The end.

178
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:11,134
- The end! 
 - I know, the end!

179
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:13,934

180
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:16,099
Welcome.

181
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,401
- Hey, how are you? 
 - Oh, hello.

182
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:28,075
- Did you get hurt? 
 - Oh, it's nothing.

183
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:32,274
Did the get-together end? It's been bothering me that

184
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:36,501
- I sent Jihoo by himself. 
 - His father came.

185
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,875
What do you mean his father? Jihoo's father came?

186
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:45,425
Where did he take him? How did he know where to...

187
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:47,666
I told him during one of the badminton lessons.

188
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,901
Badminton?

189
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,099
Oh... It was Hyeok...

190
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,349
- I thought... Oh my... 
 - Did I cause you trouble? Again?

191
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,050
No, it's nothing. I misunderstood.

192
00:12:02,776 --> 00:12:04,951
So, you work here.

193
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:08,025
No wonder everything tastes better.

194
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:11,249
Yes. Thank you. Enjoy it! And let the others know about it, too.

195
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:12,501
Yes, of course.

196
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:14,208
Let me help you. You must be in pain.

197
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,124
No, I'm allright.
You're a customer.

198
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:17,875
No, please, let me help. It's no problem.

199
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:22,051
This is my job. I'm okay. I don't need help.

200
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,541
Yes, you are.

201
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,899
What would you like?

202
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:30,998
Try this.

203
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:35,100
I made it myself. It's really tasty.

204
00:12:36,176 --> 00:12:38,699
Thank you. I'll make sure to try it tonight.

205
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:40,910
Welcome!

206
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:03,675
Embarrassment is better than a broken back.

207
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:06,224
I can't get married with a hurt back.

208
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:10,299
And that's why you're still unmarried?

209
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,650
Can you pull out a needle and some strings from the cart?

210
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,309
I want to sew your mouth shut.

211
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:19,076
Hello.

212
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:20,875
Give me anything that'll fit him.

213
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,898
Nothing that anyone else has put on their foot before.

214
00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:26,183
I need a pair that's fresh in its bag. Something untouched.

215
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:31,670
How can a pair of children's shoes cost so much?

216
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,600
He'll quickly grow out of them anyway.

217
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:37,999
Which brat stole your shoes?

218
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:42,651
You better pay me back.

219
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:45,750
Each and every cent!

220
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,825
Any coupons or shopping mall events?

221
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:50,710
Can you write up the receipt to be more?

222
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,699
I think I have this at home.

223
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:58,167
You look like an avid shopper. I thought you didn't have money.

224
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:00,675
You don't know what you're talking about.

225
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:04,249
The department store has great discount periods.

226
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:06,282
They give you a lot of points and savings,

227
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:09,692
a lot of freebies, promotions, samples...

228
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:11,249
They even let you borrow clothes.

229
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:14,626
- They let you borrow clothes? 
 - Sure.

230
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:19,542
I want a refund. It's a change of heart.

231
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:22,999
Refund? Please wait.

232
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:25,125
Sure.

233
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,576
The candy's all melted.

234
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:35,700
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes.

235
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,300
- That's not going to be possible. 
 - Why?

236
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,051
I told you, if you took the tag off, we can't do refunds.

237
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:43,250
What do you mean?

238
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,691
I didn't take the tag off.

239
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:48,325
I wore it and made sure it was safe in the pocket.

240
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:50,559
Tada!

241
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,551
What?

242
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:54,700
The tag...

243
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,099
Where'd it go?

244
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:17,099
I bet you don't even feel bad.

245
00:15:17,826 --> 00:15:21,549
I really thought you forgot to take it off.

246
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:28,100
I can't say the words I want to say to a child.

247
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,898
But what was with her?

248
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:33,830
Does she own the suit store? Why is she being so unflexible?

249
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:49,151
Who would lose such a thing!

250
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:52,650
There's no way to return it, no name on it, or any information.

251
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:58,960
All my stress flying away with all the 5 major nutrients here.

252
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,590
Are you really not going to eat? Are you not eating your ice cream?

253
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,124
What makes you different from those Momvelies we saw earlier?

254
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:09,751
You liked me when I had my suit on.

255
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,098
Now that I took it off, your embarrassed of me?

256
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:15,299
It's not that, you've been lying all day,

257
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:17,249
doing bad things, and was immoral.

258
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:18,708
Hey, what?

259
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,218
When did I lie? What was so immoral?

260
00:16:21,218 --> 00:16:23,099
Saying you're my dad, and not my uncle...

261
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,349
I never said I was your father with my own mouth.

262
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,798
Why should I correct them every time they make an incorrect assumption?

263
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:31,198
What if they start asking you about your father?

264
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,450
Are you going to say your parents are divorced?

265
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,198
I'm not lying. I'm just being "flexible."

266
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:36,998
Everyone lives like that.

267
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:39,099
Don't believe everything you hear,

268
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,525
Don't say everything you want to say.

269
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:43,898
Why are you acting so naive?

270
00:16:43,898 --> 00:16:44,999
You're just the same.

271
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:47,549
Didn't you act like you hurt your ankle earlier?

272
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,998
Honestly, you're the type of kid to intentionally take the tag off.

273
00:16:49,998 --> 00:16:52,150
Just to mess with me!

274
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,449
Get used to it. Your life as a rich kid is over.

275
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,825
The opposite of a rich kid isn't being immoral.

276
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:01,850
If you hate it so much, why don't you run off to your grandmother?

277
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:05,650
Then you can sit here in the VVIP lounge, morally and proudly.

278
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,349
You don't have to beg about refunding clothes.

279
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:11,976
You don't have to spend time with "an immoral liar" like me.

280
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:15,990
We won't be around together much longer anyways.

281
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,099
What! Is this embarrassing, too?

282
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,951
Because I sucked the spoon?

283
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:43,449
A spoon is meant for sucking and stuff! Stop messing around.

284
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:45,490
We have to go soon.

285
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:09,676
I'm sorry, Grandma.

286
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:14,301
I don't want to go. Let go of me! No!

287
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:18,199
Hey, what's wrong with you?

288
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:20,075
I'm sorry.

289
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:21,650
She's not your grandmother,

290
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,951
Oh my! Child, are you all right?

291
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:28,349
- My bag, I need my inhaler! 
 - Inhaler?

292
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:30,926
Wait, wait, hold up. Just wait!

293
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:33,490
Mr. Congressman, are you okay?

294
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,750
That's ours.

295
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:56,699
Oh... Sorry. I mistook it for ours.

296
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,160
Are you looking for your mail?

297
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,501
Apartment 804 has been empty. Did you just move in?

298
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:12,075
Yes. What's your number?

299
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:27,541
If you just moved here, does your child attend Dongmin Elementary School?

300
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,499
Yes, and yours?

301
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:34,426
Well...

302
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:42,326
How can she just ask questions and not reply to mine?

303
00:19:50,726 --> 00:19:53,099
Why is this pulled up...?

304
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:09,599
Are you okay?

305
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:15,299
You sound okay.

306
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,917
That's loud.

307
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:21,875
Wow, you're really healthy, huh?

308
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,451
Are you all right— Oh, the smell...

309
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:28,899
That smell is outrageous!

310
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:30,124
What did you eat?

311
00:20:30,124 --> 00:20:32,624
Something's wrong, did you eat something rotten?

312
00:20:32,624 --> 00:20:33,867
That's the worst smell on Earth.

313
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:34,999
 It's not me.

314
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:37,509
Stinking up the entire place!

315
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:41,576
How rude of you.

316
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:43,998
 Just wait outside.

317
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:45,442
Just talk to me, speak.

318
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:47,899
 Just get out!

319
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:50,699
This kid! So bossy.

320
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,442
It's not me.

321
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:09,442
Right? The homeroom teacher?

322
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:14,184
- Oh, yes. Hello. 
 - Hello.

323
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:16,491
Oh, it's not me, nope, not me.

324
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:19,108
Jihoo's in the toilet.

325
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:21,483
I see.

326
00:21:21,483 --> 00:21:24,241
I assume you went with him to the get-together?

327
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,099
Yes.

328
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:32,241
I bought a suit.

329
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:36,299
And bought Jihoo a pair of shoes. What are you here to buy?

330
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,798
The mall is on a sale period, so I just dropped by.

331
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,858
Discounts are good if you know when to come.

332
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:43,808
They give you a lot of points, savings,

333
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:47,100
freebies, promotion products, and samples.

334
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:52,792
- Why? 
 - I mean...

335
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:55,720
I just couldn't agree more.

336
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:05,726
Excuse me, Teacher, but...

337
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:09,299
I'm not trying to pull anything here.

338
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:14,641
I'm not hitting on you or anything... I'm genuinely curious.

339
00:22:14,642 --> 00:22:16,434
What I'm saying is...

340
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:20,634
Ask me freely, it's okay.

341
00:22:22,726 --> 00:22:24,799
You know me?

342
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,224
Do you remember me?

343
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,525
- Who? 
 - What?

344
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:33,725
What was my question?

345
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:35,399
What was it?

346
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:36,633
I don't know.

347
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:41,067
Oh, do you know me?

348
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:42,634
You're Jihoo's uncle.

349
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:46,151
Not that. You feel familiar.

350
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:50,076
- I have a common face. 
 - Of course.

351
00:22:50,076 --> 00:22:51,825
Yes.

352
00:22:51,825 --> 00:22:55,274
No, no! That's not what I meant!

353
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,875
Just tell me honestly.

354
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:01,374
When you first saw me at school, you were surprised, weren't you?

355
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:03,626
Was I?

356
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:09,034
You must be extremely famous, someone everyone knows.

357
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:14,326
No, it's not like that...

358
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,775
What's the point of being famous in the past?

359
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,725
The present is what matters.

360
00:23:19,725 --> 00:23:22,600
What took you so long?

361
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,618
Hi, Jihoo...

362
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:29,600
What's wrong? Did something happen to you?

363
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,998
Did something happen?

364
00:23:30,998 --> 00:23:34,199
I'm not sure... You okay?

365
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:37,100
Am I allowed to... play that piano?

366
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,583
Jihoo's such a talented pianist. He's a great student as well.

367
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:21,034
Not to mention, very popular among the female students.

368
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:23,625
- I guess he's just like me. 
 - I guess so.

369
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:27,098
Especially his music talent.

370
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,883
Yeah.

371
00:24:30,142 --> 00:24:31,800
Excuse me?

372
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:41,900
J. King. Right?

373
00:24:48,425 --> 00:24:51,000
I knew it.

374
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,926
How long have you known?

375
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,999
You just wanted to mess with me?

376
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:57,624
It wasn't the right situation.

377
00:24:57,624 --> 00:25:00,198
So much time has passed since. How could you possibly remember me?

378
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,274
There's no way... Were you my fan?

379
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:04,498
Is that wrong?

380
00:25:04,498 --> 00:25:08,025
Of course! Look how sad my situation is.

381
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:11,625
You should be glad you're not my fan.

382
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:15,975
If you said you were, screw the kid,

383
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:19,900
I would disappear as fast as I could.

384
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:23,701
So I guess you were in high school when you saw me?

385
00:25:23,701 --> 00:25:24,626
Yes.

386
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:29,524
Wow, from student to teacher?

387
00:25:29,524 --> 00:25:30,898
How amazing.

388
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:35,200
It's thanks to someone. He gave me the strength.

389
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,375
I see.

390
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:41,176
Damn, what have I been doing?

391
00:25:41,176 --> 00:25:45,240
Just got screwed left and right,and now I'm old...

392
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:51,101
You didn't give up on music, did you?

393
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:57,225
I don't know. I don't even know what I am or what I'm doing.

394
00:25:57,876 --> 00:26:02,042
I'm just a complete nobody.

395
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:16,599
During class, I asked the students how they felt when winter came.

396
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,126
What?

397
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:20,691
Winter vacation. Kimchi-making for the winter.

398
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:22,583
It snows.

399
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,825
I get sick.

400
00:26:24,825 --> 00:26:27,875
But one child said...

401
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:32,600
When winter comes, spring is close.

402
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,825
Flowers will bloom soon...

403
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:38,098
The reason we all stop behind a red light is

404
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:42,599
because we know it'll turn green, right?

405
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:49,199
Do you remember how many people cheered and liked J. King?

406
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:55,201
I'm sure many people gained strength and inspiration from J. King.

407
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:59,350
So, don't think that it was all for nothing.

408
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,751
There have to be people waiting for J. King to make a comeback.

409
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:07,999
Waiting for him to make music again.

410
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:10,426
Including me.

411
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:18,808
When you think of a femme fatale, people usually think of sexy, hot, seductive women.

412
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:20,058
Right?

413
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:21,349
But I disagree.

414
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,099
She's the real femme fatale.

415
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,975
A woman who catches a man's heart and makes him soar to the end of the sky.

416
00:27:28,976 --> 00:27:32,225
That's the deadliest kind. What do you think?

417
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:37,098
What's with that unforgiving face?

418
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:38,725
She's my teacher.

419
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:42,751
It's her job to guide students with special needs.

420
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:44,600
Students with special needs?

421
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:47,750
I'm just saying. It's her job.

422
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,600
Anyways, it's been a while since I got inspired.

423
00:27:52,601 --> 00:27:56,098
I'm going to write a song today. You know the feeling, right?

424
00:27:56,099 --> 00:28:00,266
This sudden rush of inspiration, where you just have to make music?

425
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:05,224
When I can't find the words or express myself,

426
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,725
that's when I write songs.

427
00:28:09,475 --> 00:28:11,800
What was so hard that you couldn't even talk?

428
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:16,501
Why'd you freak out when you saw someone resembling your grandmother?

429
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:18,651
You said you don't want anything to do with us.

430
00:28:18,651 --> 00:28:22,501
You're not curious and you don't care that today's the last time we see each other.

431
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:27,301
Thanks for the reminder. I was just about to get curious.

432
00:28:28,851 --> 00:28:33,776
Right! About your music that I heard on YouTube earlier...

433
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:34,999
Yes?

434
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:37,199
It wasn't bad.

435
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:39,326
I liked it.

436
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,225
Odd. Why are you being nice?

437
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,851
Because you're not coming back.

438
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,100
I'm not. Why would I?

439
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,350
Are you crazy?

440
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:58,151
I'm not entering your home, I'm just using your toilet.

441
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:01,766
Where have you been?

442
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,975
I heard the get-together ended a long time ago.

443
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:05,526
How was it?

444
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:08,175
Yeah. Uncle came for me.

445
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,501
Thanks for today! I didn't expect it.

446
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:17,751
 He just transferred. How could you send him by himself?

447
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:20,600
He's already in the 5th grade. What's the fuss?

448
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:24,474
 Once a year, kids spend time with... Whatever nevermind!!

449
00:29:24,475 --> 00:29:26,224
 They still don't know that you live in a rental.

450
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:27,933
 Be careful. They're crazy.

451
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:32,476
What's wrong with living in a rental apartment? So childish.

452
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,266
How could you be so naive?

453
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:40,651
Everyone thinks I'm your husband, so just don't get caught.

454
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:43,125
- Take the coffee. 
 - Don't need it.

455
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,426
Uncle, take this.

456
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:49,492
It's for the shoes.

457
00:29:55,851 --> 00:29:58,017
What was that? What do you mean "for the shoes"?

458
00:29:58,018 --> 00:30:00,451
We had some problems today.

459
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:06,000
Did you change your ringtone?

460
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,892
No?

461
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:18,551
Oh my! I think he confused my phone with his.

462
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:25,098
 Someone rented out the storage unit you were living in.

463
00:30:25,099 --> 00:30:26,899
 Where are you going to live now?

464
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:30,474
You're with your family anyways.

465
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:33,325
Why don't you sort things out and stay with them for a while?

466
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:37,098
Hello? I'm Joonhyeok's sister...

467
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:38,899
Oh, hello.

468
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:41,349
It's good to hear that he's with you.

469
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,951
I was worried.

470
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:48,725
Pardon me, but where is he staying?

471
00:30:48,726 --> 00:30:51,058
Well, nowhere now.

472
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,850
He was supposed to be on a deep-sea fishing boat today.

473
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,499
But he ditched work to meet his nephew. He missed work!

474
00:30:57,225 --> 00:31:01,175
Why was he supposed to be on a boat?

475
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:07,058
Where to now?

476
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:09,150
Let's just go.

477
00:31:12,726 --> 00:31:14,499
This isn't mine!

478
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:17,650
Jeez.

479
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,099
Who even calls for so long?

480
00:31:23,601 --> 00:31:26,375
I have to return this and get mine back.

481
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,150
Curiosity 'did' kill the cat but...

482
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:40,075
 Immoral liar.

483
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:44,525
I didn't do it. I didn't listen!

484
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:51,559
What is a musician doing on a ship...?

485
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,109
Mom, there are photos of us on the phone, right...?

486
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:01,999
- He wouldn't look. 
 - He would.

487
00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:05,084
He'll be back.

488
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:08,609
Anyways, what's with the shoe money?

489
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:11,276
I lost my shoes at the get-together.

490
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,334
Did someone take them on purpose?

491
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:17,818
I don't care.

492
00:32:17,818 --> 00:32:21,933
- You want me to take care of it? 
 - I expected worse.

493
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:25,142
- Strong boy. 
 - I'm your son.

494
00:32:27,434 --> 00:32:30,009
 Our phones were switched.

495
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:42,692
- Come in for a second. 
 - Why? Give me my phone.

496
00:32:42,692 --> 00:32:45,350
Then don't.

497
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,808
What? Just cough it up. I'm busy.

498
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:55,084
You're not busy. You don't even have anywhere to go.

499
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,009
Did you go through my phone?

500
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:03,308
You call me immoral? What's this, then?

501
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:06,867
Uncle, you didn't go through mom's phone?

502
00:33:08,434 --> 00:33:11,392

503
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:21,283
I would never stoop that low.

504
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:25,098
I have every right to know why they ran away during the night.

505
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:27,517
This is not immoral.

506
00:33:27,517 --> 00:33:30,098
 Your first new message.

507
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:34,558
 She's now tracking your phone and chasing you.

508
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,710
 It's going as expected, but I still can't sleep.

509
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,750
  I'm worried...

510
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:44,183
 Jihoo's mom, how are you?

511
00:33:44,183 --> 00:33:45,808
 How is our Jihoo?

512
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:48,859
 Never mind my questions.

513
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:52,199
 Just stay well hidden, okay?

514
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:56,683
 I never want to see you or Jihoo get beat again.

515
00:33:56,684 --> 00:33:59,899
 Stay hidden. I'm hanging up.

516
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,684
Uncle, you didn't go through her phone?

517
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:29,933
Of course not! What do you take me for!

518
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,058
- That room is empty. 
 - So what?

519
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:33,808
- It's yours! 
 - Are you crazy?

520
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:36,683
Live with you? No, thank you.

521
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:41,883
Did you give up on music? Why are you getting on boats?

522
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:43,809
I needed the money.

523
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:47,234
Why don't you even have a home? Why do you live in a storage unit?

524
00:34:47,234 --> 00:34:51,259
How the hell did you know? And who are you to talk?

525
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:53,349
Just stay here.

526
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:56,098
Look after Jihoo until I settle down. I'll pay you.

527
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:57,751
Hey!

528
00:34:57,751 --> 00:35:00,308
Are you crazy? Seriously just stop.

529
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:02,709
I don't need your pity!

530
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:07,909
You're the reason I live like this! If you hadn't taken my money!

531
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,559
You just...

532
00:35:13,934 --> 00:35:15,684
It's not mom's fault!

533
00:35:15,684 --> 00:35:17,099
Jihoo.

534
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:19,433
Mom didn't do anything wrong.

535
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:22,409
It's all because of me.

536
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:23,959
What?

537
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:29,299
You said it yourself. I stole your dreams!

538
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:32,399
You said I ruined everything.

539
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:37,234
So, stop being mean to my mom.

540
00:35:38,684 --> 00:35:39,759
That's not what I meant!

541
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:45,259
You hate me, right? That's why you have a photo of me.

542
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:47,909
To look and remember what you hate.

543
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:52,334
Jihoo.

544
00:35:53,909 --> 00:35:56,534
Think whatever you want.

545
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:58,909
Whatever you want.

546
00:35:59,434 --> 00:36:03,883
Don't listen to your uncle. He's just angry at me.

547
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,634
He must have seen all the photos on your phone.

548
00:36:12,634 --> 00:36:15,151
He knows everything.

549
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:20,359
And he still left.

550
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:25,484
Even if he has nowhere to go, he doesn't want to be with us.

551
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:28,098
He's not curious and he doesn't care...

552
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:33,259
Just let him leave.

553
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:45,709
Oh my god!  Out of nowhere. What the heck!

554
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:47,509
Is this guy crazy?

555
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:50,709
What's wrong with you? Why did you jump in front of the car?

556
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:53,499
You... Why are you...

557
00:36:53,499 --> 00:36:55,325
Who are you?

558
00:36:55,325 --> 00:36:59,058
- Who are you? 
 - I'm Kyungsoo's girlfriend.

559
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:02,433
Are you proud of being a married man's girlfriend?

560
00:37:02,434 --> 00:37:05,308
Hey, I'm not married! I divorced your sister!

561
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:08,017
- Oh, you divorced, yeah? 
 - You didn't know?

562
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,592
You haven't been in contact

563
00:37:09,592 --> 00:37:12,859
What the hell are you talking about? How would I talk to her?

564
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:14,683
She changed her number.

565
00:37:14,684 --> 00:37:17,683
How many times have I been kicked out of this house?

566
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:20,683
Joonhee would have contacted you, didn't she?

567
00:37:20,684 --> 00:37:24,234
You don't know shit about your wife, do you?

568
00:37:24,234 --> 00:37:26,159
Jihoo's uncle?

569
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:28,184
Yes...

570
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:32,484
Darling, go inside and get washed. I'll be right up.

571
00:37:36,183 --> 00:37:39,058
Why are you here? You don't even talk to your sister.

572
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:41,599
I need some money.

573
00:37:42,934 --> 00:37:44,142
This guy...

574
00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:48,559
Are you still living like a pathetic beggar?

575
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,583
Hello?

576
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,509
Who is it?

577
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:57,098
Wow, Sis?

578
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:01,083
What incredible timing here!

579
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:04,058
As promised, I called every 5 minutes.

580
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:06,683
Yeah, good job.

581
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,433
Of course, I've been waiting for your call.

582
00:38:08,434 --> 00:38:11,808
I have money.  Ask her where she is.

583
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:13,098
Don't tell her you're with me.

584
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:15,308
I'm at your house with your husband.

585
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:16,183
Hey!

586
00:38:16,184 --> 00:38:19,559
- But he said you divorced. 
 - Stop!

587
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:22,808
Why'd you get a divorce? Let's hear the details!

588
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:25,558
No way.

589
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:29,909
What kind of person would beat her daughter-in-law?

590
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:32,308
What kind of monster would beat her own grandson!

591
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,199
No, no... It's not like that.

592
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:36,909
- It's not like that. 
 - Beat you two with what?

593
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:38,499
A golf club?

594
00:38:40,009 --> 00:38:43,659
There are two sides to the story. It's a misunderstanding.

595
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:46,234
Oh, you have all the evidence?

596
00:38:46,234 --> 00:38:50,709
But what the heck was your husband doing during all of this?

597
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:53,009
What was your husband doing?

598
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:57,034
What? He hit you too? He didn't stop anything?

599
00:38:57,099 --> 00:38:59,499
You piece of trash!

600
00:38:59,499 --> 00:39:04,098
- Hey, hey, stop. 
 - You think you can get away with it?

601
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:06,308
- Wait. We have a CCTV. 
 - Come here!

602
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:07,933
Hey, look! Look!

603
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:09,559
Yeah?

604
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:11,834
It'll record your last moments alive.

605
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:13,683
- Come here! 
 - I'm sorry!

606
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,224
Please, let's talk!

607
00:39:15,225 --> 00:39:17,576
- Come here! 
 - Wait!

608
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:20,399
Hey!

609
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,350
You!

610
00:39:21,351 --> 00:39:25,599
I'm sorry. I fucked up. It's all my fault.

611
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:33,433
Are you scared? You feel terrified, huh?

612
00:39:33,434 --> 00:39:35,134
Enough to piss yourself, right?

613
00:39:35,134 --> 00:39:38,999
Yeah, I'm scared. I'm really scared.

614
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:44,609
How did my sister feel? What about the kid!

615
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:56,725
It's a new car! You piece of...!

616
00:39:56,726 --> 00:39:58,609
Damn it...!

617
00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:00,709
You can fix a car!

618
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:02,933
But you can't fix beaten people!

619
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,990
When people get beat...

620
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:10,599
It stays as a scar, forever!

621
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:14,499
Don't look for them.

622
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:18,159
Nor Jihoo.

623
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:22,967
If you look for them, I'll do you worse than what I've done to your car.

624
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:33,433
I didn't even apply it yet.

625
00:40:33,434 --> 00:40:36,558
Then why does it hurt so much?  It stings...

626
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,199
It's your heart.

627
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,098
She's a strong woman. She would never take a beating.

628
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:44,417
Ten years have passed, right?

629
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:48,283
I'm sure she fought back at first.

630
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:52,725
But when things repeat, again and again, people get accustomed...

631
00:40:52,726 --> 00:40:56,192
If a person has nothing, they lose their pride.

632
00:40:56,192 --> 00:40:58,359
It's scientifically proven.

633
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:02,184
How could you think of staying here? Aren't you embarrassed towards Yeonjoo?

634
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:05,534
Are you worried about me? Thank you so much.

635
00:41:05,534 --> 00:41:08,433
You should send the kid back to his rich family.

636
00:41:08,434 --> 00:41:11,098
Can you just stay out of it?

637
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:12,559
Hold up.

638
00:41:13,884 --> 00:41:18,182
I was born into a family of doctors.  I had to become our 4th generation doctor.

639
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:22,999
Music as life for you guys, right? For me, it's just a hobby.

640
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:27,434
For now, your nephew can escape from violence and oppression with his music.

641
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:28,808
But look at his reality.

642
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:32,433
All he has is you. You're broke and useless.

643
00:41:32,434 --> 00:41:37,199
I would advise him to go back to his father, rather than live a beggar's life like you.

644
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:41,483
Come back, play with us.

645
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:44,558
Babe, what's taking so long? Come back.

646
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:47,098
Why do they love me so much?

647
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:52,259
I have money and I have power. I'm the alpha "top dog."

648
00:41:54,183 --> 00:41:58,684
He eats expensive food but still craps out of his mouth.

649
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:01,634
Does he think all rich people are like him?

650
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:05,809
Do as your sister asked. Take care of your nephew.

651
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:08,308
Haven't you been listening?

652
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:11,059
I hate to admit it but he's right.

653
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:13,709
How could a person like me take care of him?

654
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:18,809
No one in this world carries around toilet paper in case they need to take a dump.

655
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:24,134
They first take the dump, then politely ask for some toilet paper.

656
00:42:24,183 --> 00:42:25,834
Then, surprisingly,

657
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:29,284
the guy in the next cubical hands them over some of his toilet paper from below.

658
00:42:29,284 --> 00:42:31,209
That's life.

659
00:42:31,209 --> 00:42:35,909
You and your sister are enemies? All family members are enemies.

660
00:42:35,909 --> 00:42:39,034
Five minutes together is enough to make you want to kill each other.

661
00:42:39,034 --> 00:42:42,559
But if someone else messes with your family?

662
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,667
You're on the same side.

663
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:48,099
Don't complicate things. Just throw rocks at them.

664
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:20,098
- Oops 
 - I got it...

665
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:23,084
Can you just not do anything? Just stay put!

666
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:26,009
Just go sing! On stage!

667
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:30,184
I decided not to touch my guitar until I save enough money for an album.

668
00:43:30,184 --> 00:43:31,558
What about when you flirt with girls?

669
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:34,534
How could I possibly be flirting with girls right now?

670
00:43:34,534 --> 00:43:36,309
Who knows?

671
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:37,808
Maybe I'll fall for you again if you flirt.

672
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:43,499
That's a cruel joke. You shouldn't play with your elder!

673
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:46,359
Hey, you've got a call.

674
00:43:48,809 --> 00:43:52,709
 Hi, I'm Jihoo's homeroom teacher.

675
00:43:52,709 --> 00:43:56,209
Oh, hello! How can I help you?

676
00:43:57,309 --> 00:44:01,026
How'd you get my number?

677
00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:17,480
The Taekwondo gym contacted us.

678
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,984
What's that kid's name? Park... Sechan Park, right?

679
00:44:20,984 --> 00:44:22,850
Where's his home?

680
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:25,433
Everyone's probably at Mingi's...

681
00:44:25,434 --> 00:44:27,051
Mingi?

682
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:29,683
- Hello. 
 - Welcome, Sechan.

683
00:44:29,684 --> 00:44:32,182
- Hello. 
 - Please, come in.

684
00:44:32,183 --> 00:44:34,434
Happy birthday!

685
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:38,098
I don't need those shoes back. I've got new ones

686
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,098
You want to be a loser forever?

687
00:44:40,099 --> 00:44:43,642
If you transferred to a new school, you should live a new life.

688
00:44:44,234 --> 00:44:46,734
What does it matter to you if I live as a loser or not?

689
00:44:46,734 --> 00:44:48,709
You said you're not curious and you don't care.

690
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:52,309
You said you wouldn't come back. Why are you back?

691
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:54,999
Don't worry. I really won't be back.

692
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:58,959
You went to the get-together with me, which is why I have to take care of this.

693
00:44:58,959 --> 00:45:00,583
Hurry!

694
00:45:02,959 --> 00:45:04,183
Hello, welcome.

695
00:45:04,225 --> 00:45:06,584
Welcome! The party has just begun. Please, come in.

696
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:09,098
Can you just call out a kid called Sechan?

697
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:10,433
We've got one more of Mingi's friends.

698
00:45:10,434 --> 00:45:11,809
Excuse me?

699
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,099
Excuse me.

700
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:43,434
♪ Happy birthday! Happy birthday! ♪

701
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,799
♪ Happy birthday to dear Mingi... ♪

702
00:45:46,799 --> 00:45:49,098
- You came? 
 - Yes.

703
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:50,891
I'm here for the shoe thief.

704
00:45:50,892 --> 00:45:53,599
Really? Who is it?

705
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:57,359
- Sechan. 
 - Sechan?

706
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,909
I checked the CCTV footage.

707
00:45:59,909 --> 00:46:02,359
I don't think today is a good day for that.

708
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:03,808
You're right.

709
00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:06,659
How can a kid's birthday party be so grand?

710
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:10,618
Happy birthday!

711
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:14,224
- Mingi! Happy birthday! 
 - Thanks.

712
00:46:14,225 --> 00:46:16,459
- Happy birthday! 
 - Thanks.

713
00:46:16,459 --> 00:46:18,584
Happy birthday!

714
00:46:18,584 --> 00:46:21,934
Huh? Jihoo is here.

715
00:46:21,934 --> 00:46:23,859
Hey, Jihoo!

716
00:46:23,859 --> 00:46:25,899
- Greetings, Jihoo's father! 
 - Yeah...

717
00:46:25,899 --> 00:46:28,859
You didn't even bring a present?

718
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:30,459
That little brat.

719
00:46:30,459 --> 00:46:32,992
It's fine. Everyone, come to my room!

720
00:46:32,992 --> 00:46:35,184
Hey, Jihoo, come with us.

721
00:46:35,684 --> 00:46:37,609
Jihoo, come with me.

722
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:40,299
Just survive it. Leave the rest to me.

723
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:45,459
Sorry to interrupt but I...

724
00:46:45,459 --> 00:46:46,734
Attention, please!

725
00:46:46,734 --> 00:46:48,584
Excuse me, Sechan's mother?

726
00:46:48,584 --> 00:46:52,792
Now that all the kids are having fun, should we have our own fun?

727
00:46:52,792 --> 00:46:54,182
Yeah! Great!

728
00:46:54,183 --> 00:47:00,584
As everyone knows, we have the most famous person in the Seongjak district here!

729
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,034
Everyone, please welcome!

730
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:07,808
Hwang Geunyoung! Hwang Geunyoung!

731
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:10,226
Am I the only one that doesn't know him?

732
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:16,859
Who is he? Does everyone know besides me?

733
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:18,683
No, no, please.

734
00:47:18,684 --> 00:47:20,266
He's a congressman, representing Seongjak district.

735
00:47:20,267 --> 00:47:26,334
Today, I am not here as a senator but as Hyeryeong's best friend.

736
00:47:26,334 --> 00:47:27,892
Please, take a seat.

737
00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:31,651
- What's so hot about being a Senator? 
 - He's popular.

738
00:47:31,651 --> 00:47:36,609
Since his election, our district's housing prices have skyrocketed.

739
00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:40,098
But why is a member of the parliament at a child's birthday party?

740
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:44,433
The Royal Momvelies were in charge of his election campaign.

741
00:47:44,434 --> 00:47:46,109
Jeez. What don't they do?

742
00:47:46,109 --> 00:47:49,099
I show my greatest respects towards Park Hyeryeong.

743
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,641
Thanks to that, he was elected despite not being from the constituency.

744
00:47:51,642 --> 00:47:53,799
It's was a win-win for everyone.

745
00:47:54,434 --> 00:47:56,292
It's a symbiotic relationship.

746
00:47:56,292 --> 00:48:01,840
Mr. Senator, I'm sure everyone is excited to hear the good news.

747
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:07,667
You're right! I had a deep conversation with the Ministry of Education today.

748
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:11,850
As do I, I'm sure all families here

749
00:48:11,851 --> 00:48:13,808
in the Royal Estate sincerely want the same thing.

750
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:16,098
We all want the same thing, when it comes to changing

751
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:19,509
our autonomous school into a normal, general elementary school?

752
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:24,308
Senator, there is still time until the re-elections. Is it possible?

753
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:26,442
We must make it possible.

754
00:48:26,442 --> 00:48:32,059
Not only that, we are thoroughly reviewing issues related to rental apartments.

755
00:48:36,934 --> 00:48:38,976
But aren't we at a child's birthday party?

756
00:48:42,242 --> 00:48:44,899
- And? 
 - I mean, it's kind of weird.

757
00:48:44,899 --> 00:48:47,182
He says he's here as a friend.

758
00:48:47,183 --> 00:48:51,509
But to me, he's here as a politician, trying to win over votes illegally

759
00:48:51,509 --> 00:48:53,999
at a child's birthday party.

760
00:48:53,999 --> 00:48:56,799
Wasn't everything already settled before I got here, Mrs. Park?

761
00:48:56,799 --> 00:48:59,292
They're new to the neighborhood.

762
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:03,417
Jihoo's father, I'll explain in detail at the class meeting next week.

763
00:49:03,417 --> 00:49:06,391
Oh, don't bother. I get what's going on.

764
00:49:06,392 --> 00:49:09,967
The child's birthday party is just an excuse to gather everyone,

765
00:49:09,967 --> 00:49:14,018
buy some votes, and get what you want. Right? Illegally?

766
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:16,442
Am I wrong?

767
00:49:16,442 --> 00:49:17,967
Maybe I misunderstood.

768
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:19,967
Did I misunderstand something?

769
00:49:28,642 --> 00:49:31,567
- Please, prepare for dinner. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

770
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:33,600
I knew it when I saw him at the playground.

771
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:35,467
He's a little snake.

772
00:49:35,467 --> 00:49:38,717
The Senator left because he was angry, right? What should we do?

773
00:49:38,717 --> 00:49:42,474
There are people like us and people who are different.

774
00:49:42,475 --> 00:49:43,799
Don't worry.

775
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:47,692
How are you always so calm?

776
00:49:47,692 --> 00:49:51,350
- You're such an amazing woman. 
 - Amazing.

777
00:49:57,142 --> 00:50:00,292
I'm guessing Noeul's mother is busy as well?

778
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:01,999
Well...

779
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,542
We lost her mother...

780
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:12,192
Sorry... I didn't know.

781
00:50:12,192 --> 00:50:15,918
I'm actually not Jihoo's father.

782
00:50:15,918 --> 00:50:17,917
I'm his uncle.

783
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:20,942
My sister got divorced.

784
00:50:22,142 --> 00:50:23,334
Shush.

785
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:24,641
Of course...

786
00:50:24,642 --> 00:50:28,799
I thought Chaeyoung would be here today. It's unfortunate not to see her.

787
00:50:28,799 --> 00:50:33,017
I asked her to take a day off. It's her brother's birthday.

788
00:50:33,018 --> 00:50:37,018
But she insisted she wanted to stay at the dorms to study.

789
00:50:37,018 --> 00:50:41,098
I just wish my Sodam could become like Chaeyoung.

790
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:42,467
You're asking for too much.

791
00:50:42,467 --> 00:50:45,350
She's just like you. She just likes being pretty.

792
00:50:46,392 --> 00:50:51,266
I heard Sodam's grandfather was opening a hospital for you in Gangnam.

793
00:50:51,267 --> 00:50:53,098
Why are you bringing that up?

794
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:54,766
You said that...

795
00:50:54,767 --> 00:50:58,266
your in-laws were paying for an apartment and hospital in Gangnam for you.

796
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:01,098
You mentioned it previously, so I was just curious.

797
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:04,141
We had to give them a grandson but it's all over now.

798
00:51:04,142 --> 00:51:06,017
We're both getting old.

799
00:51:06,018 --> 00:51:08,098
Why are you blaming my age?

800
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:10,499
If you want to see the stars, you have to look at the sky.

801
00:51:12,018 --> 00:51:13,959
Why don't you look up at the skies?

802
00:51:13,959 --> 00:51:15,875
Sodam's mother still looks as young and beautiful as ever.

803
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:16,652
Are you crazy?

804
00:51:16,652 --> 00:51:18,526
She has a body of a woman in her 20's.

805
00:51:18,526 --> 00:51:21,017
- Stop. 
 - Thank you.

806
00:51:21,018 --> 00:51:22,334
Who are you?

807
00:51:22,334 --> 00:51:25,801
Jihoo's father, what do you do?

808
00:51:30,642 --> 00:51:32,642
I'm a S-S-W.

809
00:51:33,642 --> 00:51:35,850
A singer-songwriter.

810
00:51:35,851 --> 00:51:39,417
I'm a musician that writes, composes, and sings.

811
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:45,192
No wonder you were a bit different. You're an artist.

812
00:51:45,192 --> 00:51:48,567
Considering your age, are you a Trot singer?

813
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:51,100
Is there a song we would know?

814
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,517
- Perhaps... 
 - Sing. Let's see if we recognize your song.

815
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,099
Yeah, sing for us.

816
00:51:57,642 --> 00:52:03,308
Sing! Sing! Sing!

817
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:06,391
I don't think it's the right place and time to do so.

818
00:52:06,392 --> 00:52:10,098
You must not be a professional. You're shy.

819
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:14,433
Do you still perform? I haven't seen you on TV.

820
00:52:14,434 --> 00:52:15,434
Yeah, well.

821
00:52:15,435 --> 00:52:18,042
Then, how do you make a living? You don't make any money?

822
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:21,499
Jihoo's mother must be a doctor or lawyer or something.

823
00:52:21,499 --> 00:52:23,598
- How else would they live in such a nice apartment? 
 - Well, not exactly...

824
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,391
Oh, you're a shutter man!

825
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,717
I'm so jealous.

826
00:52:27,717 --> 00:52:30,042
That's not...

827
00:52:30,042 --> 00:52:32,725
Everyone, let's eat.

828
00:52:32,726 --> 00:52:35,433
The special order of steamed rib stew is here.

829
00:52:35,434 --> 00:52:37,267
Sounds delicous!

830
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:39,859
Well...

831
00:52:39,859 --> 00:52:42,933
I don't think I can bring up the shoe. I'm leaving.

832
00:52:42,934 --> 00:52:46,567
Should I leave with you?

833
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:47,699
You're leaving?

834
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:52,067
The kitchen is this way. You can come in and set the table.

835
00:52:53,567 --> 00:52:56,099
Oh, we've met before, right?

836
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:00,242
We met at the rental apartment. The mailbox.

837
00:53:00,242 --> 00:53:03,292
- Are you staying? 
 - No, umm...

838
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:05,141
Oh, hello.

839
00:53:05,142 --> 00:53:09,667
Aren't you Jihoo's mother? Right?

840
00:53:15,899 --> 00:53:18,242
Why're you here?

841
00:53:18,899 --> 00:53:20,818
I had to take care of something...

842
00:53:20,818 --> 00:53:23,642
It's a kid's birthday. I came with Jihoo.

843
00:53:24,392 --> 00:53:27,484
You're Jihoo's mother?

844
00:53:27,484 --> 00:53:29,899
But you live in the rental apartment, right?

845
00:53:29,899 --> 00:53:34,999
No, she said she lived in building 3507.

846
00:53:34,999 --> 00:53:39,551
No, I did. I must have mistaken.

847
00:53:39,551 --> 00:53:42,342
Everyone makes mistakes,

848
00:53:42,342 --> 00:53:46,899
but she should have corrected you.

849
00:53:46,899 --> 00:53:51,734
I guess we weren't in the wrong at the playground, then?

850
00:53:51,734 --> 00:53:53,699
Seriously?

851
00:53:59,999 --> 00:54:04,699
Greetings, everyone. I'm Min Jihoo's mother.

852
00:54:06,592 --> 00:54:11,818
I don't live in apartment 3507. I live in the rental apartment.

853
00:54:11,818 --> 00:54:16,098
I wasn't trying to hide anything. I couldn't find the right time to explain.

854
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:19,967
Your husband has had many.

855
00:54:20,684 --> 00:54:22,433
Let's leave it at that.

856
00:54:22,434 --> 00:54:26,349
Yes. It's a common miscommunication.

857
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,725
She might run away embarrassed.

858
00:54:28,726 --> 00:54:31,433
The door is over there.

859
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,999
There are many doors here. I didn't want you to get lost.

860
00:54:36,142 --> 00:54:40,718
I understand that you wanted to hide it, but it was really rude.

861
00:54:40,718 --> 00:54:43,391
You spent with us...

862
00:54:43,392 --> 00:54:47,017
You moms just assumed. I never said anything.

863
00:54:47,018 --> 00:54:49,818
Not saying anything is keeping secrets.

864
00:54:49,818 --> 00:54:51,526
It's the same as lying.

865
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:55,442
Not saying everything is not lying.

866
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:58,442
I didn't have a reason to explain myself.

867
00:54:58,442 --> 00:55:00,576
For some odd reason, everyone here first asks about

868
00:55:00,576 --> 00:55:04,098
the one's apartment size, whether it's a rental or not...

869
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:06,942
I never realized it was your way of saying hi.

870
00:55:06,942 --> 00:55:09,099
You always have to talk back.

871
00:55:09,818 --> 00:55:13,292
You're here anyway. Stay.

872
00:55:13,292 --> 00:55:15,391
Today's my son's birthday.

873
00:55:15,392 --> 00:55:19,676
You didn't make it to the get-together. I wanted to get to know you.

874
00:55:19,676 --> 00:55:22,182
I would love to, but I still have work.

875
00:55:22,183 --> 00:55:25,959
Don't worry. I'll call your boss at Cook Mom.

876
00:55:25,959 --> 00:55:30,442
I thought she was a career-woman. I guess she's just a side cook.

877
00:55:30,442 --> 00:55:32,983
She does have a career, a career in side dishes.

878
00:55:32,983 --> 00:55:36,891
You should stop doing nothing at home, and do something like that too.

879
00:55:36,892 --> 00:55:40,142
- How could I do something like that? 
 - Why not?

880
00:55:40,142 --> 00:55:42,799
Let's go, I'll get Jihoo.

881
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,999
No, let's stay.

882
00:55:44,999 --> 00:55:46,526
Don't ruin the mood even more.

883
00:55:46,526 --> 00:55:47,559
Hey!

884
00:55:48,934 --> 00:55:50,699
Let's have a drink.

885
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:55,551
Have a drink...

886
00:55:57,292 --> 00:55:59,142
And cheer up.

887
00:56:00,634 --> 00:56:02,317
What are you doing? Seriously!

888
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:06,692
Oh my, oh my...

889
00:56:06,692 --> 00:56:08,017
Very un-classy.

890
00:56:08,018 --> 00:56:10,266
She's probably never had nice wine before.

891
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:13,349
Excuse me, Jihoo's father? Can you come with me?

892
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:15,567
Jihoo peed in his pants.

893
00:56:15,567 --> 00:56:19,417
The most expensive carpet is in that room.

894
00:56:27,018 --> 00:56:30,766
What happened here? Did you really wet yourself?

895
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:33,516
What's wrong? Jihoo, are you okay?

896
00:56:33,517 --> 00:56:34,926
What happened?

897
00:56:34,926 --> 00:56:38,017
How can he be okay? He just pissed himself.

898
00:56:38,017 --> 00:56:41,299
He did not. Sechan poured water on him.

899
00:56:41,299 --> 00:56:45,399
Hey! You're ugly! Shut your mouth.

900
00:56:45,399 --> 00:56:46,766
Hey, Sechan.

901
00:56:46,767 --> 00:56:50,592
Se-chan, is that true? Did you do that?

902
00:56:50,642 --> 00:56:53,266
He lives in a rental and acts like he doesn't.

903
00:56:53,267 --> 00:56:55,167
He's so annoying.

904
00:56:55,767 --> 00:56:59,342
Don't cross our area and walk around, okay?

905
00:57:00,099 --> 00:57:02,975
- You mental freak! 
 - You shouldn't be raised like that.

906
00:57:02,976 --> 00:57:03,767
Excuse me?

907
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:06,266
Even if I grow up like this, I won't live in a rental like you.

908
00:57:06,267 --> 00:57:08,099
Who taught you to speak like that?

909
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,400
Hey!

910
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,299
Apologize to Jihoo.

911
00:57:11,299 --> 00:57:12,999
Sechan, apologize.

912
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:14,817
That was too mean.

913
00:57:14,817 --> 00:57:18,667
Sechan, I think apologizing is the right thing to do.

914
00:57:50,018 --> 00:57:51,641
That's enough, let's go.

915
00:57:51,642 --> 00:57:54,599
Where are you going? He needs an apology.

916
00:57:56,267 --> 00:57:57,934
Apologize to Jihoo.

917
00:58:00,642 --> 00:58:02,792
Apologize to Jihoo.

918
00:58:07,642 --> 00:58:10,516
Apologize to Jihoo.

919
00:58:10,517 --> 00:58:11,766
- Sechan. 
 - Sechan.

920
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:14,600
You sing a song wri...! I'm going to kill you!

921
00:58:14,601 --> 00:58:16,224
We're coming after you!

922
00:58:16,225 --> 00:58:18,098
I'm going to open a school bullying case against you!

923
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:19,891
Why don't we just meet at the police station first?

924
00:58:19,892 --> 00:58:22,017
I'm going to sue your son for theft.

925
00:58:22,018 --> 00:58:23,891
What kind of bullshit are you saying? Sue him for what?

926
00:58:23,892 --> 00:58:25,141
What kind of bullshit?

927
00:58:25,142 --> 00:58:27,308
Your precious son stole shoes from the Taekwondo gym.

928
00:58:27,309 --> 00:58:31,159
Want to watch the CCTV footage together?

929
00:58:36,018 --> 00:58:38,059
Crap...

930
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:45,359
Where are the shoes?

931
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,999
I threw them away.

932
00:58:46,999 --> 00:58:48,999
Why'd you throw away someone else's shoes?

933
00:58:48,999 --> 00:58:51,009
He probably threw them out because they were disgusting!

934
00:58:51,009 --> 00:58:52,725
Did you see it yourself? Were they dirty?

935
00:58:52,726 --> 00:58:54,099
Did you see them?

936
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,141
Apologize, or we're all going to the police station.

937
00:58:56,142 --> 00:58:57,391
Fine, let's go then!

938
00:58:57,392 --> 00:59:00,017
You hit our child. Fine, let's go then!

939
00:59:00,018 --> 00:59:01,098
- Go! 
 - Go!

940
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:01,892
- Go! 
 - Go!

941
00:59:01,893 --> 00:59:03,725
Yeah, let's go! Go!

942
00:59:03,725 --> 00:59:08,367
It wasn't Jihoo's father who hit him. It was technically Jihoo.

943
00:59:09,099 --> 00:59:13,516
Sechan instigated by throwing water on him. It was self-defense.

944
00:59:13,517 --> 00:59:16,098
Oh, jeez, no!

945
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:18,641
The shoes were probably cheap. We'll just pay for it.

946
00:59:18,642 --> 00:59:20,717
It could have been an accident. You guys are so annoying.

947
00:59:20,717 --> 00:59:23,224
Take it. Money for the shoes.

948
00:59:23,225 --> 00:59:26,799
This is probably enough for your son's shoes and your payment for the day.

949
00:59:28,976 --> 00:59:29,976
Here!

950
00:59:29,977 --> 00:59:33,909
- Seriously? 
 - Screw it. Let's leave.

951
00:59:33,909 --> 00:59:36,267
They're not worth it.

952
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,098
Did you hear her? Not worth it?

953
00:59:39,099 --> 00:59:41,399
It's so funny how she tries to keep her pride in front of her kid.

954
00:59:41,399 --> 00:59:45,292
Can you stop as well? The kids are all watching.

955
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:47,766
Exactly.

956
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:49,999
You guys are setting the perfect examples, you know?

957
00:59:49,999 --> 00:59:52,266
If a kid makes a mistake,

958
00:59:52,267 --> 00:59:55,899
shouldn't you teach him to apologize sincerely?

959
00:59:55,899 --> 00:59:58,026
But instead, you shove money at it?

960
00:59:59,267 --> 01:00:01,850
They're learning from their parents.

961
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:02,767
What?

962
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,800
- Just stop and leave. 
 - Sure, I'll leave.

963
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:09,559
I really don't want to be here.

964
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:11,098
I'll come with you.

965
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:12,099
Let's go Noeul.

966
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,266
Oh my, why are you leaving?

967
01:00:13,267 --> 01:00:16,098
Yes, Noeul's father, why don't you stay with us?

968
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:18,667
- I'm all right. 
 - Let's go!

969
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:20,266
Excuse me...

970
01:00:20,267 --> 01:00:23,718
My baby, are you okay?

971
01:00:47,267 --> 01:00:49,092
Mom is sleeping.

972
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:53,092
There's no way she fell asleep already. Hey, come out. We have to talk.

973
01:00:53,092 --> 01:00:55,101
Just leave.

974
01:00:58,642 --> 01:01:00,292
What?

975
01:01:03,642 --> 01:01:05,018
Hey!

976
01:01:13,292 --> 01:01:14,867
Jihoo.

977
01:01:16,667 --> 01:01:18,159
 Mom.

978
01:01:23,492 --> 01:01:27,242
 Hyeok, go fetch me another bottle, will you?

979
01:01:29,142 --> 01:01:32,399
Can you go get me another bottle?

980
01:01:39,642 --> 01:01:44,292
Mom, let's stop drinking. Okay? Lay down.

981
01:01:44,292 --> 01:01:49,099
Are you... Are you...

982
01:01:49,767 --> 01:01:54,592
Yes. I'm an alcoholic

983
01:01:54,592 --> 01:01:56,399
like our mother.

984
01:01:59,542 --> 01:02:01,842
You know what we've been through...

985
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:05,017
How can you do this?

986
01:02:05,018 --> 01:02:06,992
It's because she's in pain.

987
01:02:06,992 --> 01:02:11,567
To Mom, alcohol isn't alcohol. It's medicine.

988
01:02:19,726 --> 01:02:22,142
Leave for good this time.

989
01:02:23,517 --> 01:02:26,592
Seriously, don't be curious and don't care about us!

990
01:02:26,592 --> 01:02:29,042
You said you woudn't come.

991
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:31,167
Then you came back.

992
01:02:31,892 --> 01:02:35,167
I don't want to look forward to seeing you.

993
01:03:04,018 --> 01:03:05,718
 Hyeok.

994
01:03:13,642 --> 01:03:16,292
 Mom! Mom!

995
01:03:17,292 --> 01:03:20,391
 - Mom! 
 - Mom, don't come!

996
01:03:20,392 --> 01:03:22,117
 Mom!

997
01:03:28,999 --> 01:03:32,290
 Thankfully, I don't remember seeing anything after that.

998
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:39,667
 Joonhee was only a couple of inches bigger than me. But she protected me.

999
01:03:41,934 --> 01:03:47,117

You're Wang Joonhee. Looking weak doesn't suit you.

1013
01:06:12,967 --> 01:06:16,842
Power through it. I'll stay until you can.

1014
01:06:17,517 --> 01:06:18,942
Okay.

1015
01:06:18,942 --> 01:06:20,516
In this fucked up neighborhood,

1016
01:06:20,517 --> 01:06:24,742
if they find out you're an alcoholic, it's all over.

1017
01:06:28,142 --> 01:06:30,499
Don't let anyone find out.

1018
01:06:30,517 --> 01:06:32,199
Keep it hidden.

1019
01:06:33,751 --> 01:06:36,442
 Everyone has secrets.

1020
01:06:45,692 --> 01:06:48,399
 Secrets that you didn't want others to know.

1021
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:59,367
 A secret you wish no one finds out.

1022
01:06:59,392 --> 01:07:01,142
 And...

1023
01:07:03,967 --> 01:07:06,309
When will Dad be back?

1024
01:07:06,309 --> 01:07:08,391
Christmas?

1025
01:07:08,392 --> 01:07:12,951
What about Chaeyoung? Is she still sick?

1026
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:14,617
Mingi...

1027
01:07:16,692 --> 01:07:23,299
You can't tell anyone about our family secrets. Okay?

1028
01:07:23,299 --> 01:07:26,142
 Secrets that can never be told.

1029
01:07:51,918 --> 01:07:53,950
 But...

1030
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:57,899
 There are no secrets you can keep forever.

1031
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:50,150

1032
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:54,090

1033
01:08:54,099 --> 01:08:56,558
 - Why are you here? 
 - To watch you get bullied.

1034
01:08:56,559 --> 01:08:58,182
 Still going to endure?

1035
01:08:58,183 --> 01:09:01,933
 I'm more angry about the Taekwondo Master. How could he send the CCTV to school?

1036
01:09:01,934 --> 01:09:04,098
 Why'd you leave the socks there?

1037
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:07,182
 You're freaking me out. We need to talk.

1038
01:09:07,183 --> 01:09:08,641
 About what?

1039
01:09:08,642 --> 01:09:10,325
 Are you interested in my sister?

1040
01:09:10,325 --> 01:09:12,484
 Yes... Is that a problem?

1041
01:09:12,484 --> 01:09:15,600
 The blue bird can make important decisions.

1042
01:09:15,601 --> 01:09:19,098
 Then I can protect the autonomous system, protect your music!

1043
01:09:19,099 --> 01:09:21,850
 What if he actually wins, and becomes the blue bird?

1044
01:09:21,851 --> 01:09:23,766
 That'll cause many problems.

1045
01:09:23,767 --> 01:09:25,433
 I was actually going to contact you...

1046
01:09:25,434 --> 01:09:26,392
 Me?

1047
01:09:26,393 --> 01:09:28,266
 Nuts are very good for you.

1048
01:09:28,267 --> 01:09:32,058
 Giving him nuts is the same as attempted murder!

1049
01:09:32,059 --> 01:09:32,934
 Jihoo!

1050
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:35,349
 I always thought Sechan was bullying Jihoo on his own.

1051
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:39,098
 Then I found out that a real boss monster was behind all of it.

1052
01:09:39,099 --> 01:09:41,642
 I don't think we can let him be.
