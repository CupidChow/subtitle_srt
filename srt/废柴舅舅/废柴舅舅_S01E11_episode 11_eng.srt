Try it, "You." Two, three, "You."

13
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:04,125
Okay, your vibration is much better.

00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:07,092

00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:10,067
Sorry that you're back after failing.

00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:12,567

 - Huh?

17
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:14,134
The institute director?

18
00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:17,201
- Numbers 1 through 3 come in. 
 - All right then.

19
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:19,542
Put your name tag on. Okay, let's go!

That's enough. We'll discuss it over now.

00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:47,799
- Thank you. 
 - All right, goodbye.

28
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,709
Hey, go back that way.

29
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,959
It's because you're nervous. Good job.

31
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:59,009
J. King? You're back again.

32
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,609
Hello.

33
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:02,676
Another original song?

34
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:06,959

00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:38,599
You've got a unique voice.

39
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,134
I just don't feel it.

40
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:45,109
I... haven't had inspiration lately.

41
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:47,409
There's no point.

42
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:51,859
He was arrested for illegal drugs at his own showcase.

43
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:54,426
My probation ends in 4 months...

44
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:57,759
No, why don't you just stop?

45
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,699
It's been months.

46
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:04,809
You don't even prepare. This isn't a joke.

47
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,109
I'm serious here...

48
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:09,625
If you just give me a chance...

49
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:13,367
I'll have a better track for you next time.

50
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:16,209
Audition for other labels.

51
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,634
It's not going to work out with us.

52
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:20,384
This is the only place without an age limit.

53
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:23,042
- We're done here. 
 - Thank you.

54
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:25,699
- Next! 
 - Thank you.

55
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:28,384
That way.

56
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,134
 8 months since Ji-hoo left.

57
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,559
 My inspiration left with him.

58
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:49,199
 All that is left is guilt.

59
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:54,259
 I'm a donut without filling.

60
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:56,883
 A guitar without strings.

61
00:03:56,883 --> 00:03:59,699
 A soulless zombie.

62
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:02,999
 Repeating meaningless auditions.

63
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,640

64
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:13,392

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,567

66
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:27,699

67
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:31,109
It's because I just don't have anything new.

68
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:36,999
I can't make songs anymore.

69
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:45,699
- You surprised me! 
 - How do I get you every time?

70
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:49,134
- Did you wait for long? 
 - It's fine, I've got nowhere to be.

71
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:51,999
- Are you hungry? 
 - Let's get something nice.

72
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,409
All right.

73
00:04:57,467 --> 00:05:02,134
It's a given. Chicken and beer after a hard day's work!

74
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:05,409
They say if men eat the wing, they'll cheat.

75
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:10,534
You know you have my heart. I would never.

76
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:12,209
Good.

77
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:16,109
Don't do that face again.

78
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:20,299
Your cute face just looks really sad now.

79
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:29,834
Nothing would've happened if I didn't do the fan meet.

80
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,284
The fan meeting was my idea.

81
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:35,883
No, it's because of me. All because of me...

82
00:05:35,883 --> 00:05:40,234
- Nothing happened. 
 - How could you say that?

83
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:44,309
All our fans and you were investigated because of me.

84
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:48,818
You had to quit your job. Hot Bar closed down.

85
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:50,734
Jihoo was...

86
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,999
taken from us.

87
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,159
Jihoo is doing great.

88
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:00,699
Jihoo's counselor and I talk all the time.

89
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:05,899
He gets to see his mother every other week, too.

90
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:10,384
Besides, quitting my job was my decision.

91
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:13,134
Being a teacher was your life long dream.

92
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:15,899
I'm still a teacher.

93
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:19,583
It doesn't matter where or whom I teach.

94
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:25,384
Where'd Jihoo and his mom go to today?

95
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,999
To an aquarium.

96
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,909
Teacher, did you send me a message on SoriCloud?

97
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:36,809
No? Why? Should I?

98
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:40,909
I happened to get a message from an unknown person.

99
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:45,599
- Jihoo... 
 - He's not allowed to contact you.

100
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:48,467
Maybe Director Byun from Other Music?

101
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:53,884
- I thought that, too. 
 - I wonder how he's doing.

102
00:06:54,883 --> 00:07:00,009
- I ruined so many lives. 
 - Stop thinking like that...

103
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:02,159
I'm sorry. Let's eat.

104
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:12,075
- Did you audition? 
 - Yup.

105
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:16,359
I told Jihoo you're keeping your promise.

106
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,234
How is he?

107
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:23,417
I don't know why he wanted to go.

108
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:27,284
He was too scared to go near the big fish.

109
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:30,699
I mean, how is he?

110
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:34,009
With his grandmother and father?

111
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:35,859
Do they beat him?

112
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,259
Every time we meet, I check his back and the nape of his neck.

113
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,783
Why don't they let him use a phone?

114
00:07:45,783 --> 00:07:49,509
Because of me? So he won't contact me?

115
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,259
All kids here are forced to study. They all don't have phones.

116
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:55,834
It's too strict.

117
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:05,699
Your restraining order applies to texts and messages.

118
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:11,009
No matter how badly you miss him, don't okay, Hyeok?

119
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,659
It's been 8 months. Stop warning me.

120
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:16,909
Jihoo sacrificed everything for me.

121
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:20,959
If I contacted him alone saying I wanted to see him, I would go to jail again. Am I human?

122
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:22,999
Okay.

123
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:28,009
Jihoo made a friend.

124
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,999
- Really? 
 - His name was Jay.

125
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:35,034
He's a quiet kid who listens to Jihoo's troubles.

126
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:40,634
Good, I'm glad he's doing all right.

127
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:57,542
I'm proud of you. You made a new friend.

128
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:59,599
 Are you sad?

129
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:02,834
What is there to be sad about?

130
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:07,859
I'm just... happy you're fine.

131
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,242

132
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:22,434
Why would you give that woman a penthouse?

133
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:24,384
I didn't give, I'm lending.

134
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:25,799
Prepare the car.

135
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,259
You promised to give it to her if you were to win congress.

136
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:33,534
The tables can turn with a vote or two.

137
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:36,834
If I'm actually elected it was money well spent.

138
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:40,409
Don't overestimate her.

139
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:44,217
What kind of breath does a woman who was kicked out of town have?

140
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:49,899
Don't forget she got us Jihoo. That's more than enough.

141
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:53,409
Don't be so naive. She's just talk.

142
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:57,209
I'm the one that got you what you wanted.

143
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,409
Shut up. Jihoo might hear.

144
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:04,092
Don't you get it that it's her mouth you should be worried about?

145
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:07,334
If word gets out that she helped us from the beginning, then what'll you do?

146
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:12,399
You know how bad things can get.

147
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:16,834
Yes. Yes...

148
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,584
Safe travels.

149
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:43,034
Isn't Mingi's mom so annoying?

150
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:44,899
How'd she get the penthouse?

151
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:48,159
She must've saved a lot of money.

152
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,899
I'm sure she was sentenced to 4 years.

153
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:54,134
How did she get out?

154
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:56,909
She must've bought an expensive new lawyer.

155
00:10:56,909 --> 00:11:00,925
She's creeping me out. Why'd she come back here?

156
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:04,234
Does she want revenge on us?

157
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:07,899
Revenge? Going to prison was her own fault!

158
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:11,899
What could she even do? Take back the Diamond position?

159
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:13,150
She can try if she wants.

160
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,509
This is a mom club. A club only for mothers.

161
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,259
Chaeyoung's overseas and Mingi is with his dad.

162
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:21,883
She's not a mom here. How can she sign up?

163
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:23,499
Exactly.

164
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:55,884
Have a seat please.

165
00:11:57,534 --> 00:12:00,983
I'm here to introduce you all to someone.

166
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:02,409
You're all acquainted?

167
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:05,509
Situations have changed, reintroduce yourselves.

168
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:10,899
She will join us as a consultant and marketing strategist.

169
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,699
Looking forward to it.

170
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,109
Moving forward she will represent me.

171
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:21,009
Everyone, please do your best to support her.

172
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:24,634
Mrs. President, when that woman was the Diamond,

173
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:28,559
she did a lot of illegal and terrible things.

174
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,634
Forgery, tax evasion, and embezzlement.

175
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:35,459
She's a very immoral and corrupt person.

176
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:41,709
She was acquitted during her second trial.

177
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:47,599
Nobody is perfect. Right?

178
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:51,983
Wouldn't it be better to hire a professional instead?

179
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:56,259
She's credited for Congressman Hwang's election.

180
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:00,009
Who else could possibly be a better fit?

181
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:04,009
Putting your faith in me and giving me an opportunity.

182
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:07,634
Mrs. President, I will only focus on your success.

183
00:13:07,634 --> 00:13:13,209
The camp's strategy team highly recommended her.

184
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,209
I hope you all fall in line behind her.

185
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,299
This is delicious.

186
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:31,784
- Is this glutinous rice? 
 - Yeah, with wheat.

187
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:33,809
It's so chewy.

188
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:37,334
You can't ask for a better kid than Jihoo.

189
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:40,509
Didn't you start making donuts for him? Now it's an entire store.

190
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:44,983
I stay busy to not think about him all the time.

191
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:48,825
You were so lucky. This location came out so cheap.

192
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:49,699
Yeah.

193
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:53,034
After all that you've been through in this neighborhood,

194
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:56,799
you finally have your own store and a great friend.

195
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,734
You know I'm blessed to have you, right?

196
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:03,409
You just say everything you feel?

197
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,434
I'm hard at expressing myself.

198
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:08,034
- Just try, practice. 
 - What?

199
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:09,759
Try it!

200
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:15,599
- Thanks for being my friend. 
 - No problem.

201
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:19,499
- Our friendship will last forever. 
 - Please stop.

202
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:22,659
- Embarrassed? 
 - Yes.

203
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:29,059
What happens to Jihoo if his stepmom has a boy?

204
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:32,134
- He can't have kids anymore. 
 - Oh my, why?

205
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:36,009
He slept around so much and isn't capable anymore.

206
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,499
Wow... Good, he deserves it.

207
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:42,959
Wait, no. That means he needs Jihoo.

208
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,099
They have it all wrong. A woman's enemy is a woman.

209
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:52,300

210
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:07,599
Are you busy?

211
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,617
I was thinking about you.

212
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:17,109
Should we meet today, too?

213
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:20,759
Shall we? Sure, okay.

214
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,625
A new woman in his life?

215
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,999
Sorry. I've been busy.

216
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,699
I'm glad to see you.

217
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:34,699
You declined to see me for a while.

218
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:36,459
Sorry.

219
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:39,783
I was afraid I would go look for Jihoo.

220
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:44,634
I heard Mingi's mom joined his grandmother's camp.

221
00:15:44,634 --> 00:15:47,509
- You heard? 
 - Unfortunately.

222
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:50,309
Why'd it have to be her?

223
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:55,399
We probably won't have trouble because she has no children left.

224
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:01,009
Your sister's business is doing well. How is she?

225
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:03,984
Go ask her yourself.

226
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:07,534
She asked for time. So, I guess...

227
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:08,934
I'll be waiting.

228
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:12,309
What happened between the two of you?

229
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:19,884
You both don't talk.

230
00:16:19,884 --> 00:16:22,770
You're both incredibly boring.

231
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:38,600
Is it a video call?

232
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,209
Hey, Mr. Hot Bar.

233
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:49,334
I don't own the Hot Bar anymore. I'm free...

234
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:53,084
- Where are you? 
 - In America.

235
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:57,159
A financial hotel in Las Vegas.

236
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,109
 Juno got me a VIP room.

237
00:17:01,109 --> 00:17:05,509
The sky view is amazing.

238
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:08,509
 Why do I feel at home here?

239
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:10,899
 Not a single discomfort.

240
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:15,534
 Oh, wait. Yeonjoo, Yeonjoo!

241
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,099
 J. King!

242
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,734
 Yeonjoo!

243
00:17:18,734 --> 00:17:20,759
Oh, oops.

244
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,434
We're in America so...

245
00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:27,659
I should call her by her English name.

246
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:29,534
Anastasia!

247
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:32,401
That's Russian.

248
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:34,334
 Is it?

249
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:39,159
 Why are you by yourself?

250
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,899
 Are you drinking alone again?

251
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,709
When're you coming?

252
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,534
You've been gone for months.

253
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:52,283
I worked my entire life. This is my first vacation.

254
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:54,499
Thanks to somebody.

255
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:58,509
Who ruined your bar and forced you overseas?

256
00:17:58,509 --> 00:17:59,899
 I'm thankful.

257
00:17:59,899 --> 00:18:03,984
 Seriously, all jokes aside. I'm seriously grateful.

258
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,384
J. King, think about a year ago.

259
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:12,059
I couldn't have imagined I'd be where I am.

260
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:16,259
 Imagine where I could be in another year.

261
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:18,359
 No one knows.

262
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:19,925
 Same with you.

263
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:26,659
 You were a beggar with nothing to lose a year ago.

264
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:28,599
 Now you have a family.

265
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:33,934
Your relationship with your sister, and even a girlfriend.

266
00:18:35,384 --> 00:18:37,599
When people only think about...

267
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,559
what they've lost.

268
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,059
 Life will just seem miserable.

269
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:51,009
 Don't forget that if something is lost, something is gained.

270
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:54,359
Whatever.

271
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,209
 I have to catch a flight, bye.

272
00:18:57,209 --> 00:18:58,409
Okay.

273
00:18:58,409 --> 00:18:59,759
Send a lot of photos...

274
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,980

275
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:06,840
Hot Bar?

276
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:11,080
I'm sorry. I was loud, huh?

277
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:19,559
Hyeok, thank you.

278
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:23,234
For what?

279
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:29,059
For hanging in there.

280
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,209
For staying by my side.

281
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:35,783
For taking care of the house.

282
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:39,630
And also helping my business.

283
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:54,334
What's that?

284
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:57,709
You're scaring me.

285
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:59,459
Seriously.

286
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,309
Someone told me to.

287
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:07,420
To show more affection.

288
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,570
Don't meet that someone.

289
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:16,399
I met Big Brother.

290
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:19,099
Yeah?

291
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,559
Is that it?

292
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:27,034
You drink too much. Stop drinking.

293
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:29,090
Go to bed.

294
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,020

295
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:51,060

296
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:03,980

297
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,540

298
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:32,551
Who could it be?

299
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:44,126
I heard you came back, but I didn't expect a visit.

300
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:46,799
Is there something you need?

301
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,876
Still a bit nervous around me?

302
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:53,651
I'm sure you don't like me either.

303
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:55,300
That's true.

304
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,125
You stabbed me in the back by spying.

305
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:03,075
People would agree that you deserved it.

306
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:05,776
I'll get to the point.

307
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:09,776
Do you want to be the Momvely Diamond?

308
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:12,899
Does that title even mean anything now?

309
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:15,375
Thanks to you, the Momvelies are

310
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:20,670
nothing but servants for politicians.

311
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:26,100
You're just using your new position to seek revenge.

312
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,830
Revenge?

313
00:23:28,751 --> 00:23:30,626
Don't get me wrong.

314
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:34,075
I want Seongjak district to thrive.

315
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:39,200
Sorry for laughing. But that was hilarious.

316
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,250
I will regain my reputation, and bring back my son.

317
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:49,225
Bring him to fulfill your ambitions Chaeyoung failed to?

318
00:23:49,225 --> 00:23:50,917
Yes, exactly.

319
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:55,099
Honestly, that's what I want.

320
00:23:55,099 --> 00:24:00,199
I believe I can accomplish it by working for Mrs. President.

321
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:02,125
Good luck to you.

322
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:05,899
If you're done, I'd like to ask you to leave.

323
00:24:13,676 --> 00:24:17,999
You're not in Gangnam. You still can't have a child?

324
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:21,025
Does your husband still avoid your ovulation?

325
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:25,025
You must be out of your mind. You sure have a lot to say.

326
00:24:25,025 --> 00:24:28,050
Just making small talk.

327
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,301
Apart from the Momvely,

328
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:34,526
we used to talk about everything as good friends.

329
00:24:34,526 --> 00:24:40,551
I thought we were friends, but you used me.

330
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:48,825
How could she suddenly offer being Diamond to me?

331
00:24:48,825 --> 00:24:52,275
Seriously. What a strange woman.

332
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,776
Did you just take my side?

333
00:24:54,776 --> 00:24:58,375
- Of course, you're my wife. 
 - You used to side with her.

334
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,099
You said I should just do whatever she says.

335
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:04,401
You even said no one could fill her shoes.

336
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:06,251
I don't remember.

337
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,626
- Do you have beer? 
 - What?

338
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:11,751
The food would be good with beer. Let's drink.

339
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:14,099
- You want to drink with me? 
 - You don't want to?

340
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:16,301
No, I'm just surprised.

341
00:25:16,301 --> 00:25:18,526
- Oh my. 
 - Sit down.

342
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,199
- Let's talk while I eat. 
 - Yeah.

343
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:26,401
Did um...

344
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:29,776
Jihoo's mom and Noeul's father break up for good?

345
00:25:29,776 --> 00:25:32,125
I believe so.

346
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:34,899
They're both too blunt for change.

347
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:36,375
And Jihoo's uncle?

348
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:38,451
What's he up to?

349
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:41,950
Why the sudden interest in people?

350
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,499
Yes, Driver Kim.

351
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,100
What do you mean?

352
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,551
Jihoo isn't there? Did you check the classroom?

353
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,750
All the kids look like Jihoo.

354
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,642
 Going up.

355
00:26:37,651 --> 00:26:39,000
Okay, okay, okay.

356
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,301
Okay, okay.

357
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:48,199
Okay, okay, okay.

358
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,125
Oh man, how far did I get?

359
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:19,499
 It's pretty bad.

360
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,176
I know.

361
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,734
But A minor to D minor is a classic cord progression.

362
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:30,900
 It's too old. Add a bridge then.

363
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:36,776
Hallucination of Jihoo that's enough for today.

364
00:27:36,776 --> 00:27:40,901
Stop messing with my self-esteem.

365
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:03,499
What the!

366
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:05,699
Got you!

367
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,801
Hey.

368
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:13,999
Is this real?

369
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:17,076
Hey. Are you real?

370
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:20,925
Of course, I am!

371
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,401
Are you okay? Let me see.

372
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:26,101
Let me see.

373
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:31,501
Stop, stop it. You're just like mom.

374
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,501
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

375
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:35,751
How'd you get here?

376
00:28:35,751 --> 00:28:36,999
I took a taxi.

377
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:40,125
You can't come here. We shouldn't meet.

378
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:43,275
If we get caught together,

379
00:28:43,275 --> 00:28:45,401
they'll be furious.

380
00:28:45,401 --> 00:28:48,651
Don't worry. I have a plan.

381
00:28:48,651 --> 00:28:51,375
Seriously, why are you here?

382
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:54,201
Because you aren't keeping your promise!

383
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:57,375
- What? 
 - 8 months have gone by.

384
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,999
Why aren't you a famous musician yet?

385
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:02,275
It's not as easy as it sounds.

386
00:29:02,275 --> 00:29:04,999
I know it's difficult.

387
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:09,734
But I got you out of prison and also 100 million won.

388
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:11,699
You should work harder.

389
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:13,651
Hey, I'm doing my best.

390
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,125
I go to auditions every other week and make songs.

391
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:19,526
But you aren't doing your best.

392
00:29:19,526 --> 00:29:22,401
Are you really here to talk about this?

393
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:25,501
Of course. Why else would I come?

394
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:31,083
I have cram classes, tests, tutoring... even horseback riding.

395
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:34,999
My life has become really busy because of you.

396
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:38,025
You should keep your word.

397
00:29:38,025 --> 00:29:40,499
You're really okay, right?

398
00:29:40,499 --> 00:29:44,899
You used to write lyrics and songs with your pain.

399
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:49,501
Now you can't even do that. How're you letting it out?

400
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:51,542
Nothing to let out.

401
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:54,125
Haven't you heard about Jay?

402
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,150
I just talk to Jay about everything.

403
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,225
- Yeah? 
 - He's really quiet.

404
00:30:00,225 --> 00:30:02,125
He's the opposite of you.

405
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,426
Totally different friend.

406
00:30:04,426 --> 00:30:08,600
Music was just a curiosity; I wasn't serious about it.

407
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,375
I think you've changed.

408
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,375
I grew up, you mean?

409
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:17,801
You're a bit snobby.

410
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:22,351
You haven't changed one bit.

411
00:30:26,526 --> 00:30:28,976
- See you later. 
 - I'll be right back.

412
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,901
- Hello. 
 - Hi, Noeul.

413
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,234
Shall we eat donuts?

414
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:43,299
- No, we'll be late to our appointment. 
 - Oh.

415
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:45,625
Bye...

416
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:05,050
Hey, where's Jihoo?

417
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,126
- What are you saying? 
 - I know you took him.

418
00:31:08,126 --> 00:31:11,751
- Is he gone? 
 - Stop lying, he's with you!

419
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:13,292
No, he isn't!

420
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:15,225
Where is he then? Have you searched?

421
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:17,834
I'm searching right now.

422
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:20,776
Oh!

423
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:23,799
Probably with his uncle.

424
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,526
Bastard.

425
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:27,751
He'll regret this.

426
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:41,209
This isn't going to work.

427
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:43,083
I... I'll work harder.

428
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:46,801
- Are you sure? 
 - Of course! Give me a fist bump.

429
00:31:47,676 --> 00:31:49,392
Fighting.

430
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:56,125
- You forgot how? 
 - Nope.

431
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,125
It's too childish for me.

432
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,150
Even took off the ring...

433
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,325
It was silly and heavy.

434
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:06,999
If they find out we're breaking the restraining order.

435
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:09,899
Do you know what my father will do to you?

436
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,100
What?

437
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,000
- If you don't work hard... 
 - Then what?

438
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,950
Are you threatening me about telling your dad?

439
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,651
Come on, what's your plan?

440
00:32:20,651 --> 00:32:24,651
We don't have time. Should I give you a deadline?

441
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,899
Hey, Wang Joonhyeok! I know he's here!

442
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:28,000
It's your dad, your dad.

443
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,999
Right on time.

444
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:33,826
- What do I do? 
 - Don't stand there, just hide.

445
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,599
Why? Why should I?

446
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:42,675
Min Jihoo! I knew you were here.

447
00:32:42,675 --> 00:32:44,999
Oh, hello.

448
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:47,400
Jihoo, how'd you get here?

449
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,001
Mom, see. I told you it was here.

450
00:32:54,084 --> 00:32:55,651
Seriously...

451
00:32:55,651 --> 00:32:57,999
I kept asking for them but you couldn't find them.

452
00:32:57,999 --> 00:32:59,999
I really needed these.

453
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:03,426
Is that what you were looking for?

454
00:33:03,426 --> 00:33:08,000
Dad, let's go. I found my notes.

455
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:15,201
Where's that bastard?

456
00:33:18,025 --> 00:33:20,080
Hey, Wang Joonhyeok!

457
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:27,125
You'll go to jail if you break the restraining order.

458
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:30,125
He isn't home.

459
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:34,499
Mom said uncle was out of town today.

460
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:39,799
Right, he's in Busan for shows.

461
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:44,301
The restraining order wasn't violated, right?

462
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,075
Did he leave?

463
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:07,551
What happened? Why was he here?

464
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:09,726
He threatened that I had to keep my promise.

465
00:34:09,726 --> 00:34:13,751
- Did you ask him to come? 
 - No, I can't even contact him.

466
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,599
Hey! Hey!

467
00:34:50,651 --> 00:34:54,801
My Jihoo! Do you know how much Mom missed you?

468
00:34:57,551 --> 00:35:02,525
Punish him. You know you made a mistake, right?

469
00:35:07,526 --> 00:35:10,050
Jeez, no...

470
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:18,001
Worried for what? He doesn't even miss me.

471
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:24,675
I'll keep my promise. I'm in debt to you.

472
00:35:25,175 --> 00:35:27,359
Let's see.

473
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:32,276
Did I respond to this comment?

474
00:35:32,276 --> 00:35:36,167
I must've been drunk.

475
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:39,417
"My inspiration was taken from me.

476
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:42,375
If I could just see him once. I'd be inspired again.

477
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:46,459
Photographs are of no use. I miss him so much."

478
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:50,551
This is really embarrassing. It could be anyone.

479
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,834
Wait...

480
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:59,125
Is it Jihoo?

481
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,801
No way.

482
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:05,026
Is this why he came?

483
00:36:19,592 --> 00:36:22,799
Why'd he forget this?

484
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,720

485
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:18,399
Don't forget you're Gangto Money's successor.

486
00:37:18,399 --> 00:37:20,751
You know your grandmother's wish?

487
00:37:20,751 --> 00:37:24,999
You must attend an Ivy League college. Make her proud.

488
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:27,375
If she found out you went to that house,

489
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,950
you know how furious she'd be.

490
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:34,276
I'll keep it a secret.

491
00:37:34,276 --> 00:37:38,499
But you will be punished like your father said.

492
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:44,399
It's late, so just 2 short hours on the apology chair.

493
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,375
Don't make me add hours.

494
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:54,850
You also have to do 100 words of English writing.

495
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:58,499
Cooperate with me, got it, son?

496
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:20,626

506
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:40,225
Yes, teacher. I'm Jihoo's mother.

507
00:39:40,225 --> 00:39:43,850
I had a few questions for you.

508
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:52,399
Why'd you come here? You can't even get in...

509
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:11,000
- Hurry over. 
 - On my way.

510
00:40:29,334 --> 00:40:30,876
Let's see...

511
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:39,950
- I need to use the toilet... 
 - Go to the 2nd floor, at the top.

512
00:40:51,676 --> 00:40:53,751
Hey, you. Why are you coming in?

513
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:58,826
Do you need the toilet? It's on the 2nd floor.

514
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:03,175
Don't drop any dirt. Be clean in there.

515
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:06,751
Does she know about Jihoo going to that house?

516
00:41:06,751 --> 00:41:08,626
Of course not, she'd throw a fit.

517
00:41:08,626 --> 00:41:13,000
He was quiet for 8 months why'd he suddenly do that?

518
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,950
I don't know. He doesn't talk to me at all.

519
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:20,375
Did he hear us talking? Did he tell them about it?

520
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:23,375
No way!  We were careful of what we said in front of him.

521
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:27,751
Yeah, if Joonhyeok knew. He would do something.

522
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:30,626
He'd already be here causing a scene.

523
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:33,551
I wish he would. I want him back in prison.

524
00:41:33,551 --> 00:41:35,699
Wait!  Where's my phone?

525
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:37,701
Should we send him abroad?

526
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:55,375
Hey.

527
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:57,999
Hey, here.

528
00:41:57,999 --> 00:42:00,900
So clumsy.

529
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,551
Jihoo.

530
00:42:38,626 --> 00:42:40,199
What's that noise?

531
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,799
I've never heard that ringtone.

532
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:45,825
The landscaper is using the toilet upstairs.

533
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:51,151
What?

534
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,400
- Where are you? 
 - Why, what?

535
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,776
I was worried. I asked Hwaeum to look into Jihoo.

536
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:05,399
I think Jihoo has been lying to us.

537
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:06,501
What?

538
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:11,351
 He hasn't been talking in school or at home.

539
00:43:11,351 --> 00:43:13,999
What? He seemed fine.

540
00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:18,099
He even has a reliable friend. The kid named Jay.

541
00:43:18,751 --> 00:43:24,126
 He's on anti-depressants and his asthma has gotten worse.

542
00:43:24,126 --> 00:43:25,851
 I think he's miserable there.

543
00:43:25,851 --> 00:43:27,426

544
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,700
 Hyeok, hello?

545
00:43:29,799 --> 00:43:31,799
I'll call you back.

546
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,600

547
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,870

548
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,060

549
00:44:08,918 --> 00:44:12,567
Jihoo. Jihoo...

550
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:22,176
Jihoo.

551
00:44:23,899 --> 00:44:25,726
Jihoo.

552
00:44:25,726 --> 00:44:29,425
You need to focus. 82 is unacceptable.

553
00:44:29,425 --> 00:44:32,676
You have to catch up as soon as possible.

554
00:44:32,676 --> 00:44:36,501
It's hard enough as it is, why'd you go to that house?

555
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:39,076
You saw your uncle, right?

556
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,675
What did you say?

557
00:44:44,501 --> 00:44:46,700
You went back there?

558
00:44:47,175 --> 00:44:49,799
Are you meeting your uncle?

559
00:44:49,799 --> 00:44:52,999
No, Mother. He only went once.

560
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:56,125
Did you report it? Report it now, put him in prison!

561
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:58,926
His uncle wasn't there. He won't do it again.

562
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,400
When will you start talking!

563
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:07,999
Hate it or love it, you're my grandson.

564
00:45:07,999 --> 00:45:11,426
Even your stubbornness comes from me.

565
00:45:11,426 --> 00:45:15,501
You must be happy about ruining my plans.

566
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:19,176
You're keeping your grades down on purpose, too?

567
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:22,551
Words just won't do it.

568
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:23,501
Let's see.

569
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:28,275
The things that are valuable to him! Take all of them away from him!

570
00:45:28,275 --> 00:45:31,801
Things from his uncle? Yes, Mother.

571
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:36,359
Things like that!

572
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:37,751
Give it here!

573
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:40,501
You bastard, give it to me now!

574
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:44,499
Give it to me! Why you!

575
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:51,999
You little bastard!

576
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:54,450
No!

577
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:56,401
Mother.

578
00:45:56,401 --> 00:45:59,650
You can't hit him. You know that.

579
00:46:08,751 --> 00:46:10,999
Open your hand!

580
00:46:11,526 --> 00:46:13,750
I'll break your fingers!

581
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:26,851
The apology chair! Until his teacher comes!

582
00:46:27,526 --> 00:46:29,276
Yes, Mother.

583
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,950
Let's go, Jihoo.

584
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,999
I'm very sorry.

585
00:46:46,999 --> 00:46:51,776
I spoke with his counselor on a regular basis but...

586
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:57,575
Jihoo acted as if everything was all right.

587
00:46:57,575 --> 00:47:02,175
I should've checked with the nurse's office too...

588
00:47:02,175 --> 00:47:04,450
I'm very sorry.

589
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,125
Greetings, hello.

590
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:26,950
We appreciate your hard work.

591
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:29,501
I will do my best.

592
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:31,576
Yes, hello.

593
00:47:33,301 --> 00:47:35,676
Oh my!

594
00:47:35,676 --> 00:47:40,525
It's nice to see you out here advertising.

595
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:43,676
I guess I was right.

596
00:47:43,676 --> 00:47:47,099
I can see Mrs. Park right there behind you.

597
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:50,651
That's a wild accusation. It's a misunderstanding.

598
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:53,475
I've recently have gotten to know Mrs. President.

599
00:47:53,475 --> 00:47:56,625
If you say so, then it is so?

600
00:47:57,626 --> 00:47:59,876
Be careful, Mrs. President.

601
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:04,850
Poisoned drinks tend to be very sweet.

602
00:48:17,676 --> 00:48:19,975
Why the hell are you here?

603
00:48:20,576 --> 00:48:23,150
I can't come to the market?

604
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,999
I'm here to buy fried chicken!

605
00:48:24,999 --> 00:48:28,999
It's a coincidence to see you here. I should say hi.

606
00:48:28,999 --> 00:48:33,701
You look great, Mrs. President. I hope you win.

607
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,499
Thank you for your kind words.

608
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:40,375
Don't bother with him, ma'am.

609
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:46,125
I guess it's normal to stick knives in each other's backs.

610
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:48,250
It's amazing how you're back here.

611
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:51,626
I applaud your survival skills.

612
00:48:51,626 --> 00:48:55,150
Shut up and get lost. We're cleaning up after your mess.

613
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,676
Oh, right. I should thank her again.

614
00:48:58,676 --> 00:49:01,999
Let me show you my appreciation. Thank you.

615
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:05,250
You bought an expensive lawyer to get me out of prison.

616
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:09,400
Should I write a song in your honor?

617
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:14,626
I'm sorry. I already have a campaign song.

618
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:18,850
- Stop trying to pull something. 
 - I'm a Seongjak citizen.

619
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:23,299
Can I give you some advice as a voter?

620
00:49:27,526 --> 00:49:30,950
Domestic violence, child abuse!

621
00:49:32,025 --> 00:49:34,626
Must be eradicated!

622
00:49:34,626 --> 00:49:36,851
Must be eradicated!

623
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:40,001
You can't even keep a straight face.

624
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,501
Are you harassing Jihoo like you did back then?

625
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:48,000
Do you want to be arrested for false information?

626
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,225
You'll never get out.

627
00:49:50,225 --> 00:49:52,618
I'm not afraid of that. Why?

628
00:49:52,618 --> 00:49:54,625
I have nothing to lose.

629
00:49:55,175 --> 00:49:58,850
Say whatever you want no one will believe you.

630
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:02,475
False, I have people who would.

631
00:50:02,475 --> 00:50:06,851
Congressman Hwang would be extremely interested.

632
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:12,501
You know? Matador, propaganda, negative...

633
00:50:12,501 --> 00:50:16,000
Even the slightest dirt on the opposing nominee

634
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,451
can be blown out of proportions to affect them negatively.

635
00:50:18,451 --> 00:50:23,125
Yes, I understand you are concerned for Jihoo.

636
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:25,100
Go, just get lost.

637
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,925
I'm watching you, got it?

638
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:31,201
I'm watching.

639
00:50:31,201 --> 00:50:33,001
Understood?

640
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:37,226
I'm always watching.

641
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:41,426
Who are you to be contacting Jihoo's teachers?

642
00:50:41,426 --> 00:50:43,634
What right do you have?

643
00:50:43,634 --> 00:50:46,599
Would you like a restraining order, too?

644
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:51,375
Are you aware you ruined his education?

645
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:55,001
He can't focus on his studies.

646
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:59,199
How will he become the next generation's global leader?

647
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,375
As the daughter-in-law, you just needed to raise him well.

648
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:07,159
You should've brought dignity and honor to the family.

649
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:11,400
But you're an embarrassing alcoholic.

650
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:15,300
Don't you know you are the worst role model for Jihoo?

651
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:21,876
Do you remember me when I used to live there?

652
00:51:21,876 --> 00:51:25,875
You walked around as if you belonged there.

653
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,125
Why are you bringing that up?

654
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:31,899
You knew he was married,

655
00:51:31,899 --> 00:51:34,551
yet you did everything to seduce him.

656
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:39,375
You couldn't have a child, so you tried to take my place.

657
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:42,251
- Excuse me. 
 - I was grateful.

658
00:51:44,876 --> 00:51:46,925
Thanks to you, I got divorced.

659
00:51:46,925 --> 00:51:50,276
Thanks to you, I took custody of Jihoo.

660
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,650
Whatever. I'm the daughter-in-law and Jihoo's mother now.

661
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:01,025
- Jihoo's... mother? 
 - Yeah, his mother.

662
00:52:01,025 --> 00:52:03,600
I am Jihoo's mother.

663
00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:06,999
Then please be a good mother.

664
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,401
I...

665
00:52:09,401 --> 00:52:12,725
don't deserve to raise Jihoo.

666
00:52:12,751 --> 00:52:18,192
It's my fault and my shortcomings that I lost Jihoo.

667
00:52:18,676 --> 00:52:23,750
I know no matter what I do I won't get him back.

668
00:52:26,999 --> 00:52:29,001
Jihoo told me.

669
00:52:29,701 --> 00:52:34,775
His stepmother was kind.

670
00:52:35,426 --> 00:52:40,176
That she tries her best to become his mother.

671
00:52:40,776 --> 00:52:44,525
I don't think that Jihoo was lying.

672
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:51,750
I should've given it to you earlier.

673
00:52:53,401 --> 00:52:56,751
I couldn't find the courage but...

674
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,900
It's his umbilical cord and baby clothes.

675
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:06,901
I kept a diary ever since he was born.

676
00:53:07,676 --> 00:53:13,400
Details on when his teeth grew when he stopped using diapers.

677
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:19,026
His first words. I wrote down all the small details.

678
00:53:21,526 --> 00:53:23,451
You're his mother.

679
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:31,650
As his mother, please help him adjust to that family.

680
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:36,151
Jihoo has nobody he can count on.

681
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,126
Please, take care of his heart.

682
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,999
I beg you.

683
00:54:32,776 --> 00:54:36,175
I faced his grandmother and his father.

684
00:54:37,451 --> 00:54:39,976
But there was nothing I could do.

685
00:54:41,426 --> 00:54:46,600
I just blabbered about and walked away.

686
00:54:47,175 --> 00:54:53,550
Is that what Jihoo would've wanted from you?

687
00:54:54,426 --> 00:54:58,200
He came to give J. King inspiration.

688
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,375
He wants to be consoled by his uncle's music.

689
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,675
Which is why he took the risk to see you.

690
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:11,099
The only realistic way J.King can help Jihoo is

691
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:14,250
to help him get through these tough times.

692
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:19,850
Giving him strength, support, and cheering for him through your music is what I think.

716
00:57:53,217 --> 00:57:55,134
Well...

717
00:57:55,134 --> 00:57:58,509
How long do you have left of probation?

718
00:57:59,734 --> 00:58:02,709
- Pardon? 
 - Probation.

719
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,850

720
00:58:10,999 --> 00:58:12,883
Jihoo.

721
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:18,309
Jihoo.

722
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:21,834
Eat it at home.

723
00:58:21,834 --> 00:58:23,509
Okay.

724
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,399
You left this behind.

725
00:58:32,484 --> 00:58:36,034
You should've told me you were struggling.

726
00:58:36,034 --> 00:58:37,434
Sorry.

727
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:40,584
I'm sorry I didn't realize your pain.

728
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:43,209
I hid it from you.

729
00:58:46,999 --> 00:58:50,834
Do you want me to be happy...

730
00:58:50,834 --> 00:58:53,734
or act like I am?

731
00:58:53,734 --> 00:58:56,459
I want you to be happy.

732
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,099
But...

733
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:05,559
It's going to be hard for both of us to be.

734
00:59:07,709 --> 00:59:10,334
But at least when we meet like this,

735
00:59:10,334 --> 00:59:13,684
let's talk about our struggles and count on each other.

736
00:59:15,209 --> 00:59:17,584
Uncle will do his best, too.

737
00:59:17,584 --> 00:59:23,359
So don't come looking for him or contact him.

738
00:59:24,459 --> 00:59:25,834
Okay.

739
01:00:15,734 --> 01:00:19,109
 I have a new deal thanks to this song.

740
01:00:20,634 --> 01:00:24,083
 It's a small contract without a signing bonus.

741
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:27,509
 But thanks to you, I still get another chance.

742
01:00:27,509 --> 01:00:29,292
 Thank you.

743
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,200

744
01:00:40,999 --> 01:00:42,734
 Thank you for this song.

745
01:00:42,734 --> 01:00:45,399
 I will be back after my trip.

746
01:00:45,399 --> 01:00:48,209
 Until then, goodbye.

747
01:00:48,209 --> 01:00:49,934
 Uncle...

748
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:57,667

749
01:01:00,709 --> 01:01:01,999

750
01:01:21,999 --> 01:01:23,599
What's this?

751
01:01:33,584 --> 01:01:38,109
He's crazy! He's absolutely insane!

752
01:01:38,859 --> 01:01:40,683
Where are you?

753
01:01:41,859 --> 01:01:46,009
Did you get another loan?

754
01:01:47,384 --> 01:01:49,659
Where did you use it?

755
01:01:49,659 --> 01:01:53,209
Are you gambling again?

756
01:01:56,634 --> 01:01:59,459
How could you? How can you do this again?

757
01:01:59,459 --> 01:02:03,934
I told you we needed that for our apartment lease.

758
01:02:03,999 --> 01:02:07,334
What were you thinking? Have you lost your mind?

759
01:02:07,334 --> 01:02:10,259
Why can't you just cheat on me? You idiot!

760
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:13,434
Hel—

761
01:02:18,734 --> 01:02:21,809
Oh, mother...

762
01:02:22,834 --> 01:02:27,584
My husband who's never given me attention

763
01:02:27,584 --> 01:02:30,083
suddenly calls me often and is curious about me.

764
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:32,709
- He even gossips with me. 
 - Good for you.

765
01:02:32,709 --> 01:02:36,059
Is he getting ready to die?

766
01:02:37,484 --> 01:02:39,783
Just have a donut.

767
01:02:41,634 --> 01:02:43,799
Honey, where are you?

768
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:47,159
I wanted to drop off snacks.

769
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:51,334
You aren't at the hospital?

770
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,259
At this hour?

771
01:02:54,234 --> 01:02:58,199
Didn't I mention I had something to take care of?

772
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:03,209
Snacks... Of course, I'd enjoy them.

773
01:03:03,209 --> 01:03:04,634
Yeah.

774
01:03:04,634 --> 01:03:06,734
I'm so sorry.

775
01:03:06,734 --> 01:03:08,759
Yeah, I'll be late.

776
01:03:08,759 --> 01:03:12,834
So don't wait up for me; go ahead and sleep.

777
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:15,134
I might not even make it home.

778
01:03:15,999 --> 01:03:17,459
Yeah, okay.

779
01:03:17,459 --> 01:03:20,499
Okay, I have to go. Bye

780
01:03:37,676 --> 01:03:39,999
Yes. I confirmed the payments.

781
01:03:39,999 --> 01:03:42,401
 All the other tenants are furious.

782
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,167
Why?

783
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:46,109
 About the donut store's deposit being half off.

784
01:03:46,109 --> 01:03:50,334
 They're curious about her relationship with the building owner.

785
01:03:50,334 --> 01:03:52,626
Don't tell them anything.

786
01:03:52,626 --> 01:03:56,709
You must keep it a secret. Understand?

787
01:03:56,709 --> 01:03:59,099
 Yes, I hear you.

788
01:04:03,876 --> 01:04:05,709

789
01:04:05,709 --> 01:04:09,000

790
01:04:34,459 --> 01:04:39,934
Mom, that lady ordered our guys to investigate the neighborhood people.

791
01:04:40,484 --> 01:04:42,209
If that's what she needs.

792
01:04:42,209 --> 01:04:43,983
Don't you think she's using you

793
01:04:43,983 --> 01:04:47,159
to get revenge on Congressman Hwang and the moms?

794
01:04:47,859 --> 01:04:49,799
Of course.

795
01:04:50,384 --> 01:04:53,283
You're letting her use you?

796
01:04:54,334 --> 01:04:58,759
I'm using her. Her targets are in line with mine.

797
01:04:59,759 --> 01:05:01,909
Not exactly.

798
01:05:01,909 --> 01:05:04,384
Don't worry about it.

799
01:05:04,384 --> 01:05:08,099
Just make sure Jihoo's uncle doesn't act up.

800
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:12,983
We shouldn't have let him out. He's bugging me.

801
01:05:12,983 --> 01:05:16,284
Did you take care of Director Byun from Other Music?

802
01:05:16,284 --> 01:05:19,184
Don't worry.

803
01:05:26,334 --> 01:05:29,509
 Did he hear us talking? Did he tell them about it?

804
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:34,583
 Yeah, if Joonhyeok knew. He would do something.

805
01:05:36,709 --> 01:05:38,999
What could it be? What are you hiding?

806
01:05:38,999 --> 01:05:42,584
What am I missing here?

807
01:05:42,584 --> 01:05:45,359
Just wait until I find out.

808
01:06:18,899 --> 01:06:20,183
Wait.

809
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:22,684
This is Other Music's office.

810
01:06:28,999 --> 01:06:29,999
Yes, Teacher.

811
01:06:29,999 --> 01:06:32,584
 - Why aren't you coming?  
 - Where?

812
01:06:32,584 --> 01:06:34,459
 We have a show in Woongsan...

813
01:06:34,459 --> 01:06:36,234
Oh!

814
01:06:36,234 --> 01:06:38,083
I'm so stupid!

815
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:41,484
- I'm an idiot. 
  - Where are you? You're late.

816
01:06:41,484 --> 01:06:45,259
- But teacher... 
  - J. King...

817
01:06:45,259 --> 01:06:47,334
I'm going. I'm on my way.

818
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:48,899
Yes, I'm sorry, Teacher.

819
01:06:48,899 --> 01:06:50,400
Yes.

820
01:06:51,959 --> 01:06:54,399
Jeez... But wait.

821
01:07:03,959 --> 01:07:05,434
What is this?

822
01:07:06,459 --> 01:07:08,892

I'm so excited!

823
01:07:08,892 --> 01:07:10,709
I want to keep this!

824
01:07:10,709 --> 01:07:13,209
Can we take all of them after the show?

825
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:15,083
Or can we ask where we can buy them?

826
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:16,334
Why can't I get used to this?

827
01:07:16,334 --> 01:07:17,999
I really want one.

828
01:07:17,999 --> 01:07:21,459
I want to post them all over my ceiling.

829
01:07:21,459 --> 01:07:25,459
The left side of your face looks so much better.

830
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:29,659
This place is better than I thought.

831
01:07:29,659 --> 01:07:30,999
This sucks, right?

832
01:07:30,999 --> 01:07:33,083
Don't say that.

833
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:36,709
It's really cool. I looked into this company.

834
01:07:36,709 --> 01:07:39,709
Their staff are famous for being professionals.

835
01:07:39,709 --> 01:07:42,709
Who else would give me a contract during my probation?

836
01:07:42,709 --> 01:07:46,134
Exactly. Which is why we should be happy!

837
01:07:46,899 --> 01:07:48,659
Teacher.

838
01:07:48,659 --> 01:07:51,884
I think I've misunderstood this world we live in.

839
01:07:52,999 --> 01:07:55,009
I thought you would...

840
01:07:55,009 --> 01:07:58,109
just leave me as soon as things went bad.

841
01:07:58,109 --> 01:08:01,709
Me? You don't know me then.

842
01:08:01,709 --> 01:08:07,609
A pretty, kind, perfect person like you, I have never understood why you liked me.

843
01:08:07,609 --> 01:08:13,459
But since such an incredible person likes me,

844
01:08:13,459 --> 01:08:16,299
it makes me feel like I'm not so bad.

845
01:08:16,999 --> 01:08:18,909
Are you thankful?

846
01:08:18,909 --> 01:08:20,083
I'm thankful.

847
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:22,859
If you are...

848
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:26,409
Hey, come on.  It's a night club.

849
01:08:27,834 --> 01:08:31,599
- Why not? 
 - Come on, Teacher.

850
01:08:33,334 --> 01:08:35,459
I made some money!

851
01:08:35,459 --> 01:08:38,059
Hurry over. To the club!

852
01:08:39,334 --> 01:08:40,759
Huh?

853
01:08:42,834 --> 01:08:46,759
- Director Byun? 
 - Oh my! Director Byun!

854
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:51,934
How did you know to find me here?

855
01:08:51,934 --> 01:08:54,209
- What? 
 - How did we know?

856
01:08:54,209 --> 01:08:57,209
I don't know anything!

857
01:08:57,209 --> 01:08:59,909
Don't follow me!

858
01:09:05,083 --> 01:09:06,799
Get him!

859
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:08,499
Suddenly!

860
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:42,150

861
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:49,580

862
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:57,990

863
01:09:57,999 --> 01:09:58,999
 Move! Move!

864
01:09:58,999 --> 01:10:00,459
 What's going on?

865
01:10:00,459 --> 01:10:01,834
 Why do we have to chase you?

866
01:10:01,834 --> 01:10:03,951
 You chased me because we screwed you, no?

867
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:05,651
 Byun Seongcheol has priors for fraud.

868
01:10:05,651 --> 01:10:07,609
 Then what happens to me when they catch him?

869
01:10:07,609 --> 01:10:11,517
 Oh, sis! Thank you for inviting me!

870
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:13,999
 What do I do?

871
01:10:13,999 --> 01:10:16,259
 He's wealthy and well-connected.

872
01:10:16,259 --> 01:10:18,999
 He would've been your biggest obstacle when taking Jihoo.

873
01:10:18,999 --> 01:10:23,126
 No wonder a perfect guy like him dated Jihoo's mother.

874
01:10:23,126 --> 01:10:24,209
 Having fun?

875
01:10:24,209 --> 01:10:26,809
 What do you get out of spreading false rumors?

876
01:10:26,809 --> 01:10:29,083
 Think about what you've lost.

877
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:30,959
 Who wanted it?

878
01:10:30,959 --> 01:10:34,326
 This little rascal said he wanted to live with me forever.

879
01:10:34,326 --> 01:10:37,542
 I don't have to wait 7 years and 4 months to see Jihoo?

880
01:10:37,542 --> 01:10:39,559
 I have even better news.

881
01:10:39,559 --> 01:10:40,792
- Jihoo! 
 - Uncle...

882
01:10:40,792 --> 01:10:44,984
 I believe the heavens helped so the two of you could meet.

883
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,620

884
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:52,340

885
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:58,670
