1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:07,030

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,401

3
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:16,709

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:22,200

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,667

6
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:33,584

7
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:37,920

8
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,290

9
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,552

10
00:00:49,552 --> 00:00:50,384

11
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,734
 He's excited and wants your comeback to be awesome.

12
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:55,609
 He signed, sir.

13
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:57,301
 Wow! We got him!

14
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:00,960
 J. King! J. King!

15
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,776
 Jihoo, wake up!

16
00:01:04,776 --> 00:01:06,676
 What's wrong with him!

17
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:09,375
 He's unconscious! Help us!

18
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,275
 It's shock from alcohol poisoning.

19
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:12,442
 Hey, he ate chocolate with alcohol in it...

20
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:14,218
 What about Uncle? Can you save him?

21
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:15,134
 Uncle!

22
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:16,442
 This is my stage!

23
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:18,250
 I've never done drugs!

24
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,676
 For Jihoo?

25
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:21,401
 Jihoo will be mine no matter what.

26
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:23,059

27
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:25,067
 You're his mother, I'm his uncle.

28
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:27,567
 Why aren't we suitable to raise him?

29
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:32,501
 You have to keep your word, even if I'm not there.

30
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:36,750
 Nothing would've happened if I didn't do the fan meeting.

31
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,199
 As his mother, please help him adjust to that family.

32
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:44,192
 - What! 
 - I got you!

33
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,899
 I never felt this before.

34
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:50,426
 Could this be happiness?

35
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:52,534
 You chased me because we screwed you, no?

36
00:01:52,534 --> 00:01:54,651
 Think about what you've lost.

37
00:01:54,651 --> 00:01:56,626
 Who would want what you've lost?

38
00:01:56,626 --> 00:01:58,109
 We must get you acquitted.

39
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:00,292
 Then... I'll be able to be with Jihoo?

40
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:02,334
 Don't be scared.

41
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:04,199
 It's what you've always done.

42
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:07,467
 Just do as you're told.

43
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,999
 Dad, what do I do?

44
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,567
 He stood trial for murder!

45
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:16,434
 He was acquitted. He's innocent.

46
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:18,009
 Why aren't you at the hospital?

47
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:20,876
 I heard Jihoo is meeting his uncle today.

48
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:25,299
 ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

49
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:28,570
 It was really hard.

50
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,320

51
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,399
How did Director Byun know?

52
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:41,699
How could he have known what you're allergic to?

53
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,599
He isn't family.

54
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:50,499
Yes, Director.

55
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:53,109
I'm really sorry. I won't miss the next session.

56
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:56,799
 You asked me about Other Music. Director Byun.

57
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,317
- Yes! You looked into it? 
  - I heard from the engineer.

58
00:03:00,317 --> 00:03:04,517
 Apparently Byun said something while drunk.

59
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,492
What?

60
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:08,899
 He said his investor was Gangto Money.

61
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:11,099
 - You know Gangto Money, right?  
 - Please, wait...

62
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,692
 - They're famous.  
 - Gangto... Wait, Gangto?

63
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:20,080
Why would... he mention them?

64
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:27,342
 - The chocolate Jihoo ate... 
 - I think Director Byun brought it.

65
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:30,067
 Think about what you've lost.

66
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:32,242
 Who would want what you've lost?

67
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:35,620
 Find that person, stupid.

68
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:03,467
Wang Joonhyeok! I've got you!

69
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:05,317
Come here. On your knees!

70
00:04:05,317 --> 00:04:08,899
Uncle! Hide uncle! You'll go to jail!

71
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:11,799
I won't report you. Just come here.

72
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,167
Come here, you prick!

73
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:19,199
Go inside for a moment. Please, Jihoo?

74
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:21,942
He knew because he's family.

75
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:25,117
Because he's family. Because he's the father.

76
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:26,999
What're you saying?

77
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:30,718
Jihoo almost died. He almost died!

78
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:32,417
Honey!

79
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:34,317
- Are you crazy? 
 - You call yourself a father?

80
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:36,867
You're not a father!

81
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:38,892
What the hell are you saying?

82
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:40,967
- Hurry up and get Jihoo. 
 - Okay.

83
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:42,892
Do you know Director Byun?

84
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:44,192
Huh?

85
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:47,167
You're the CEO of Other Music!

86
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:50,792
You used Byun to get Jihoo drunk, right?

87
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,967
Bullshit! I don't even know Other Music!

88
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:56,467
Who's Director Byun?

89
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:59,692
Do you know how many employees I have?

90
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:03,492
You're going to jail for attempted murder, got it?

91
00:05:03,492 --> 00:05:05,267
- You hear me? 
 - You've lost it!

92
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:07,042
- Call the police. 
 - Jihoo, come here.

93
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:09,167
What the hell are you trying to pull?

94
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:11,592
Uncle! Uncle!

95
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:13,567
What drove you this crazy?

96
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:16,842
Prepare yourself. You're finished.

97
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:19,592
- Jihoo. 
  - Uncle!

98
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:21,818
 - Uncle!  
 - Jihoo! Jihoo!

99
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:24,099
- Jihoo! Jihoo! 
 - Uncle!

100
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:27,384
 - Uncle!  
 - Jihoo!

101
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:30,399
Uncle!

102
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,599
Uncle!

103
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,290

104
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,309
Get inside!

105
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:42,767

106
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:44,799
Grandmother, please, just one more time.

107
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,992
This is all my fault.

108
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:49,042
Don't report my uncle.

109
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:51,301
Go inside your room!

110
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:53,799
I'll do whatever you say.

111
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:55,842
I'll be first place in everything.

112
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:58,117
Grandmother, please!

113
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:00,099
Shut up!

114
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:02,518
Shut your mouth and go upstairs!

115
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:09,542
And you! What the hell is this?

116
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:14,267
I'm Jihoo's mother. I deserve to make some decisions.

117
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:18,659
He should be rewarded for his efforts or he'll quit!

118
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:20,792
Do you want Jihoo to end up like him?

119
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:22,499
What?

120
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:23,999
How dare you!

121
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,740
Do you want her to leave me, too?

122
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:34,092
Yonga!

123
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:37,267
Report him! Lock him up!

124
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:40,192
But Mom...

125
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:44,792
He asked if I was the CEO of Other Music.

126
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:47,799
- What? 
 - I think he's on to us!

127
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:52,742
He said he'll get me locked up for attempted murder.

128
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:58,742
Wait, just wait. What do we do?

129
00:06:58,742 --> 00:07:01,818
 Calm down. Did they take Jihoo?

130
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:03,242
Yes.

131
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:05,767
Then... should I go to the police?

132
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:09,492
 He denied everything. We don't even have evidence.

133
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:11,692
Evidence... Evidence...

134
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:14,142
I need to get Byun no matter what.

135
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,467
Sorry, but I need to hang up. I'll call you back.

136
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:19,542
I should talk with my sister. I'll call you.

137
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:24,017
Now what?

138
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:28,010
She's going to freak out if I tell her. What do I do?

139
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:36,642
Son, I really didn't tell him anything.

140
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:42,792
I don't think they'll report him right now.

141
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,799
Really?

142
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:49,142
Can you tell Uncle that he's going to be okay?

143
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:52,267
Give and take.

144
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:56,217
I do something for you, you do something for me.

145
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:58,217
All right.

146
00:07:58,217 --> 00:08:01,742
Let's try out for the Olympiads.

147
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:08,410
I disobeyed my restraining order but still...

148
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:15,230
 Jihoo's fine. I didn't snitch on you.

149
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:25,792
Done crying?

150
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:29,599
Doesn't it feel better?

151
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:36,017
Do you really want to move?

152
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:40,942
I don't care if they bully me.

153
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:45,899
I hate it when they talk bad about my dad.

154
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,830
That's why I wanted to take it to my grave.

155
00:08:55,699 --> 00:09:01,192
You told me people enjoy others' misfortune.

156
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,817
It's not always the case.

157
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:09,199
It's just... because they don't know better.

158
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:14,199
So, we shouldn't let what they say to hurt us.

159
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:20,010
Can you take care of dad?

160
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:23,742
You're such a sweetheart.

161
00:09:50,618 --> 00:09:54,899
She worries about you more than herself.

162
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:00,617
For today...

163
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:06,599
Thanks for bringing Noeul home today.

164
00:10:07,492 --> 00:10:09,942
I even hit someone.

165
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:19,442
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

166
00:10:20,592 --> 00:10:24,192
No matter how much I think about it...

167
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:27,599
Jihoo's father spread the rumors.

168
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:31,118
He's the one who told me about it.

169
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,399
But...

170
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:43,792
the rumors didn't spread before. Why now?

171
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,917
 What about Sechan?

172
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,742
 Does he know? About his father's criminal history?

173
00:10:55,592 --> 00:10:59,699
 If you don't want rumors to spread in our neighborhood,

174
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:02,418
 just do as you're told.

175
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:07,042
 You call yourself a mother?

176
00:11:30,592 --> 00:11:34,667
- How's Noeul? 
 - Not good.

177
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:38,342
That's why you asked if I trusted him.

178
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:43,942
Immediately having to move in and live with him,

179
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:48,699
regardless of whether it was true or not, it really bothered me.

180
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:52,799
I felt like I didn't know him well enough.

181
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,342
Maybe I was moving too fast.

182
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:58,217
Why didn't you talk to me about it?

183
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,092
Jihoo's father really scared me.

184
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:02,583
Huh?

185
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,867
How is that prick involved in this? Again?

186
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:08,242
Again?

187
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:12,167
I'm losing my mind!

188
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,367
What?

189
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,292
What's wrong?

190
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:20,892
I think...

191
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:25,467
Kyungsoo owns Other Music.

192
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:26,367
What?

193
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:31,720
I think Kyungsoo used Byun to screw me over.

194
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:39,342
You're saying Kyungsoo was behind everything?

195
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,667
Everything. He's responsible for everything.

196
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:45,192
Jihoo almost dying from the chocolate, included.

197
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:46,042
Seriously?

198
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,642
Hey, wait...

199
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,142
There's no point going right now.

200
00:12:50,142 --> 00:12:52,350
We don't have evidence.

201
00:12:55,718 --> 00:12:58,399
We need to find evidence first.

202
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,799
If this is all true he'll go down for attempted murder.

203
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:08,142
I won't need a retrial. We can bring Jihoo back right away.

204
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,934
How could he... How could a human being do that?

205
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:20,642
Just calm down. I'll go speak with Big Brother first.

206
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:26,567
Seriously.

207
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:28,092
Hey.

208
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:31,540
It's Jihoo's grandmother.

209
00:13:36,092 --> 00:13:40,092
Gangto Money's successor in a rental apartment.

210
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:42,792
This must be your reality.

211
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:45,067
I was just about to go and see you.

212
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:47,342
How bold of you to come and meet us willingly.

213
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:50,442
You broke the law. How dare you?

214
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:53,592
Lock me up. I don't care, but!

215
00:13:53,592 --> 00:13:56,699
You'll pay the price for what you've done to us.

216
00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:01,192
How stupid do you have to be so misunderstood?

217
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:05,234
Misunderstood?

218
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:09,451
You lied that you didn't want Jihoo, then you...

219
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:15,851
You put him in danger. Made him a criminal.

220
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:18,667
How could you act like you wanted to help then do that?

221
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,718
We didn't do anything!

222
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:22,317
Then, who did?

223
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:26,192
So the incident happened but no one's responsible?

224
00:14:26,192 --> 00:14:32,409
Mingi's mom. Park Hyeryeong planned everything.

225
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:39,818
 Can I really blame everything on you?

226
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:41,699
 Of course, Mrs. President.

227
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,618
 Now that they know the truth they won't stay quiet.

228
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:47,699
 Use me as your shield.

229
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:51,567
When I was searching for you and Jihoo for months,

230
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,267
I got a phone call from a prison.

231
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,342
If I helped win her appeal she would find Jihoo for me.

232
00:14:56,342 --> 00:14:59,567
 Blame everything on me.

233
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:03,842
 I will take responsibility. It's the least I can do for you.

234
00:15:03,842 --> 00:15:05,417
You're saying...

235
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:09,567
She told you where we lived to save herself?

236
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,167
Save herself? No.

237
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:16,017
She wants revenge.

238
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:17,167
 But...

239
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,042
 will they believe me?

240
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:21,718
 I was trying to get my son back.

241
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:25,899
 I wanted revenge for my daughter. They will believe you.

242
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:29,899
She lost her daughter, reputation, and ended up in jail because of you.

243
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:32,167
She's crazy.

244
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:37,267
You shouldn't ruin someone like that.

245
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:41,142
You almost got Jihoo killed! Got it?

246
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:42,967
Excuse me, Grandmother!

247
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:45,192
Wake up. Want to know the facts?

248
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:47,918
Because of your greed, Jihoo almost lost his life.

249
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:50,042
You're the one who gave her orders. Am I wrong?

250
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:52,367
I didn't order her to do anything!

251
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:55,792
A music label, director? I've never heard of them!

252
00:15:55,792 --> 00:16:01,042
She said she wanted one thing, you! To cut your wings off.

253
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,242
My wings?

254
00:16:02,242 --> 00:16:05,492
She's the one who exposed your boyfriend.

255
00:16:05,492 --> 00:16:10,092
She'll go after anyone who helps you. Understand?

256
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:15,909
How dare she put Jihoo in danger.

257
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:19,392
I'll make sure she pays for it.

258
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:23,630
Even after beating her my anger burns.

259
00:16:25,342 --> 00:16:29,999
The elections are near. I can't risk her coming after me.

260
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,892
I'll take care of her in due time.

261
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:37,367
I'll lift your restraining order.

262
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:44,220
I'm rewarding you for my negligence. I should've known.

263
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:57,167
 Your son came yesterday?

264
00:17:00,342 --> 00:17:02,742
 Thank you, Mrs. President.

265
00:17:02,742 --> 00:17:04,942
 I was able to meet with my son.

266
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,175
 Let's win the election.

267
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:13,667
 If we do... this house, your son, everything will be yours.

268
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,917
 I'll be on my way.

269
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:24,218
 Mrs. President, before you leave. You must hit me.

270
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:28,892
 - That's unnecessary. 
 - They will come to check.

271
00:17:28,892 --> 00:17:32,850
 This must be done in order to fool them completely.

272
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:53,699
Excuse me.

273
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,799
Do you really want revenge?

274
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,692
You took Jihoo from us. Turned me into a criminal.

275
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:01,617
Because of what happened with Chaeyoung?

276
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:06,792
Did you order Byun to give Jihoo alcoholic chocolate?

277
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:10,399
You know that's attempted murder, right?

278
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:11,884
Do you have evidence?

279
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:14,967
Where's Director Byun?

280
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,499
Why are you asking me?

281
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:22,767
- Aren't the cops onto him? 
 - I just hope he's alive.

282
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:27,967
I was there when you tried to kill Dogyeong.

283
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:34,230
All right, then. I'll see you in court.

284
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:48,200
 - You're really going to do it? 
 - Of course!

285
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,900
Have you seen me lie?

286
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,925
Mom!

287
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:58,620
We're going to re-do Uncle's birthday party.

288
00:19:13,225 --> 00:19:17,475
Allowing him to see Jihoo again made the plan successful.

289
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:21,225
I agree. He was simply excited to take Jihoo.

290
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:23,375
We've completely fooled him.

291
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:27,375
Everything is pointed towards me. I'll watch them closely.

292
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:31,175
You and your son don't have to worry about this anymore.

293
00:19:31,175 --> 00:19:35,099
All right. You've done a great job.

294
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:36,783
Yes.

295
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:42,025
She really took the blame?

296
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,375
She's becoming a force to be reckoned with.

297
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:51,399
She's still useful. Dump her when you win the election.

298
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,099
She won't be easy to get rid of.

299
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:56,999
She has nothing besides us.

300
00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:00,099
No one would miss her if she disappeared.

301
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:04,625
Oh, Director Byun! Tell her to get rid of him.

302
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,225
I already have.

303
00:20:06,225 --> 00:20:10,576
The greatest genius! Shin Hwaja!

304
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:19,001
Honey, let's go on a trip. It's so nice without Jihoo.

305
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:22,234
I'm his mother.

306
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:26,300
I married you to raise Jihoo.

307
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,999
We got him back. By doing everything.

308
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:31,475
Why'd you get caught in the first place?

309
00:20:31,475 --> 00:20:34,626
It's taken care of. What's with the attitude?

310
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:38,926
Did you take care of it? You're nothing.

311
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:42,199
Did you call me "nothing"?

312
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,851
- You want to see me angry? 
 - Then what are you?

313
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:46,526
How is it that nothing goes your way?

314
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:49,651
Everything is what your mother or that woman plans.

315
00:20:49,651 --> 00:20:53,025
Why'd they lift the restraining order? Why!

316
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:57,626
I was making progress with Jihoo. Finally, I was controlling him!

317
00:20:57,626 --> 00:21:02,199
I even got him to take the pills. He was making fast progress!

318
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:06,276
You give him pills? He gets sick on them.

319
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,601
Everyone studies until they get sick.

320
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:15,901
Don't forget, I'll make Jihoo into the greatest successor.

321
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:20,151
You can't have a child. If we lose Jihoo...

322
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:23,342
I'm leaving you. Understand?

323
00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:26,450
Always talking about progress.

324
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,576
Is he a video game?

325
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,876
 Want to join Jihoo's uncle's birthday party?

326
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:40,250
 Noeul, I don't believe the rumors.

327
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,626
 Come to school, I'll protect you.

328
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:44,999
 We're friends.

329
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,026
Noeul.

330
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,276
I want to speak with you.

331
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:14,499
- Someone... spread the rumor on purpose. 
 - Why?

332
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,376
Because we're friends with Jihoo's family.

333
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,626
They thought if bad rumors were spread about us,

334
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:24,651
we'd move away.

335
00:22:24,651 --> 00:22:27,501
I'm not going to move.

336
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:33,550
Are you sure? You hated that rumor.

337
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,776
It was just you and me back then.

338
00:22:38,826 --> 00:22:41,099
Now it isn't.

339
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:44,675
Now I have friends...

340
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:47,276
and Jihoo's mom who hugs me.

341
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,601
So?

342
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:56,599
So... let's stay here.

343
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,799
Let's get through this.

344
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,550
All right.

345
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:28,501
 I guess you'll be busy with Mingi today.

346
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:38,525
 I'm jealous but I congratulate you with all my heart, Hyeryeong.

347
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:47,876
- Mom. 
 - Yes.

348
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:50,400
We'll be late. Let's go.

349
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:53,300
Sodam, text your father.

350
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,592
Tell him you're with me today. To warm up the soup for dinner.

351
00:23:57,592 --> 00:23:59,199
You do it.

352
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:02,425
You two are so lovey dovey these days.

353
00:24:02,425 --> 00:24:04,300
I think Dad changed.

354
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,825
He's good to you, too.

355
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:19,350
You two are strange.

356
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,784
- Let's go, Dad. 
 - Yeah.

357
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:32,401
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

358
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,550
- Make a wish! 
 - Okay.

359
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,200
Ask to become the greatest superstar!

360
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,999
Yeah, he's too old to be an idol.

361
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:45,526
I'll blow it out at once.

362
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,199
What did you wish for?

363
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:55,826
To become a famous idol.

364
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:57,675
I wish to be together like this.

365
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,876
To be able to be happy with everyone here.

366
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:04,999
But, Uncle, I think you'll be married by your next birthday.

367
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,051
Thank you, Sodam.

368
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:16,226
If it was my birthday that's what I would've wished for.

369
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:19,000
Teacher... I was going to wish for that, too.

370
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,675
- I was joking. 
 - You were?

371
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:25,599
- Teacher, you have a weird taste in men. 
 - Hmm?

372
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,299
Noeul.

373
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:31,726
Sorry, Teacher, I lived with my father so

374
00:25:31,726 --> 00:25:33,876
I have high standards.

375
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:34,999
Noeul.

376
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:38,876
Noeul, I have high standards too!

377
00:25:38,876 --> 00:25:43,626
- Then why are you dating Uncle... 
 - Exactly.

378
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:47,225
- Uncle is incredibly charismatic, right? 
 - Of course.

379
00:25:47,225 --> 00:25:50,926
He's my brother but I can't listen to this.

380
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:53,375
Uncle, can you sing for us?

381
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,951
I want to hear you live.

382
00:25:55,951 --> 00:25:58,250
- Here? 
 - Yeah, let's hear it.

383
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,999
Who sings on their own birthday?

384
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:01,575
Then sing together.

385
00:26:01,575 --> 00:26:04,751
Jihoo, do a duet! I want to hear you sing.

386
00:26:04,751 --> 00:26:11,075
- Sing for us! 
 - Sing for us!

387
00:26:11,075 --> 00:26:12,900

I know somethings wrong.

402
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:43,550
Tell me what happened.

403
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:49,999
Hypothetically, if you had two phones,

404
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:53,142
and on the second phone is not your normal one.

405
00:27:53,142 --> 00:27:53,999
Okay.

406
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:57,550
But the second phone only has one number saved.

407
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,701
And it's saved with a heart emoji...

408
00:28:00,701 --> 00:28:03,099
What does that mean?

409
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,925
Sodam's father?

410
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:12,740
I saw the texts with that number. Do you know who it is?

411
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:17,100
- It's Hyeryeong. 
 - Hyeryeong?

412
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,559
Mingi's mother.

413
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,399
What?

414
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,601
He's having an affair with her.

415
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:26,350
How could he... How could he... do this to me?

416
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,876
Are you sure it's her?

417
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:30,425
If it was someone else,

418
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:34,650
he wouldn't talk about you or Jihoo's surprise party for his uncle.

419
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,376
He was telling her everything that I talked to him about.

420
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:39,951
I knew something was wrong.

421
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:45,425
Gifting me a ring, being sweet? He was trying to hide his affair.

422
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:49,600
How could she choose my husband out of everyone?

423
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,199
She came and offered me the Diamond position.

424
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:57,317
She also blamed me for spying on her and being a traitor.

425
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:01,310
What do I do? That woman...

426
00:29:02,126 --> 00:29:04,375
- It might not be an affair. 
 - How can it not be?

427
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:08,251
He had a second phone she was saved as a heart.

428
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:14,801
She approached your husband to get information on my family.

429
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:16,299
Huh?

430
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:22,076
She's the reason we lost Jihoo.

431
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:24,334
What?

432
00:29:24,334 --> 00:29:28,776
Have a good time. Let me know if you need anything.

433
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:30,899
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

434
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:40,918
She covered her tracks by using my husband as a spy.

435
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:43,718
I'm so embarrassed.

436
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:47,501
Everyone here is a victim. Including Teacher.

437
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:49,675
I guess so?

438
00:29:49,675 --> 00:29:52,934
Restore her reputation? Getting Mingi back?

439
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:54,501
Everything is just a lie.

440
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:58,999
We should tell the entire neighborhood and ruin her once more.

441
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:02,999
We shouldn't let our emotions get in our way.

442
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:07,526
Drop dead. She should go to Hell.

443
00:30:07,526 --> 00:30:10,501
While Mingi's mother was planning all this,

444
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:12,876
Jihoo's grandmother was unaware?

445
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:17,625
Lifting the restraining order is extremely weird for me.

446
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:23,026
It feels like she's giving candy to an aggravated child.

447
00:30:23,026 --> 00:30:28,399
What are you thinking about?

448
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,351
Oh, nothing.

449
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:36,651
I'm trying to figure out how Mingi's mother knew Byun.

450
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:38,999
She started planning in prison.

451
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:42,626
She was already in prison when you signed and did the showcase.

452
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:43,350
Right.

453
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,375
She's figured out ways to do crazy things in the past.

454
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:49,999
But would she know about drugs and the music industry?

455
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:54,200
What about the exact timing of giving Jihoo the chocolate?

456
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,251
Visitation and phone calls are limited. No access to a cell phone.

457
00:30:59,251 --> 00:31:01,125
But...

458
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,475
When Jihoo fainted,

459
00:31:05,475 --> 00:31:08,499
nobody knew what Jihoo ate. Right?

460
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:12,626
Right, the fan merely said Byun gave him chocolate.

461
00:31:12,626 --> 00:31:14,876
She didn't mention anything about alcohol.

462
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:16,999
How did the doctor know?

463
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:20,792
His breath must have smelt like alcohol with chocolate around his mouth.

464
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:24,110
No, he didn't try smelling.

465
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,501
 We don't know what he ate! We didn't see...

466
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:27,751
 - Min Jihoo? 
 - Yes, he's Jihoo.

467
00:31:27,751 --> 00:31:31,483
 It's shock from alcohol poisoning. He had chocolate with alcohol in it.

468
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:35,300
He knew that Jihoo was coming? The doctor?

469
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:40,076
Yes, the doctor already knew Jihoo and what he ate.

470
00:31:40,076 --> 00:31:43,375
At first, I thought someone at Hot Bar called it in ahead of time.

471
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:47,051
He already knew? This is strange.

472
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:51,626
Jihoo's grandmother came by the hospital.

473
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:54,275
- Really? 
 - Yes.

474
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:56,951
She seemed very calm.

475
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:58,751
As if she knew everything.

476
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:04,125
The doctor mentioned that she knew the chief of the hospital.

477
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:09,999
I'm frustrated but the more I hear, I don't believe it's Mingi's mom.

478
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,276
Could she have taken the fall for it?

479
00:32:14,276 --> 00:32:16,876
If that's true, what does everything mean?

480
00:32:16,876 --> 00:32:22,375
If it wasn't Mingi's mom and it turned out to be Jihoo's grandmother...

481
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:26,699
We could get custody back.

482
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:38,399
 After that day, the adults acted differently.

483
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,051
I'm on it.

484
00:32:43,976 --> 00:32:45,876
Noeul, I'll be right back.

485
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:47,875
Okay.

486
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:51,000
 We didn't know what they were doing,

487
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,999
 but suddenly everyone was busy.

488
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:57,751
I remember. The child who had alcoholic chocolate.

489
00:32:57,751 --> 00:33:02,076
Yes, but, how did you know about the

490
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:05,234
alcoholic chocolate before we arrived?

491
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:10,400
 They would gather frequently and have serious discussions.

492
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,375
Those crazy bastards!

493
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:16,775
You're sure that Mingi's mom took the fall?

494
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:20,999
How annoying. Now we have to clear her name?

495
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,850
The Limit of Sequences?

496
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,175
Jihoo, that's crazy!

497
00:33:28,225 --> 00:33:33,599
Even when I'm visiting, they don't care. I'm invisible to them.

498
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:38,226
Can you solve these? It's for high school kids.

499
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:41,209
In order to come here.

500
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:43,450
I have to solve all of that.

501
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:48,292
But what are the adults doing all the time?

502
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,300
I think they're planning something.

503
00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:59,042

504
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:04,599
 Things that I couldn't understand began happening.

505
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:07,559
Hey! Wang Joonhee! Just stop!

506
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,551
You shouldn't disrespect me like that!

507
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:12,599
Forget it. All right?

508
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,526
Yeah, if you can't deal with it. Let's never see each other!

509
00:34:15,526 --> 00:34:17,342
Happy?

510
00:34:23,076 --> 00:34:24,951
What's wrong? What's going on?

511
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:26,042
Are you fighting with Jihoo's mom?

512
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:29,292
Have you seen me fight? I'd rather cut her out.

513
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:31,409
She's your best friend. You should try...

514
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,999
Seriously!

515
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:37,000
Don't touch me! And try what? What would you know?

516
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,075
Get away from me!

517
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:42,876
What a pleasant surprise.

518
00:34:42,876 --> 00:34:46,975
Is the deal you offered still valid?

519
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:48,183
Becoming the Diamond?

520
00:34:48,183 --> 00:34:51,459
I don't have to be the main in order to shine.

521
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:55,226
Also, that position is already filled. Just reinstate me as Gold?

522
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,199
Why the sudden change of heart?

523
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,834
You didn't want to be a "political servant."

524
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:01,617
Can I be honest?

525
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:03,199
I'm terribly bored.

526
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:07,292
After cutting ties with everyone and spending time with Jihoo's mom,

527
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:09,425
I've been really lonely.

528
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:12,817
Forget it, if you aren't interested.

529
00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:14,676
I am.

530
00:35:14,676 --> 00:35:19,576
We've been short on members and need more helping hands.

531
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:25,899
Please welcome Sodam's mother to the Gold Momvelies.

532
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:31,775
I knew you'd come back.

533
00:35:31,775 --> 00:35:35,951
I feel like we're complete again. This was always your home.

534
00:35:35,951 --> 00:35:41,559
Thank you for welcoming me. I feel comfortable here.

535
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:46,575
Let's hear a word from the Diamond.

536
00:35:46,575 --> 00:35:48,501
Yes.

537
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:52,126
Welcome back.

538
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:55,825
How about Sodam's mom becoming Diamond?

539
00:35:57,292 --> 00:36:03,499
Sis, the Momvelies have a terrible reputation right now.

540
00:36:03,499 --> 00:36:07,050
Sodam's mom joining could show change.

541
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,801
Help recover our reputation.

542
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:12,100
The current Diamond wouldn't like that.

543
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,775
Do as you please. I heard you were already offered it.

544
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:21,201
There's no need to rush. Let's think about it.

545
00:36:21,201 --> 00:36:26,099
I'd like to talk about Mrs. President's campaign ceremony.

546
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:31,775
Should we do it at the camp? Anyone have any ideas?

547
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:34,451
The camp is a bit old-fashioned.

548
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:40,076
How about throwing a party instead at her mansion?

549
00:36:40,076 --> 00:36:42,999
That's great. It'll feel less formal.

550
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:46,050
She has the best ideas!

551
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,876
I should ask her.

552
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:55,151
Sodam's mom, can you take lead on this?

553
00:36:55,151 --> 00:36:57,501
You were always our best event planner.

554
00:36:57,501 --> 00:37:00,626
I'd like you to take charge.

555
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:02,575
What do you think, Diamond?

556
00:37:02,575 --> 00:37:06,300
If that's what you want, I agree.

557
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,076
Then that's that. We're close to elections now.

558
00:37:10,076 --> 00:37:15,775
How about we use our facility here for her election office?

559
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:20,325
This is a prime location for her to travel and actively campaign.

560
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:23,826
- Here? 
 - That's a great idea.

561
00:37:23,826 --> 00:37:25,899
Is it?

562
00:37:25,899 --> 00:37:29,399
We all agree?  We all agree, right?

563
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:33,425
Diamond, speak with security and work it out.

564
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:35,801
Yes, all right.

565
00:37:35,801 --> 00:37:40,426
Let's support her as well as we can.

566
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:49,101
Sodam's mom cut ties with Jihoo's mom?

567
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:55,451
What's wrong with these women?

568
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,450
I was curious why she wanted to join us again.

569
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,226
Indeed.

570
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:06,676
When can we see each other?

571
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:11,925
If you just tell me when, I can reschedule.

572
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:16,426
I miss you. I miss you so much...

573
00:38:17,775 --> 00:38:20,125
 Shin Hwaja! Shin Hwaja!

574
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,125
 Hello, everyone!

575
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:25,459
 Uncle was acting the strangest.

576
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:32,125
Shin Hwaja! Shin Hwaja!

577
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:35,125
♪ The most talented, Shin Hwaja! ♪

578
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:38,125
♪ World's best company president! ♪

579
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:40,501
- Oh, jeez... 
 - What're you doing?

580
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:45,299
You caught me. I was trying to support you guys quietly.

581
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:46,375
What're you planning?

582
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:48,584
Planning? I'm not doing anything.

583
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:51,550
Our ex-in-law let me see Jihoo again.

584
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:56,676
I'm just showing my appreciation for lifting my restraining order.

585
00:38:56,676 --> 00:39:00,501
I was the one who did that.

586
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:01,876
I'm Jihoo's father.

587
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:05,209
Oh right... You're right. Now that I think about it, you're absolutely right.

588
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:09,199
Thank you so much, seriously. Can I buy you a drink?

589
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:10,300
No thanks.

590
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,226
Hey, but...

591
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:15,675
Who's she?

592
00:39:15,675 --> 00:39:18,850
She's always next to your mom.

593
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:25,959
Your mom even bought her a penthouse?

594
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:27,775
Who the hell...

595
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:29,926
aid that?

596
00:39:29,926 --> 00:39:31,951
We're lending it to her.

597
00:39:31,951 --> 00:39:34,651
- Right? Okay. 
 - Of course.

598
00:39:34,651 --> 00:39:37,792
She's just our errand girl, okay?

599
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:43,718
She just acts like she's in charge of everything.

600
00:39:43,718 --> 00:39:48,542
There's no way. I'm the son of Gangto Money.

601
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:52,167
Right, you're Gangto Money's Shin Hwaja's son.

602
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:54,999
You're the successor! Right!

603
00:39:55,876 --> 00:40:00,292
I'm leaving. Let's have a drink sometime.

604
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,999
Okay.

605
00:40:07,976 --> 00:40:09,376
What was that?

606
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,150
What?

607
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,025
That guy.

608
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:18,576
Jihoo's uncle. Don't you know?

609
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:22,775
You should've figured out what he's doing.

610
00:40:22,775 --> 00:40:27,451
Don't underestimate him. Keep an eye on him.

611
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:33,575
You're giving me orders?

612
00:40:33,575 --> 00:40:37,899
Why should I? It's your job.

613
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:39,400
Hey.

614
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,650
Do you actually believe you hold status here?

615
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:48,375
You're simply here to do our dirty work.

616
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,083
Dirty work!

617
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:52,167
No matter what, I'm still my mother's...

618
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:54,375
Let's go, Mrs. President.

619
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:57,676
How dare she cut me off...

620
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:12,951
Nothing like a glass of wine to relax.

621
00:41:12,951 --> 00:41:15,650
I saw some strange activity.

622
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,820
I've relayed people onto Jihoo's uncle.

623
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,599
All right. It's best to be prepared.

624
00:41:26,876 --> 00:41:30,826
I can feel my age creeping up on me these days.

625
00:41:30,826 --> 00:41:33,625
You must take care of your condition.

626
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:39,101
Mayor is just the beginning. You can climb higher.

627
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:41,475
Should I?

628
00:41:41,475 --> 00:41:43,734
If I tried...

629
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:48,575
they'd call me an ignorant old lady

630
00:41:48,575 --> 00:41:52,550
who only knows money and raises a child alone.

631
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,825
They'd look down on me.

632
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:59,375
I will do my best to support you to the end.

633
00:42:03,575 --> 00:42:09,826
It was my dream to raise a fine son.

634
00:42:09,826 --> 00:42:12,876
It didn't go my way.

635
00:42:12,876 --> 00:42:15,076
Although my son is flawed,

636
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:19,526
my wish was to raise my grandchildren as wonderfully as possible.

637
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:25,326
but in reality, their blood would be mixed with other people who have no roots.

638
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:29,851
Erasing that vulgar blood from Jihoo...

639
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:32,576
is terribly difficult.

640
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:37,800
How about secretly... sending him abroad?

641
00:42:40,675 --> 00:42:45,499
You always know what I want inside.

642
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:49,201
Sometimes you scare me.

643
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:53,926
Mrs. President, you are my role model.

644
00:42:53,926 --> 00:42:56,725
You're like a daughter to me.

645
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,201
Mrs. President...

646
00:43:01,801 --> 00:43:06,351
May I overstep and give my humble opinion?

647
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:08,475
Of course.

648
00:43:08,475 --> 00:43:12,399
It's about Jihoo's father.

649
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:14,276
My son?

650
00:43:14,276 --> 00:43:16,200
Yes.

651
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:22,000
If possible, we should exclude him from external events.

652
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:33,950
When meeting with campaigners or voters, his actions are...

653
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,299
He's too rough and honest. You'd be better off without him there.

654
00:43:55,951 --> 00:43:58,000
Nonsense!

655
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,076
Who does she think she is? How dare she tell me to stay home!

656
00:44:02,076 --> 00:44:05,300
- Just do as you're told. 
 - Why?

657
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,699
Maybe she doesn't want everyone to see your incompetence.

658
00:44:14,299 --> 00:44:18,799
Your words... are getting on my nerves.

659
00:44:18,799 --> 00:44:20,699
Because they're true?

660
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:25,175
Just focus on our business not my campaign.

661
00:44:27,425 --> 00:44:29,899
This is ridiculous!

662
00:44:33,225 --> 00:44:37,099
Yes, Councilor, I think I'm right in front.

663
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:40,326
Yeah, a cafe on the first floor? Yes, I'm here.

664
00:44:40,326 --> 00:44:43,451
You're out? You aren't here?

665
00:44:43,451 --> 00:44:46,542
Hours? How many hours?

666
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:47,684
Yeah, I don't care. Yes, I'll...

667
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,900

668
00:44:56,626 --> 00:44:58,999
Yes, he's meeting with lawyers.

669
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:01,576
It'll be a long time.

670
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,699
If anything happens. I'll call you right away.

671
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:15,999

672
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:19,526
Finally, got rid of him.

673
00:45:19,526 --> 00:45:22,326
Sorry, I'm late.

674
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:24,676
Who are you?

675
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:28,775
Who? Your ex-brother-in-law.

676
00:45:28,775 --> 00:45:32,584
Act your age. What's with all that?

677
00:45:32,584 --> 00:45:38,299
What? All the kids are doing this. You should unbutton yours, too.

678
00:45:38,299 --> 00:45:41,699
Here... Thank you.

679
00:45:49,901 --> 00:45:53,550
How long has it been since we've drunk like this?

680
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,801
It's our first, you idiot.

681
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:58,300
You could never drink with me.

682
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,999
Yeah?

683
00:45:59,999 --> 00:46:02,199
Still reminds me of the old days.

684
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:04,999
My sister and I ran a restaurant. You were a regular.

685
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:07,651
I was the VVIP!

686
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:15,825
Why don't you use honorifics?

687
00:46:15,825 --> 00:46:17,375
Big Brother, was that upsetting to you?

688
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,876
You should have said so. Have a drink, Big Bro.

689
00:46:20,876 --> 00:46:23,950
You sly idiot.

690
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:35,999
Happy to see Jihoo?

691
00:46:35,999 --> 00:46:42,451
Of course. Thanks to you, Big Bro. I'm extremely happy.

692
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:48,599
I'm happy about the restraining order, too.

693
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:53,726
Honestly, I hate kids.

694
00:46:53,726 --> 00:46:56,351
Why'd you take him?

695
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,400
Why do you think?

696
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,499
My mom's obsession for a worthy successor.

697
00:47:03,499 --> 00:47:08,599
She isn't satisfied with me. So she obsesses over Jihoo.

698
00:47:09,575 --> 00:47:11,783
And my side piece.

699
00:47:12,501 --> 00:47:14,625
Well, we're married so she's my wife.

700
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:18,225
Anyways, Yonga really wanted Jihoo, too.

701
00:47:18,225 --> 00:47:21,926
- Why would she? 
 - She loves video games.

702
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:27,199
She's obsessed with leveling up Jihoo.

703
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,075
The best character to level up is a real human?

704
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,870
Oh my god, seriously!  Sorry...

705
00:47:33,876 --> 00:47:37,751
Do you want to level up, too?

706
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:41,700
Take pills, bleed from your nose?

707
00:47:53,626 --> 00:47:56,042

708
00:47:56,042 --> 00:48:00,351
You still can't even find Director Byun?

709
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:04,000
Your job is to defend the public...

710
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,425
All right whatever, goodbye.

711
00:48:06,459 --> 00:48:08,899
Hey, hey.

712
00:48:08,899 --> 00:48:13,801
You'll never find him. Just give up.

713
00:48:13,801 --> 00:48:14,675
Why?

714
00:48:14,675 --> 00:48:16,399
He's...

715
00:48:19,951 --> 00:48:22,725
- Did you? 
 - No.

716
00:48:22,725 --> 00:48:25,551
- That woman... 
 - What?

717
00:48:25,551 --> 00:48:29,926
Her again? I'm worried for you, Big Bro.

718
00:48:29,926 --> 00:48:34,518
She might take over and leave you with nothing.

719
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:37,751
You don't know anything.

720
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:44,509
I'm way above her. She can't do anything.

721
00:48:44,509 --> 00:48:49,009
- What're you saying? 
 - Do you know what really annoys me?

722
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,499
What?

723
00:48:50,525 --> 00:48:53,399
She doesn't know her place.

724
00:48:53,399 --> 00:48:57,325
By the way, you're underestimating my mom.

725
00:48:57,325 --> 00:49:02,475
Do you think my mom will let her get the best of her?

726
00:49:02,475 --> 00:49:05,126
My mom is...

727
00:49:05,126 --> 00:49:11,142
just pulling trash out of her pockets and giving it to her.

728
00:49:11,142 --> 00:49:15,499
Later we'll... just burn it all.

729
00:49:17,325 --> 00:49:21,400
I was curious why everyone was busy and meeting lawyers.

730
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,076
I received mail that Jihoo's uncle sued me.

731
00:49:25,076 --> 00:49:28,625
I'm glad that he's preoccupied with you.

732
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:32,999
He hasn't been annoying me. I'm pleased.

733
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:35,425
I took care of Director Byun.

734
00:49:35,425 --> 00:49:38,375
All evidence has been dealt with.

735
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,626
Don't worry about a thing.

736
00:49:52,626 --> 00:49:54,801
Were you followed today?

737
00:49:54,801 --> 00:50:00,901
Yes, I think I might have to sleep over today.

738
00:50:00,901 --> 00:50:02,501
Why?

739
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:05,501
Sleeping over here would look less suspicious.

740
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:08,375
Should I get you comfortable clothes?

741
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:11,751
Don't rush. My heart is racing.

742
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,250
These are your petitions.

743
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,999
They'll be attached to your retrial request.

744
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:21,626
I met all your fans and had them write one.

745
00:50:21,626 --> 00:50:22,999
Really?

746
00:50:25,999 --> 00:50:28,399
Focus on Uncle Joonhyeok.

747
00:50:28,399 --> 00:50:30,999
I'll take care of J. King.

748
00:50:30,999 --> 00:50:35,850
Why am I so blessed? My real fan...

749
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:39,325
So, do you mind if I use your phone?

750
00:50:39,325 --> 00:50:40,709
Why?

751
00:50:40,709 --> 00:50:42,876
- I need to install something. 
 - Yeah.

752
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:43,626
What's the password?

753
00:50:43,626 --> 00:50:47,350
I don't have one I can't remember them.

754
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:52,800
Sorry I've only focused on Jihoo.

755
00:50:53,626 --> 00:50:57,999
No, he's important to me too. Don't say that.

756
00:50:58,976 --> 00:51:00,759
Done.

757
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:03,667
You have a...

758
00:51:04,751 --> 00:51:07,125
precious memories album?

759
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:10,375
- I shouldn't see it, right? 
 - Please do.

760
00:51:10,876 --> 00:51:12,999
I want to brag about it but no one cares.

761
00:51:12,999 --> 00:51:14,375
I'll press it for you.

762
00:51:15,626 --> 00:51:19,300
No way! Isn't that a celebrity? Who was he?

763
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,099
A few years back... While driving towards the highway,

764
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:25,375
I saw a broken down celebrity van.

765
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:27,125
He was in a hurry for a photoshoot,

766
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:31,250
so I took him there and got a selfie in return.

767
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,301
Always helping others.

768
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,450
What?

769
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,000
What's this?

770
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,826
We look good? Like a couple?

771
00:51:41,826 --> 00:51:43,075
No.

772
00:51:43,075 --> 00:51:46,625
- I think we do. 
 - Nope.

773
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:50,000
What's the story behind this photo?

774
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,376
This was... two years ago.

775
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,999
I was working at a barbecue restaurant.

776
00:51:55,999 --> 00:52:00,250
I went out for coal when I saw her getting harassed by thugs.

777
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,876
- Oh my, what happened? 
 - I rescued her right away!

778
00:52:02,876 --> 00:52:04,276
What?

779
00:52:04,276 --> 00:52:05,999
I'm serious!

780
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:09,626
She said she'd post it on her SNS but still hasn't.

781
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:13,700
- Were you hurt? 
 - You want to scold me?

782
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:18,000
No, doing good deeds is great but I worry you might get hurt.

783
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,126
That's not a good deed. I'm not that kind of guy.

784
00:52:22,126 --> 00:52:25,675
I didn't do it for justice or anything.

785
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,617
It happened...

786
00:52:28,617 --> 00:52:31,375
when I moved out of my sister's.

787
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:33,999
So I thought if I helped someone,

788
00:52:33,999 --> 00:52:38,999
maybe someone might help my sister during a crisis?

789
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:43,999
Have a bite.

790
00:52:43,999 --> 00:52:47,250
Is she prettier? Or am I?

791
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,326
Beanie girl.

792
00:52:57,459 --> 00:53:00,876
This is a spicy hotdog I recently developed.

793
00:53:00,876 --> 00:53:04,134
- Would you like to try? 
 - Thank you.

794
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,200
How is it?

795
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,050
It's good.

796
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:11,909
Tell your friends about it.

797
00:53:11,909 --> 00:53:13,634
Yeah, okay.

798
00:53:13,634 --> 00:53:16,609
Can you just give me a few months?

799
00:53:16,609 --> 00:53:18,499
Sechan's mother?

800
00:53:18,499 --> 00:53:20,909
Sorry, let me call you back.

801
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:24,299
What? Why, what?

802
00:53:26,709 --> 00:53:29,159
I'm sorry about last time.

803
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:32,883
I shouldn't have hit you. I'm really sorry.

804
00:53:36,584 --> 00:53:38,899
Don't be pretentious.

805
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:42,259
Why are you apologizing?

806
00:53:42,259 --> 00:53:46,099
- Excuse me? 
 - I've wronged you so many times.

807
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:49,201
You must hate me, no?

808
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:53,959
You hit me and felt better, that's that. Why're you apologizing?

809
00:53:53,959 --> 00:53:58,684
Why are you making me the villain? Why is everyone doing it?

810
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,950
I'm apologizing to Sechan.

811
00:54:03,959 --> 00:54:07,350
I shouldn't have hit you infront of him.

812
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,200
I'm sorry.

813
00:54:22,383 --> 00:54:25,709
Sechan, not going to say hi?

814
00:54:26,483 --> 00:54:29,059
I'm your choir teacher. Hmm?

815
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:31,709
Drug addict.

816
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:36,567
- Hey. 
 - What?

817
00:54:50,709 --> 00:54:53,410
What're you waiting for?

818
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:55,780
Did you spit in it?

819
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:58,634
Always with the mouth. Just eat it.

820
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,959
You... um...

821
00:55:05,959 --> 00:55:08,399
Are you buying me cheap snacks to lecture me?

822
00:55:08,399 --> 00:55:11,859
I don't want it. Old man.

823
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:15,999
You're being a smart ass because you know you're in the wrong?

824
00:55:16,784 --> 00:55:20,809
Don't bully other kids. It's not cool.

825
00:55:20,809 --> 00:55:22,909
I'm not trying to be cool.

826
00:55:22,909 --> 00:55:24,959
You want to look tough?

827
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:33,883
I'm helping my mom.

828
00:55:35,659 --> 00:55:38,909
No one takes her side.

829
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:42,209
Everyone blames her for everything.

830
00:55:42,959 --> 00:55:48,099
I just want to be able to help her.

831
00:55:48,099 --> 00:55:50,784
Don't overthink it.

832
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:53,299
Just apologize to Noeul.

833
00:55:53,299 --> 00:55:59,109
Go ahead, eat... It's Jihoo's favorite. Try it, it's delicious.

834
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,534
Son. Have some snacks.

835
00:56:15,383 --> 00:56:18,583
Oh, I wanted to eat those.

836
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,410
Yeah?

837
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:24,084
Did you buy it from Jihoo's mom?

838
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,609
Can I...

839
00:56:33,584 --> 00:56:38,209
apologize to Noeul?

840
00:56:42,584 --> 00:56:44,309
Yes.

841
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,683
She'll get mad at me.

842
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:02,559
Do it if you want to.

843
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:07,234
If you're sincere, she'll accept it.

844
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,199
Yeah.

845
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:13,983
Hey, son.

846
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,699
Can we move away?

847
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,559
Of course. Do whatever you want.

848
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,359
No matter what, I'm on your side.

849
00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:37,959
I'll always be on your side.

850
00:57:37,959 --> 00:57:42,534
Oh!  Oh my goodness, my baby.

851
00:57:42,534 --> 00:57:44,750
My amazing baby.

852
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,584
My amazingly handsome baby.

853
00:57:47,584 --> 00:57:49,999
You're all grown up.

854
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:52,334
Go ahead, eat.

855
00:57:52,334 --> 00:57:53,899
- I'll buy you more. 
 - Okay.

856
00:57:53,899 --> 00:57:55,559
Right.

857
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:01,609
Finish that up and sleep.

858
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:18,959
Driver Kim!

859
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,883
 Finally. The day was near.

860
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,659
Yes, we'll be counting on you. Yes, Congressman Hwang.

861
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:42,734
When we know the right timing, I'll call you.

862
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:57,899
I'm sensing a war coming...

863
00:58:59,959 --> 00:59:03,959
Have you told them anything?

864
00:59:03,959 --> 00:59:07,399
No, Mom! I didn't say anything.

865
00:59:07,399 --> 00:59:09,399
Heard anything new?

866
00:59:09,399 --> 00:59:11,134
Nope.

867
00:59:11,709 --> 00:59:15,459
Did you know you have a new fan-made channel on YouTube?

868
00:59:15,459 --> 00:59:16,283
Really?

869
00:59:16,283 --> 00:59:20,183
- Noeul and I made it. 
 - Is there even anything to post?

870
00:59:20,183 --> 00:59:22,834
It was a video taken by Teacher on Uncle's birthday.

871
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:24,299
Yeah? Do I look good?

872
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:26,809
You look like an uncle.

873
00:59:26,809 --> 00:59:28,684
Take it down!

874
00:59:29,334 --> 00:59:33,709
What did your stepmom ask in return for letting you come here?

875
00:59:33,709 --> 00:59:37,034
It was Grandmother.

876
00:59:37,034 --> 00:59:40,099
What? What'd she ask for?

877
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:44,409
The reporter who interviewed us has a podcast.

878
00:59:44,409 --> 00:59:48,834
It's called, "Seo's Current Stories." I have to be a guest.

879
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,034
It's Big Bro.

880
00:59:52,584 --> 00:59:54,370
Yes, Big Bro.

881
00:59:56,090 --> 01:00:00,009
You're prepared? Yes, all right.

882
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,884
What is it? What's going on?

883
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,809
Are you...

884
01:00:19,459 --> 01:00:24,599
sure you still want to come here?

885
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:29,384
I'm just asking.

886
01:00:29,384 --> 01:00:34,034
I don't want to force you to come back to us.

887
01:00:34,709 --> 01:00:37,083
You don't think I want to?

888
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:39,899
That's not what I'm saying.

889
01:00:39,899 --> 01:00:42,209
What's wrong with you?

890
01:00:42,209 --> 01:00:46,209
Weren't you planning to bring me back?

891
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:48,783
We are, but...

892
01:00:49,734 --> 01:00:52,734
I needed to hear your opinion.

893
01:00:52,734 --> 01:00:58,099
Once this begins, you're going to have a rough time.

894
01:00:58,099 --> 01:01:01,334
So what? Do you want to give up now?

895
01:01:01,334 --> 01:01:05,359
We will do it. And I'm confident we'll succeed.

896
01:01:07,209 --> 01:01:09,959
So just listen to what I'm saying.

897
01:01:11,999 --> 01:01:15,634
Realistically, that family...

898
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:20,059
is extremely wealthy with a good background.

899
01:01:21,659 --> 01:01:23,534
Right?

900
01:01:23,534 --> 01:01:26,609
Everyone would probably agree that

901
01:01:26,609 --> 01:01:30,109
it's best for you to live there.

902
01:01:30,109 --> 01:01:31,334
You have a nice stepmother...

903
01:01:31,334 --> 01:01:36,059
Who would leave their mom because their stepmom was nice?

904
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:39,899
For me to come home,

905
01:01:39,899 --> 01:01:43,834
do I have to be miserable while I'm there?

906
01:01:45,209 --> 01:01:48,083
You have a family there, too.

907
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:52,899
When I was about to die you rushed and carried me.

908
01:01:52,899 --> 01:01:58,683
You didn't even realize that you hurt your foot. That's family.

909
01:02:00,459 --> 01:02:02,309
In order to take me,

910
01:02:02,309 --> 01:02:07,009
they tried to kill me. That's not family.

911
01:02:11,999 --> 01:02:16,599
I heard what you said to my dad from the car.

912
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:20,292
All right.

913
01:02:21,999 --> 01:02:24,499
I understand how you feel.

914
01:02:25,383 --> 01:02:30,209
Instead... you have to prepare yourself.

915
01:02:31,209 --> 01:02:34,634
You have to be careful, Uncle.

916
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:38,399
Yes, sir!

917
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:49,459
Min Jihoo rescue team. Execute plan A, over.

918
01:02:49,459 --> 01:02:52,059
Understood, over.

919
01:02:53,942 --> 01:02:55,792

920
01:03:01,999 --> 01:03:05,334
What brings you here at this hour?

921
01:03:06,099 --> 01:03:08,559
You're finally here?

922
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:12,959
If it were me, I'd have rushed over and pulled your hair out already.

923
01:03:12,959 --> 01:03:16,384
If that would solve anything, I would have.

924
01:03:16,384 --> 01:03:20,434
But my priority is solving this issue. I've been busy.

925
01:03:21,334 --> 01:03:23,459
I'm here to take Jihoo.

926
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:26,834
You saw him yesterday.

927
01:03:26,834 --> 01:03:34,059
No, not for visits. I'm here to take him.

928
01:03:34,834 --> 01:03:37,699
Why'd you come back here?

929
01:03:40,334 --> 01:03:43,234
That's not your concern.

930
01:03:44,334 --> 01:03:47,999
If you sold my family out to Jihoo's grandmother to get out of prison,

931
01:03:47,999 --> 01:03:50,584
you should have left after.

932
01:03:50,584 --> 01:03:53,083
Why do you care about the elections?

933
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:59,183
This house is meaningless. Are you taking the blame for Jihoo's grandmother's sins?

934
01:03:59,183 --> 01:04:01,359
What are you talking about?

935
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:04,734
Aren't you ashamed to bring Mingi here?

936
01:04:04,734 --> 01:04:08,799
Can you tell your son how you got this place?

937
01:04:16,099 --> 01:04:19,299
What are you pulling?

938
01:04:20,209 --> 01:04:23,859
We've done some research on our own.

939
01:04:24,609 --> 01:04:27,999
Research on what?

940
01:04:27,999 --> 01:04:31,084
Chaeyoung wrote letters to me.

941
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:35,809
Her rehab went well. She doesn't need a wheelchair anymore.

942
01:04:36,584 --> 01:04:41,999
She has friends, she studies hard...

943
01:04:41,999 --> 01:04:45,184
What's your point? What do you want?

944
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:48,999
There are better ways to get your children back.

945
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:54,183
So just leave our family alone. Stop meddling in Jihoo's life.

946
01:04:54,183 --> 01:04:55,999
You might lose your children forever.

947
01:04:55,999 --> 01:05:00,559
Do you think Jihoo's grandmother will give you what you want?

948
01:05:01,959 --> 01:05:05,699
Do you think I wouldn't have everything figured out?

949
01:05:06,999 --> 01:05:10,459
I'm sincerely worried for you.

950
01:05:10,459 --> 01:05:14,999
Not worried for you, but worried for your kids.

951
01:05:14,999 --> 01:05:17,959
You have your flaws, but your kids need a mother.

952
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:19,499
So, please...

953
01:05:20,209 --> 01:05:25,284
Please wake up, think about your kids, and run away.

954
01:05:27,209 --> 01:05:32,599
 That's when I realized what the adults were planning.

955
01:05:34,709 --> 01:05:35,999
Did you fight Jihoo's mom?

956
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:38,365
Why would I fight? I'll just cut her off.

957
01:05:38,365 --> 01:05:39,994
 She was in charge of disrupting.

958
01:05:39,994 --> 01:05:41,474
 Giving false information.

959
01:05:41,474 --> 01:05:42,999
 Disrupting the enemy.

960
01:05:42,999 --> 01:05:44,834
What did you research?

961
01:05:44,834 --> 01:05:50,059
You said Mingi's mother was behind getting Jihoo back?

962
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:51,099
That's what I said.

963
01:05:51,099 --> 01:05:53,083
But we found out that

964
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:59,199
Mingi's mom only had visits from a single person while in prison.

965
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:01,899
Chairman Shin Hwaja.

966
01:06:01,899 --> 01:06:06,083
We also went by the hospital to look into something else.

967
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:09,174
 Noeul's dad was the control tower. Organizing and collecting information.

968
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:10,555
 Control Tower

969
01:06:10,555 --> 01:06:14,074
 How did you know he ate chocolate containing alcohol?

970
01:06:14,074 --> 01:06:17,309
Our chief doctor said he was informed. He then informed us.

971
01:06:17,309 --> 01:06:18,899
From who?

972
01:06:18,899 --> 01:06:23,234
I heard she was Jihoo's grandmother.

973
01:06:23,234 --> 01:06:26,999
So? That isn't evidence.

974
01:06:26,999 --> 01:06:28,409
You're right. It isn't.

975
01:06:28,409 --> 01:06:30,599
But we have other evidence.

976
01:06:33,999 --> 01:06:39,099
 She just flapped her mouth from prison.

977
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:41,620
 Uncle infiltrated the enemy while engaging in psychological warfare.

978
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:43,684
 Conciliation and psychological warfare

979
01:06:43,684 --> 01:06:47,309
I, Min Kyungsoo, planned everything.

980
01:06:47,309 --> 01:06:49,999
CEO of Other Music? That's me.

981
01:06:49,999 --> 01:06:52,534
I hired Director Byun.

982
01:06:53,734 --> 01:06:54,960
You bastard!

983
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,880
You recorded everything?

984
01:06:56,883 --> 01:07:00,959
Mom, that's not me. It really isn't me.

985
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:05,999
Yeah, you aren't the culprit. Keep listening.

986
01:07:05,999 --> 01:07:09,359
 So, you gave Jihoo alcoholic chocolate?

987
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:12,209
 No, I don't even know what he's allergic to.

988
01:07:12,209 --> 01:07:14,484
 My mom gave the order to...

989
01:07:14,484 --> 01:07:17,183
feed him that chocolate.

990
01:07:17,183 --> 01:07:21,609
 My mom? She's the president of Gangto Money, Shin Hwaja!

991
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:26,799
 She had doctors on standby before Jihoo even arrived.

992
01:07:31,334 --> 01:07:33,999
So what? What're you trying to do?

993
01:07:33,999 --> 01:07:38,709
You're a poor, vulgar piece of trash. You want to go against me?

994
01:07:38,709 --> 01:07:41,600
Go against you? No,

995
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:45,959
I'm no cop or judge.

996
01:07:45,959 --> 01:07:49,209
I'm no special agent or the symbol of justice.

997
01:07:49,209 --> 01:07:52,626
How could I go against an evil

998
01:07:52,626 --> 01:07:55,959
criminal who built her fortune on corruption?

999
01:07:55,959 --> 01:07:59,599
Then what the Hell are you doing?

1000
01:08:02,183 --> 01:08:04,099
Give us...

1001
01:08:05,209 --> 01:08:07,359
Jihoo back.

1002
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,499
Please.

1003
01:08:13,999 --> 01:08:16,259
That's all you prepared?

1004
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:22,083
I'm doing this for Jihoo's sake.

1005
01:08:22,083 --> 01:08:25,709
I want to protect Jihoo from

1006
01:08:25,709 --> 01:08:28,083
the pain that is about to come.

1007
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:33,809
So let's just end this here.

1008
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:36,083
I beg you.

1009
01:08:38,834 --> 01:08:40,499
Get lost.

1010
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:45,999
That's too bad.

1011
01:08:45,999 --> 01:08:48,083
I was hoping it would end here.

1012
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:50,570
Yes, yes.

1013
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:52,330
I think you should come in.

1014
01:08:52,334 --> 01:08:53,759
Yes.

1015
01:08:54,434 --> 01:08:57,709
What is this? Who's coming in here?

1016
01:08:57,709 --> 01:09:00,234
I recommend you get some rest today.

1017
01:09:00,234 --> 01:09:04,210
You'll be busy with all the news articles tomorrow.

1018
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:05,899
What?

1019
01:09:05,899 --> 01:09:10,584
President of Gangto Money Shin Hwaja.

1020
01:09:10,584 --> 01:09:14,199
Almost kills her own grandson with alcohol

1021
01:09:14,199 --> 01:09:15,799
in a wild attempt to take custody.

1022
01:09:15,799 --> 01:09:21,709
Shocking evidence and statements will be released

1023
01:09:21,709 --> 01:09:25,834
to every media outlet tomorrow.

1024
01:09:27,584 --> 01:09:32,359
Do you think a public attack will bother me?

1025
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:35,584
Do you think that's all?

1026
01:09:35,584 --> 01:09:37,159
It's me.

1027
01:09:39,859 --> 01:09:42,134
I'm Jihoo's uncle.

1028
01:09:51,434 --> 01:09:53,359
What?

1029
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,999
Why are you just walking in? Get out!

1030
01:09:55,999 --> 01:10:00,299
We'll be taking Jihoo. We're concerned about domestic violence.

1031
01:10:00,299 --> 01:10:04,334
- What? 
 - Min Kyungsoo, please accompany us back to the station.

1032
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:07,250
Why? Who are you? Get out, get the hell out!

1033
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:12,709
Did you see this mail? Notice of custody change hearing.

1034
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,234
Here.

1035
01:10:15,299 --> 01:10:17,183
I'll just see you in court.

1036
01:10:17,183 --> 01:10:18,583
What?

1037
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:24,459
Oh, I almost forgot.

1038
01:10:24,459 --> 01:10:28,370
A restraining order is in place.

1039
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:32,300
Don't go near Jihoo, you bastard.

1040
01:10:32,309 --> 01:10:34,484
You bastard! Get off me!

1041
01:10:34,484 --> 01:10:37,959
No! My son! My grandson!

1042
01:10:37,959 --> 01:10:39,200
No one is leaving!

1043
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,999
Everyone get out! Bring your superior!

1044
01:10:41,999 --> 01:10:43,459
Shin Hwaja?

1045
01:10:43,459 --> 01:10:47,709
You're under arrest for attempted murder of a minor.

1046
01:10:47,709 --> 01:10:49,509
- What? 
 - Get them out of here.

1047
01:10:49,509 --> 01:10:51,834
Let go of me! Get your hands off me!

1048
01:10:51,834 --> 01:10:53,509
Hey, Wang Joonhyeok! I'm going to kill you!

1049
01:10:53,509 --> 01:10:55,309
Hey!

1050
01:10:55,309 --> 01:10:57,999
Why... You!

1051
01:10:57,999 --> 01:10:59,709
Get off!

1052
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:09,499
 Uncle looked like the world's greatest special agent.

1053
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:16,083
 He threw himself in harms way in order to save me.

1054
01:11:16,709 --> 01:11:20,126
 To me, Uncle was my cool...

1055
01:11:21,183 --> 01:11:23,399
 Superman.

1056
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:34,960

1057
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:10,840

1058
01:12:11,459 --> 01:12:15,459
 If the people don't care, could our case just disappear?

1059
01:12:15,459 --> 01:12:19,751
 No one stands a chance against them.

1060
01:12:19,751 --> 01:12:21,442
 Let go!

1061
01:12:21,442 --> 01:12:23,799
 His signal died at this address.

1062
01:12:23,799 --> 01:12:26,375
 You were right. I should've gotten famous.

1063
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:28,959
 Then she wouldn't have been able to do this to us.

1064
01:12:28,959 --> 01:12:31,042
 We should just begin Plan B.

1065
01:12:31,042 --> 01:12:34,459
 But in case something goes wrong...

1066
01:12:34,459 --> 01:12:35,698
 I'll rescue you.

1067
01:12:35,698 --> 01:12:39,125

We're making sure only invited guests are entering.

1068
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:41,999
 What were you aiming for when you came back to the Momvelies?

1069
01:12:41,999 --> 01:12:43,860
 Why?

1070
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,584
 I'll kill you!

1071
01:12:45,584 --> 01:12:47,317
 You bastard!

1072
01:12:47,317 --> 01:12:49,142
 Please find my uncle.

1073
01:12:49,142 --> 01:12:51,292
 - Stop it right now! 
 - Missing?

1074
01:12:51,292 --> 01:12:54,709
 Open your damn eyes! That isn't dying down!

1075
01:12:54,709 --> 01:12:58,292
 Let's build a fire to force the rabbit out.

1076
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:05,260

1077
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,840
