1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,870

2
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:11,501

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,709

4
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:22,000

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,167

6
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:33,626

7
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:37,830

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,080

9
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:49,959

10
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:54,067
National Survival Music Audition!

11
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:56,642
Super Dream Voice Season 2!

12
00:00:56,642 --> 00:01:00,375
Prize money of 100 million won and a brand new sedan!

13
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:03,918
Who will the lucky winner be?

14
00:01:03,918 --> 00:01:06,667
Now! Let us find out!

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,810

16
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:15,842
Super Dream Voice Season 2!

17
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,199
This season's winner is...

18
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:22,842
The winner is...

19
00:01:22,842 --> 00:01:24,620
Will be!

20
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:28,918
J. King!

21
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,567
 It was a miracle.

22
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:42,509
 The one and only miracle in my life.

23
00:01:45,626 --> 00:01:48,017
Sister! Sister!

24
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:49,626
Sister! Sister!

25
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:51,883
I won!

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,542
But my sister who was like a mother to me...

27
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:05,667

28
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:12,017
 She stole that miracle away from me.

29
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,383
 My unfortunate twisted life...

30
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:20,834
- Wait! 
  - I'm J. King!

31
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:23,000
 Even through all my struggles I was all right.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,125
 Because I was alone. But...

33
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:26,999
Hello?

34
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:28,767
 Hyeok, it's me, your sister.

35
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,126
 She returned to my life.

36
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:33,999
 She came back broken.

37
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:36,734
 Even brought a kid with her.

38
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:38,709
Are you Min Jihoo?

39
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,620

40
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:47,999

41
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,999
Eat up and get rid of the alcohol.

42
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:57,267
- Quit drinking, now! 
 - All right.

43
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:01,999
Oh!  Wow, this is delicious!

44
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:05,284
It's been so long since I've tasted your soup.

45
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:07,667
Your uncle is sweet, he just acts tough.

46
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,584
Are you still drunk? What are you saying?

47
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:12,292
- I didn't even try. 
 - Can you do the groceries?

48
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,459
Can you learn to be modest?

49
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:17,083
Jihoo, I'll be home late.

50
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:20,434
I'll shop for your uncle's necessities. Is that all your luggage?

51
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,459
Yeah.

52
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,025
If kids try to bully you at school about being a renter...

53
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:27,201
Just endure, Jihoo.

54
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,759
Endure? Don't you know it's an eye for an eye?

55
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,592
You messed up, to begin with. You should have been strong.

56
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:36,659
Don't be their prey! Let's do it right this time.

57
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,959
We don't have anywhere to move,

58
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,918
and you chose this school for music, right?

59
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:44,250
So let's own up to it and endure, okay?

60
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,399
Okay.

61
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:50,099
Are you even Joonhee? Own up? Endure?

62
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,899
How'd you change so much?

63
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,299
I don't want his grandmother to find out.

64
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,984
She's capable of anything.

65
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:01,334
So let's just fly under the radar and live a quiet life.

66
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:02,999
A quiet, normal life.

67
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:06,009
If you stay quiet, you think she won't find you?

68
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:08,859
In this day and age, there's no hiding, stupid.

69
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:13,899
Your sister is very smart. I've made preparations, just eat.

70
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:18,084
Great!

71
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:20,267
Hey, hey, hey.

72
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:22,934
What?

73
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,709
- What now? 
 - What's this?

74
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,284
- Where'd you find this? 
 - In my room.

75
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:32,642
Are you pregnant?

76
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:34,459
Is that why you ran away?

77
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:37,099
- Are you kidding me? 
 - Then what's this?

78
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,167
Isn't it yours?

79
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:43,209
There's no way!

80
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,799
- Think about it. 
 - There's nothing to think about, no way.

81
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:49,809
Or not. Maybe the previous renters left it.

82
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:52,334
That's what I thought, too.

83
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:56,542
Who's is it?

84
00:04:56,584 --> 00:05:01,299
Did you see her face and the rude way she talked?

85
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:03,634
All mothers are protective.

86
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:06,384
She was just trying to protect her child.

87
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:09,083
No, being poor made her ferocious.

88
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,099
That's how everything in life is.

89
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:14,609
I'm angrier about the Taekwondo master. How could he send the CCTV to school?

90
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:18,584
Why did the homeroom teacher show it to them in the first place, so annoying.

91
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:23,334
What do you think I should do? Should I file a bullying case?

92
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:25,234
How can that be bullying?

93
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:28,459
Your son sprayed water first, and stole his shoes.

94
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:31,292
If Jihoo's family reports Sechan for theft,

95
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:34,083
it'll bring Gold Momvelies extreme shame.

96
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,899
Aren't you being a bit rude?

97
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:39,999
Hey, if you ruined the party just apologize to her.

98
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:43,083
I'm so sorry.

99
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,259
- I'm sorry it happened on Mingi's... 
 - It's fine.

100
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,883
Things happen when raising children.

101
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:54,499
They're in the same classroom, shouldn't they get along?

102
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:00,484

103
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:14,499
Sechan!

104
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,084
Stop!

105
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,159
Can you change my seat?

106
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:24,034
- Why? 
 - This seat smells...

107
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:26,801
Smells like a renter.

108
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:34,659
That's not true. I can't change the seating now.

109
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:39,334
My little berries, listen up.

110
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:44,459
Everyone must write their dreams in the story book by this week.

111
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:47,459
- Understood? 
  - Yes.

112
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:59,499
Hey, Jihoo, you transferred to do music?

113
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:02,583
Why are you so interested in me?

114
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:05,999
Well, that's too bad.

115
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:08,709
Our school is changing to a normal one.

116
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:12,634
No problem though, you can move schools again.

117
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:25,334
Yeah, the used-stuff blog, I posted the suit.

118
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:32,634
It's not from an outlet. It's an exclusive collaboration with Ducci.

119
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:34,584
Yeah, from a department store.

120
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,350
Discount?

121
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:40,883
Of course! Discounts are the essence of good deals!

122
00:07:40,883 --> 00:07:42,584
How much are you willing to pay?

123
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:46,542
Yeah, just tell me. How much, how much...

124
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:48,442
Yes, yes.

125
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:51,701
What?

126
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:57,209
Sorry but, yeah, okay I... sure, sure.

127
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:00,209
You have a kind voice, I'm losing money on this deal.

128
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:04,759
All right then, I'll see you at Dongsan station, exit 3 in an hour.

129
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,459
All right, thank you.

130
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,975
Okay, it's done!

131
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:19,442
Sorry, I already sold the suit.

132
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:22,292
Hello?

133
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:24,399
Oh, homeroom teacher!

134
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,459
What? Now?

135
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,859
Did something happen to Jihoo?

136
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,459
All right, I'm coming... Right away, yeah...

137
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:34,983
Yeah.

138
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,534
Sorry, it's me again. Can I sell the suit tomorrow?

139
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:49,234
Take it. Now everything will be over.

140
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,134
Jeez... Is this really the only way you solve problems?

141
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:57,209
Just look at the amount. I put in more than you can imagine.

142
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:59,026
Oh, really?

143
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,799
Wow, you sure did.

144
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,734
This meeting was for an apology, right?

145
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:10,634
More like a negotiation. If you take that, nothing happened.

146
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,534
You must give us the CCTV evidence, too.

147
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:15,484
You, Royal Momvely Diamond must be so busy.

148
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:18,584
Apologizing as the leader, arbitrating as the leader...

149
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:21,959
I don't negotiate these matters with money.

150
00:09:23,718 --> 00:09:25,650
How about this?

151
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,009
- Huh? 
 - I'm sure it's new to you.

152
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:35,301
I, am, so, very, sorry.

153
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,483
Give it a try.

154
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,109
I am so sorry.

155
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:45,099
Can't do it? Then the deals off.

156
00:09:45,099 --> 00:09:47,209
I'll see you at the police station.

157
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,750
Why don't you just apologize?

158
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:58,099
If you can't apologize, the police will...

159
00:09:58,099 --> 00:09:59,784
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,867
What?

161
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:07,267
I said I'm sorry. Sorry! Happy?

162
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:10,626
Well done, well done! Don't you feel better?

163
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:12,999
This is what the children should have done yesterday.

164
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:16,609
You didn't have to involve the principal. We're done now?

165
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:20,076
Can you sign this please?

166
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:22,617
Sure. What is this?

167
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:24,334
A memorandum.

168
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:28,259
It states the shoe incident never happened, and will never be spoken of.

169
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:32,209
Too many people go back on their words.

170
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:34,309
Sign it.

171
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:39,000
You people really make a big deal out of things.

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,242
- Sign it. 
 - Sure, let's do it!

173
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,567
Let's see here, I'll sign...

174
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:57,209
I'm used to signing with big letters.

175
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:00,309
You might frame that once I'm famous.

176
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:02,634
Are you kidding me?

177
00:11:11,484 --> 00:11:12,959
Hey, you little...

178
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,683
Jihoo, are you okay? Are you hurt?

179
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:24,299
- Why are you here? 
 - To watch you get bullied.

180
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,309
Still going to endure? Run away?

181
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:30,984
Let it be. Bullies just want a reaction.

182
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:32,899
We should just go to the police.

183
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,484
Why is he wearing a flashy suit? I thought he was jobless.

184
00:11:36,484 --> 00:11:37,899
Exactly!

185
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:41,083
Dressing all fancy while his wife works all day?

186
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,999
I think he only has one cheap suit, he wears it all the time.

187
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,784
Let's just go.

188
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:47,967
Excuse me.

189
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:50,001
Just keep walking.

190
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:54,834
Twice. I wore this twice, okay?

191
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,999
You call this cheap?

192
00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:01,000
You can't even tell that it's an exclusive Ducci collab?

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,992
What now?

194
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:05,318
Sechan, this is a designer!

195
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:07,809
Jeez, what now?

196
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:11,118

197
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,899
Greetings, everyone!

198
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:27,800
Cleared the principal meeting... Everything went well.

199
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,600
My feet are killing me.  Now they feel better.

200
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:36,792
Why'd you leave the socks there?

201
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:39,767
I only wore them once. I'll wear them again.

202
00:12:44,592 --> 00:12:48,009
Hey, besides nuts, what allergies do you have?

203
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:51,492
Where are you going? I asked you a question.

204
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:54,799
To wash my hands. You should, too!

205
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,167
My hands will be washed naturally, when I cut the vegetables.

206
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:00,601
It's fine, go and get some rest.

207
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:57,242
Is that...

208
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:00,167
a booger?

209
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,792
That ramen is new, don't throw it out.

210
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,299
We can mix rice in it for dinner.

211
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,625
What's wrong with you?

212
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:27,725
Why'd you put your mouth on it?

213
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:36,292
Better?

214
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,599
You're freaking me out. We need to talk.

215
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,067
About what?

216
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:48,467
Everyone drinks from the bottle and pick their nose, okay?

217
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,967
They don't stick it under the table.

218
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:54,259
Why are you comparing us with others, to begin with?

219
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,926
Yeah? Let's talk about "us."

220
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,584
We agreed to live together, right?

221
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:05,042
Then why can't you stop frowning once you get back home?

222
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:06,592
Don't you care about the person stuck at home all day?

223
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:08,759
What did you do all day?

224
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,999
How can it be this dirty?

225
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:13,542
I cleaned, did laundry, and the dishes! What's dirty?

226
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:16,442
It's dirty, can't you see?

227
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:25,125
Did I really quit my fishing gig to be treated like this?

228
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,342
Dirty? Yeah, okay fine.

229
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:29,918
Well, I can't live with your dirty attitude.

230
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:34,025
Did I ask to live with you? You're the one that sang about it.

231
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:37,592
Oh, low blow... Low blow.

232
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:41,125
Since I apparently begged to live with you,

233
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:47,809
I guess I have no right to voice my own opinion on anything!

234
00:15:52,392 --> 00:15:53,667
Does he even know? Seriously.

235
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,083
Do you think I just sit around at home all day?

236
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,542
Who am I working so hard for?

237
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,792
Jeez!

238
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:04,376
I can't take this anymore!

239
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,167
You surprised me!

240
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:46,826
- DId you see him? 
 - Who? The guy with the hat?

241
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:47,999
I just saw him, why?

242
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:50,999
He kept trying to punch in our password.

243
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:52,926
Why would he do that...

244
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,092
Lock the door and stay inside!

245
00:16:57,092 --> 00:17:01,399
Don't go, don't go, Uncle! I'm scared!

246
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:05,201
Hey, mister! Mister?

247
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,918
Excuse me? Excuse me?

248
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:11,451
Excuse me! Excuse me! Stop, let's talk.

249
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:14,618
Excuse me? Excuse me?

250
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,492
Excuse me? Excuse me?

251
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,999
Wait!  Why are you running away? Let's just talk.

252
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:26,734
Let's just talk!

253
00:17:26,734 --> 00:17:29,942
Way too fast, I can't get him.

254
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,292
I just want to talk. Why are you running?

255
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:38,167
Why were you trying to get into my home?

256
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:38,999
Take your hat off.

257
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:41,292
Wait! Let me see your face.

258
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,892
I said, why were you trying to get into my home?

259
00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:46,367
Let go of me!

260
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:55,434
Could it be Jihoo's grandmother?

261
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,150
Hey, is this the first time?

262
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:03,499
Was he just a thief?

263
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:07,542
No way, there are better apartments.

264
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:08,999
Then what is it?

265
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:12,142
Could it be a drunk's mistake?

266
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:18,167
You... For once you look like a child.

267
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:22,117
Where's your strong attitude from before?

268
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:25,784
I'm sorry... about earlier.

269
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:27,242
No thanks.

270
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,542

271
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:34,142
No more intentionally hurting feelings with words. Okay?

272
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:35,342
Okay.

273
00:18:35,342 --> 00:18:37,501
No leaving the house after an argument.

274
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:38,834
Okay.

275
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:41,042
Add diminutive suffixes when feelings are hurt.

276
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:42,718
That's childish...

277
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:45,167
I know it is but that way, feelings don't get hurt.

278
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:45,992
All right.

279
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:49,592
Do not shed, pick boogers, or leave bodily traces around.

280
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:52,799
Hey! That's not up to me(sies)! 
  (He's adding the diminutive suffix they just discussed)

281
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,342
Wait 'til you become my age(sies)!

282
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:59,367
If the person you live with hates it, you can make an effort(sies)!

283
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:01,342
Let's take out the suffixes, it's too childish.

284
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:05,218
Where were we? Do not shed bodily...

285
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:08,899
It only applies to communal areas then! Leave personal areas alone. Okay?

286
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,750
Okay.

287
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,699
Uncle, what's in the old box in your room?

288
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:17,017
That's personal, leave it alone.

289
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:20,083
Okay then, all done? High five!

290
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,259
Additionally!

291
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:25,383
Avoid unnecessary touching for hygienic reasons.

292
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:26,667
Okay.

293
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,918

294
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,375
 Don't hurt feelings. Don't leave the house after arguing.

295
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,999
 Do not shed, pick boogers, or leave bodily traces around.

296
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:33,192
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

297
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:40,318
No, it's not that. Noeul asked me to buy it.

298
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:43,442
I'm just not sure how to buy these thigns...

299
00:20:45,818 --> 00:20:49,992
Would you mind helping me?

300
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,899
I see.

301
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:58,117
- Whatever you were doing was weird. 
 - Yeah.

302
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:02,459
Noeul's mother must be busy.

303
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:07,499
I raise her alone. She passed away.

304
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:11,142
Jihoo's uncle didn't mention it?

305
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:15,317
How'd you know?

306
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,501
He told me the truth after we became friendly.

307
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:19,292
What an idiot!

308
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:22,799
Please don't worry. My lips are sealed.

309
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:34,734
It's best to bring her here and have her try them on.

310
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:38,759
This one's normal and moves comfortably.

311
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,742
Buy this for now then bring her here to buy more.

312
00:21:43,742 --> 00:21:45,799
Thank you.

313
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:52,342
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding I created with the neighbors.

314
00:21:52,342 --> 00:21:55,818
You were just trying to help.

315
00:21:55,818 --> 00:21:58,099
Please dont worry about it.

316
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:00,034
Well then.

317
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,750
Have some snacks, my son.

318
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,510

319
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,799
Towards, Gold Momvely: Recommending anonymous blog activity.

320
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,942
Target, Royal Taekwondo Gym.

321
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:32,167
My poor child. Someone gave him head lice.

322
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:36,392
I think it's from the Taekwondo helmets. Please be careful, everyone.

323
00:22:36,392 --> 00:22:40,183
Oh my, that's terrible! Take him to the hospital!

324
00:22:40,183 --> 00:22:42,718
Which Taekwondo gym was it? Please inform us!

325
00:22:42,718 --> 00:22:45,167
Direct naming is prohibited. I'll DM you.

326
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,999
Could it be R_X Taekwondo?

327
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,117
If it is, I have a lot to say about that place, too.

328
00:22:50,117 --> 00:22:53,799
- Mom, I have to tell you something. 
 - I'm busy, later.

329
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:56,899
I heard their van driver smokes in the van!

330
00:22:56,899 --> 00:23:00,592
I would never send my child there.

331
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:02,918
We just destroyed another after-school institute.

332
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:08,899

333
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:12,242
What are you doing? We didn't do anything.

334
00:23:12,242 --> 00:23:16,376
Our driver doesn't smoke but if you want, I'll fire him.

335
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:20,667
Also, we have never had an issue with head lice.

336
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:23,192
Are you implying that we're on a revenge smear campaign?

337
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,700
You should be begging for forgiveness, not making excuses!

338
00:23:28,751 --> 00:23:32,292
After you publicly made my child into a thief?

339
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:36,983
Oh my, don't do that.

340
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:40,899
I'm terribly sorry. I've made a huge mistake.

341
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:45,183
I thought the homeroom teacher should handle the incident.

342
00:23:45,183 --> 00:23:46,701
I'm terribly sorry.

343
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:49,792
- Master. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

344
00:23:51,092 --> 00:23:57,418
How could a couple of allegations affect your business this much?

345
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:04,799
No matter what you do, nothing will change.

346
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:17,942
- Stop before they bully you, too. 
 - They already do.

347
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:21,234
You're lucky, I have to do everything mom says.

348
00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:25,783
How unlucky, I don't have a mom so I can do whatever I want.

349
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:31,217
The orchestra pianist is moving to Canada.

350
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:32,759
His spot will open up.

351
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:37,442
Is the school system change really happening?

352
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:40,618
- Extracurricular activities all gone? 
 - Not certain yet.

353
00:24:40,618 --> 00:24:44,767
The moms are trying hard, so their kids can study all the time.

354
00:24:53,818 --> 00:24:57,025
You figured out my peanut allergy?

355
00:24:57,025 --> 00:25:01,817
What do you mean? Nuts are very good for you.

356
00:25:01,817 --> 00:25:05,526
Hey! Giving him nuts is the same as attempted murder!

357
00:25:05,526 --> 00:25:07,567
Why do you always butt in?

358
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:09,399
You're ugly.

359
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:11,492
Park Sechan!

360
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:22,899
What's wrong with him.

361
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:25,884
Hello, Master.

362
00:25:25,884 --> 00:25:27,867
- Hello. 
 - Is there something wrong?

363
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:31,776
I was actually going to contact you...

364
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:34,734
- Me? 
 - Let me show you something.

365
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,400
Sechan, how'd you find out about Jihoo's allergy?

366
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:43,799
- I didn't know. 
 - You didn't know?

367
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:47,492
Where'd you get the peanuts?

368
00:25:47,492 --> 00:25:49,642
Answer me, Sechan.

369
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,899
Sechan has a Taekwondo test soon, he's angry he can't go.

370
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:57,492
How could the kids understand.

371
00:25:57,492 --> 00:26:00,192
We just have to guide them properly.

372
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,400
- Wow, this place is nice! It's my first time here. 
 - Hello.

373
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:07,417
What're you doing? You can't just come in here!

374
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:09,542
Here? It's a community center.

375
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:12,167
A place for residents. Renters are residents, too.

376
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,900
- Doesn't matter, it's our space! 
 - Really?

377
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,500
- Get out, now! 
 - You can't make up your own rules!

378
00:26:20,518 --> 00:26:23,999
Oh! Is that why you're Momvelies?

379
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,567
Jihoo's father? What can I help you with?

380
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:29,217
- Oh, there you are. 
 - He smells!

381
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:31,959
I just wanted to show you something.

382
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:34,942
Here it is, please wait.

383
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,942
- Hey! What're you doing? 
 - What?

384
00:26:43,942 --> 00:26:49,692
Don't we have a written agreement not to speak of that?

385
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:54,667
We did. But that was before I found out about something.

386
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,650
Now, shall we begin here?

387
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:13,099
Mingi ordered Sechan to do it!

388
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,776
Hey! Stop lying! Don't bring me into this!

389
00:27:15,776 --> 00:27:19,518
I saw you going through the files on Teacher's desk!

390
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:23,467
How is that evidence that I did it?

391
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:25,809
Say something!

392
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:34,559
Is it true that Mingi told you to give Jihoo peanuts?

393
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:46,826
Sechan, answer me.

394
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:50,842
I always thought Sechan was bullying Jihoo on his own.

395
00:27:50,842 --> 00:27:55,942
Then I found out that a real boss monster was behind all of it.

396
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:02,742
Aren't you a two-faced diamond?

397
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:03,992
So what?

398
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:07,899
I heard you ran the Taekwondo gym out of business.

399
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:11,176
If you saw the full footage, you would have done worse.

400
00:28:11,176 --> 00:28:17,392
When we signed the deal, did you know Mingi made Sechan steal the shoes?

401
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:23,792
- I didn't know. 
 - Hey! Who ordered who?

402
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:27,242
They're best friends being loyal to each other.

403
00:28:27,242 --> 00:28:30,099
Loyal? Oh, that's what loyalty is.

404
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:31,799
Just like their mothers.

405
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:35,684
Bestfriends doing bad things and hurting others.

406
00:28:35,684 --> 00:28:37,292
Watch your mouth!

407
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:42,150
I heard the Momvelies are infamous for bullying people around.

408
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:46,442
Ruining shops and after-school academies if you don't like them.

409
00:28:46,442 --> 00:28:50,334
Ruining someone's life is easy for you, right?

410
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:52,399
What do you want to do?

411
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,067
Do you want to apologize sincerely?

412
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,384
Or be charged with theft?

413
00:29:07,342 --> 00:29:11,299
I'm sorry. Is that enough?

414
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:13,942
Why are you apologizing to him!

415
00:29:13,942 --> 00:29:17,499
You have your apology, now leave.

416
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:27,967
He smells!

417
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:32,617
Sechan didn't even buy the peanuts, it was Mingi.

418
00:29:32,617 --> 00:29:36,359
- So? 
 - Ma'am, this is a serious issue.

419
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,192
This was too dangerous to be considered a prank.

420
00:29:39,192 --> 00:29:41,799
You should apologize to Jihoo's parents.

421
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:44,192
I'll arrange for Sechan and Mingi to...

422
00:29:44,192 --> 00:29:46,699
- Teacher Hwaeum Song? 
 - Yes?

423
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:51,818
Just focus on the children's studies, and mind your own business.

424
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:55,818
Do you understand what I'm saying?

425
00:29:55,818 --> 00:29:57,692
Ma'am.

426
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:17,199
So, what happened then?

427
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:20,934
Is Jihoo all right?

428
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:23,251
How could they do such a thing...

429
00:30:23,251 --> 00:30:25,599
All right, let's talk again.

430
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:37,900
Boss, do you mind if I leave work early today?

431
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,109
- All right. 
 - Thank you.

432
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:42,199
Something happened to my child.

433
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:46,651
We barely have any customers, take care of your child.

434
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:49,792
And don't come back again.

435
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:57,134
- Excuse me? 
 - People are afraid you might poison or spit in the food.

436
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,459
What are you saying? Who would say such horrible things?

437
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:07,151
Who do you think? Why'd you piss off the Momvelies?

438
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:10,067
They're the reason we don't have customers.

439
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:16,199
I can't help you. Look for another job.

440
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:23,442
But once you're a target, no one will hire you.

441
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:51,101
Excuse me, Miss!

442
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:01,434
The kid that bullies you is...

443
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:03,999
Mingi, right? Sechan is just the front?

444
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:06,259
How'd you know?

445
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:11,099
Kids and adults are the same.

446
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:14,799
Did anything happen today?

447
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:19,184
- Mom. 
 - Did you eat it?

448
00:32:19,184 --> 00:32:20,799
I fed him.

449
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,234
Did you eat the peanuts? I heard they tried to make you eat them.

450
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,899
Are you okay?

451
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:29,459
Yeah, I'm fine. It's nothing, don't worry.

452
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:32,259
- What happened? 
 - All right, forget it.

453
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:34,401
Forget what!

454
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:37,083
You said nothing happened!

455
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,999
Those evil women!

456
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,459
- What're you going to do? 
 - I don't know!

457
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,999
Your kid almost died. We can't do nothing!

458
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:45,634
- Leave it. 
 - Leave it?

459
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:46,983
Why are you scared of them?

460
00:32:46,983 --> 00:32:51,199
For one, they just got me fired from Cook Mom.

461
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:54,584
- What? 
 - Why would I be afraid of those evil women?

462
00:32:54,584 --> 00:32:55,734
They aren't scary.

463
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:58,234
A truck full of them wouldn't scare me!

464
00:32:58,234 --> 00:33:01,859
- Then what's stopping you? 
 - You want to fight again?

465
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:04,234
- Cause a scene, get the police involved? 
 - Why not!

466
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:07,134
Then what if Jihoo's grandmother finds us!

467
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:12,099
That's the only thing I'm afraid of.

468
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:15,559
Jihoo getting sent back to that hell hole.

469
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:17,934
That's why we're taking it.

470
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,934
Mom.

471
00:33:31,934 --> 00:33:34,083
What? Looking for drinks?

472
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:36,334
What turned you into this?

473
00:33:36,334 --> 00:33:39,083
Just get me a bottle. Just one.

474
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,484
What made you into this!

475
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:50,334
Jihoo's grandmother...

476
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:54,134
fed Jihoo drugs.

477
00:33:54,999 --> 00:34:01,083
She didn't want him sleeping until he passed the academic level test.

478
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:04,559
When she found out he studied music,

479
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,209
do you know how much she beat him?

480
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:08,251
You let that happen to him?

481
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:10,999
What about you?

482
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:13,334
Your his mother, why didn't you do something!

483
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:15,859
Of course, I did! They beat me, too!

484
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:19,599
They broke my bones and didn't even let me go to the hospital!

485
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:23,309
I endured the pain with alcohol, and now I'm addicted.

486
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:26,459
Hey!

487
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:28,459
I had a bottle here...

488
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,759
- Stop. 
 - Move.

489
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:31,999
- Stop. 
 - I said move!

490
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:35,184
- Stop. 
 - You can go now!

491
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:41,583
Mom, if something hurts, you can go to the hospital now.

492
00:34:47,283 --> 00:34:49,234
So let's go together.

493
00:34:49,234 --> 00:34:51,799
You must be hurt somewhere.

494
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:55,718
Doctors can help you now.

495
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:59,083
Don't cry... I'm sorry.

496
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:01,799
I swear I won't drink.

497
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:05,384
You can't do it alone. Let's go to the hospital.

498
00:35:05,384 --> 00:35:07,899
How can I do that?

499
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:10,109
They'll put me in rehab.

500
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:12,859
How could you live without me?

501
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:15,334
It's so that I don't have to live without you.

502
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:19,292
I'm afraid I'll lose you forever.

503
00:35:27,899 --> 00:35:29,675
I'm so sorry.

504
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:45,109
Take my medicine, do my homework, and eat healthily,

505
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:48,899
call you frequently, and send you many pictures.

506
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:49,999
That's it?

507
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:53,899
Don't scratch itches, use lotion. Drink a lot of water.

508
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:58,634
Your inhalers and hand wash is in my top drawer.

509
00:36:09,899 --> 00:36:12,317
He might act mature, but he's still a baby.

510
00:36:12,317 --> 00:36:15,167
He has tics, panic attacks, and depression.

511
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:16,234
He has to take his medication.

512
00:36:16,234 --> 00:36:17,275
All right.

513
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,359
I left some money on the dining table.

514
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,484
Only buy eco-friendly ingredients.

515
00:36:21,484 --> 00:36:25,234
You know all his allergies? Don't give him instant food.

516
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:26,334
All right.

517
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:30,484
He cries at night because of nightmares...

518
00:36:30,484 --> 00:36:33,234
Make sure to dry his sheets in the sunlight.

519
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:39,999
If he scratches, it'll leave a scar, you have to use sterile gauze.

520
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:43,334
You have to submit a document to attend the class meeting.

521
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,209
And if kids bully him again...

522
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:48,434
I got it, just get in.

523
00:36:51,484 --> 00:36:53,059
Goodbye!

524
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:19,559
He's just like you.

525
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:25,809
Every time I was adopted and you weren't allowed to come.

526
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:29,499
My heart sank, just like now.

527
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:33,317
But you were just like him.

528
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:37,001
You just quickly turned and walked away.

529
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:40,550
Are you dumb?

530
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:44,251
He doesn't want you to see him crying.

531
00:38:00,101 --> 00:38:02,383

532
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:09,999
 Just focus on the children's studies, and mind your own business.

533
00:38:22,209 --> 00:38:23,999

534
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:25,959

535
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:35,183
Jeez, do those women have no shame?

536
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:38,234
Don't they have better things to do?

537
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:43,509
I had a hard time raising Yeonjoo all by myself, too.

538
00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:46,301
I suffered from the worse rumors!

539
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:48,983
How her mother ran off during the night!

540
00:38:48,983 --> 00:38:52,334
How her father is a crossdressing barkeep!

541
00:38:52,334 --> 00:38:53,759
That's a fact.

542
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:56,709
Those aren't rumors, they're facts.

543
00:38:57,609 --> 00:38:59,484
- I guess so. 
 - Yeah.

544
00:38:59,484 --> 00:39:03,459
Anyways, don't even bother responding to them.

545
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:07,083
Like your sister said, what if his grandmother finds him!

546
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:09,509
Everything is screwed then!

547
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:13,799
Yes, Teacher.

548
00:39:13,799 --> 00:39:15,899
- Teacher? 
 - Teacher?

549
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:18,083
My teacher wants to meet me right now.

550
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:21,009
Where? I can't drive. I had a couple drinks.

551
00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:23,983
- Tell her to come here! 
 - I can't do that!

552
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:26,759
- Yeah, just tell her to come. 
 - Here, let me!

553
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:30,359
- Hello,  Teacher, we're at... 
 - Stop, stop it!

554
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:32,083
Yeah, if you just cross the road...

555
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,183
Hold on!

556
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:41,083
I didn't know the kids saw the health reports.

557
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:45,059
With this and the whole shoe incident...

558
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:47,284
I'm sorry that I let all these things happen.

559
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,434
No, it's fine.

560
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:51,183
- I'm sorry, Jihoo. 
 - It's okay.

561
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:54,999
If anything bad happens again, don't hide it from me.

562
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:56,899
Please tell me everything.

563
00:39:56,899 --> 00:39:59,109
I'll do my best to help you.

564
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:00,734
Okay.

565
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:03,459
I won't let this incident go.

566
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:07,334
I'll have Sechan and Mingi sent to the counselor.

567
00:40:07,334 --> 00:40:10,442
Are you sure? What about the Momvelies?

568
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:12,850
It's my responsibility.

569
00:40:13,484 --> 00:40:20,159
Teacher, is our school going to become a normal school?

570
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:24,484
Not yet, but it might turn out that way.

571
00:40:24,484 --> 00:40:27,334
Then what will happen? He can't study music anymore?

572
00:40:27,334 --> 00:40:31,099
If it isn't an autonomous school, then sadly yes.

573
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:35,509
This family moved here for this. How can they do whatever they want?

574
00:40:35,509 --> 00:40:38,899
I even saw that they had a congressman to support them.

575
00:40:38,899 --> 00:40:42,759
- Can't you stop this? 
 - Those mothers have a lot of influence...

576
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:47,599
But still, we're doing the best we can. Well...

577
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:50,083
I should leave now.

578
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:53,609
Leaving already? Do you want a drink?

579
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:57,083
Can I cook a meal for you? I'm a really good cook.

580
00:40:57,083 --> 00:41:00,559
My uncle's food is the best.

581
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:04,109
Should I?

582
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:11,509
Pretty teacher, did you know?

583
00:41:11,509 --> 00:41:15,009
J. King has been coming here for 10 years,

584
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:17,934
and you're his first female guest!

585
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:18,959
Really?

586
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:22,599
Because I was the one and only female in his life.

587
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:29,083
I am J. King's ex-girlfriend.

588
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:31,834
Oh, hello.

589
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:34,092
Sorry for the long wait!

590
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:38,183
There wasn't much to work with in the kitchen.

591
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:41,259
- Please enjoy! 
 - Thank you, Jihoo.

592
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:44,899
- Thank you! 
 - It's not much but enjoy.

593
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:51,359
All right!

594
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,418
Is there something between you two?

595
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:58,859
Oh my, how could I... It's not like that.

596
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:02,083
- Hey, how dare you be so... 
 - Nevermind, she's not your type.

597
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,384
She totally is my type!

598
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:07,959
No, she isn't. You like pretty and dumb like me.

599
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:11,609
Can't be dumb if she's a teacher.

600
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:15,909
- Thank you for the compliment. 
 - Did I compliment you?

601
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:20,359
But didn't we meet for the first time today?

602
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:21,334
So?

603
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:26,734
Would the way you speak be considered respectful, or not?

604
00:42:26,734 --> 00:42:30,584
If you got a problem, just speak as I do.

605
00:42:30,584 --> 00:42:33,359
You're an old man style? I'm American-style.

606
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,434
You've never been to America.

607
00:42:36,434 --> 00:42:38,899
I've been to Guam! That's also America!

608
00:42:38,899 --> 00:42:40,983
I only drink Americanos, too.

609
00:42:40,983 --> 00:42:42,459
- I know. 
 - But...

610
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,859
If you're an ex-girlfriend, that means you broke up?

611
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:49,083
No, I dumped him. I have a new lover.

612
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:50,199
He's a doctor.

613
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:53,959
Then why do I feel like you want me to be uncomfortable?

614
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:57,999
Uncomfortable? No. I'm super comfortable.

615
00:42:57,999 --> 00:43:00,200
Don't act like you know me, book bug.

616
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,359
- Bookworm. 
 - Oh, bookworm.

617
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,417
Thanks, how sweet of you.

618
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,759
I like you. You want to be my homie?

619
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:11,200
You mean, do I want to be your friend?

620
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,025
Just eat your food, old man.

621
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:15,759
I don't like your style.

622
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:25,099

623
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:26,626
Hello.

624
00:43:26,626 --> 00:43:28,250
Hello, Noeul's father!

625
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,099
- Going to the class meeting? 
 - Yeah.

626
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:36,250
Jihoo's mother quit her job, and she doesn't call back.

627
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,375
Is something wrong?

628
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:41,809
Why do you need to contact her?

629
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:44,250
Are you interested in my sister?

630
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:48,025
Yes... Is that a problem?

631
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:52,959
No, no problem.

632
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:56,851
Look at you! A manly man!

633
00:43:56,851 --> 00:43:59,501
- Just a man. 
 - Wow, look at these...

634
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:01,725
I didn't even flex it.

635
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:08,175
Today, I will explain how to withdraw our autonomous system.

636
00:44:08,175 --> 00:44:11,651
Teacher, you don't have to stay for this.

637
00:44:11,651 --> 00:44:14,876
It's fine, I should be here for a class meeting.

638
00:44:14,876 --> 00:44:16,417
Do as you please.

639
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:19,526
While we're here, please sign this agreement.

640
00:44:19,526 --> 00:44:23,950
Our Diamond will work closely with the Ministry of Education.

641
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:29,042
Our children struggle at last place in their studies

642
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,818
after graduating from this elementary school.

643
00:44:31,818 --> 00:44:36,676
We cannot compete with Gangnam with this free-spirited schooling system.

644
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:39,567
For our children to survive in the Seongjak district,

645
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:43,584
We must bring the Seongjak district's standards up to Gangnam's.

646
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:45,251
Exactly.

647
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:50,300
Excuse me.

648
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:55,125
Some students are here for the music.

649
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:59,301
Music should be a hobby, or send the child to a music academy.

650
00:44:59,301 --> 00:45:05,150
Students should focus on studies, not extracurricular activities.

651
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:09,342
If you don't like the food,

652
00:45:09,342 --> 00:45:11,626
shoudn't you go to a different restaurant?

653
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:16,801
Why are you like this these days? Everything is for Noeul.

654
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:19,501
Which part exactly, is for Noeul?

655
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:22,751
Do you know what Noeul wants?

656
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:26,799
We should tell them. What do children know.

657
00:45:26,799 --> 00:45:29,551
Excuse me, everyone.

658
00:45:29,551 --> 00:45:34,200
Today's agenda will be sorted through a bluebird vote.

659
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,999
Sodam's mother took the vacant position, but

660
00:45:37,999 --> 00:45:40,626
I think we should be taking a vote today.

661
00:45:40,626 --> 00:45:44,375
The substitute bluebird should just do it, why vote for a new one?

662
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:48,551
Maybe the teacher has a problem since we never voted on it.

663
00:45:48,551 --> 00:45:51,700
Let's take a vote then.

664
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:56,384
Umm, what's a "bluebird"?

665
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:01,676
How can a parent be so oblivious? So annoying.

666
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:05,201
It's like a classroom rep, but for parents.

667
00:46:05,201 --> 00:46:06,799
Like a class leader?

668
00:46:06,799 --> 00:46:09,799
Why? Do you want to have a go?

669
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:11,199
Huh?

670
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:16,950
Sure, give it a shot! It could be fun!

671
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:20,475
No thank you. You will all find ways to embarrass me.

672
00:46:20,475 --> 00:46:24,800
Do you think anyone will actually vote for you?

673
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,826
Why don't you try? You never know.

674
00:46:29,826 --> 00:46:31,125
A miracle might happen.

675
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:35,851
Why not? Let's enjoy some friendly competition.

676
00:46:35,851 --> 00:46:39,575
Are you sure it'll be fair? Fair?

677
00:46:39,575 --> 00:46:43,699
If I win, will you accept the results?

678
00:46:46,899 --> 00:46:49,350
He's actually worried.

679
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:51,626
- Add him to the nominees? 
 - Should I?

680
00:46:51,626 --> 00:46:54,851
It's a vote against me and you.

681
00:46:54,851 --> 00:46:59,250
We'll vote in the group chat, the majority wins. Got it?

682
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,676
I think it'll be 25 to 0.

683
00:47:00,676 --> 00:47:04,250
No way! I'm sure he'll vote for himself.

684
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,426
So 24 to 1.

685
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,899
Yeah, let's do it. Add me to the list.

686
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:16,300
Yup.

687
00:47:19,826 --> 00:47:23,826
Why didn't you stop me. Why? why?

688
00:47:23,826 --> 00:47:26,442
This is going to be so embarrassing.

689
00:47:26,442 --> 00:47:29,999
You looked so confident, I thought you had a plan.

690
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:32,999
They were making fun of me, so I just reacted...

691
00:47:32,999 --> 00:47:36,884
Whatever. I'm just going to text the group chat that I'm out.

692
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,225
You should try for Jihoo.

693
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:43,101
Don't you want to save the school system?

694
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:44,999
Is the bluebird that powerful?

695
00:47:44,999 --> 00:47:50,501
Yes, sure. You can participate in school activities and have a vote for important decisions.

696
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:51,501
Yeah, try.

697
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:55,475
I disagree with the changes, I'll support you. Let's try.

698
00:47:55,475 --> 00:47:59,250
We can try but who would even vote for me?

699
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:04,200
Half want to eat my guts out, and I don't know the other half.

700
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,776
You won first place on national TV.

701
00:48:06,776 --> 00:48:10,600
Did you know everyone who voted for you then?

702
00:48:11,899 --> 00:48:13,526
I didn't know anyone.

703
00:48:13,526 --> 00:48:18,501
Back then, when I saw J. King progressing step by step,

704
00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:22,899
I saw his power of moving people's hearts.

705
00:48:25,242 --> 00:48:28,375
- Did I? 
 - Of course!

706
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:32,501
Nothing can defeat honesty.

707
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:37,799

The bluebird can make important decisions.

725
00:49:46,899 --> 00:49:50,325
Then I can protect the autonomous system, protect your music!

726

That's if you win.

I'll lose for sure, for sure!

729
00:49:57,401 --> 00:49:59,099
Unless you help me.

730
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:01,601
Listen carefully, I'm serious.

731
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:06,200
I'm determined to die if I lose the bluebird position.

 - Just answer me, are you going to help?

Are you going to help? Or not!

 - I don't have that kind of money. You know I'm broke.

737
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,250
- I saw it in your wallet.

Okay! Let's do it! Let's bluebird!

747
00:50:57,626 --> 00:50:59,667
A school free from evaluation!

748
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:01,959
I will abolish academic placing testing!

749
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:04,799
Like a warm hug, on the way to class.

750
00:51:06,751 --> 00:51:07,999
10 to 1?

751
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:10,800
I guess he already voted for himself.

752
00:51:11,676 --> 00:51:13,250
You already have 10 votes.

753
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,876
You just need 3 more, then it's over.

754
00:51:17,676 --> 00:51:21,125
Someone just voted, It's now 10 to 2.

755
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:23,667
What? Let me see.

756
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,751
What? It just became 10 to 3.

757
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:31,000
What's this? Free drinks?

759
00:51:57,876 --> 00:52:00,175
They're actually enjoying this?

760
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:01,999

761
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:05,250
Are the moms crazy? How can they be seduced so easily?

762
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,375
- Sis! 
 - Sister!

763
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:09,999
Jihoo's father has a talent for embarrassing our neighborhood!

764
00:52:09,999 --> 00:52:11,751
They'll have 5 votes at most.

765
00:52:11,751 --> 00:52:15,250
Even 5 votes feel disrespectful.

766
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,301
What?

767
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:18,125
He's already at 6.

768
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:20,751
Wait, how? What is he doing now?

769
00:52:28,751 --> 00:52:30,083
Bottoms up!

770
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:31,501
Cheers!

771

772
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:35,999
Did he seriously print this?

773
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:38,501
Is he running for congress?

774
00:52:38,501 --> 00:52:41,999
What if he actually wins, and becomes the bluebird?

775
00:52:41,999 --> 00:52:46,899

 - That'll cause many problems.

Correct!

792
00:53:46,999 --> 00:53:48,334
- Omaggi! 
 - Rice cake!

793
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:50,125
What? Rice cake?

794
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:53,250

But don't repeat what you see, it's dangerous!

808

You're fine. Don't be nervous.

00:54:42,751 --> 00:54:43,709
How pretty!

813
00:54:43,709 --> 00:54:44,751
How about this one?

814
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:46,334
It's pearl, rub it.

815
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:48,092
Tada!

816
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:55,299
Just wait a bit.

817
00:54:55,299 --> 00:54:57,199

818
00:55:04,751 --> 00:55:08,450
You like music right? Do you listen to K-pop?

819
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:11,226
Yeah, I listen to everything.

820
00:55:12,551 --> 00:55:15,999
Do you know who this is?

821
00:55:16,999 --> 00:55:19,776
Oh! It's JUST BE.

822
00:55:19,776 --> 00:55:23,799
I knew you'd know! I love them.

823
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:28,375
I heard they're having a fan meet-up, I really want to go.

824
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:32,876
Look, he's my favorite. His name is Mappu?

825
00:55:33,501 --> 00:55:35,899
You look just like him.

826
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:38,625
You look like him! You see it right?

827
00:55:39,409 --> 00:55:41,699
Can I see more?

828
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:44,999
Just think! If something were to happen to your child!

829
00:55:44,999 --> 00:55:48,999
Who would be able to help you? The Momvelies? Or Jihoo's father?

830
00:55:48,999 --> 00:55:49,999
Momvelies!

831
00:55:49,999 --> 00:55:52,667
Can you trust him with your child?

832
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:54,526
I won't say it twice, ladies and gentlemen!

833
00:55:54,526 --> 00:55:56,375
If you vote me as your bluebird,

834
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:58,000
I will be your trustworthy...

835
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Once a month...

836
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,225
Bluebird!

837
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:03,899
...we can party like today!

838
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:07,226
I will do my best!

839
00:56:07,226 --> 00:56:09,150

840
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:11,099
Let's go! Let's go!

841
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:13,899

842
00:56:13,899 --> 00:56:15,399
Ouch!

843
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,501
Isn't this a bit too much?

844
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,651
Then what? You have any better ideas?

845
00:56:22,651 --> 00:56:24,650
My husband will hate this.

846
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,701
Why isn't Sodam's mom here? How can she miss this?

847
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:30,076
Hey, Sodam's mom. Where are you?

848
00:56:30,076 --> 00:56:32,426
Oh, sister...

849
00:56:32,426 --> 00:56:34,626
I'm completely losing my mind!

850
00:56:34,626 --> 00:56:37,250
Sodam missed all her afterschool classes, she disappeared!

851
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:41,450
I'm looking for her but she won't answer the phone!

852
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,450
She must be at home.

853
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:48,709
But, if you don't focus on this, Momvelies will be embarrassed, do you understand?

854
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:50,709
You can't lose to him.

855
00:56:50,709 --> 00:56:53,417
Excuse me, Teacher. Have you seen Sodam?

856
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:55,699
I haven't seen her.

857
00:56:56,899 --> 00:57:01,918
Sis, can you ask the group chat if they've seen Sodam?

858
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,951
I can't believe it's down to the last vote!

859
00:57:04,951 --> 00:57:07,301
Do senior citizen's have a vote?

860
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:10,626
When did we ever think ahead!

861
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:12,250
Just look at our votes!

862
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:13,167
Listen to what your teacher said.

863
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:17,876
I have the power to move people's hearts!

864
00:57:17,899 --> 00:57:21,375
Our finale is for our lonely senior citizens!

865
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:24,999
Hit them with a powerful song!

866
00:57:24,999 --> 00:57:28,876
- What's wrong? 
 - My phone's just on vibrate.

867
00:57:28,876 --> 00:57:33,301
What's all the fuss in the group chat?

868
00:57:33,301 --> 00:57:36,417
What? Sodam disappeared?

869
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:38,651
- Disappeared? 
 - Yeah.

870
00:57:38,651 --> 00:57:44,526
Where'd she go? Her mom is terrified!

871
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,509
This is our chance!

872
00:57:48,509 --> 00:57:50,301
God gave us this chance!

873
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:55,025
While they're busy looking for her, we secure the last vote!

874
00:57:55,025 --> 00:57:58,375
Okay? Go, go, go, go! Come on!

875
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:00,125
What are you waiting for?

876
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:01,999
- Uncle. 
 - Yeah?

877
00:58:01,999 --> 00:58:05,699
I think I know where she is.

878
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:07,951
Yeah?

879
00:58:09,225 --> 00:58:12,150
Oh, then we should tell her parents.

880
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:15,584
But I'm not completely sure.

881
00:58:15,584 --> 00:58:17,401
What do you want me to do?

882
00:58:17,401 --> 00:58:19,999
Can we go look for her?

883
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:24,676
Why should we? We don't have time!

884
00:58:24,676 --> 00:58:28,800
We can't worry about her! We've got one vote left!

885
00:58:31,501 --> 00:58:33,967
Don't look at me with those eyes.

886
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,100
Was all this for nothing?

887
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:42,500
What if something bad happens to her?

888
00:58:48,876 --> 00:58:50,125
- Hello! 
 - Hello.

889
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:51,618
- What's your name? 
 - Sodam.

890
00:58:51,618 --> 00:58:54,125
Sodam? How old are you?

891
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:56,626
- I'm 12! 
 - 12, I see.

892
00:58:56,626 --> 00:58:59,051
- I love your music! 
 - Really?

893
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,301
Yeah, the TW center entrance.

894
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:16,275
I don't know if it's the front or back.

895
00:59:16,275 --> 00:59:18,375
Oh, I see you! Go straight!

896
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:19,799
I'm sorry.

897
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:23,209
Everyone was so worried. I had no choice.

898
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:27,959
I knew I would get in trouble. It's okay, I met Mappu.

899
00:59:27,959 --> 00:59:32,200
Thanks for worrying, and coming to get me.

900
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,751
All right, all right!

901
00:59:33,751 --> 00:59:35,876
All right, park!

902
00:59:35,876 --> 00:59:39,276
Park here, park!

903
00:59:40,501 --> 00:59:42,375
You, come here! You!

904
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:45,292
Are you crazy? Come here!

905
00:59:45,292 --> 00:59:48,999
It hurts! Let go of me, let go!

906
00:59:48,999 --> 00:59:50,999
How could you do this to me?

907
00:59:50,999 --> 00:59:53,651
How could you come here without telling anyone!

908
00:59:53,651 --> 00:59:55,250
I wanted to tell you!

909
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:58,000
I tried to tell you! But you never listen!

910
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,542
Are you trying to embarrass me!

911
01:00:00,542 --> 01:00:02,834
You're out on the street! Get in the car!

912
01:00:02,834 --> 01:00:04,375
- Just come! 
 - Mom!

913
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:08,200
Don't be so strict. All kids are a bit wild these days.

914
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:13,326
You! Don't you tell anyone about this! Or else!

915
01:00:15,325 --> 01:00:19,409
Where should we sit? Wait, you're leaving us?

916
01:00:19,409 --> 01:00:22,125
We took a taxi here! Wait for us!

917
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:24,876
Jeez... Wait...

918
01:00:24,876 --> 01:00:29,426
Where's my wallet... I didn't bring my card...

919
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:37,292
Aren't you too young to chase boys!

920
01:00:37,292 --> 01:00:39,792
Did you take after your mother? What are you wearing!

921
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:41,384
Is that makeup?

922
01:00:41,384 --> 01:00:42,899
That's sleezy!

923
01:00:42,899 --> 01:00:44,626
Watch what you say to her!

924
01:00:44,626 --> 01:00:47,900
Where the hell were you when our child went missing!

925
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,459
I went to the hospital to see if I can give you a son!

926
01:00:50,459 --> 01:00:52,899
Isn't that the only way we can move to Gangnam?

927
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,325
How dare you stare back at me! Do you want to die!

928
01:00:55,325 --> 01:00:57,517
- Just stop! 
 - I said be quiet!

929
01:00:57,517 --> 01:01:00,526
Are you crazy? She's a child!

930
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:03,426
What're you doing out in public!

931
01:01:05,951 --> 01:01:10,025
Sodam, where'd you go? Wow, did you do makeup?

932
01:01:11,726 --> 01:01:14,201
Sodam! Sodam's mother!

933
01:01:14,201 --> 01:01:16,751
Did you forget about the bluebird votes?

934
01:01:16,751 --> 01:01:18,667
I'm aware, just let me go.

935
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:20,325
- Sodam! 
 - She's going home just fine.

936
01:01:20,325 --> 01:01:21,999
This last vote is very important! Let's go!

937
01:01:21,999 --> 01:01:24,876
Yeah, we don't have time for this. It's very serious.

938
01:01:24,876 --> 01:01:27,401
Stop!

939
01:01:27,401 --> 01:01:29,375
You guys are ruthless!

940
01:01:29,375 --> 01:01:32,175
Is the bluebird more important than my child?

941
01:01:33,409 --> 01:01:35,075
Sodam!

942
01:01:58,325 --> 01:02:02,201
How cruel... So cruel...

943
01:02:02,201 --> 01:02:07,126
I can't believe he let us off, right at 4,800 Won.

944
01:02:07,899 --> 01:02:10,551
How can an adult have less than 10,000 Won?

945
01:02:10,551 --> 01:02:12,725
I had 14,000 Won!

946
01:02:12,725 --> 01:02:16,000
We took a taxi to find Sodam remember?

947
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,217
I'm broke now.

948
01:02:18,217 --> 01:02:21,242
How can you say that to me?

949
01:02:21,242 --> 01:02:25,950
How are you complaining? We lost everything!

950
01:02:27,617 --> 01:02:31,975
Do you know how hard I tried to become the bluebird?

951
01:02:37,699 --> 01:02:40,140
Even left the lights on?

952
01:02:48,626 --> 01:02:50,725
Oh, my legs...

953
01:02:54,399 --> 01:02:56,100
So tiring...

954
01:02:57,501 --> 01:03:00,351
Let's not talk today.

955
01:03:13,876 --> 01:03:15,800
Should we...

956
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,680
eat some instant noodles?

957
01:03:35,559 --> 01:03:38,376
- I'm sorry. 
 - About what?

958
01:03:38,376 --> 01:03:43,300
You lost the last vote because of me.

959
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,542
Uncle, you worked really hard.

960
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:50,399
I honestly feel terrible.

961
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:53,250
Hey, look.

962
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,799
If we left Sodam and got the last vote,

963
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:59,799
don't you think we'd feel terrible?

964
01:03:59,799 --> 01:04:02,150
You did the right thing. Super romantic by the way.

965
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:06,401
- Musicians must be romantic. 
 - That's right! Wait!

966
01:04:06,401 --> 01:04:08,940
Let me get more kimchi.

967
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,899
- Uncle. 
 - Yeah?

968
01:04:16,899 --> 01:04:19,301
- We haven't lost yet. 
 - What do you mean?

969
01:04:19,301 --> 01:04:20,899
It's still a tie!

970
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,292
12 to 12.

971
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,626
Seriously?

972
01:04:25,626 --> 01:04:29,325
Wait, what time is it! I can't just sit here!

973
01:04:29,325 --> 01:04:31,401
Finish up eating and wash the plates!

974
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:35,199
Who's vote could it be?

975
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:37,192
Who's that?

976
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:44,999
Oh, how can I help you?

977
01:04:58,826 --> 01:05:02,384
Thank you so much for today.

978
01:05:08,526 --> 01:05:10,699
What? No way!

979
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:13,076
Sis, did you see this?

980
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:14,367
Did we lose?

981
01:05:14,367 --> 01:05:19,110
No... No way... Sis, what sh... What do we do?

982
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,999
Unnecessary touching!

983
01:05:40,676 --> 01:05:42,983
I won.

984
01:05:42,983 --> 01:05:45,220
I won!

985
01:05:49,799 --> 01:05:52,120
 It was a miracle.

986
01:05:57,792 --> 01:05:58,842
I won.

987
01:05:58,842 --> 01:06:01,451
I'm a bluebird, Teacher.

988
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:07,451
See, I told you. J. King can move hearts.

989
01:06:07,451 --> 01:06:10,301
I know it's not a big deal but to me, this is...

990
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:12,492
extremely...

991
01:06:12,492 --> 01:06:15,025
Anyways, thank you, Teacher.

992
01:06:15,025 --> 01:06:19,300
You were the only person who believed in me.

993
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:23,076
Even I didn't believe in myself.

994
01:06:23,076 --> 01:06:25,376
Anyways, thank you.

995
01:06:31,526 --> 01:06:34,000
Good job.

996
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:47,050
I have the same one! A fan gave it to me long ago.

997
01:06:50,301 --> 01:06:53,001
 I made it myself.

998
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:58,950
Wait, but... she said she made it herself.

999
01:07:01,009 --> 01:07:03,210
 J. King!

1000
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:13,201
 I made it myself.

1001
01:07:23,301 --> 01:07:25,599
Hey, wait, you...

1002
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,950
You're the beanie girl!

1003
01:07:29,526 --> 01:07:31,399
Hey, you...

1004
01:07:40,183 --> 01:07:43,910
 Miracles were happening all around me.

1005
01:07:46,883 --> 01:07:49,967
 And intoxicated by these miracles...

1006
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,599
 I couldn't see the tragedies waiting for me.

1007
01:07:55,699 --> 01:07:58,926
 I found them, Ma'am.

1008
01:07:58,926 --> 01:08:02,200
 I know where your grandson is.

1009
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,960

1010
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:43,760

1011
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,699
 Can I post a notice at your club?

1012
01:08:45,699 --> 01:08:48,699
 This was left behind in our apartment. In our closet.

1013
01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:52,050
 Did you know they're hosting open auditions?

1014
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:54,699
 I'll support you forever.

1015
01:08:54,699 --> 01:08:57,150
 I'm all cured now, please let me leave.

1016
01:08:57,150 --> 01:08:59,983
 My son, is alone, without his mother!

1017
01:08:59,983 --> 01:09:01,609
 - Mingi! 
 - What happened?

1018
01:09:01,609 --> 01:09:04,199
 Where the hell were you when he fell?

1019
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:05,899
 She was busy.

1020
01:09:05,899 --> 01:09:07,800
 She's in love with Jihoo's father.

1021
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,259
 A meeting?

1022
01:09:09,259 --> 01:09:12,659
 I think it's about the school system changing.

1023
01:09:12,659 --> 01:09:16,083
 If she's still here, she knows she'd get caught!

1024
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:18,859
 Identies... can be borrowed.

1025
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:20,959
 You both have significant others, this is unacceptable.

1026
01:09:20,959 --> 01:09:23,799
 Why are you trying to ruin her life?

1027
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:28,300
 Ruin her life? I am preventing danger.

1028
01:09:28,334 --> 01:09:32,000
 Hey. Now let me out, please.

1029
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:39,940

1030
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:45,050
