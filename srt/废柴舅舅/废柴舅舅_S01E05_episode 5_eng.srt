1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,790

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,217

3
00:00:12,217 --> 00:00:16,584

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:22,100

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,870

6
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:33,701

7
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:37,910

8
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,420

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,150

10
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:55,342
Be careful of that man. Okay?

11
00:00:55,342 --> 00:00:57,234
That's him? The pervert?

12
00:00:57,234 --> 00:00:58,818
How did he get out?

13
00:00:58,818 --> 00:01:00,392
He might hear us.

14
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:03,580
Don't make eye contact, he's crazy.

15
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:11,940

16
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:16,030

17
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:19,718
Get inside.

18
00:01:29,442 --> 00:01:34,170
 Since then, uncle went into hiding...

19
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:45,342
 The bluebird disappeared.

20
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:49,242
 And...

21
00:01:56,326 --> 00:02:00,340
 So did our teacher...

22
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:06,734
Who'll teach us now that our teacher is gone? Is a new teacher coming?

23
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:11,550
I don't know, even our school system is changing.

24
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,426
Hey, I heard the bluebird was your uncle, not your father.

25
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:20,125
Your uncle and our teacher dated?

26
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:25,317
She was fired because of your uncle, right?

27
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:26,826
Just stay quiet.

28
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:29,826
Don't defend Jihoo, Minggi will do worse.

29
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:31,951
How long can you take it?

30
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,150
Teacher isn't here anymore.

31
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,726
You can't hide behind your uncle.

32
00:02:37,726 --> 00:02:39,734
Just use that thing.

33
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:45,942
Always have it ready.

34
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:51,526
 You want to be a loser forever?

35
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:55,542
 You need to live a new life.

36
00:02:58,842 --> 00:03:01,542
 Something else disappeared, too.

37
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:04,851
 The cowardly Min Jihoo.

38
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,726
Say whatever you want.

39
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:09,484
What isn't true, can't hurt me.

40
00:03:09,484 --> 00:03:12,418
Hey! What isn't true?

41
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:13,925
It's all on the news.

42
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:17,342
The TV said your uncle was crazy.

43
00:03:17,342 --> 00:03:20,634
If you don't know him, I guess you can believe that.

44
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:25,518
But you all know what kind of a person he is.

45
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:27,317
If you trust the TV so much,

46
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:31,026
look up Super Dream Voice 2 winner J. King.

47
00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:33,018
He's Jihoo's uncle.

48
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:35,418
It's in the past.

49
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:38,225
Now he's a perverted renter.

50
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:41,925
Are you scared that I won't transfer?

51
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:42,942
What?

52
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:45,726
You're worried that a renter like me,

53
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,526
is smarter and has better test scores.

54
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:50,634
Why don't you shut your mouth?

55
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:53,025
Just hit him, hit him!

56
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:58,018
All you do is bully people, you can never beat me.

57
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:11,350
Wow, cool! Have a look!

58
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,934
- What? 
 - Let me see.

59
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,734
♪ Dreams always leave us behind ♪

60
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:26,730
♪ We try to hold on but they're gone... ♪

61
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,030

62
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,980

63
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,042
Where are you?

64
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:43,317
Oh, there you are.

65
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,134
I have to go take care of something.

66
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:48,650
I prepared some food, eat okay?

67
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:24,051

68
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:27,250
Yes, I prepared all the printings.

69
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,517
Please make sure class goes well without me.

70
00:05:30,517 --> 00:05:34,150
Can you also send me Songhee's study report?

71
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,134
She needs it to fulfill her school days.

72
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:42,717
Okay, just rest. Figure out your transfer.

73
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,851
I'm not transferring, I'm going to the school district.

74
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:49,651
Don't do anything you'll regret.

75
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:52,751
They can do worse, just give up.

76
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:55,250
 You can't beat them.

77
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,626
Diamond is above the principal.

78
00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:02,217
How great?

79
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:04,934
We even got rid of the teacher. And Jihoo's dad?

80
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:09,317
I mean, his uncle? He's been living quietly, too.

81
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:12,225
That's what you get for messing with us.

82
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:15,651
But child molestation was too much.

83
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:18,817
We shouldn't be making things up...

84
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:21,751
Why are you even taking his side?

85
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:23,250
Who's side?

86
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,526
I just don't want rumors to spread and embarrass us.

87
00:06:26,526 --> 00:06:31,418
Aren't you the best at making up false rumors?

88
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:33,417
Here we go again.

89
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:35,526
We didn't completely lie.

90
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:39,525
Remember how perverted he looked at first?

91
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:43,142
Did Jihoo's father die? Is she divorced?

92
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:44,767
Who cares.

93
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,850
Gossip is fun, Sis.

94
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,734
I'm jealous she lives alone.

95
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:51,050
The only thing I want to throw out, is my husband.

96
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,250
If a housewife loses her husband, she goes to poverty.

97
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,517
You want to be a renter?

98
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:59,834
Some people find a better husband and live happily.

99
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:02,526
Someone like Noeul's father. I could do it.

100
00:07:02,526 --> 00:07:03,934
I'd divorce in a heartbeat.

101
00:07:03,934 --> 00:07:07,134
He's handsome, well mannered, and intelligent.

102
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:09,918
No, not having a mother-in-law is the most important.

103
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:12,526
I heard he has buildings and land to inherit.

104
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:15,517
He, himself is also successful.

105
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:18,417
Single women in our neighborhood, are all after him.

106
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:20,442
Even all the divorcees.

107
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:23,734
His standards are too high though.

108
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:28,334
Yeah, I bet he'll remarry some young woman.

109
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:30,442
He wouldn't be interested in a divorced lady with kids.

110
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:34,050
Yeah... That only happens in dramas.

111
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,551
Who's the other guy,besides No-eul's dad.

112
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:39,250
Here's the food you ordered.

113
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,942
- Thank you. 
 - Please enjoy.

114
00:07:56,051 --> 00:08:00,010

115
00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:03,542
Welcome.

116
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:06,734
Oh, hello. Are you the owner?

117
00:08:06,734 --> 00:08:09,325
What?

118
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:12,092
I saw the ad outside...

119
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:15,734
Can I work here?

120
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,426
I'm a customer...

121
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:24,842
Excuse me, sir! Can you come out?

122
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:27,626
- Oh, greetings! 
 - Hello.

123
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:29,851
Welcome. Have a seat.

124
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:33,850
No, she's here for the job.

125
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,442
Is that so?

126
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:40,750
Sorry, I prefer someone younger.

127
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,626
How about the kitchen?

128
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:47,018
I have my chef license, I can clean, cook, or anything.

129
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:49,317
I currently run the kitchen.

130
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:51,434
Well just in case, you can have my number.

131
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:53,150
No, thank you.

132
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,134
Nice to meet you.

133
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:05,742
Getting older is upsetting enough as it is...

134
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:11,918
Will you move following the school change?

135
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:16,725
Not right away, but before the next half of the year.

136
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:21,242
We haven't got much, I'm trying to do whatever I can.

137
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:23,842
Do you want me to look into jobs for you?

138
00:09:23,842 --> 00:09:28,042
No, I don't think I can work in this neighborhood.

139
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:30,351
The Momvelies?

140
00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:35,651
Everyone's afraid Mombvelies will attack if they hire me.

141
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:39,242
Working away is hard for me to take care of Ji-hoo.

142
00:09:39,242 --> 00:09:42,542
I heard a restaurant nearby is looking for kitchen staff.

143
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:46,818
- How's your health? 
 - I'm an outpatient now.

144
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:50,718
I got a call.

145
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,220

146
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,484
Your uncle is moody like a crazy man, right?

147
00:10:06,484 --> 00:10:08,083
How'd you know?

148
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,292
That's the normal response.

149
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:14,983
I read Elisabeth Kubler Ross's, "On Death and Dying"

150
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:18,092
that explains, "the 5 stages of grief."

151
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:20,092
I'm not, it's not true, seriously not true, a misunderstanding...

152
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:22,701
 First step: denial.

153
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:24,317
Nope! Nope!

154
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:25,918
Molester? Nope.

155
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:28,709
Pervert? No.

156
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:31,990
 Second step: anger.

157
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,209
No, it's all my fault.

158
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:40,130
 The third: bargaining.

159
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,550
I'll do better.

160
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:46,330
 Fourth: depression.

161
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:11,000
 It's been 9 days and 17 hours since...

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,417
 16 hours and 24 minutes since I came in this room...

163
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:20,317
 Disconnecting from the world. Cut off from all humans.

164
00:11:20,317 --> 00:11:22,983
 I, Wang Junhyeok, am in isolation.

165
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:26,584
 I will be a cold dead body soon.

166
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:28,000
 The fifth and last stage:

167
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Please get my last message to beanie girl.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,559
 Acceptance.  
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

169
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,083
Teacher, don't ever forgive me...

170
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,809
 Uncle?

171
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,492
Oh, the sun light.

172
00:11:45,484 --> 00:11:48,818
Uncle, I'm back from after school studies.

173
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:51,900
Mom will be late today.

174
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,201
Do you hate me?

175
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:56,109
You've been humiliated, and now the transfer?

176
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:58,709
Sechan and Mingi are bullying you more now?

177
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,992
I don't care.

178
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:02,609
Let's go.

179
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,900
How'd you change so much?

180
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,718
You hate touching.

181
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:13,384
You said I was dirty, and hated touching me.

182
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,018
You changed.

183
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:17,792
Tell me.

184
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:21,118
Is it sympathy? Feeling sorry for me?

185
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:24,417
Do you live with me because you feel sorry?

186
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:27,918
We're a family. A family takes care of each other.

187
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:29,701
Family?

188
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:31,209
Let's get out.

189
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,000
Staying in the dark isn't good for you.

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,918
Is that why? I've been hearing things.

191
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:38,601
- Things? 
 - Yeah, things.

192
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:40,417
Yeah, that beeping sound.

193
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:43,592
I hear that beeping whenever I'm alone.

194
00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:45,918
Beep, beep. It's driving me crazy.

195
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:48,800
Maybe I am going crazy.

196
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,900
Beep, beep, beep.

197
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,301
Wait.

198
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:55,083
That's weird? I can still hear it. Can you hear it?

199
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:59,484
Uncle, you're not hearing things. Someone's breaking in.

200
00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:01,401
What? Who?

201
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:03,292
- Maybe it's that guy. 
 - Who?

202
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:06,192
- The guy in the hat. 
 - The drawing?

203
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:07,918
The guy who injured me?

204
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,609
That bastard!

205
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:12,800
He thinks no ones home. Quick, call the police.

206
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,192
Don't worry.

207
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:15,501
A 4 digit code?

208
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:18,709
The chances of him getting it right is one out of 25 million.

209
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:55,918
Got you now! We got you!

210
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,751
Stay still, call the police! The police!

211
00:13:58,751 --> 00:13:59,651
You stupid robber!

212
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:02,442
- I'm not a robber! 
 - What kind of robber would admit it!

213
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,718
- Call the police! 
 - Not the police! Please!

214
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,634
I used to live here!

215
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:10,542
- What? 
 - I used to live here before you.

216
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:14,234
- Prove it! 
 - Yeah, evidence! Prove yourself!

217
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:16,217
The bathroom sink is cracked!

218
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:18,717
I was the one who cracked it!

219
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:25,234
Wait, okay, wait. I need more evidence!

220
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:29,134
The far-end room has star stickers on the ceiling!

221
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,734
- Is that true? 
 - Yeah.

222
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:34,042
It freaks me out when I turn off the lights.

223
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:37,542
- I can't breathe, I can't... 
 - What initials are they?

224
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:40,426
Initials? There aren't any. Just stars...

225
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:41,751
He didn't fall for it...

226
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:44,850
I'm really not robbing you, I'm sorry.

227
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,751
I'm sorry I broke in.

228
00:14:54,918 --> 00:14:56,534
Come here!

229
00:14:58,317 --> 00:15:01,326
What? Your just a kid!

230
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:02,770
How old are you?

231
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,740
I'm a freshman in college.

232
00:15:07,217 --> 00:15:11,634
I'm really sorry but, can I use your bathroom?

233
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:14,051
- Number 1 or 2? 
 - What?

234
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:16,134
- Why is that important? 
 - It's not...

235
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:18,250
- You know where it is. 
 - Yes.

236
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,942
Well, you better.

237
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:31,242
- Oh, thank God. 
 - Shouldn't we call the police?

238
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:34,625
You don't think he's a robber though?

239
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,876
- Money? 
 - Yes.

240
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:04,918
Then why didn't you just say that to begin with?

241
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:07,125
If I told you, I thought you might steal it.

242
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:11,034
I should've found it first...

243
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:12,650
What!

244
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:17,759
How'd you guess the password?

245
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,083
I watched many times, as your family went in.

246
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,375
Hey, that's a huge crime!

247
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,918
You're lucky you met nice people like us!

248
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,450
All right, get out now.

249
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,375
Yes, I'm sorry. I'll show myself out.

250
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,751
- Change your password. 
 - Don't look at it then!

251
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:41,417
Wait, then...

252
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:45,392
Is the ultrasound his?

253
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:52,959
I caught on to begin with!

254
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,876
You did, right? I knew everyone found out!

255
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:57,918
That's crazy, seriously!

256
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:02,083
Hey, something came up, I'll be right back.

257
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,859
Sure, Sis, we'll be here.

258
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,059
That's what's important...

259
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,375
Why aren't you in the army?

260
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,883
Life must be good.

261
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:21,467
You look even better.

262
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:28,367
Why'd you go into their house?

263
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:40,959
Why are you returning it? I gave it to your father.

264
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:45,667
You wanted us to take the money and leave quietly?

265
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:53,876
You didn't know? That's the deal I made with your father.

266
00:17:53,876 --> 00:18:00,184
No, my father's last words were to return this money.

267
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:09,383
He... passed away?

268
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,259
Thanks to you.

269
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:26,051
That's why... you shouldn't look at a tree you can't climb.

270
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:33,467
If you left my daughter alone, none of this would have happened.

271
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:40,950
Deny it all you want, what happened, happened.

272
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:45,959
Nothing happened for my Chaeyoung.

273
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:49,750
She's happily studying abroad.

274
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:56,375
Why'd she leave the country?

275
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,083
Because she wanted to.

276
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:03,076
You should wake up, and face reality.

277
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:06,650
It's what your dead father would have wanted.

278
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,359
Don't ever speak about my father.

279
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:18,167
This is your last warning, never show up here again.

280
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:23,375
Are you afraid that I'll tell people about Chaeyoung?

281
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,151
Do I scare you?

282
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:32,083
No, who would believe you in the first place?

283
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:35,750
You still don't get how the world works?

284
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,067
Not surprised...

285
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:48,583
A poor renter's son, dumb enough to go after my daughter?

286
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:01,267
Just do as I say.

287
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:07,167
Or maybe you might turn up dead like your father.

288
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,430

289
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:27,067
Doctor, my daughter is doing great right?

290
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:30,251
Can you please wait outside?

291
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,584
I don't think she should leave the country.

292
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:56,383
She has a trauma caused by her boyfriend leaving her and the abortion...

293
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,150
I think she'll be fine.

294
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,550
I recommend hospitalization.

295
00:21:06,484 --> 00:21:09,176
No, just give us the prescription.

296
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,684
She said your good now! You can go study abroad!

297
00:21:54,684 --> 00:21:56,351
Get in.

298
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,150

299
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:22,384
I don't want to transfer, I love doing music.

300
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:26,459
5th graders can join band now, I want to do music.

301
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:29,584
That's just a hobby, just focus on studying.

302
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:31,751
Be an elite student like Chaeyoung.

303
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:34,751
Who's that? What'd she do?

304
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,751
I don't even know her face.

305
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:39,584
Why are you deciding my role model for me?

306
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:42,167
Maybe your mom wants to be like her mother.

307
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:47,083
No way, I'm not going to rot here, I'm going to Gangnam.

308
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:51,250
How? If you don't give me a son, my father won't help.

309
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,259
Maybe Sodam will become successful! Who knows.

310
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:58,250
It doesn't matter because I'm not a son.

311
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,167
Grandfather only wants a son.

312
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:04,275
I'll become a pop star and make you rich!

313
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:07,167
Shut up! Go to your room and study.

314
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:08,867
Go study!

315
00:23:11,983 --> 00:23:14,776
Your husband's a doctor.

316
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:16,767
This is a good life, why do you want more?

317
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:20,776
If all I wanted was this, I wouldn't have married you.

318
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:23,459
I had guys by the truck load, lining up for me.

319
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:24,776
What about me?

320
00:23:24,776 --> 00:23:27,551
If I knew how poor you were, I would never have married you.

321
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:29,175
You're the one that followed me around.

322
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,250
All you wanted to be was a rich doctor's wife.

323
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,959
Just do botox better, Sanghyeon's mom can't close her eyes!

324
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:38,050
The Momvelies put your hospital banner up at the club,

325
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,750
which is the only way you make money.

326
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,475
Where are you going!

327
00:23:45,475 --> 00:23:47,484
It's my ovulation day...

328
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:49,667
Just give up. It's not happening.

329
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:52,959
Don't give up... Don't leave.

330
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:57,184
Would you want to sleep with a girl like you?

331
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,751
Do you think being pretty is everything?

332
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,167

333
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:10,083
What? What anonymous post at such a late time?

334
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,851
- Sis! 
 - Sis, look.

335
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,500
"The school change is a scam, consent forms were forged.

336
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:21,275
Acquiring 70% of the consent forms in that short time is impossible."

337
00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:23,151
- Did you delete it? 
 - Yeah.

338
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:24,751
Only three people saw it.

339
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:26,751
Is it Jihoo's uncle?

340
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:29,375
Renters can't post on Momvely's club.

341
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,584
Who could it be?

342
00:24:30,584 --> 00:24:33,459
All our apartment prices rise, who would do this!

343
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:37,175
We did so much dirty work on behalf on everyone!

344
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:41,275
Maybe they didn't like all the illegal things.

345
00:24:41,275 --> 00:24:44,667
The only people who know about the fake consent forms...

346
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,883
are us.

347
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:52,259
Do you mean that one of us...

348
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:59,567
Did someone talk to the other moms?

349
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:04,567
 Please, I won't ever leave the kitchen.

350
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:08,359
 I'm really not a bad person, why would I spit in...

351
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:11,451
 Hello? Hello?

352
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:19,167
Hyeok, I'll go to the parent education, you just rest.

353
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:22,150
Jihoo, don't be late for school. Okay?

354
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,850
Yes.

355
00:25:34,751 --> 00:25:36,676
What, why?

356
00:25:48,983 --> 00:25:50,584
- You closed the board? 
 - Yes.

357
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:53,375
- Any mention on other sites? 
 - Yes, Sis.

358
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,083
Excuse me, Diamond?

359
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:57,959
I heard the school change was the Momvelies doing.

360
00:25:57,959 --> 00:26:02,150
- Thank you! 
 - Our apartment prices will sky rocket!

361
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,776
- Thank you. 
 - See you around.

362
00:26:03,776 --> 00:26:06,876
- Sure. 
 - Thank you.

363
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:09,959
Look, Sis. No one knows yet.

364
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:13,150
How could it be one of us?

365
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,759
Someone must have been theorizing.

366
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:17,759
I hate the autonomous system!

367
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,350
They constantly call us in for nothing!

368
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,859
Just focus on studies!

369
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:25,250
It'll all be over by the end of the semester.

370
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,375
I'm so relieved.

371
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:29,375
Stupid orchestra, keeping us busy until late.

372
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:32,918
Now we just send our kids to after-school classes.

373
00:26:32,918 --> 00:26:34,467
Good idea!

374
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,451
- Let's go. 
 - Yes.

375
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:42,667
- Hello. 
 - Hi, Noeul's father.

376
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,675
Hello, Noeul's father.

377
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,567
Is that Jihoo's mom?

378
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:52,459
I ordered food last night, she was the delivery guy!

379
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:55,167
She'll do anything since she's jobless.

380
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:59,375
Why is she here? Is she actually joining us?

381
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:03,751
How can she show herself after lying about everything?

382
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:05,876
I would be too embarrassed to leave my house.

383
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,959
She'll move soon.

384
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:12,551
Is she walking towards us?

385
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,459
Hello, it's been a while.

386
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:18,175
- Sure. 
 - Yes.

387
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:20,967
Do you have something to say?

388
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:24,751
I just wanted to apologize...

389
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:29,983
I, I mean, we... are very sorry.

390
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:33,767
Sechan's mother especially, we apologize.

391
00:27:35,651 --> 00:27:38,751
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

392
00:27:38,751 --> 00:27:39,667
I'm sorry.

393
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:44,250
Where's your temper? Didn't you demand an apology from us?

394
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,175
I was out of my mind. Please forgive me.

395
00:27:47,175 --> 00:27:49,875
All right, you can leave now.

396
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,584
Momvely Diamond, I...

397
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:03,084
Please let me go back to work at Cook Mom.

398
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:09,950
- Why would I do that? 
 - You got me fired.

399
00:28:12,851 --> 00:28:14,384
What are you talking about?

400
00:28:14,384 --> 00:28:16,983
You might spread false rumors here.

401
00:28:16,983 --> 00:28:20,259
I heard they take down business and get people fired...

402
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:22,851
That's so cruel, is that true?

403
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:24,601
Seriously!

404
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:29,959
Please, as you know I'm a renter and single mother.

405
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:34,250
I can't afford to work away, and I have no one to help me.

406
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,367
Please stop this, and forgive me.

407
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,159
I'm really sorry.

408
00:28:46,576 --> 00:28:48,567
What are you doing!

409
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:56,175
If you just let me work, I won't bother you.

410
00:28:56,175 --> 00:29:00,359
I'll live a quiet life. Please.

411
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:03,959
- What are you doing? 
 - What is wrong with you? Get up!

412
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:06,167
Just stop your acting!

413
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:10,384
What did we do? What are you saying?

414
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:13,175
I think there's a misunderstanding.

415
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:14,659
Get up.

416
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:17,667
Get up! We'll allow you to work!

417
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:20,167
Hey, shut up! You aren't the Diamond!

418
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:23,959
This is ruining our reputation.

419
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:26,359
Come on! Please get up!

420
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,776
You messed up, big time.

421
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:53,450
 What do you mean, move to the States?

422
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,951
 You got fired from school, just give up and come here.

423
00:29:56,951 --> 00:30:00,601
 I didn't get fired, and I want to be a teacher.

424
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:03,034
 I have to plant my roots out here in America.

425
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,275
 You don't even have family left in Korea.

426
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:08,884
 It's always been my dream to become a teacher. You know that, right?

427
00:30:08,884 --> 00:30:13,118
 If you want to teach, let's have some kids. You can teach them.

428
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:16,083
 Stop babysitting everyone else's.

429
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,518
Babysitting?

430
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,809
 Beanie girl became an incredible teacher!

431
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,400
 Truly a great teacher.

432
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,517
Hi! My teacher-friend!

433
00:30:45,517 --> 00:30:48,517
- Hello. 
 - Talking like an old lady again?

434
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:51,583
- Just talk freely. 
 - No, I'm okay.

435
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,083
- You're so selfish. 
 - What?

436
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:59,000
You're making me look bad by being so polite.

437
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:04,792
How is... J. King doing?

438
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:07,718
I mean, "What's up with him?"

439
00:31:07,718 --> 00:31:08,792
I don't know.

440
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:10,918
- Is he inside? 
 - He is not.

441
00:31:10,918 --> 00:31:12,501
- Is he okay? 
 - Nope, he is not.

442
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:15,851
He blames himself and is dying of self-pity.

443
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:17,950
Come in, let's drink.

444
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,642
Teachers drink too, right?

445
00:31:20,642 --> 00:31:22,292
Let's go!

446
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:32,200
My friend, introduce yourself.

447
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,200
After J. King went broke,

448
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,584
I dumped him for, My Prince.

449
00:31:38,584 --> 00:31:42,492
- Doctor Juno! Boom! 
 - Hello.

450
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:45,501
Swing by anytime.

451
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:50,751
Very dry, I'll pump you with water gloss toxins.

452
00:31:50,751 --> 00:31:53,784
I heard you're a J. King fan.

453
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:58,417
Oh, what a rare and limited edition.

454
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,100
There are so many other musicians out there.

455
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,042
You can obsess over them instead.

456
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:06,292
I heard he cost you your job.

457
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:09,692
If I were you, I'd be pissed off.

458
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:19,409
Oh my god.

459
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:24,417
Oh my, I think she can drink more than any of us.

460
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:28,200
A real fan never backs away.

461
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,418
What?

462
00:32:29,418 --> 00:32:33,501
How can you dump someone you love because of money?

463
00:32:33,501 --> 00:32:36,167
Then you were jealous he was interested in me?

464
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:38,109
You're a bad person.

465
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:41,801
- Me? It's about me? 
 - I think so.

466
00:32:41,801 --> 00:32:46,417
I gave him the keyring, and I couldn't hide my fan spirit.

467
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:48,501
I was the one who put the child in danger.

468
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:50,417
J. King did nothing wrong!

469
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:53,601
I'm not embarrassed to be his fan!

470
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:56,318
No, I'm actually proud!

471
00:32:56,318 --> 00:32:59,183
I'm his only fan left! If I give up on him,

472
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:02,083
I'd feel so bad for J. King!

473
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:06,209
Did I cause this mental breakdown?

474
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:10,476
- Just apologize. 
 - Hey, I'm sorry.

475
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,683
Did you break her?

476
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:17,501
Is she sleeping?

477
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:19,184
She's sleeping.

478
00:33:20,492 --> 00:33:22,426
She's snoring!

479
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:26,901
I don't know where she lives, why'd you call me.

480
00:33:26,918 --> 00:33:30,809
I never asked you to come. I asked for her address.

481
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:34,592
You never pick up your phone, suddenly you're here?

482
00:33:34,592 --> 00:33:36,392
Whatever.

483
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,480
Whatever.  Geez!

484
00:33:46,718 --> 00:33:49,501
Teacher, your phone...

485
00:33:49,501 --> 00:33:53,592
Teacher... It's here...

486
00:33:53,592 --> 00:33:55,200
Wow, careful.

487
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:57,783
Hello.

488
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:01,500
- Hello. 
 - Teacher, sorry, wait...

489
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,525
Jaeseo?

490
00:34:06,384 --> 00:34:09,650
I didn't reply because I'm angry.

491
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,000
That was so mean.

492
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,101
You think my job is babysitting? I'm a teacher.

493
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:22,009
You're mean!  Bye.

494
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:26,017
So dense.

495
00:34:26,584 --> 00:34:29,101
You should sleep at home.

496
00:34:30,292 --> 00:34:31,909
Teacher?

497
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:34,400
Teacher?

498
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:39,584
Huh?

499
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:42,918
It's J. King.

500
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:46,792
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay.

501
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:51,092
Gongseong intersection!

502
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:52,883
Gongseong intersection!

503
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:56,592
- Teacher, are you okay? 
 - Gongseong...

504
00:34:56,592 --> 00:35:00,483
- Are you sure you're okay? 
 - Of course.

505
00:35:00,483 --> 00:35:05,492
I can do everything by myself.

506
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:11,501
Berries! When your home is near and taxis aren't available...

507
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:14,783
What should we do?

508
00:35:14,783 --> 00:35:17,000
Exactly!

509
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,100
We walk!

510
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,801
Let me catch a cab for you.

511
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:27,918
I can't even get a taxi...

512
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:31,475
I am a useless human being.

513
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,701
Oh, Teacher.

514
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:40,309
But I still have to go home.

515
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:49,884
If I tried harder? I could have got a cab, right?

516
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:52,692
- I know how to get a taxi... 
 - Let's try this.

517
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,383
My bag...

518
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,609
Get on.

519
00:35:57,609 --> 00:35:59,001
Great!

520
00:35:59,001 --> 00:36:04,701
I got a taxi. Thank you, Mr. Driver.

521
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:11,492
- Which way are we going? 
 - Straight ahead, please.

522
00:36:11,492 --> 00:36:13,218
All right.

523
00:36:28,817 --> 00:36:34,718
 Dear J. King, I'm Song Hwaeum, a junior in high school.

524
00:36:34,718 --> 00:36:39,609
 My nickname is Young Teacher.

525
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:43,200
 I live in an orphanage.

526
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,409
 Which is why I have so many siblings.

527
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:49,318
 Whenever they call me "teacher,"

528
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:52,700
 I feel warm and achieved inside.

529
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:59,192
 Which is why I've decided, to become a teacher.

530
00:36:59,192 --> 00:37:03,892
 Maybe my parents left mebecause I'm useless.

531
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:10,217
 Studying to become a teacher here is very difficult.

532
00:37:10,217 --> 00:37:13,226
 I was about to give up.

533
00:37:14,192 --> 00:37:19,800
 I wish my music gives hope, when all hope is lost.

534
00:37:20,492 --> 00:37:26,684
 That's when I saw you on TV.

535
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:34,809

00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:02,192
 Then maybe my dreams could come true, too.

542
00:38:02,634 --> 00:38:05,883
 I will cheer for you, with all my heart.

543
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:09,976

What're you doing?

547
00:38:42,784 --> 00:38:44,618
Making a wish.

548
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:47,317
Will it come true?

549
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:49,800
There's no way.

550
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,717
What's your wish?

551
00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:56,917
I want to grow up, so I can be useful.

552
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,401
What happened?

553
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:05,192
Mom, got on her knees.

554
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,809
At school, in front of the moms.

555
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,392
Why?

556
00:39:14,092 --> 00:39:18,609
She begged for her job at Cook Mom.

557
00:39:21,283 --> 00:39:26,483
She says she only needs me, but I cause her so much pain.

558
00:39:26,483 --> 00:39:29,992
It's not you, it's me.

559
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:32,984
Uncle, when will you be okay?

560
00:39:32,984 --> 00:39:36,701
I don't know, I'd like to know too.

561
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:40,192
Even canned tuna has an expiration date.

562
00:39:41,892 --> 00:39:46,217
Can't you gain strength, and help mom?

563
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,184
Mom was like a mom to you too, Uncle.

564
00:39:49,184 --> 00:39:52,992
Hey, your mom ruined my life.

565
00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:56,592
If she didn't steal my money, I wouldn't live like this.

566
00:39:57,509 --> 00:40:03,618
If she didn't take it, would you really have succeeded?

567
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:06,392
- Nope. 
 - Then stop blaming her.

568
00:40:06,392 --> 00:40:10,792
Stop blaming everyone else for your problems.

569
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:14,292
Don't kick a man while he's down.

570
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:18,400
Success? Do you think I want to be successful?

571
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,909
I'd be happy with mending all the problems I caused.

572
00:40:22,909 --> 00:40:26,609
- Then fix it. 
 - I can't, how can I?

573
00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:29,200
I have nothing.

574
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:34,001
Give me an Infinity Stone, Ant-Man!

575
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:36,200
Give me a time machine.

576
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,483
If I had a time machine, I could...

577
00:40:39,483 --> 00:40:44,318
Say something cool, I am J. King!

578
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,692
I am J. King!

579
00:40:47,817 --> 00:40:51,184
I am... What? Do I look like a loser?

580
00:40:51,184 --> 00:40:53,992
Being an adult is no different.

581
00:40:53,992 --> 00:40:57,509
Yup. It doesn't fix anything.

582
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,201
- Maybe your the only mess. 
 - Shut up, I'm wishing.

583
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:07,783
All right.

584
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:17,517
What?

585
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:22,409
 The school change was a scam, consent was faked.

586
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:29,192
 We're the only ones that know the consent forms are fake.

587
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:31,609
- So what now? 
 - What?

588
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:33,301
Isn't this...

589
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,817
enough to fix everything!

590
00:41:35,817 --> 00:41:39,118
What do you mean? This isn't enough for anything.

591
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:41,984
Why not? We know it was faked.

592
00:41:41,984 --> 00:41:44,817
Let's find the fake consent forms and take them.

593
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:46,983
Find and take?

594
00:41:46,983 --> 00:41:50,283
- No. 
 - Yes, steal them.

595
00:41:50,283 --> 00:41:53,300
I understand how you feel, but that's illegal.

596
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,901
What's illegal? So the Avengers are all criminals?

597
00:41:56,901 --> 00:41:59,618
They went to the past and stole the stones.

598
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:03,109
Boom! Brought everyone back!

599
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:05,609
Which is why Iron Man died.

600
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:21,484
I love you three thousand...

601
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:25,718
It was cool in the movies...

602
00:42:32,276 --> 00:42:34,901
So, you want us to become the Avengers?

603
00:42:34,901 --> 00:42:35,692
Exactly!

604
00:42:35,692 --> 00:42:39,084
Then I'm Black Widow! Dad, you have leather clothes!

605
00:42:39,084 --> 00:42:42,709
I have everything: a cape, a hammer...

606
00:42:42,709 --> 00:42:43,817
I'm not doing this.

607
00:42:43,817 --> 00:42:46,318
If I go to prison at such an old age...

608
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:47,609
My health...

609
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:50,300
Why would you go to prison? You did nothing wrong.

610
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,483
Just be there when things happen, you know?

611
00:42:52,483 --> 00:42:54,392
Are you sure?

612
00:42:54,392 --> 00:42:56,901
This is stealing!  You might ruin your...

613
00:42:56,901 --> 00:42:57,809
Never mind!

614
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:02,418
If I can sacrifice myself for Jihoo, my sister, and the teacher...

615
00:43:02,418 --> 00:43:07,417
If I can restore what they lost, I don't care what happens to me.

616
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:09,901
You! How'd you change?

617
00:43:09,901 --> 00:43:13,101
You were always a selfish coward.

618
00:43:13,101 --> 00:43:16,500
You break up with me and now you're so manly?

619
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,717
So charming?

620
00:43:17,717 --> 00:43:19,318
I'm still here.

621
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:23,417
Sorry, I thought you left.

622
00:43:23,442 --> 00:43:25,226
Please just help me, okay?

623
00:43:25,226 --> 00:43:28,909
Help me. If I can pull this off...

624
00:43:30,292 --> 00:43:32,009
Do you know this person?

625
00:43:32,683 --> 00:43:36,292
Seongjak Educational Office, School Conversion Supervisor.

626
00:43:37,334 --> 00:43:39,460
 The parent consent forms.

627
00:43:41,984 --> 00:43:46,292
Yeah! Right! I saw him take the files!

628
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:48,318
Wow, how'd you know that?

629
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:50,009
Stupid.

630
00:43:50,009 --> 00:43:52,292
He's a government worker, just Doodle him.

631
00:43:52,292 --> 00:43:54,984
Wow! So smart!

632
00:43:54,984 --> 00:44:00,117
As expected, doctors are different! Doctor Juno range!

633
00:44:00,117 --> 00:44:03,083
Do you have a plan?

634
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,192
Listen closely. I'll do a simulation for you.

635
00:44:05,192 --> 00:44:06,692
Gather in.

636
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,483
Plan A.

637
00:44:10,509 --> 00:44:15,109
I'll use their lunch break to infiltrate the school district.

638
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:20,984
Yeonjoo make a big scene,

639
00:44:20,984 --> 00:44:24,401
so people don't notice me.

640
00:44:24,418 --> 00:44:27,817
I'm feeling sick.

641
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:33,984
Sir, will you help me up?

642
00:44:33,984 --> 00:44:37,209
 That's not the right way.

643
00:44:58,817 --> 00:45:02,392
He's coming. He sees me. Oh gosh...

644
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,817
What should I do?

645
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:06,917
Just ask the supervisor for the documents.

646
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:09,618
Oh, that's smart.

647
00:45:09,692 --> 00:45:12,000
Why do you need them?

648
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:14,709
Who's asking?

649
00:45:14,709 --> 00:45:17,317
 Just be bold, and lie.

650
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:19,318
I'm from the Seoul School District.

651
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:22,083
 That's not being bold.

652
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:25,700
Oh, I see.

653
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:30,084
The school change is complete, I already gave them back.

654
00:45:30,084 --> 00:45:31,192
To who?

655
00:45:31,217 --> 00:45:35,934

Starting from now,

656
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:38,240
let's begin Plan B...

657
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,150
Hold this.

658
00:45:41,817 --> 00:45:42,817
Hello.

659
00:45:42,817 --> 00:45:45,192
I asked the school district,

660
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:47,309
the deadline for appeals is tomorrow.

661
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:49,817
If you're going to steal them,

662
00:45:49,817 --> 00:45:52,692
you have to succeed today, can you do it?

663
00:45:52,692 --> 00:45:56,817
If anything... If anything happens to me today,

664
00:45:56,817 --> 00:45:58,984
please take good care of Jihoo and his mother for me.

665
00:45:58,984 --> 00:46:01,118
Hey, watch out.

666
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,690

667
00:46:08,017 --> 00:46:09,400
We've got an hour.

668
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,901
Two people left inside, let's begin this.

669
00:46:11,901 --> 00:46:13,817
But...

670
00:46:13,817 --> 00:46:15,318
Must we do the "Please Help" plan?

671
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:17,192
It's classic, it'll work.

672
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:18,934
It's embarrassing.

673
00:46:18,934 --> 00:46:20,667
Let's do this!

674
00:46:27,817 --> 00:46:28,609
Excuse me!

675
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:29,609
Please help!

676
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:32,318
A man has... A heart attack!

677
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:35,709
What're you waiting for, hurry! Help him!

678
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,109
It's him! It's this guy!

679
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:41,692
- Are you okay? 
 - Just hold on!

680
00:46:41,692 --> 00:46:43,109
Oh my!

681
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:45,109
911...

682
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:46,609
Call 911...

683
00:46:46,609 --> 00:46:49,318
What should we do!

684
00:47:19,192 --> 00:47:22,518
Please take care of Chaeyoung's luggage.

685
00:47:22,518 --> 00:47:24,483
Call me right away if something goes wrong.

686
00:47:24,483 --> 00:47:26,183
Yes.

687
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:41,517
What? Why is she here?

688
00:48:05,609 --> 00:48:07,467

689
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,320

690
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:25,290
Oh no!

691
00:48:26,817 --> 00:48:28,601
What now!

692
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,630

693
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,901
What?

694
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,609
It's not locked, why won't it open?

695
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,130
My god!

696
00:49:35,609 --> 00:49:38,592
What are you doing? Why are you here?

697
00:49:40,692 --> 00:49:42,984
Go ahead and make me look like a fool again!

698
00:49:42,984 --> 00:49:46,100
- What? 
 - I've been looking for tha...

699
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,730
Hey! Hey!

700
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:53,909
Hey!

701
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,980
No, no, no!  Not me! Get her!

702
00:49:56,984 --> 00:49:58,918
Get him!

703
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,100
Hold on!

704
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:04,417
I think I'm okay now.

705
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,000
What? What?

706
00:50:10,784 --> 00:50:12,442
Oh no, grandfather!

707
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:13,567
There!

708
00:50:13,567 --> 00:50:16,550
He's dying! He's dying!

709
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,601
Hurry, get in!

710
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:33,984
You show up now? Like the main hero?

711
00:50:33,984 --> 00:50:35,434
How'd you know I was here?

712
00:50:35,442 --> 00:50:36,901
I was worried.

713
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:40,767
You know what's crazy? Someone else came to steal it, too!

714
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,709
- Who? 
 - Who do you think!

715
00:50:43,709 --> 00:50:46,218
Wait, look. I signed this.

716
00:50:46,218 --> 00:50:47,925
Look, J. King.

717
00:50:47,925 --> 00:50:49,492
What?

718
00:50:49,492 --> 00:50:51,192
What is this?

719
00:50:52,109 --> 00:50:56,218
This is for the Library regulations.

720
00:50:56,218 --> 00:50:58,692
They added it to the school conversion consent form.

721
00:50:58,692 --> 00:51:00,984
They're so conniving.

722
00:51:00,984 --> 00:51:03,692
Gold Momvelies are such snakes.

723
00:51:03,692 --> 00:51:05,918
I didn't think they'd go this far...

724
00:51:06,817 --> 00:51:09,601
It's all mixed in here.

725
00:51:11,192 --> 00:51:14,809
Just calm down and talk to me.

726
00:51:16,483 --> 00:51:19,567
I'm on my way, just figure it out.

727
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:21,276
I'm coming!

728
00:51:21,276 --> 00:51:23,901
Those weren't the right files!

729
00:51:23,901 --> 00:51:25,001
All right, bye.

730
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:27,192
Close down the website, and keep it that way!

731
00:51:27,192 --> 00:51:29,009
Okay, okay.

732
00:51:29,817 --> 00:51:31,483
- What's going on? 
 - Sis!

733
00:51:31,483 --> 00:51:34,318
Jihoo's uncle is going to all the parents with the form!

734
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:36,984
He's checking with everyone and their signatures!

735
00:51:36,984 --> 00:51:40,483
All the parents are furious about the consent hidden in them!

736
00:51:40,483 --> 00:51:43,292
How did he get the files?

737
00:51:43,318 --> 00:51:45,609
Stop him! Go stop him right now!

738
00:51:45,609 --> 00:51:48,209
Okay, okay!

739
00:51:50,109 --> 00:51:53,109
Yes, Congressman Hwang, it's me.

740
00:51:58,701 --> 00:52:02,509
Should we edit the video? So the Diamond isn't shown?

741
00:52:06,192 --> 00:52:08,609
You only signed for the library regulations, right?

742
00:52:08,609 --> 00:52:10,984
- Yes. 
 - You see the stapler mark?

743
00:52:10,984 --> 00:52:14,609
They added the consent form between these!

744
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:19,292
Oh my, you're right! Those women are crazy.

745
00:52:19,292 --> 00:52:22,276
Already four families here said they never signed it.

746
00:52:22,276 --> 00:52:23,984
If we can get as many as we...

747
00:52:23,984 --> 00:52:27,200
- Hey, you! 
 - Excuse me.

748
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,409
Hello.

749
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,509
Hello. Hello.

750
00:52:34,509 --> 00:52:38,367
Stop! Stop!

751
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:41,251
Stop! Stop!

752
00:52:41,251 --> 00:52:42,867

753
00:52:42,901 --> 00:52:45,901
Okay, fine. I'm done.

754
00:52:46,942 --> 00:52:49,483
What are you trying to do here?

755
00:52:49,483 --> 00:52:51,692
Exactly, what's your plan. Huh?

756
00:52:51,692 --> 00:52:54,151
- Give them back! 
 - Don't touch me!

757
00:52:54,151 --> 00:52:55,600
I'll call the police!

758
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,583
What's your plan? Nothing will change.

759
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:02,901
Do you think these consent forms can stop the conversion?

760
00:53:02,901 --> 00:53:06,084
If it doesn't matter, why'd you forge them?

761
00:53:06,084 --> 00:53:08,309
Forge? We didn't forge anything!

762
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:11,600
Forge, fraud? Fraud, fraud, fraud?

763
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,609
Fraud?

764
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:15,609
They were going to agree anyways. It's just a little earlier.

765
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,792
Is that so? Oh, I guess I didn't know.

766
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:20,318
Excuse me!

767
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:24,100
Have you signed the school system change consent form?

768
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,692
No, I didn't.

769
00:53:25,692 --> 00:53:28,192
You didn't? Your signature can be found in here!

770
00:53:28,192 --> 00:53:29,400
I'll find it for you.

771
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,400
What classroom?

772
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,984
These people forged the documents...

773
00:53:31,984 --> 00:53:36,318
I'm sorry, this crazy person is causing a scene.

774
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:36,984
Goodbye, Miss!

775
00:53:36,984 --> 00:53:39,483
Don't leave! Please check this first!

776
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:44,592
Do you think this will go on your way? Who'll believe anything you say?

777
00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:49,259
You're right!  No one would believe me.

778
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:53,717
I'm a perverted molester and a liar!

779
00:53:53,717 --> 00:53:55,318
You made it that way!

780
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:58,484
No one would believe me.

781
00:53:58,484 --> 00:54:01,817
But they'll listen to you.

782
00:54:01,817 --> 00:54:05,817
 The school change was a scam, consent was faked.

783
00:54:05,817 --> 00:54:09,409
 Acquiring 70% consent forms in that short time is...

784
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:13,583
 We did so much dirty work on behalf of everyone!

785
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,909
 Maybe they didn't like all the illegal things.

786
00:54:16,909 --> 00:54:22,517
 Who knows about the fake consent forms... is us...

787
00:54:22,517 --> 00:54:26,192
Done! Admission of forging documents, with her own mouth,

788
00:54:26,192 --> 00:54:29,984
we have heard the Diamond's testimony.

789
00:54:29,984 --> 00:54:32,483
Applause!

790
00:54:32,483 --> 00:54:37,509
You stole that! You stole from a government office!

791
00:54:37,509 --> 00:54:41,192
I didn't steal it, someone else did!

792
00:54:41,192 --> 00:54:45,300
I wonder why you would want to steal these.

793
00:54:45,318 --> 00:54:50,009
Do you have evidence that I stole them!

794
00:54:50,009 --> 00:54:55,717
So bold, I guess you've already tampered with the CCTV.

795
00:54:55,717 --> 00:54:58,618
It's okay though, I don't need any evidence!

796
00:54:58,618 --> 00:55:02,218
I am ready to go to prison for this!

797
00:55:02,218 --> 00:55:05,609
I'm filing for an appeal tomorrow morning.

798
00:55:05,609 --> 00:55:09,717
I'll share this recording with everyone and turn myself in.

799
00:55:09,717 --> 00:55:13,525
We'll all go to prison. How exciting.

800
00:55:13,525 --> 00:55:15,400
Let's go!

801
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,701
- What do we do? 
 - He's gone mad.

802
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:22,300
What do you want?

803
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:24,884
But, Sis...

804
00:55:25,901 --> 00:55:28,817
Making my wishes come true?

805
00:55:28,817 --> 00:55:31,784
Just tell me what you want!

806
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,610
Sis!

807
00:55:42,192 --> 00:55:45,483
I am J. King!

808
00:56:20,184 --> 00:56:22,118
It's true.

809
00:56:22,151 --> 00:56:24,984
Teacher, you're back!

810
00:56:24,984 --> 00:56:26,192
Hello, Jihoo.

811
00:56:26,192 --> 00:56:26,942
Hello!

812
00:56:26,942 --> 00:56:28,817
- Hi, Sechan. 
 - Welcome back.

813
00:56:28,817 --> 00:56:31,117
- Hello! 
 - Teacher!

814
00:56:31,192 --> 00:56:33,901
- I missed you! 
 - I missed you, too.

815
00:56:33,901 --> 00:56:35,609
Hello, Jiho and Jinsu.

816
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:38,192
Songhee did you hand in your field trip report?

817
00:56:38,192 --> 00:56:39,084
Yes!

818
00:56:39,084 --> 00:56:40,109
Good job.

819
00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:43,517
I missed you all.

820
00:56:43,517 --> 00:56:46,092
It's from my uncle.

821
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:56,901
 Dear junior in high school Song Hwaeum...

822
00:56:56,901 --> 00:57:01,309
 It's me, J. King.

823
00:57:01,309 --> 00:57:03,483
 Sorry for the late reply.

824
00:57:03,483 --> 00:57:06,217
 Thank you so much for the keyring.

825
00:57:06,217 --> 00:57:09,984
 Let's both make our dreams come true.

826
00:57:10,984 --> 00:57:13,984
 I'll cheer for your dreams, too.

827
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:18,909
 10 years from now, you'll be an amazing teacher.

828
00:57:18,909 --> 00:57:23,300
 Some students won't listen, and will annoy you,

829
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:27,283
 as well with some bossy parents, but...

830
00:57:27,283 --> 00:57:32,692
 You will be loved and respected as the best teacher.

831
00:57:32,692 --> 00:57:38,792
 So never give up on your dreams and keep hope.

832
00:57:39,909 --> 00:57:41,917
 By the way, beanie girl.

833
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:45,783
 You should never think that you're useless.

834
00:57:45,783 --> 00:57:46,609
Hello!

835
00:57:46,609 --> 00:57:50,601
 Even if you don't become something,

836
00:57:50,609 --> 00:57:55,283
 you are already a precious human being.

837
00:57:55,283 --> 00:57:59,984
 You deserve to be loved. From, J. King.

838
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:13,383
Thank you for letting me work.

839
00:58:13,383 --> 00:58:15,392
Just be grateful.

840
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:19,401
Just know it's thanks to me.

841
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,400
Yes.

842
00:58:23,017 --> 00:58:24,601
Oh, and...

843
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:27,583
- You and Noeul's father? 
 - Pardon?

844
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:30,592
Why does he work so hard to help your family?

845
00:58:30,592 --> 00:58:35,001
He stole for you, got signatures, he's like your husband...

846
00:58:42,192 --> 00:58:44,183
Greetings from Cook Mom.

847
00:58:46,892 --> 00:58:50,817
- You live here? 
 - Congratulations, your back to work.

848
00:58:50,817 --> 00:58:51,984
Yes.

849
00:58:51,984 --> 00:58:56,292
I heard you helped. Thank you.

850
00:58:56,292 --> 00:58:58,542
Don't you want to know why?

851
00:58:59,984 --> 00:59:02,609
I didn't want you to move away.

852
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:09,792
The school conversion isn't happening, so you won't move. Right?

853
00:59:11,067 --> 00:59:12,751
That's a given.

854
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:19,910
Burning...

855
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,240
Oh no!

856
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:46,070
What should we do?

857
00:59:46,701 --> 00:59:51,617
You're hurt, let me clean that up for you.

858
00:59:51,617 --> 00:59:55,517
- I'll make you new fried eggs. 
 - That would be...

859
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,150
Oh...

860
00:59:57,817 --> 00:59:59,640
It's okay...

861
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,584
Just wait.

862
01:00:06,717 --> 01:00:08,901
I said we "lost" the files.

863
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:12,400
I told the principal to collect new consent forms.

864
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,800
Yes, I'll focus on collecting the forms as well.

865
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:21,400
No, the school should take care of it now.

866
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,092
Let's step away from this.

867
01:00:24,792 --> 01:00:30,992
Then the school system will never be able to change.

868
01:00:30,992 --> 01:00:33,817
Your approval ratings are up for now,

869
01:00:33,817 --> 01:00:36,220
but you never know what might happen.

870
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,200
Above all else, it must mean that the housewives are in our favor.

871
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,310
What do we do if this guy uses the forged documents against us?

872
01:00:43,318 --> 01:00:47,483
Which is why I advised you to edit me out

873
01:00:47,483 --> 01:00:50,884
of the CCTV and have him arrested for theft.

874
01:00:50,884 --> 01:00:54,817
Arrest him for stealing forged documents?

875
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:58,775
If he was arrested, he would have no choice but to return them.

876
01:00:58,775 --> 01:01:02,609
You've never dealt with people like him.

877
01:01:02,609 --> 01:01:04,483
Mr. Congressman,

878
01:01:04,483 --> 01:01:07,984
I would do anything to make sure you win the election.

879
01:01:07,984 --> 01:01:12,475
I know how much you sacrifice for me.

880
01:01:12,475 --> 01:01:16,083
I appreciate your efforts, just be careful.

881
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:19,684
You can find yourself in danger. Got it?

882
01:01:36,692 --> 01:01:37,901
Huh?

883
01:01:45,392 --> 01:01:49,083
Is this the only way?

884
01:01:49,792 --> 01:01:54,284
We must change everything back to normal.

885
01:01:56,909 --> 01:02:01,618
I don't know if this is the right move, whatever.

886
01:02:06,901 --> 01:02:08,484
Hello...

887
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:11,609
 - Hello...  
 - What the Hell is that?

888
01:02:11,609 --> 01:02:15,809
 Dear Royal Estate residents, sorry for the interruption.

889
01:02:15,817 --> 01:02:19,775
- Isn't that Junhyeok's voice? 
 - No way.

890
01:02:19,775 --> 01:02:24,901
 I'm the uncle living in the rental apartment 804.

891
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:27,017
Did he lose his mind?

892
01:02:27,017 --> 01:02:29,010
 I, as a person,

893
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:30,700
am a good liar,

894
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:34,109
 who tries to refund his suit on purpose.

895
01:02:34,109 --> 01:02:38,792
 I used to finish entire meals at the free tasting sections.

896
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:43,300
 But I am not a bad person who would harm others.

897
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,540
- He's so annoying... 
  - I am not a molester,

898
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:48,100
nor am I a pervert.

899
01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:55,183
Moving forward, I will show you that I am a good person.

900
01:02:55,817 --> 01:03:00,984
I apologize for all the ruckus the last few days.

901
01:03:00,984 --> 01:03:04,184
As an apology, we...

902
01:03:04,184 --> 01:03:07,684
prepared a song for everyone.

903
01:03:20,292 --> 01:03:22,783
Wow!

904
01:03:22,783 --> 01:03:24,792

 I believed our family's future would stay bright.

927
01:05:30,634 --> 01:05:32,399
Mom! Mom!  Look at this!

928
01:05:32,399 --> 01:05:34,076
Mom, have a look!

929
01:05:34,076 --> 01:05:36,199
Come on, just look.

930
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:39,584
It's him. This is Jihoo, right?

931
01:05:40,483 --> 01:05:42,509
Where is this?

932
01:05:42,509 --> 01:05:44,199
Where is this?

933
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:46,009
Can't you tell? It's Seoul.

934
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:48,659
They were still in Korea?

935
01:05:48,659 --> 01:05:50,567
I knew it.

936
01:05:50,567 --> 01:05:54,667
She tricked you, they're still here!

937
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:59,317
Find them now. Search every elementary school.

938
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:04,367
I'll kill them all!

939
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:21,330

940
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:48,460

941
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:52,076
 Since I destroyed the Momvelies and their plans...

942
01:06:52,076 --> 01:06:54,199
 Our goal is survival.

943
01:06:54,199 --> 01:06:57,134
 Jihoo's uncle should be our target.

944
01:06:57,134 --> 01:06:59,901
 I'll be here every day. I'm stuck to you like a leech.

945
01:06:59,901 --> 01:07:03,992
 What do I do when the boy I like, likes someone else?

946
01:07:03,992 --> 01:07:08,342
 If they're happier with someone else...

947
01:07:08,342 --> 01:07:10,699
 There's not much to do...

948
01:07:11,399 --> 01:07:13,399
 - Jihoo! 
 - I said stop!

949
01:07:13,399 --> 01:07:14,399
 Hey!

950
01:07:14,399 --> 01:07:15,942
 Are you crazy!

951
01:07:15,942 --> 01:07:17,951
 He might be asked to transfer.

952
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:20,151
 That makes you the same kind of person as your grandmother.

953
01:07:20,151 --> 01:07:21,199
 Are you really my son?

954
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:24,817
 If I didn't exist, you would be happy.

955
01:07:24,817 --> 01:07:26,567
 It's off. What do we do?

956
01:07:26,567 --> 01:07:28,399
 Why did you push him into a corner!

957
01:07:28,399 --> 01:07:30,359
 I'm your one and only, biggest fan...

958
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:32,099
 Can you please stop being my fan?

959
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:35,292
 Just keep it to yourself, Teacher.

960
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:43,500

961
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:49,290
