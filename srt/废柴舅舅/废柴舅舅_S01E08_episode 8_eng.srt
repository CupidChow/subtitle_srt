1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720

2
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:12,301

3
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:16,709

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:22,100

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,167

6
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:33,584

7
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:38,070

8
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,290

9
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:50,990

10
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,920

11
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:05,401
 Don't turn yourself in, let's just run away.

12
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:08,475
 I tried to kill your mother.

13
00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:10,667
 It's okay, I forgive you.

14
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:13,399
 I just can't forgive your mother.

15
00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:17,518
 Then don't, I won't either.

16
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:21,109
 She'll never stop coming for us. We can't run forever.

17
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:24,292
 I can, if I have you by my side.

18
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,799
 I can't live like that.

19
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:29,917
 What about me?

20
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:32,799
 What should I do?

21
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,660
 Go back to your mother.

22
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,992
Something feels off.

23
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:22,542
What're you doing?

24
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,999
- She's going to jump! 
 - Oh my!

25
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:28,030
- What's going on? 
 - Oh my, oh my!

26
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:16,742
She's here! 911 Hurry!

27
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:20,580
A person just fell from our apartment building!

28
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:29,060
Chaeyoung! Chaeyoung!

29
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:36,292
Please just open your eyes.

30
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:39,510
No… What do I do?

31
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:49,792
Chaeyoung!

32
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:52,501
Chaeyoung, open your eyes!

33
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:55,899
Why'd she have to do it here...

34
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:59,009
Chaeyoung!

35
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,750
Chaeyoung!

36
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:05,210
Chaeyoung! Chaeyoung, why!

37
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:09,642
What're you doing?

38
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:11,799
Why are you taking my sister?

39
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,092
We just need her statement. Let's go.

40
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:17,042
I'm a witness. I saw her commit suicide.

41
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:18,799
It happened just now.

42
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,799
I'll be back.

43
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:21,999
Hurry inside, Jihoo is by himself.

44
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,067
Yeah.

45
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:25,199
- We must go. 
 - Yes.

46
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,699
Now our apartment prices will fall!

47
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:30,817
Of course, they'll fall!

48
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:33,709
Causing everyone harm even in death!

49
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:37,592
Someone just died, is that what you care about?

50
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:39,967
You guys are disgusting.

51
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,160

52
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,392

53
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,017
Uncle.

54
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:58,599
Your suit... What happened?

55
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,167
It's dirty.

56
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:07,342
How'd this happen?

57
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:10,842
Trapped in a freezer, I almost froze to death.

58
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:15,599
I used a chemical reaction to blow up the door.

59
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:18,167
I barely survived!

60
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:20,599
You're always lying.

61
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,299
You aren't mad anymore? We can talk now?

62
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:28,167
Oh, I forgot.

63
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:32,342
But where's mom?

64
00:05:32,342 --> 00:05:34,618
Hey.

65
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:36,667
She went to work.

66
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,718
- But today's Sunday. 
 - She's working this Sunday.

67
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:43,342
- I saw her when she went. 
 - Okay.

68
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,318
Hey, you...

69
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:48,999
Just stay home today.

70
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,417
Don't go outside, okay?

71
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,992
Why?

72
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:54,892
It's hot.

73
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,392
It's really hot.

74
00:05:56,392 --> 00:05:59,292
You get sick when it's too hot.

75
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,799
I do?

76
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:07,642
Her ex used to live in our apartment before us.

77
00:06:08,342 --> 00:06:13,718
Before leaving the country, she wanted to reminisce in our home.

78
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:15,899
She really wanted to come in.

79
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:18,542
Why'd you go to the rooftop?

80
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:25,967
Something felt strange, I just walked.

81
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:30,750
I saw her walking up and followed her.

82
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:40,590
By the time I got up, she had already jumped.

83
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:52,417

84
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:56,242
When the maid comes, go home with her.

85
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,967
It's all your fault.

86
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:03,742
She jumped, because of you.

87
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:07,192
What are you saying?

88
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:11,199
She didn't want to leave, she wanted to run away.

89
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,999
She said she'd rather die!

90
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,792
Be quiet.

91
00:07:16,618 --> 00:07:19,767
Don't speak of this to anyone, okay?

92
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:22,399
Listen to me!

93
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,942
It's clear that she committed suicide.

94
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:38,999
No, there's no way she would do that.

95
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:43,192
She was excited to study abroad, why would she?

96
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:47,592
Do you know that she met with Dogyeong this morning?

97
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:51,442
I heard they were in love.

98
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:55,817
They dated and she even got pregnant.

99
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:59,417
Who the hell told you this? Who!

100
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:05,030
Wang Joonhee of Apt. 804, gave us her statement.

101
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:12,392
- She pushed her. 
 - What?

102
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:18,167
She pushed my daughter... She killed her!

103
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:20,392
There's no...

104
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,042
Are you sure?

105
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:26,542
Did you witness it?

106
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:32,692
I've told you everything I know...

107
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:34,967
May I leave...

108
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:40,999
What?

109
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:43,167
Hold on.

110
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:47,542
Do you have animosity against Chaeyoung's family?

111
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:49,292
Pardon?

112
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:52,917
Did you push Chaeyoung off the building?

113
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:56,918
What are you saying?

114
00:08:56,918 --> 00:08:58,892
Please sit.

115
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:01,718
She would never do that! That's crazy!

116
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:04,618
There's a lot of talk in the Momvely group chat.

117
00:09:04,618 --> 00:09:05,899
She didn't, right?

118
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:07,899
Jihoo's mom didn't push her off, right?

119
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:10,067
Of course not! What's going on!

120
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:12,217
Please tell them she didn't.

121
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:14,217
All right.

122
00:09:14,217 --> 00:09:15,042
Where's Noeul?

123
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:16,899
She'll go to Jihoo after her English lesson.

124
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:20,780
Are they serious? Has she gone insane?

125
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:31,999
 She didn't want to leave, she wanted to run away.

126
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:36,418
 She said she'd rather die!

127
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:43,167
How could you do this to me?

128
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:49,767
How can you disappoint me like this again!

129
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:54,551
Why didn't you just die?

130
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:57,192
You should've just died, and made things easier.

131
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:46,450
Don't wake up, just die! Just die!

132
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:57,751
I need to check the patient.

133
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:01,542
Yeah.

134
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:04,117
The police are investigating.

135
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:06,367
Yeah.

136
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,000
Who's the doctor in charge?

137
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:16,592
What happened?

138
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,999
Did you push her?

139
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:21,492
- Are you nuts! 
 - You didn't right?

140
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:24,492
By the time I got up there, she had already jumped.

141
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:26,892
Why is she saying, you pushed her daughter?

142
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:29,542
She doesn't want the truth to get out.

143
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:33,042
How can someone lie about something like this?

144
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:36,592
They have already spread rumors that you pushed her.

145
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:39,042
Did Jihoo hear it?

146
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:41,417
Yeah, his friends told him.

147
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,099
I told him it wasn't true.

148
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:46,192
Noeul's father is looking into it, don't be worried.

149
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:48,899
Who are you? Get out. You can't just come in here.

150
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,492
I was about to, I'm sorry.

151
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:52,442
- Just go, it's okay. 
 - You have to stop.

152
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:53,899
- Please take care of her. 
 - Wait outside.

153
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:58,699
- Hey. Take care of Jihoo. 
 - Yeah, of course.

154
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:01,870
All right, thanks.

155
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,300
Thanks.  Thank you.

156
00:12:05,717 --> 00:12:08,767
It's just taking longer since they have two statements.

157
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:11,692
Right? There's no way they believe that, right?

158
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:12,899
Of course.

159
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,417
There was no suspicion of murder to begin with.

160
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:18,083
It'll be finalized as a suicide attempt.

161
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,542
Oh, thank God!

162
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:25,392
How are you so well connected with the police?

163
00:12:25,392 --> 00:12:28,292
The kids are here anyways, let's all wait together.

164
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:31,018
Thank you so much. Do you want anything to drink?

165
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:34,392
Sure. But I don't have any change...

166
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:38,001
Neither do I.

167
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:48,099
I didn't know how terrifying Jihoo's mom could be.

168
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:49,692
But Chaeyoung...

169
00:12:49,692 --> 00:12:52,792
Why was she with Jihoo's mom in the first place?

170
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:55,417
She probably lured her there.

171
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:57,918
Look at how she seduced Noeul's father.

172
00:12:57,918 --> 00:13:01,999
It's still under investigation, we don't know anything yet.

173
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,392
We can't make serious accusations.

174
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:06,818
No, if Sis says it's true, then it is!

175
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:12,792
You don't think that she could've jumped?

176
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,909
What the hell did you say?

177
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:17,742
Sis.

178
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:20,367
Are you crazy? Say that again!

179
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,926
Why would my Chaeyoung attempt suicide?

180
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:25,767
What I'm saying is...

181
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:30,267
Chaeyoung is the hardest working child out there.

182
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,899
Don't talk behind her back as she lays in a coma.

183
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:35,101
You hear me?

184
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:39,467
- Congressman? 
 - Oh, Mrs. Park.

185
00:13:39,467 --> 00:13:41,592
What's going on?

186
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:45,567
I feel a bit of relief that you're here now.

187
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:50,599
I spoke with the head of the hospital, it'll be alright.

188
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:53,718
Should we leave? Does Sis need us?

189
00:13:53,718 --> 00:13:58,067
The congressman is here, let's give them some space.

190
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:01,967
Take care, we're here for you.

191
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,942
Please, follow me.

192
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:16,509
How can you say such stupid things?

193
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:20,509
How can you ignore the most obvious possibility?

194
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:23,942
She suddenly quits school? Suddenly has a flight to go abroad?

195
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:25,942
Be quiet, this is a hospital.

196
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:28,567
You wish she committed suicide, right?

197
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,517
What? Why would I?

198
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:33,792
If Chaeyoung really attempted suicide,

199
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:38,199
it'll harm Diamond's image, the position you want.

200
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:40,618
Wake up! None of that is important right now!

201
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:41,967
Stop acting so compassionately.

202
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:45,542
If you constantly have blind faith in her,

203
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:48,292
we might all suffer terrible consequences. Got it?

204
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:50,692
You have no loyalty.

205
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:54,692
It's better than falsely accusing someone of murder?

206
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:58,099
How do you know? Are you the police?

207
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:01,960
- Stop. 
 - Just stop! We're in a hospital!

208
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:13,599
I told you to be careful of renters.

209
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:18,818
We should have gotten rid of them sooner.

210
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,742
You're right.

211
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:26,518
I wanted to give renters a chance.

212
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:33,067
They've hated me since the consent form incident.

213
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:39,592
Their child even hospitalized Mingi for 8 weeks.

214
00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:44,317
I even let that go to give them a second chance.

215
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:48,167
You should have just told me.

216
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,142
No...

217
00:15:50,142 --> 00:15:53,818
I didn't want to bother you with everything...

218
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:57,199
I just wanted to take care of it.

219
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:01,942
Things just turned out miserably.

220
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:08,190
Mrs. Park, are you sure she pushed her off?

221
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:11,017
Of course.

222
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:16,042
For now, she'll be released for insufficient evidence.

223
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:20,390
We can't let her out, she should be locked up!

224
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:24,967
You don't have to try to help.

225
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:29,767
We're partners, this isn't about just you!

226
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:31,942
Congressman...

227
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:35,692
I'm so sorry and thankful.

228
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:40,942
Do we have any CCTV evidence or witnesses?

229
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:47,417
Well then...

230
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,392
Sis.

231
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:54,980
- Did you drive back? 
 - No, I was waiting here.

232
00:16:58,442 --> 00:17:03,699
I have to ask you for a big favor.

233
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:07,942
You know I trust you the most, right?

234
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:16,042
- This is taking too long! 
 - I agree.

235
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,792
Detective Choi! I...

236
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:23,292
Can you tell me what's taking so long?

237
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,818
She's been...

238
00:17:25,818 --> 00:17:28,799
Moved to a holding cell, she's now a suspect.

239
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,667
Suspect? How can she be a suspect?

240
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:35,099
I heard she's an alcoholic?

241
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:37,567
So what? She wasn't even drinking!

242
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:41,767
- Did you look into the phone? 
 - That's not my department.

243
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:43,999
You witnessed their relationship this morning.

244
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:46,792
You know about Chaeyoung and Dogyeong.

245
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:51,442
Dogyeong turning himself in shocked Chaeyoung.

246
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:53,042
Which is why she...

247
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:57,692
By the time my sister got up there she had jumped...

248
00:17:57,692 --> 00:18:02,192
What can I do? We have a witness!

249
00:18:02,192 --> 00:18:05,192
- Witness? 
 - Yes.

250
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:08,899
After a physical argument, she pushed Chaeyoung.

251
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:12,620
That's impossible! Who said that?

252
00:18:17,142 --> 00:18:18,667
No...

253
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:21,292
Sechan's mom, what did you say?

254
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:24,484
What did you see? You can't lie about this!

255
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:26,167
She's lying about everything!

256
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:29,967
Do you have proof that I'm lying?

257
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:33,067
Why are you doing this? Why...

258
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:34,417
An arrest warrant?

259
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:37,517
Do you seriously believe any of this?

260
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:43,292
What, why? What the hell is going on?

261
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:46,018
Higher-ups are involved in the investigation.

262
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:47,392
Higher-ups?

263
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:52,080
The chief of police is friends with Congressman Hwang.

264
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:59,570
Take care of Jihoo... Please look after him!

265
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:07,992
Exactly what I mean.

266
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:11,318
Can we have another bottle?

267
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:16,817
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:17,718 --> 00:19:19,967
- I'm sorry. 
 - Get out!

269
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:22,699
Please Congressman, I apologize.

270
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:25,042
- Hey! 
 - Please forgive me...

271
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:26,942
I shouldn't have meddled with your conference.

272
00:19:26,942 --> 00:19:28,942
I'm sorry for bothering all your work.

273
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:31,317
Please, everything is a lie.

274
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:33,567
Please believe me, Congressman.

275
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:36,799
She's using you to keep her social status.

276
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,592
She's just using you.

277
00:19:38,592 --> 00:19:39,699
Wait! Wait!

278
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:42,875
Please, let me just...

279
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:46,800
Hey! Excuse me!

280
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:56,692
Yeah...

281
00:19:56,692 --> 00:20:00,718
I heard some strange information from a friend...

282
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:03,292
Chaeyoung was pregnant.

283
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:06,767
I think she attempted suicide.

284
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:09,590
About that...

285
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:13,992
- Sechan's mom is a witness. 
 - Witness to?

286
00:20:13,992 --> 00:20:16,467
My sister pushing Chaeyoung.

287
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:20,250
What? How does that make any sense?

288
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:22,992
Exactly.

289
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:26,942
I don't understand all you Momvelies.

290
00:20:26,942 --> 00:20:30,618
I tried to, but I just can't.

291
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:33,718
How can you do this?

292
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,610

293
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:44,999
What?

294
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:49,167
Why are we all gathered here at night?

295
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:53,567
Oh, Sis! Why are you here?

296
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:57,717
It's an emergency meeting, how can I miss it?

297
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:01,192
Did you see Jihoo's mom push Chaeyoung?

298
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:02,592
What?

299
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:06,292
Yeah. I did.

300
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:08,692
Why didn't you mention it before?

301
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:10,417
Everything was moving fast.

302
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:12,142
Fast?

303
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:15,100
You're just making this up, you're lying.

304
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,167
Lying about what?

305
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:19,167
Do you have proof?

306
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:20,718
And Sis?

307
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:22,667
You take down my husband's banner,

308
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:26,217
and suddenly put her husband's carwash banner?

309
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:31,542
Did you speak with Jihoo's family about this?

310
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:32,642
I'm sure she did.

311
00:21:32,642 --> 00:21:36,542
You've been acting suspicious for a long time now.

312
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:39,542
Since when have you sided with them!

313
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:42,999
Fine, if that's so important, let me tell you.

314
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:46,792
I gave Jihoo's uncle the last blue bird vote.

315
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:50,417
I gave them the voice recording for the forged forms.

316
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:53,542
You traitor! And you call yourself a Gold Momvely?

317
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:57,417
Exactly! I did it because I am!

318
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,542
I want the Momvelies to stop being so corrupt!

319
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:05,175
If they figure out your false testimony, we're all screwed!

320
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:11,417
Is there proof she didn't push my Chaeyoung?

321
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:16,167
Always about evidence... No, there's no evidence.

322
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:20,667
But there is evidence of you lying.

323
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:21,999
Let's hear it.

324
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:24,792
What lies could our Diamond possibly have said?

325
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:30,876
A male student won the future creative talent scholarship.

326
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:33,718
Chaeyoung getting a scholarship to study abroad?

327
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:36,167
They're all les.

328
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,259
She was pregnant.

329
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:41,267
That's why she left school, Sis.

330
00:22:45,592 --> 00:22:47,334
Chaeyoung...

331
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:52,499
She was stalked and raped...

332
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,692
Sechan's mom and I already heard from Sis...

333
00:22:57,692 --> 00:23:01,599
Would you... be honest about it, if it was your daughter?

334
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,999
Would you tell everyone your daughter was raped!

335
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:09,292
Are you crazy? Don't bring my kid into this!

336
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:12,792
It's my fault. Everything is my fault.

337
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,999
Sis! Sis! It's not your fault.

338
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:21,642
I've always known how jealous she was of me

339
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:27,417
But... how could she bring my daughter's pain into this?

340
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:31,542
It's okay stop talking about it. I'll explain.

341
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:36,292
A renter's son planned to extort money from Sis!

342
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:41,792
They threatened her but she got them to move away!

343
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:47,167
Now Jihoo's family planned to kill Chaeyoung!

344
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:51,167
We should all stick together and fight this!

345
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:53,792
Do you actually believe any of this?

346
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:58,059
Why wouldn't we believe our Diamond?

347
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:02,542
Chaeyoung's problems...

348
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:06,999
They aren't your business, it's all personal...

349
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:12,542
As the Diamond, have I done wrong by all of you?

350
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,999
If you think so, I'll quit my position.

351
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:20,542
 No, please don't. Don't do that.

352
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:26,542
At least I have the congressman to help me...

353
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:28,999
He has complete faith in me.

354
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:34,192
I've always put Momvelies before everything in my life...

355
00:24:34,192 --> 00:24:37,667
Which is why I believe you have my back.

356
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:40,399
Of course! We believe you!

357
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:42,751
We should all stick together!

358
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:45,126
- Right! 
 - That's right, Sis.

359
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:50,292
Get out! Get out of here!

360
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:53,667
You don't deserve to be a Gold Momvely!

361
00:24:56,792 --> 00:25:00,967
- Thank you all. 
 - Of course, Sis.

362
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:22,442
You don't want to see me?

363
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:28,392
I'm embarrassed.

364
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,667
I missed you.

365
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:41,418
How are you?

366
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,892
How's Chaeyoung?

367
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:52,692
Her surgery went well...

368
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:58,842
If she dies...

369
00:26:01,442 --> 00:26:04,067
will I be a murderer?

370
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,092
I won't let that happen.

371
00:26:14,592 --> 00:26:17,517
My friend is a famous lawyer.

372
00:26:17,517 --> 00:26:21,342
He'll be by your side every step of the way.

373
00:26:21,342 --> 00:26:26,117
I have friends who are prosecutors as well.

374
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:33,642
No one believes me in here...

375
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:38,542
I believe you.

376
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:10,392
Why isn't anyone here with her...?

377
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:32,267
Hey, Chaeyoung.

378
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:34,792
We've met at the park.

379
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:39,542
I'll introduce myself.

380
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:42,999
I live in the apartment Dogyeong lived in.

381
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:46,317
And the lady that saw you last?

382
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:49,067
I'm her younger brother.

383
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,142
I don't know if you know

384
00:27:51,142 --> 00:27:56,642
but I stopped Dogyeong from stabbing your mom.

385
00:27:56,642 --> 00:28:01,242
We don't know each other, but we've been through a lot.

386
00:28:06,842 --> 00:28:10,467
I know you're scared.

387
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:12,999
You must be lonely... Right?

388
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:15,967
How do I know?

389
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:18,792
I was in your shoes recently.

390
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:21,999
After the surgery, I just laid there.

391
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:25,199
It felt like...

392
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:28,899
I was stuck in a dark room alone.

393
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:32,167
I could hear faint voices of people, but...

394
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,718
my body wouldn't listen, I couldn't move.

395
00:28:34,718 --> 00:28:36,918
I was terrified.

396
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,918
And lonely...

397
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:44,417
I'm just here to keep you company.

398
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:45,967
So?

399
00:28:46,967 --> 00:28:50,899
I'm super ultra cool, huh?

400
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:54,292
But you know what's better?

401
00:28:54,918 --> 00:28:58,917
Tada! Your favorite coffee!

402
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:04,999
I went to visit Dogyeong, he told me to get this for you.

403
00:29:05,717 --> 00:29:10,099
I didn't know young kids drank this.

404
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:13,799
Usually, it's old grandpas that drink this coffee.

405
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:25,017
I used to be able to do this... I'm bad at everything.

406
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:37,118
I lost both my parents when I was really young.

407
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:40,799
I'd never argued with my mom before.

408
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,499
I don't even know her.

409
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:45,799
I can't remember.

410
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:47,692
All I had was...

411
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:52,199
my sister.

412
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:56,567
She's only two years older than me but...

413
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:58,692
she practically raised me.

414
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:07,692
But now my sister is... locked up.

415
00:30:07,692 --> 00:30:12,992
Because... they're framing her for pushing you.

416
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:15,567
Outrageous, right?

417
00:30:17,576 --> 00:30:20,618
Completely outrageous…

418
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,580
But what makes me angrier is...

419
00:30:25,042 --> 00:30:29,292
I can't do anything for her, I just have to wait.

420
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,867
I'm really angry.

421
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:43,142
Christ, Buddha,

422
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:46,042
any and all gods...

423
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:51,742
I've never prayed before, but please help me.

424
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:56,692
Please, anyone, help Chaeyoung wake up.

425
00:30:57,292 --> 00:31:02,417
And help my sister from being framed.

426
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,818
What the hell are you doing here?

427
00:31:18,818 --> 00:31:21,417
How dare you come here, get out!

428
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:24,167
I was worried, I'm just checking on her.

429
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:27,599
Get out!  Get the hell out!

430
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:33,199
You try to murder her and now you're worried?

431
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:36,292
If you keep lying, do you begin to believe it's true?

432
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:38,718
It looks as if you believe what you're saying.

433
00:31:38,718 --> 00:31:40,299
Because it is!

434
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:43,167
Your family did this to my daughter!

435
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,767
You know we didn't.

436
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:47,167
You're the one who did this to her.

437
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,542
Me? Why would I?

438
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:54,892
Don't kid yourself, your sister pushed her.

439
00:31:56,818 --> 00:32:00,042
Why can't you admit she tried to kill herself?

440
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:05,667
Let's say Dogyeong raped her

441
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:10,299
and my sister pushed her, would that bring her back?

442
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:14,042
Isn't her well being the most important?

443
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:16,417
What are you trying to protect?

444
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:27,292
No matter what you say,

445
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:30,918
no matter who you talk to, no one will believe you.

446
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:36,099
She can say she's innocent but no one will listen.

447
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:40,567
That's what I'm protecting. Faith in me.

448
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:46,299
People will believe anything I say.

449
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:50,918
You'll never prove the truth.

450
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:52,542
Why?

451
00:32:52,542 --> 00:32:55,399
Everything is up to me.

452
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:15,399
Are you okay?

453
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:25,392
You must be so worried about Ji-hoo and his mom.

454
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:29,999
Someone should look after you, too.

455
00:33:32,818 --> 00:33:35,180
Did you eat?

456
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:39,092
You look terrible.

457
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:45,918
Are you okay?

458
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,867
What now?

459
00:33:51,192 --> 00:33:53,342
How do I help her?

460
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:58,299
I don't know what I can do anymore.

461
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,459

462
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,617
Jihoo!

463
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,167
Mom!

464
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:48,999
I'm okay, Jihoo!

465
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:51,559
I'm all right. Don't be worried, okay?

466
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:54,759
Don't worry. Everything will work out, okay?

467
00:34:58,784 --> 00:35:01,800
Mingi's mom! Please!

468
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,999
Chaeyoung's mom, I beg you!

469
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:08,299
Don't do this. I have a son.

470
00:35:08,299 --> 00:35:11,784
It's my fault. I'll do anything, please?

471
00:35:11,784 --> 00:35:15,709
You don't need to beg here, do it in court.

472
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:19,751
Please, I'm sorry. We'll move.

473
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,792
Please let my mom go.

474
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:24,399
Jihoo stop, don't behave like this.

475
00:35:31,867 --> 00:35:34,799
Chaeyoung!

476
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:38,242
Are you okay?

477
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:42,692
Why didn't you call, I would've gone to you!

478
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:47,199
Say that she pushed you.

479
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,442
I'll take care of the rest, do you understand?

480
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:54,199
Someone told me...

481
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,999
My body won't listen, but

482
00:35:56,999 --> 00:36:01,742
you could hear all the faint voices.

483
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:06,792
What?

484
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:09,667
"Why didn't you just die."

485
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:13,592
"Why didn't you just die."

486
00:36:13,592 --> 00:36:15,834
"Don't wake up, just die."

487
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:17,292
"Just die already."

488
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:19,167
"Just die..."

489
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,499
I really did.

490
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:28,292
No... Chaeyoung...

491
00:36:28,292 --> 00:36:34,167
I was just really emotional and upset...

492
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:39,542
This is nothing!  I can fix everything for you.

493
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:41,792
You trust me?

494
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:43,417
No, I don't.

495
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:48,151
Everyone else might, but I don't.

496
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:58,992
I jumped off the rooftop myself.

497
00:37:03,642 --> 00:37:06,199
Please let her go.

498
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:08,775
She did nothing wrong.

499
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:15,717
I'm sorry.

500
00:37:20,918 --> 00:37:23,626
What? What's going on?

501
00:37:23,626 --> 00:37:27,599
What do you mean? You've committed perjury!

502
00:37:28,425 --> 00:37:29,999
Jihoo!

503
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:37,018
She can't go! Chaeyoung isn't in her right mind.

504
00:37:37,018 --> 00:37:38,999
She just woke up, you can't take her word.

505
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:41,100
This woman pushed her.

506
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,542
Don't just stand there!

507
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:46,242
You're a witness! You saw everything!

508
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:54,199
Just stop!

509
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:56,417
I jumped because of you!

510
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:59,767
I'd rather die, than live as your daughter!

511
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:09,267
How can you do this to me?

512
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:13,067
You're my daughter, you're mine!

513
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:18,299
I'm not your daughter, I'm your trophy.

514
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:22,442
Now your trophy is destroyed.

515
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:47,092
It must've been hard.

516
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:49,917
Thanks.

517
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:53,667
- I'm sorry. 
 - You're welcome.

518
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:56,250
I did everything.

519
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,967
But he really helped out!

520
00:38:59,742 --> 00:39:02,918
Should we go and eat some tofu?

521
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:06,392
She must be tired, I want her to get some rest.

522
00:39:06,392 --> 00:39:09,567
Yeah, Mom looks tired.

523
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:16,092
Can we get Noeul and eat some tofu?

524
00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:19,692
Shall we?

525
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:25,167
- Where's your wallet? 
 - I don't have it.

526
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,167
You don't?

527
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:28,292
- Uncle, do you like tofu? 
 - Of course!

528
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:31,292
- Then buy me tofu. 
 - All right, let's go.

529
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:36,442
Now!

530
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:44,292
Thank you.

531
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:49,042
I get to hold your hand, it was worth it.

532
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:54,892
I thought depending on others made me weak.

533
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,692
But I realized I can't do anything alone.

534
00:40:00,342 --> 00:40:03,067
You don't have to like me by yourself.

535
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:06,199
I'll share the same feelings.

536
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:18,167
Are you blushing?

537
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:25,617
I don't want to be a burden though.

538
00:40:25,617 --> 00:40:27,999
So this goes both ways.

539
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:29,667
You can depend on me.

540
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:31,992
I'll help you with everything.

541
00:40:42,642 --> 00:40:46,192
My apologies, Chief Kwak.

542
00:40:46,192 --> 00:40:49,217
I couldn't believe it was a suicide attempt.

543
00:40:49,217 --> 00:40:52,242
We had a witness, so I believed her.

544
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:56,267
I put you in a terrible position.

545
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:57,899
I'm sorry.

546
00:40:57,899 --> 00:41:01,292
I'll head over there, let's speak in person.

547
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,842
All right.

548
00:41:12,918 --> 00:41:16,418

549
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:32,899
Wait!

550
00:41:32,899 --> 00:41:35,310
Were you about to sit here?

551
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,200
Are you crazy?

552
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,567
- What's all this? 
 - Chaeyoung.

553
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:48,342
You said she never took cram lessons?

554
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:51,999
It turns out she was tutored every day?

555
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:53,999
You acted as if your family was rich?

556
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:57,292
You didn't even finish university?

557
00:41:57,292 --> 00:42:00,667
When was your divorce? Is everything a lie?

558
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:04,167
Husband in Dubai? You must be so happy!

559
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:06,167
He's a used car dealer!

560
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:08,292
Who investigated my past?

561
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,918
You thought I'd let this go?

562
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:14,167
I committed perjury for you!

563
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:17,467
How can everything be a lie?

564
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:22,092
You're a renter, your car is leased, furniture rented.

565
00:42:22,092 --> 00:42:24,542
I was curious about how you maintained everything.

566
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,542
You took cuts for introducing students to businesses.

567
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:31,417
You also took money for marketing behind our backs.

568
00:42:31,417 --> 00:42:36,417
You took membership fees and advertisements?

569
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:37,667
Yeah.

570
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:40,818
Is that all that you came up with?

571
00:42:40,818 --> 00:42:43,799
Don't make a scene, just leave us.

572
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:46,999
What will you do without me?

573
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:50,992
As much as you, I've learned how to steal.

574
00:42:50,992 --> 00:42:56,417
I created this, you want to take this away from me?

575
00:42:56,417 --> 00:42:59,718
Royal Momvely club is mine, I own this.

576
00:42:59,718 --> 00:43:03,142
- It's mine! 
 - Nothing is yours.

577
00:43:03,142 --> 00:43:07,867
From head to toe, you're all lies.

578
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:14,999
There's nothing you can do now.

579
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:17,192
Just accept it.

580
00:43:17,192 --> 00:43:24,442
If you had a good reputation to begin with, this wouldn't have happened.

581
00:43:27,718 --> 00:43:31,417
You have a good heart and incredible wealth,

582
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:34,492
a person like you should be in our government.

583
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:39,292
I want my son to take over, as I live volunteering.

584
00:43:39,292 --> 00:43:44,142
How about you volunteer for your district?

585
00:43:44,142 --> 00:43:47,992
Why don't you try this year's election?

586
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,999
Of course I want to, it'd be an honor, but

587
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:56,417
people will all smear my name behind my back.

588
00:43:56,417 --> 00:44:02,918
They won't accept me because of my company.

589
00:44:02,918 --> 00:44:08,067
I would never, I truly respect you, Ma'am.

590
00:44:08,067 --> 00:44:10,542
 Let me in!  Don't you know who I am?

591
00:44:10,542 --> 00:44:13,092
 He has a guest inside.

592
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:17,999
Ms. Park, what're you doing?

593
00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:23,542
Am I not allowed? Sorry, I didn't know you had a guest.

594
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:27,267
Oh, the president of Gangto Money?

595
00:44:27,718 --> 00:44:33,017
You must have urgent matters, go ahead.

596
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:38,899
I'll do my best to find your grandson.

597
00:44:38,899 --> 00:44:40,692
Please.

598
00:44:51,342 --> 00:44:56,417
You don't even answer your phone, are you serious?

599
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:57,910
You!

600
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:00,730
You crossed the line.

601
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:03,542
Fixing this is damn hard.

602
00:45:03,542 --> 00:45:06,999
- I can fix it for you. 
 - Ms. Park.

603
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:09,992
Let's end this here.

604
00:45:11,999 --> 00:45:16,518
Cutting ties with me will cause you some problems.

605
00:45:16,518 --> 00:45:21,167
Can you win the election without the Momvelies?

606
00:45:22,042 --> 00:45:25,967
You aren't the Diamond anymore, right?

607
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:28,999
Yeah.

608
00:45:30,192 --> 00:45:32,818
Congressman, the new Diamond.

609
00:45:32,818 --> 00:45:36,492
Oh greetings, new Diamond.

610
00:45:44,718 --> 00:45:50,318
 Dear residents, I'm the new Diamond, Cheon Dajeong.

611
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:54,542
Does she really believe that she's fit?

612
00:45:54,542 --> 00:45:56,818
Only Mingi's mom could handle that position.

613
00:45:56,818 --> 00:45:57,999
Momvelies are over.

614
00:45:57,999 --> 00:46:01,392
 We've decided to dismiss Park Hyeryeong.

615
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:07,999
 The entire Momvely club feels extremely sorry for any...

616
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:09,042
 And will apologize for...

617
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:12,799
- Looks good huh? 
 - Thank you.

618
00:46:12,799 --> 00:46:18,267
 Thank you for listening, I am Diamond Cheon Dajeong.

619
00:46:19,792 --> 00:46:21,218
Yes.

620
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:25,292
What do you mean?

621
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:29,192
Why does the owner want me out? We had a deal.

622
00:46:29,192 --> 00:46:31,999
 I heard you can't afford to pay rent anymore.

623
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:35,292
 He'll even pay for your moving expenses. Just go.

624
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,542
 Text me the password, I have to show the apartment.

625
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:38,417
You little...

626
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,199
I'll carpool Jihoo after badminton,

627
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:58,792
go on, meet the teacher.

628
00:46:58,792 --> 00:47:03,099
You're so smart and savvy.

629
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:05,918
Hello, Noeul's father, and Jihoo's uncle.

630
00:47:05,918 --> 00:47:06,792
Greetings.

631
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:09,292
You can't be friendly to me out in the open.

632
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:13,167
- My spy? 
 - It's okay now, I'm free.

633
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:15,792
Why? Did they kick you out?

634
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:18,542
What? No, I left on my own.

635
00:47:18,542 --> 00:47:21,667
Lose your pride and join us.

636
00:47:21,667 --> 00:47:24,417
You don't want to be enemies with the Diamond.

637
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:26,542
It's okay, not interested.

638
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:29,167
We'd never accept you.

639
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:32,042
- You're hilarious. 
 - Hey, you're more hilarious.

640
00:47:32,042 --> 00:47:35,799
No one believes you fit the position.

641
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:41,342
Did you know?

642
00:47:41,342 --> 00:47:44,042
She blackmailed businesses for everything she's wearing.

643
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:48,042
She can sell all that and pay rent for a few months.

644
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:50,792
She doesn't have many, she trades them in.

645
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:56,699
- Things just don't change... 
 - It's exactly the same.

646
00:47:58,999 --> 00:48:01,167
- Come with me. 
 - Yes!

647
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:03,042
 Park Sechan!

648
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:07,942
Hey, Sechan! You little...

649
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:10,042
Sechan!

650
00:48:10,042 --> 00:48:11,999
Oh my, Sechan!

651
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:15,142
Mingi! Are you crazy? Think you're a gangster?

652
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,918
He pushed me first.

653
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:19,999
Mingi, apologize! You want to get in trouble?

654
00:48:19,999 --> 00:48:23,042
Don't apologize. Good job, my son.

655
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:27,792
Is that how you want to play this? I'll show you how I play.

656
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:31,417
I'll do what you've done to others, open a bullying case.

657
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:33,918
Ready to be expelled? Got it?

658
00:48:33,918 --> 00:48:37,342
Expelled? Do as you please.

659
00:48:37,342 --> 00:48:39,999
Mingi will study abroad anyways.

660
00:48:39,999 --> 00:48:41,442
Let's go.

661
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:44,718
Hey!

662
00:48:44,718 --> 00:48:46,718
- You! 
 - Stop acting classy!

663
00:48:46,718 --> 00:48:48,692
Let go of me!

664
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:51,542
- Let go! 
 - I'll ruin your life!

665
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:52,999
I said let go!

666
00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:55,917
- Should we stop them? 
 - Leave them alone.

667
00:48:57,592 --> 00:48:59,392
Park Hyeryeong?

668
00:49:00,718 --> 00:49:02,042
Park Hyeryeong?

669
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:03,542
I said let go of me!

670
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:06,167
We're the police, we're taking you in.

671
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:09,242
Take her! Get rid of this crazy woman!

672
00:49:10,999 --> 00:49:14,842
- What's wrong? 
 - You forged papers?

673
00:49:14,842 --> 00:49:19,999
Embezzlement, false reports, the list goes on and on.

674
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:22,917
- Excuse me? 
 - Let's talk at the station.

675
00:49:23,999 --> 00:49:27,499
- Good riddance! 
 - Let go of me.

676
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:30,292
Who? Who did this?

677
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:32,167
It's obviously Congressman Hwang!

678
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:36,642
You thought you were so smart. You didn't see this coming?

679
00:49:37,918 --> 00:49:39,042
Let's go.

680
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:43,467
Mingi, go home. Okay? 
 - Mom...

681
00:49:43,467 --> 00:49:44,792
Let go.

682
00:49:44,792 --> 00:49:46,292
Hey!

683
00:49:46,292 --> 00:49:48,292
I'll be back for you all!

684
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:51,792
I'm coming for you! You're all dead!

685
00:49:51,792 --> 00:49:52,999
Hey!

686
00:49:52,999 --> 00:49:55,417
Ouch, that hurts!

687
00:49:56,892 --> 00:50:01,817
 That was the last we heard from that family.

688
00:50:08,899 --> 00:50:14,392
 Soon after, Mom received mail from someone.

689
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:25,399
Isn't that Mom's handkerchief?

690
00:50:26,142 --> 00:50:28,042
- You remember? 
 - Of course.

691
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:32,667
Both our names are embroidered inside... Yup.

692
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:34,167
Who sent it?

693
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:36,792
Wow.

694
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:38,759
There's a letter.

695
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:46,517
 Thank you for lending this to me.

696
00:50:46,517 --> 00:50:49,217
 I don't need it anymore.

697
00:50:49,217 --> 00:50:54,118
- What'll happen to Dogyeong? 
 - He'll be out soon.

698
00:50:55,959 --> 00:51:00,250
 Uncle said he had to buy something for that guy.

699
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:06,126

700
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,417
- How is it? 
 - Delicious.

701
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:16,418
Amazing, right?

702
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,040

703
00:51:30,042 --> 00:51:33,799
So you just want me to be a producer?

704
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:38,692
Exactly, I don't think the limelight is...

705
00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:43,918
On the phone, I thought you wanted a singer.

706
00:51:43,918 --> 00:51:46,999
Yeah, well...

707
00:51:46,999 --> 00:51:51,042
I don't think that would work, he's also old.

708
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:54,901
And extremely unique.

709
00:51:54,918 --> 00:51:58,899
For us to take a chance on him is...

710
00:51:58,899 --> 00:52:01,042
A bit too adventurous.

711
00:52:01,042 --> 00:52:05,042
Can we have time to think about it?

712
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:06,717
Sure.

713
00:52:06,717 --> 00:52:10,292
- I'll be waiting. 
 - Shouldn't we just...

714
00:52:12,718 --> 00:52:15,999
What's wrong with writing music? It's better than nothing.

715
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,042
J. King's version of "Vanilla" is by far the best.

716
00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:22,292
I want people to hear someone sing with sincerity.

717
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:26,017
You've waited this long, a little more won't hurt.

718
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:29,692
You know what I've realized recently?

719
00:52:29,692 --> 00:52:33,217
To live properly, you must have money and power.

720
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:37,717
I don't have influence so at least I should have money.

721
00:52:37,717 --> 00:52:41,401
Their deal was a pretty good offer.

722
00:52:41,417 --> 00:52:45,542
Would you like to be the after-school band teacher?

723
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:47,192
Teacher?

724
00:52:47,192 --> 00:52:50,667
- You're joking. 
 - No, I'm serious.

725
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,667
I'm not fit to be a teacher.

726
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:55,918
How could I pass the government teaching exam?

727
00:52:55,918 --> 00:52:58,692
You don't have to if you're an after-school teacher.

728
00:52:58,692 --> 00:53:03,299
Our teacher was in an accident, we need a substitute.

729
00:53:03,299 --> 00:53:05,999
- Can anyone do it? 
 - Not anyone!

730
00:53:05,999 --> 00:53:08,142
J. King won first place on a TV show.

731
00:53:08,142 --> 00:53:11,501
You're more than qualified in experience.

732
00:53:11,501 --> 00:53:15,042
It's also an emergency situation for the school.

733
00:53:15,042 --> 00:53:18,317
What do I do...

734
00:53:18,317 --> 00:53:20,599
What do I wear?

735
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:25,542
Wow... You must be loaded!

736
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:28,342
Everything is designer!

737
00:53:28,342 --> 00:53:33,399
Wow... Louis Buitton, Ducci, Tom Yellow...

738
00:53:33,399 --> 00:53:34,718
Big Brother, can I really...

739
00:53:34,718 --> 00:53:37,967
- try these on? 
 - Of course.

740
00:53:38,999 --> 00:53:42,242
- It won't fit. 
 - I'll make it work.

741
00:53:42,242 --> 00:53:45,592
Monday to Sunday...

742
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:52,292
I don't think that's right...

743
00:53:52,292 --> 00:53:56,067
He's really dirty, he'll probably ruin it.

744
00:53:56,067 --> 00:54:01,092
My nephew, if you lie, you'll grow butt hairs.

745
00:54:01,092 --> 00:54:03,417
- Gross. 
 - I'm used to it now.

746
00:54:03,417 --> 00:54:06,499
Don't worry about it, borrow anything.

747
00:54:06,499 --> 00:54:10,299
Now that we share a closet, I feel even closer to you.

748
00:54:10,299 --> 00:54:11,342
Anyways, congratulations.

749
00:54:11,342 --> 00:54:15,042
Please teach my daughter well, Teacher J. King.

750
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:18,199
Teacher?

751
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:31,899
Did you really have to go and borrow all that?

752
00:54:31,899 --> 00:54:36,092
Borrow? We're family now. Family.

753
00:54:36,092 --> 00:54:38,899
No, we aren't, don't go overboard.

754
00:54:38,899 --> 00:54:42,042
Hey, hey, hey!

755
00:54:42,042 --> 00:54:43,542
There is also something for you!

756
00:54:43,542 --> 00:54:46,999
He waited in line to buy this for you.

757
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:50,120
Did you tell him you like Castera?

758
00:54:50,692 --> 00:54:52,767
I didn't tell him.

759
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,118
Min Jihoo.

760
00:54:57,467 --> 00:55:00,767
What? He asked me, so I told him.

761
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:02,959
Perfect fit.

762
00:55:02,959 --> 00:55:05,999
It's perfect, the length is perfect.

763
00:55:05,999 --> 00:55:08,618
Wearing it long is trendy.

764
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:11,667
Move.

765
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:14,042
How disrespectful.

766
00:55:14,042 --> 00:55:17,542
I'm a teacher, you're a parent. Got it?

767
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:19,417
Where are you manners?

768
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:22,018
I'll break your legs.

769
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:22,918
Go throw this out.

770
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:25,542
You don't understand our new situation?

771
00:55:25,542 --> 00:55:30,417
I am responsible for your child's education, understand?

772
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:31,792
- Uncle? 
 - Why?

773
00:55:31,792 --> 00:55:33,099
I think she'll hurt you.

774
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:36,567
Never! No!

775
00:55:41,709 --> 00:55:44,567
Who should be the main in the after-school choir?

776
00:55:44,567 --> 00:55:48,818
Of course, it should be Sechan; it's always been Mingi.

777
00:55:48,818 --> 00:55:50,417
I have a different thought.

778
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:53,142
Shouldn't it be up to fair competition now?

779
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:57,267
Isn't it tradition for Diamond's son to be center?

780
00:55:57,267 --> 00:56:00,542
The teacher was in an accident, there's a substitute.

781
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:02,792
Can you go away?

782
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:05,042
This is school property, not yours.

783
00:56:05,042 --> 00:56:09,167
- You didn't know about the substitute? 
 - I knew, I heard.

784
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:12,718
The substitute was a popular musician.

785
00:56:12,718 --> 00:56:14,399
Who?

786
00:56:14,417 --> 00:56:17,567
- You don't know? 
 - Of course I know, I hear everything.

787
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:20,467
- So who is it? 
 - You don't know.

788
00:56:20,467 --> 00:56:23,342
He's coming, Teacher!

789
00:56:24,342 --> 00:56:26,918
Greetings, Mothers.

790
00:56:28,217 --> 00:56:31,542
I'm the after-school choir teacher, J. King.

791
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:33,417
So annoying!

792
00:56:33,417 --> 00:56:35,792
This is ridiculous.

793
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:36,999
Excuse me.

794
00:56:36,999 --> 00:56:39,818
Move aside.

795
00:56:39,818 --> 00:56:41,999
- Which way was it? 
 - Oh this way, Sir.

796
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:45,317
- Please move. 
 - Out of the way.

797
00:56:49,918 --> 00:56:54,417
Principal, how can you give him a teaching position?

798
00:56:54,417 --> 00:56:58,692
You're practically spitting on our faces.

799
00:56:58,692 --> 00:57:01,999
Fire him immediately and find someone else.

800
00:57:01,999 --> 00:57:08,199
I thought things would change with a new Diamond.

801
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:13,542
- Your rude infringement continues. 
 - Excuse me?

802
00:57:13,542 --> 00:57:18,817
I would like you to stop acting in this manner.

803
00:57:20,342 --> 00:57:21,542
Oh my.

804
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:29,242
 Please come in.

805
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:31,792
It's a secret that I order from you.

806
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:35,618
My mother-in-law thinks I cooked everything.

807
00:57:36,792 --> 00:57:38,699
Right here, please.

808
00:57:38,699 --> 00:57:41,842
Put the vegetables in after it boils.

809
00:57:41,842 --> 00:57:44,742
- Goodbye. 
 - Excuse me.

810
00:57:44,742 --> 00:57:47,992
Do you have time for a cup of tea?

811
00:57:53,292 --> 00:57:56,967
You've gotten so pretty.

812
00:57:56,999 --> 00:57:59,500
All I did was change my lotion...

813
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,142
Oh, you're funny.

814
00:58:02,142 --> 00:58:05,167
- They say love makes women. 
 - You're way more pretty...

815
00:58:05,167 --> 00:58:10,217
I dump so much money into my skin care.

816
00:58:10,292 --> 00:58:12,399
Speaking of...

817
00:58:13,617 --> 00:58:16,042
This really helps.

818
00:58:17,042 --> 00:58:19,692
You want to try? You should, come here.

819
00:58:19,692 --> 00:58:24,792
Here, just like this...

820
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:29,092
It's a crime if a woman doesn't take care of herself.

821
00:58:29,092 --> 00:58:33,967
Were you always this muscular?

822
00:58:33,967 --> 00:58:38,050
Your metabolism is high, right? You don't gain fat?

823
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:40,267
I'm so jealous of you these days.

824
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:44,199
You have a rich boyfriend yet you work so hard.

825
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:46,299
You're amazing.

826
00:58:46,299 --> 00:58:50,167
My husband checks every single penny I spend.

827
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:52,917
He's such a prude.

828
00:58:53,899 --> 00:58:58,918
Noeul's father has never had any bad rumors.

829
00:58:58,918 --> 00:59:03,292
Every woman here tried to get his attention but failed.

830
00:59:03,292 --> 00:59:05,592
But suddenly, he's head over heels?

831
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:07,417
How lovely, right?

832
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:11,517
His body is like a beast. Boom, boom!

833
00:59:11,517 --> 00:59:13,867
Oh my, I'm sorry.

834
00:59:13,867 --> 00:59:16,292
I'm always alone these days.

835
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:20,892
I have no one to talk to, I'm excited to talk to you.

836
00:59:21,918 --> 00:59:27,067
Did you leave Momvely for siding with us?

837
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:30,899
No, I'm a woman with strong morals.

838
00:59:30,899 --> 00:59:34,817
I didn't take sides, I did the right thing.

839
00:59:35,442 --> 00:59:37,167
Thank you.

840
00:59:37,167 --> 00:59:42,717
Love or hate, I used to respect her a lot.

841
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:49,467
But she's done terrible things to get her way.

842
00:59:49,467 --> 00:59:52,817
Jihoo's uncle is the best.

843
00:59:52,817 --> 00:59:55,692
I didn't like him at first.

844
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:58,699
But I got to know his sincerity.

845
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:01,817
- He's a strange guy. 
 - Yes, extremely.

846
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,892
 This season's winner is...

847
01:00:06,892 --> 01:00:08,892
 your...

848
01:00:08,892 --> 01:00:11,499
 J. King!

849
01:00:17,899 --> 01:00:22,118
I am... J. King.

850
01:00:26,918 --> 01:00:28,542
You can applaud.

851
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:31,292
Did someone tell you all not to applaud?

852
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:33,942
There we go.

853
01:00:33,942 --> 01:00:35,167
My jacket is cool, right?

854
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:38,867
I used to wear this every day, it's from, umm...

855
01:00:38,867 --> 01:00:44,042
I'll keep my introduction short, a simple 30 minutes.

856
01:00:44,042 --> 01:00:48,099
You can all call me "Teacher J. King."

857
01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:52,817
I see a lot of familiar faces here today.

858
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:56,417
- Yes, Sechan? 
 - Am I at the center?

859
01:00:56,417 --> 01:01:01,417
- How is that fair? 
 - I'm Diamond's son.

860
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:04,118
My mom told me I had to be center.

861
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:07,417
Are you dreaming? It's not up to your mom.

862
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:12,167
Mingi always had special treatment. Why can't I?

863
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:16,042
Don't compare yourself with someone that isn't even here.

864
01:01:16,042 --> 01:01:20,999
So you're the center? Because your uncle teaches?

865
01:01:20,999 --> 01:01:22,999
Hey, hey, stop now.

866
01:01:22,999 --> 01:01:26,999
Can I be at the center? I'll look really pretty.

867
01:01:26,999 --> 01:01:29,167
Hey, shut up.

868
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:31,742
Don't talk to her like that.

869
01:01:35,967 --> 01:01:37,542
What's all this?

870
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:41,167
Uncle is really popular at school.

871
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:42,467
No way...

872
01:01:42,467 --> 01:01:46,342
Parents are bribing me to stand their kid in the center.

873
01:01:46,342 --> 01:01:49,342
Beauty and health products... Coffee and food...

874
01:01:49,342 --> 01:01:51,618
They want to introduce me to women, too.

875
01:01:51,618 --> 01:01:56,417
After how they've treated this entire time?

876
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:57,492
Do they have no pride?

877
01:01:57,492 --> 01:02:00,342
What parent puts pride before their kids?

878
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:04,242
Have a kid and you'll understand how they feel.

879
01:02:04,242 --> 01:02:06,999
There's an order to things in life.

880
01:02:06,999 --> 01:02:11,167
You have to marry to have children, you have to have children to raise children, silly.

881
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:14,167
- Just return everything. 
 - No, why...

882
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:18,699
- I agree, return them. 
 - No, they are all mine.

883
01:02:19,417 --> 01:02:22,792
If you accept this and they don't get what they want,

884
01:02:22,792 --> 01:02:25,418
they'll come after you again.

885
01:02:32,867 --> 01:02:33,792
What should I do?

886
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:37,292
Everyone wants to be in the center so bad.

887
01:02:37,292 --> 01:02:40,999
They don't understand that the center isn't important.

888
01:02:40,999 --> 01:02:44,692
Exactly! A choir is about balance, not the center.

889
01:02:44,692 --> 01:02:49,792
If you focus on one instrument, everything is lost.

890
01:02:49,792 --> 01:02:50,999
Exactly.

891
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:52,999
It's like that in a band as well.

892
01:02:52,999 --> 01:02:55,942
Do you know when they play best?

893
01:02:55,942 --> 01:03:00,730
When you focus on your peers and listen to them.

894
01:03:01,718 --> 01:03:03,167
Why?

895
01:03:08,292 --> 01:03:12,742
- What drawing is this? 
 - What could it be?

896
01:03:13,899 --> 01:03:14,999
It's abstract.

897
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:18,542
It is abstract. What could it be?

898
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:20,667
- Are you done coloring? 
 - Yes.

899
01:03:20,667 --> 01:03:23,618
Flip it over and you'll find a number.

900
01:03:23,618 --> 01:03:26,099
1,2,3,4,5,6... to 20.

901
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:28,792
Let's put it together by number.

902
01:03:28,792 --> 01:03:31,492
If you're done coloring, come up.

903
01:03:38,667 --> 01:03:40,042
He's better than us.

904
01:03:40,042 --> 01:03:43,417
How'd he figure that out? He's worked hard.

905
01:03:43,417 --> 01:03:45,667
Now, now, what is the drawing?

906
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:47,417
- A tree! 
   - A tree!

907
01:03:47,417 --> 01:03:50,999
Each of you drew different parts of a tree.

908
01:03:50,999 --> 01:03:53,799
Some drew the trunk, some drew leaves. Right?

909
01:03:53,799 --> 01:03:56,792
It became a tree but look.

910
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:57,999
How about now?

911
01:03:57,999 --> 01:04:01,999
 - The tree is cut.  
 - It's weird, right?

912
01:04:01,999 --> 01:04:04,542
- And now? 
  - It lost a branch.

913
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:05,999
It's not a tree anymore.

914
01:04:05,999 --> 01:04:11,299
If we lose a single part, the whole thing is ruined.

915
01:04:13,999 --> 01:04:18,799
Each piece is as important as the other.

916
01:04:19,542 --> 01:04:21,967
That's how life works.

917
01:04:21,967 --> 01:04:25,199
You can't accomplish anything alone.

918
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:28,542
Everyone must do their part well,

919
01:04:28,542 --> 01:04:32,092
to create a beautiful harmony.

920
01:04:32,092 --> 01:04:37,542
You're all smart, you know what I'm saying.

921
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:39,318
 Yes.

922
01:04:39,318 --> 01:04:45,999
Play rock, paper, scissors to take turns being center.

923
01:04:45,999 --> 01:04:50,542
Your previous teacher prepared a center focused song.

924
01:04:50,542 --> 01:04:54,167
Which is why I am changing the entire song.

925
01:04:54,167 --> 01:04:56,999
- What's this? 
  - A gift.

926
01:04:56,999 --> 01:04:59,167
What gift?

927
01:05:02,442 --> 01:05:07,299
Gifts your parents gave me to make you all center.

928
01:05:07,299 --> 01:05:12,367
Take them back home to your parents.

929
01:05:13,099 --> 01:05:14,792
I don't need them.

930
01:05:14,792 --> 01:05:18,267
I'm not sad to return them.

931
01:05:18,267 --> 01:05:21,667
- He looks sad. 
 - I'm sure he is.

932
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:25,742
I understand how badly they want their kids there.

933
01:05:25,742 --> 01:05:28,442
I'll take their feelings,

934
01:05:28,442 --> 01:05:33,292
and repay them by giving everyone a gift.

935
01:05:33,292 --> 01:05:35,240
A gift?

936
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,890
What could it be?

937
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:44,392
 - A letter for... 
 - A letter for...

938
01:05:44,392 --> 01:05:46,018
...you.

939
01:05:46,018 --> 01:05:50,999
We are a choir, let's share your voices.

940
01:05:50,999 --> 01:05:53,918
Do you want to write to your parents?

941
01:05:53,918 --> 01:05:54,999
 Yes.

942
01:05:54,999 --> 01:05:57,292
Well, then let's write.

943
01:05:57,292 --> 01:06:01,292
Take one, pass it on.

944
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:05,042
Our lyrics will be your letters.

945
01:06:07,042 --> 01:06:08,718
Are you stalking me?

946
01:06:08,718 --> 01:06:12,999
You can move their hearts, Teacher J. King.

947
01:06:12,999 --> 01:06:14,299
Thanks.

948
01:06:16,792 --> 01:06:18,167
Excuse me.

949
01:06:22,718 --> 01:06:25,467
Yes, Jaeseo.

950
01:06:25,467 --> 01:06:30,599
 I've been thinking. I've decided to forgive you.

951
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:33,467
 A kiss? Fine, it's okay.

952
01:06:33,467 --> 01:06:36,367
 Everyone makes mistakes.

953
01:06:38,417 --> 01:06:43,367
It wasn't a mistake.

954
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:52,299
I really like him.

955
01:07:06,542 --> 01:07:10,042
You were cool today.

956
01:07:10,042 --> 01:07:12,667
- Just today? 
 - Just today.

957
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:14,267
Just today.

958
01:07:14,267 --> 01:07:17,267
I'll take it.

959
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:20,092
Stay here, I'll get our food.

960
01:07:31,792 --> 01:07:35,792
Stay calm, let's run that way... I mean that way.

961
01:07:35,792 --> 01:07:38,667
Hold my hand. On my count, we bolt. Okay?

962
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:41,542
One, two...

963
01:07:50,999 --> 01:07:52,542
What...

964
01:07:52,542 --> 01:07:54,934
We made eye contact...

965
01:07:54,999 --> 01:07:57,792
Then why aren't they coming for you?

966
01:07:57,792 --> 01:08:00,542
Maybe they couldn't see us from outside?

967
01:08:00,542 --> 01:08:02,999
Almost had a heart attack.

968
01:08:02,999 --> 01:08:05,042
Let's get out of here, quickly.

969
01:08:05,042 --> 01:08:06,999
That way, that way.

970
01:08:07,918 --> 01:08:09,592
I'm sorry.

971
01:08:10,542 --> 01:08:13,067
Go straight?

972
01:08:13,067 --> 01:08:16,359
I found it, Noeul. Thanks.

973
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:19,167
Is there not anything you need?  Just tell me.

974
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:23,967
 Then do you mind if I cut your head off?

975
01:08:24,584 --> 01:08:25,492
What?

976
01:08:25,492 --> 01:08:29,167
 I'm doing a magic show for an after school project.

977
01:08:30,818 --> 01:08:32,818
 I need someone to practice on.

978
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:36,367
Okay, I'll do it.

979
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:40,042
She's strange.

980
01:08:41,999 --> 01:08:45,599
- Please enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

981
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:49,267
Oh my goodness!

982
01:08:50,099 --> 01:08:51,467
What?

983
01:08:51,467 --> 01:08:55,499
You rejected a date with me, why are you here?

984
01:08:56,442 --> 01:09:00,099
Who is he? Who's the other guy?

985
01:09:01,292 --> 01:09:04,367
I heard this was your favorite coffee shop.

986
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:09,092
I asked Noeul. Why are you here?

987
01:09:10,167 --> 01:09:11,817
It's for me?

988
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:30,592
Sorry, this is all I can afford.

989
01:09:30,592 --> 01:09:33,018
Can't you see, I'm dying of happiness.

990
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:36,267
I'm glad.

991
01:09:37,142 --> 01:09:41,242
But don't buy things for me, okay?

992
01:09:41,242 --> 01:09:43,467
You'll spoil me.

993
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:47,192
You do so much for me.

994
01:09:47,192 --> 01:09:50,267
It's because I love doing it.

995
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:54,542
I can watch Noeul anytime.

996
01:09:54,542 --> 01:09:57,342
And let me know if you need me.

997
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:11,090
I really like you, I don't need anything from you.

998
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:15,099
You don't have to try to be her mother.

999
01:10:19,042 --> 01:10:22,342
Then, what do I do?

1000
01:10:24,899 --> 01:10:28,642
Should I just focus on you?

1001
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:32,067
Yes, just like me back.

1002
01:10:32,999 --> 01:10:34,692
And...

1003
01:10:39,242 --> 01:10:41,467
don't leave me.

1004
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:46,870
Why would I?

1005
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:52,718
Noeul's mother left me.

1006
01:11:10,417 --> 01:11:12,492
I won't leave.

1007
01:11:21,542 --> 01:11:24,292
I'm always afraid that...

1008
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:28,617
something might go wrong.

1009
01:11:31,142 --> 01:11:32,767
Me too...

1010
01:11:34,417 --> 01:11:40,592
You're like a dream come true.

1011
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:45,092
I'm afraid I might wake up.

1012
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:50,742
We're both cowards.

1013
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:10,042

1031
01:14:14,999 --> 01:14:16,042
It looks great!

1032
01:14:16,042 --> 01:14:18,867
 Hello, I am the principal.

1033
01:14:19,567 --> 01:14:22,792
 What an amazing opening from our choir.

1034
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,125
 Absolutely amazing.

1035
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:27,018
Jihoo... you did great!

1036
01:14:27,018 --> 01:14:29,501
Noeul's magic show is up soon.

1037
01:14:29,501 --> 01:14:32,417
Yeah? Let me go cheer her on before.

1038
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:33,909
Just wait.

1039
01:14:33,909 --> 01:14:38,000
You were born for the stage! So cool!

1040
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,667
- It was better than practice! 
 - Really?

1041
01:14:40,667 --> 01:14:44,899
One of our biggest, newest school supporters...

1042
01:14:44,899 --> 01:14:49,317
I present to you, the president of Gangto Money.

1043
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:36,110

1044
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:55,200

1045
01:15:55,209 --> 01:15:56,125
 What?

1046
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:57,959
 Security! Security!

1047
01:15:57,959 --> 01:15:59,792
 I was right there, why didn't you tell me?

1048
01:15:59,792 --> 01:16:01,999
 If you leave without telling me,

1049
01:16:01,999 --> 01:16:02,959
 what am I to do?

1050
01:16:02,959 --> 01:16:05,659
 I plan on running for Seongjak congress.

1051
01:16:05,659 --> 01:16:07,918
 Nothing to fear if you have these!

1052
01:16:07,918 --> 01:16:08,918
 What're you doing?

1053
01:16:08,918 --> 01:16:11,918
 Can't you tell? I'm a bodyguard.

1054
01:16:11,918 --> 01:16:14,999
 If you distract my operations,

1055
01:16:14,999 --> 01:16:16,992
 I will come after you.

1056
01:16:16,992 --> 01:16:19,125
 If a year passes after our marriage registration,

1057
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:22,326
 I can legally become Jihoo's father.

1058
01:16:22,326 --> 01:16:23,759
 Insurance?

1059
01:16:23,759 --> 01:16:25,199
 Sign it.

1060
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:26,501
 Isn't it strange?

1061
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:27,083
 Joo Kyeongil.

1062
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,834
 He purposely approached you.

1063
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,792
 Please look through the contract.

1064
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:32,999
 What a nice stage.

1065
01:16:32,999 --> 01:16:37,284
 It's easy to manipulate the good-hearted and kind.

1066
01:16:37,999 --> 01:16:39,709
 They're easily trapped.

1067
01:16:39,709 --> 01:16:41,499
 J. King!

1068
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,800

1069
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:54,760
