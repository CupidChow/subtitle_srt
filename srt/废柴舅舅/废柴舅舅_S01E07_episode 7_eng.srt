1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,570

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,500

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,766

4
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:22,100

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,770

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,600

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,870

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,230

9
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:51,080

10
00:00:52,990 --> 00:01:00,010

11
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:09,092
 I really like Jihoo's mom.

12
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:14,180
 So please watch the way you speak to her.

13
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:28,817
 What's going on? What's this atmosphere? He's actually into her?

14
00:01:28,817 --> 00:01:32,867
 I told you this would happen. What should we do?

15
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:35,599
 If we don't let it go, then what should we do?

16
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,242
 But why are we talking through text?

17
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:42,899
Didn't you hear? Noeul's father told us to watch our mouths.

18
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:49,826
A public confession? That's really old-fashioned.

19
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:51,292
Was it bad?

20
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:53,692
It was cool.

21
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:55,767
Where'd Sis go?

22
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:58,520
Where's Joonhyeok?

23
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,630

24
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:18,192
 It's all your fault!

25
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:21,580
 Your lies ruined my relationship with Chaeyoung!

26
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:38,599
 Hey!

27
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:41,699
 Call 911...

28
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:25,067
He's not picking up. We don't have time.

29
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,818
Where's the evidence? My phone.

30
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:31,742
Uncle had it, he went to the bathroom.

31
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:34,042
Is he constipated?

32
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:36,067
What now?

33
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,540
 The number you have dialed is not answeringâ€”

34
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,233

35
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:48,699
Junhyeok? Where are you? Are you coming?

36
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:52,670
What?

37
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,275
The respirator! Hurry!

38
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:58,418
 Even when he fell unconscious,

39
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:01,850
 he held Noeul's phone tight.

40
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,160

41
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,492
 Uncle was stabbed while helping someone.

42
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:14,430
 His surgery went well but he hasn't regained consciousness.

43
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,150

44
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,840

45
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:37,899
 I'm Detective Choi, with Seongjak Police.

46
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,742
Mrs. Park Hyeryeong?

47
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:42,999
Why the hell are you out?

48
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:45,499
I've been looking all over for you.

49
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:47,899
Dogyeong didn't know about my pregnancy.

50
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:50,092
He didn't blackmail you.

51
00:04:50,092 --> 00:04:51,399
What?

52
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,899
How could you lie about something like this?

53
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,101
Do you believe what he's saying?

54
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:01,599
You're going to let him fool you again?

55
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,626
Can't you tell what kind of a person he is?

56
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:06,634
He tried to kill me.

57
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:10,167
He tried to stab me but someone else got hurt.

58
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,250
What?

59
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,899
If he dies, Dogyeong is a murderer.

60
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:17,575
Stop lying!  It's all lies!

61
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:19,510
Lies?

62
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:27,725
Seongjak Police? Yes, I'm Park Hyeryeong.

63
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:31,900
Yes, I was terrified and ran away.

64
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:38,290
Yes, the man with the knife was Jang Dogyeong.

65
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:44,025
What's happened? Did you catch him?

66
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:47,299
 He fled the scene but we're looking for him.

67
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:49,092
What about the man?

68
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:52,651
The man who was stabbed by Dogyeong.

69
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:54,599
Is he dead?

70
00:05:57,326 --> 00:05:59,800
His vitals are steady.

71
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,126
Operation site is clean, and without discharge.

72
00:06:02,126 --> 00:06:04,610
Let's wait and see.

73
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:19,850
I just brought some necessities.

74
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,651
I'll stay here, go home and get some rest.

75
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:24,875
You can bring whatever else you need.

76
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,976
Thank you for everything.

77
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:29,151
The bullying case was rescheduled?

78
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:33,620
Yes, they allowed us to push it back.

79
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:40,799
He's going to be fine, so don't worry.

80
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,799
He's also so careful about himself,

81
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:46,451
why would he meddle in someone else's business?

82
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:52,380
I'm sure it was a natural reaction, he's a good person.

83
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,499
Will Uncle be okay?

84
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:01,451
He won't die.

85
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:04,475
He wasn't stabbed directly in the heart.

86
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:09,660
He might have memory loss and lose a couple of senses.

87
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,975
He's a bigger coward than I am.

88
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:21,299
He must have been terrified. It looks painful.

89
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:25,025
It's really... dirty.

90
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,099
Uncle, wake up.

91
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,426
If you just wake up...

92
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:48,175
I promise to give you 100 wishes.

93
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:53,050
You should pinky promise.

94
00:07:56,776 --> 00:08:00,699
I swear to you.

95
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:07,690
So get some rest and wake up tomorrow.

96
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,950
Excuse me.

97
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:21,175
Soft eyes, I mean, Chaeyoung. Do you live here?

98
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:26,801
Yes, why weren't you at the hospital? I wanted to say goodbye.

99
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:29,000
Where are you going?

100
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,425
Studying abroad...

101
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:34,050
Are you okay to leave?

102
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:42,026
Close the window.

103
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:52,176
So this is how you knew about my treatment.

104
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:54,301
Is it okay for her to leave?

105
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,951
I don't think she's recovered yet.

106
00:08:56,951 --> 00:09:00,150
I swear if you tell anyone about this.

107
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:04,500
Don't worry, I'm not like you.

108
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,201
Sure, I'll be there for the next get-together.

109
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:18,099
How are the kids?

110
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,900
Seunghyeon got into an elite school?

111
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,125
He must know Chaeyoung.

112
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,551
Does he know Chaeyoung?

113
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:25,175
Yeah, she's the valedictorian.

114
00:09:25,175 --> 00:09:26,175
Yeah! Shin Chaeyoung!

115
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:29,201
Our pride, Chaeyoung...

116
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:34,626
What? You're saying she dropped out?

117
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:36,676
Yeah...

118
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,799
Okay, let's talk soon.

119
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,975
All right, bye.

120
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:43,950
- What? 
 - What?

121
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,401
Should we ask Sis?

122
00:09:46,401 --> 00:09:49,301
You know the future creative talent scholarship, right?

123
00:09:49,301 --> 00:09:51,699
The student selection program hosted by MV Group?

124
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:57,150
Of course, they provide a full ride and a high-paying job after graduation.

125
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,326
What about it?

126
00:09:58,326 --> 00:10:00,175
Chaeyoung was selected.

127
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:02,050
She's moving to the United States.

128
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,399
Oh my!  Congratulations, Sis!

129
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:08,925
First her father, now Chaeyoung,

130
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:10,799
I'm sad everyone is abroad.

131
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,551
What an extraordinary and loving family.

132
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,799
What can I do?

133
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:20,426
Chaeyoung is just so interested in international affairs and trade.

134
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:23,150
You're so lucky, Sis.

135
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,050
Oh, "How I wish my Sodam was like Chaeyoung?"

136
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,425
Aren't you going to say it?

137
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:31,576
Don't even start, stop.

138
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:34,050
Oh right! Did you hear?

139
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,025
Remember the stabbing incident, recently?

140
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:38,401
Yeah, I heard about it.

141
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:43,350
It turns out the culprit was the son of a security guard here.

142
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,550
Really?

143
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,401
The person who was stabbed? It was Jihoo's uncle.

144
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:48,526
No way!

145
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:51,000
- Do they know each other? 
 - I don't know.

146
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,899
Is he dead?

147
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,175
- Do you want him dead? 
 - No, I was just curious.

148
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:58,050
He's alive, not dead.

149
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,426
But he's in a coma.

150
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:05,499
So that's why they moved the bullying case.

151
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:10,099
Stop arguing and post a notice on the Momvely website.

152
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:12,526
Don't let anyone mention the incident on our site.

153
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:14,900
Just mentioning it can effect our apartment prices.

154
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,799
You're so smart, always one step ahead.

155
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:21,220
I can't believe that happened here!

156
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:32,125
Back again?

157
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,299
Please don't hit me.

158
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:37,000
If you're worried about him, go to the hospital.

159
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,799
You're here to say, "Is he okay? How is he?" right?

160
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,375
Is he okay? How is he?

161
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,534
Jeez!

162
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:52,776
I'd feel so bad for J. King, if he died like this.

163
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:54,576
Don't even say that.

164
00:11:54,576 --> 00:11:56,651
How unlucky is he?

165
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:59,426
He hasn't even shown the world his potential.

166
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:02,551
Just a sad life of hardship and debt...

167
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:05,676
Never having the chance to get married.

168
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:08,899
Even if he lives, he doesn't have a great chance at marriage.

169
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:11,150
Stop crying, your mascara will smear.

170
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,751
It's waterproof.

171
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:16,199
Maybe, but I don't believe the advertisements.

172
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:22,125
You should visit him in the hospital before he dies.

173
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,501
Is it really that bad?

174
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:26,000
Does that matter?

175
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,250
That's so evil and selfish.

176
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,526
J. King risked going to prison to get your job back.

177
00:12:31,526 --> 00:12:34,676
You basically used him while acting like his fan.

178
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:38,325
Now that he's hospitalized, you won't even visit?

179
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,201
Are you trash?

180
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,899
There she goes again, murdering someone's soul.

181
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,626
Full power drinking?

182
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:53,000
You want to see who can drink more?

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,426
I want to go and it's driving me crazy!

184
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:59,799
Then go. You have feet and eyes, don't you?

185
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,250
Just go and see him.

186
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,275
He told me not to be his fan anymore.

187
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:05,999
To keep my distance from him...

188
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:08,000
He doesn't even greet me anymore.

189
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
How could I go see him?

190
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,375
What is this? Some kind of Joseon play acting?

191
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,350
Why are you so difficult?

192
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm not difficult!

193
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,699
I have a flexible personality!

194
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:26,099
Wouldn't that make me a bad person if I do something he doesn't want me to?

195
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:28,175
How can you be so clueless?

196
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:31,999
He said that because he cares about you!

197
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:34,250
Because you have a boyfriend.

198
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,000
He hates bad rumors about you.

199
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,426
Can't you see that he's in love with you?

200
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:41,375
- Hey! 
 - What?

201
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:45,199
Don't confess on his behalf.

202
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,799
Did I just ruin it?

203
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,030
What do you mean?

204
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,000
He's into me?

205
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,501
Dad, I messed up.

206
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:57,551
Just go with it, you already spilled it.

207
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:59,676
Yeah, well! J. King likes you a lot.

208
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:02,275
He's completely over me and into you.

209
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,401
Head over heels! Happy?

210
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:07,125
There's no way...

211
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,299
He's just being nice because I'm a fan.

212
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,899
How can a teacher be this clueless?

213
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,799
Becoming a teacher must be easy.

214
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,501
Teacher, men...

215
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:24,225
don't even lift a finger unless they're into a woman.

216
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:26,501
Listen to this.

217
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:28,501
J. King wrote this while thinking about you.

218
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,126
A song?

219
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:57,501
â™«  It'll take me a while  â™«

220
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:05,167
â™«  To erase you from my mind  â™«

221
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:11,792
â™«  Can you just say something  â™«

222
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:18,709
â™«  Instead of looking at me with sorrow  â™«

223
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:22,999
 Okay!

224
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:26,459
 Straight ahead, please.

225
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:37,834
â™«  I'll miss your beautiful smile  â™«

226
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:49,375
â™«  But as time passes by  â™«

227
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:57,125
â™«  We'll slowly forget each other  â™«

228
00:15:57,918 --> 00:16:02,834
â™«  I hope you're happy  â™«

229
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:06,459
â™«  I hope you forget me  â™«

230
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:10,959
â™«  Now it's time to say goodbye...  â™«

231
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:20,551
Sorry, it took me so long.

232
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:27,399
Sorry, I didn't notice your feelings.

233
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:39,800
Laying there like you're Snow White?

234
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:47,876
I remember a kiss woke her up...

235
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,126
I need to check his blood pressure.

236
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,776
Oh, you're awake!

237
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:36,375
Wang Joonhyeok! Wang Joonhyeok!

238
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,975
Great, just wait.

239
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:57,000
Nurse, did you just kiss me?

240
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,500
What?

241
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,750
No!

242
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:09,526
What's wrong with him?

243
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:11,301
I think it's the painkillers.

244
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:13,901
Why'd you kiss...

245
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:20,250
Uncle, are you okay?

246
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,125
The bullying case...

247
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,001
Noeul's phone... Her phone...

248
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:33,125
Where am I? Is this Heaven?

249
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:37,375
I'm alive? I'm alive...

250
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,000
Noeul's here, too. How lovely...

251
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,576
You've grown so much, how many years was I out?

252
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:52,126
Hug me, Jihoo.

253
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:59,750
I made it. Your uncle is alive. Uncle...

254
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,501
Thank goodness...

255
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:12,326
You promised me 100 wishes, right?

256
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:21,001
That was a dream.

257
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,850
Yeah?

258
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:30,925
I swear I heard it...

259
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,000

260
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:01,150
 Finally, you picked up.

261
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,451
Jaeseo...

262
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:06,999
 How could you keep me worried from abroad?

263
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:10,250
 You don't answer your phone, you don't move here...

264
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,699
 Are we even a couple?

265
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,467
I don't know anymore...

266
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:20,551
 You don't know? What're you saying?

267
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:22,218
I...

268
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:27,799
kissed another man.

269
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,999
 Song Hwaeum, are you crazy?

270
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,970
Detective...

271
00:20:35,842 --> 00:20:40,459
He woke up? Oh my, what a relief.

272
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:42,399
All right.

273
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:49,599
What about Dogyeong?

274
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:56,609
Listen to me carefully.

275
00:20:56,609 --> 00:21:01,334
You were stalked by a renter security guard's son.

276
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:04,083
He raped you and got you pregnant.

277
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:09,183
Dogyeong tried to use that to blackmail me then planned to kill me.

278
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:12,234
Did you say that to the police?

279
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:14,999
Did you lie to the police?

280
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:18,209
What? Should I tell them the truth?

281
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:20,959
You dated a renter's son, had an abortion,

282
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,999
dropped out, and went to a mental clinic?

283
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:26,859
Can you live with everyone knowing that?

284
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:28,584
Just move abroad.

285
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:30,999
I'll cover for your mistakes.

286
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:35,659
Forget everything, become a lawyer then come back.

287
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:38,334
It's the only way to make up for your failure.

288
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:51,283
I'm so upset.

289
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:52,834
Why?

290
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:56,509
Jihoo doesn't answer my calls or text.

291
00:21:56,509 --> 00:22:00,209
He's just busy with his uncle.

292
00:22:00,209 --> 00:22:02,209
Is it really that bad?

293
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:05,334
He woke up, don't worry.

294
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:07,709
How do you know?

295
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:09,759
I was worried, too.

296
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:12,609
I asked your father's friend who works there.

297
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:16,234
His wound is healing just fine.

298
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,484
I'm glad.

299
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:19,634
- Mom. 
 - Yeah?

300
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:22,899
- Did you know? 
 - What?

301
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:26,634
I like you more these days.

302
00:22:26,634 --> 00:22:29,384
You didn't like me before?

303
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:31,509
Of course not!

304
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:35,999
You always told me to become like Chaeyoung!

305
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:38,209
You're right.

306
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:39,959
I'm sorry, Sodam.

307
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:44,899
Your grandmother stressed me out constantly about a son. I'm sorry.

308
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:48,584
Don't worry, I'll make you rich.

309
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:52,999
That's so sweet, you're so mature now.

310
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:56,859
Gold Momvelies only talk about apartment prices.

311
00:22:56,859 --> 00:23:01,283
They're mean to renters, and try to change the school.

312
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:02,334
They're so annoying.

313
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:06,083
We used to be different...

314
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,883
We've lost sight of what matters.

315
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:11,109
I'm sorry Sodam.

316
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:13,484
It's okay.

317
00:23:13,484 --> 00:23:15,084
Eat up.

318
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:30,359
Disappointed that I'm alive?

319
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,709
How could I?

320
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:36,134
You didn't even call for help.

321
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:41,959
What was he to your daughter?

322
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,083
 It's all your fault!

323
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:47,099
 You ruined my relationship with Chaeyoung!

324
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:48,609
I'm just curious.

325
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:53,909
What lies you made up to drive him crazy enough to do that...

326
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:58,999
I paid for your surgery.

327
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:02,334
So just keep your mouth shut.

328
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:06,484
Why do you think that you can order me around?

329
00:24:06,484 --> 00:24:09,234
I got stabbed for you, paying my bills is courtesy.

330
00:24:09,234 --> 00:24:12,709
You're acting as if you did me a favor.

331
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:15,009
You think I'm stupid?

332
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:21,083
I'll settle Jihoo's bullying case.

333
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,209
That's what you want?

334
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:25,083
I want the hearing.

335
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:28,483
We have incredible evidence.

336
00:24:33,584 --> 00:24:35,209
How's this?

337
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:38,459
I'll allow you to live in your apartment.

338
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:40,234
What are you talking about?

339
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:42,109
How is that up to you?

340
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:48,399
Your home isn't registered to your family, you're living there illegally.

341
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:51,083
Are you obsessed with our family?

342
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:54,083
I have no interest in any of you.

343
00:24:54,083 --> 00:25:01,359
But if you get in my way, you'll have my full attention.

344
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:07,899
Oh!  I get it, just back off from us.

345
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:11,734
I don't know anything, I didn't see anything. Right?

346
00:25:12,584 --> 00:25:15,599
I told you to find him as fast as possible!

347
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:19,909
Find him before the police get him!

348
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:27,083
Are you stupid!

349
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:31,999
You fought and took a knife for her?

350
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:34,609
Do you know who stabbed me?

351
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:36,083
He used to live in our home.

352
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,999
What are you talking about?

353
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:39,799
Call the police.

354
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,509
Just tell them everything you know.

355
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:44,109
That's scaring me, put that down while we talk.

356
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,999
The kids are involved, let's just stay out of this.

357
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:49,509
Kids? What kids?

358
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:50,999
What's going on?

359
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:56,584
The guy who stabbed me and her daughter, something's there.

360
00:25:56,584 --> 00:26:00,883
The guy who stabbed you was Chaeyoung's ex?

361
00:26:00,883 --> 00:26:05,083
He got her pregnant then blackmailed them! He's garbage!

362
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,899
What do you mean?

363
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,009
How do you know Chaeyoung?

364
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,659
Remember the ultrasound?

365
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:16,983
Could that be Chaeyoungs?

366
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:23,083
If she finds out we know, she'll go crazy.

367
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,334
Oh, so she came to silence me.

368
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:29,083
Paying for my hospital bills, offering to settle Jihoo's case...

369
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,509
If rumors spread, she'll blame us for everything.

370
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:35,999
Let's just play stupid, and not mention this to anyone.

371
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:39,799
Stop getting involved in other people's businesses.

372
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:01,209
 It's me, Chaeyoung.

373
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:03,334
 The guy you stabbed survived.

374
00:27:03,334 --> 00:27:05,209
 Don't get caught, run away.

375
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:06,759
 My mom is after you.

376
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:09,584
 And meet me, Sunday morning.

377
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:13,009
 I'll be waiting at the park, please come.

378
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:28,184
Go, go, go!

379
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:32,234
Stop, that way, left, back!

380
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:36,009
I don't feel like going that way, turn me.

381
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:40,999
Use your hands, they aren't injured.

382
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:43,609
No complaining, I remember everything clearly.

383
00:27:43,609 --> 00:27:47,834
I can still feel everything on the tip of my finger.

384
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,999
- Which way? 
 - That way.

385
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:51,959
100 wishes.

386
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:55,083
Okay!

387
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:58,234
Take it back down. 98 wishes left.

388
00:27:58,234 --> 00:28:03,699
 Uncle recovered quickly and left the hospital.

389
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:09,459
 The bullying case was settled, I was able to go back to school.

390
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:11,999
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah, I'm all right.

391
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:13,834
You two are family now?

392
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:15,234
Jihoo!

393
00:28:15,234 --> 00:28:17,083
So desperate.

394
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:20,999
Why didn't you answer my texts or calls?

395
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,999
Just end it, break up with her.

396
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:25,109
I'll forgive you.

397
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:26,359
Thanks.

398
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:28,409
Everyone, sit.

399
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,609
Noeul, let's be friends.

400
00:28:35,634 --> 00:28:36,799
Why?

401
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,683
Since you'll be Jihoo's sister, you'll be my sister-in-law.

402
00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:45,799
Looking forward to the future?

403
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,859
But anything can happen in life.

404
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:53,109
If that really happens, I guess we can't call Jihoo a renter.

405
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:56,999
Jihoo gets a new father, Noeul's dad is pretty cool.

406
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:58,799
Hey, shut up.

407
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,999
Why'd they stop the bullying case?

408
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:05,334
So the ending is, Jihoo beating you up?

409
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:08,134
I felt sorry for him.

410
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:10,899
Are you laughing at me? Do you have a death wish?

411
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:14,059
No... Sorry.

412
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:45,899
Jihoo!

413
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:49,499
Yes? Who are you?

414
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,025
When's your birthday?

415
00:30:04,025 --> 00:30:07,275
I respectfully deny gifts.

416
00:30:07,275 --> 00:30:10,501
I'm curious if I'll be your older or younger brother.

417
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:14,250
Born in March, but never think of me as your older sister.

418
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,692
Okay.

419
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:20,399
Did you hear that?

420
00:30:21,776 --> 00:30:23,599
Hear what?

421
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,180
A bell.

422
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,576
I don't want to go home, I'm hearing things.

423
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:41,150
Yes?

424
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,501
Take my blanket off of me I need to pee.

425
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:46,699
84.

426
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:52,699
Where are you going?

427
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:54,000
You have to dress me.

428
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,150
Why? You're going to go pee.

429
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:00,000
A fashionista is always ready for anything.

430
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,100
Undress me.

431
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:07,150
Undressing then dressing, count it as two.

432
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,750
Okay.

433
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,875
What?

434
00:31:19,651 --> 00:31:22,776
Pull down my zipper.

435
00:31:22,776 --> 00:31:24,676
Your hand is just fine!

436
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:29,999
I don't have any strength in my fingers, I can't do it.

437
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:31,275
81.

438
00:31:31,275 --> 00:31:36,799
Pulling down the zipper then up, so 80!

439
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,199
Deal.

440
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,309
I'm hungry, what's the menu?

441
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,426
Doenjang stew and...

442
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:56,926
I can't breathe.

443
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,125
I can't move, hide the knife.

444
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:03,099
You surprised me, I'm more scared!

445
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:05,301
I think you have knife trauma.

446
00:32:05,301 --> 00:32:08,225
Get rid of it.

447
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:10,751
You can't cook anymore? The only thing you're good at.

448
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,751
I'll sit there, move.

449
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:14,526
Jihoo what do I do? What if I can't cook?

450
00:32:14,526 --> 00:32:19,326
No choice really. You're just really useless now.

451
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,250
- 70. 
 - Okay.

452
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,699
No, with the seaweed.

453
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:42,126
Anchovy... and pepper.

454
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:57,201
Yeah, Hyeok. Why? I'm almost finished with work.

455
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:02,451
Japchae sold out. It sells out quickly.

456
00:33:03,876 --> 00:33:09,800
Cook it for you? Is it your birthday?

457
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,250
Do you think you can milk your injury this far?

458
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:17,501
I see how you're using my son as your servant.

459
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:21,825
Be careful or I might cut you open myself! Hang up!

460
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,125
Let me carry it for you.

461
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:35,000
No, people might be looking.

462
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,226
Who cares, everyone heard the rumors.

463
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,999
All the ingredients for japchae?

464
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:46,100
I'm going to charge him 4,000 won per serving.

465
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,200
Sounds delicious, can I have some?

466
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,025
4,000 won.

467
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:55,726
So...

468
00:33:55,726 --> 00:34:00,599
Should we let Joonhyeok relax at home, and go to the beach?

469
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:07,226
I promised Jihoo.

470
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,175
21.

471
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:16,226
20.

472
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:22,675
You didn't jump at it?

473
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:26,125
Look in the mirror, old lady.

474
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:29,525
You should have said, "Thank you, let's go immediately."

475
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,899
You should look in the mirror, you look older than me.

476
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:37,899
Every woman in our neighborhood drools at him.

477
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:40,475
He must have strange taste, since he's into you.

478
00:34:40,475 --> 00:34:43,375
Let's just thank the heavens and bow our heads.

479
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:46,876
Just go with it. Don't make a fruss.

480
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:50,726
Make a fuss. Not making a fruss. No 'r'.

481
00:34:50,726 --> 00:34:52,876
What're you saying?

482
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:54,100
Are you the grammar police?

483
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,225
Sorry.

484
00:34:56,225 --> 00:34:57,100
17.

485
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,099
How is it 17? Weren't we in the 20's?

486
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,501
You're cheating me, right?

487
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:03,001
No.

488
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:04,626
No?

489
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:08,499
Just go to the beach with him.

490
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:12,101
I can't believe you've never been to a beach.

491
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:13,751
I was busy.

492
00:35:13,751 --> 00:35:17,000
When others took vacations on trains and planes?

493
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,200
I was working to buy my brother clothes and a guitar.

494
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,375
How about you?

495
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:23,399
The ocean?

496
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:28,301
I'm practically an ocean man. Madoros! 
  (In reference to the Madoros boy, a sailor boy statue in Yokohama, Japan)

497
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:30,501
If it wasn't for this apartment...

498
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:33,999
I'd be on a huge ship, staring down the horizon,

499
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:37,509
watching the red sunset, and playing my guitar.

500
00:35:37,509 --> 00:35:38,999
But I'm stuck here.

501
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:43,999
Uncle, you caught anchovies and you got seasick.

502
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:49,025
You lived in the captain's storage? Just be grateful.

503
00:35:49,776 --> 00:35:52,751
Who slices carrots this thick?

504
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,250
Is this food for elephants?

505
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,125
Look at how big they are.

506
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,999
How do you work at a side dish place like this?

507
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:00,999
Is your cooking license real?

508
00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:04,226
I should just cut your mouth! Big stupid mouth!

509
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:08,401
Shut up. Don't eat it.

510
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:28,959
Tell him you're going when you give this to him.

511
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:33,026
Jihoo, go give this to him.

512
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:36,134
You go, Jihoo has to pack for me.

513
00:36:36,134 --> 00:36:39,501
You're coming to the beach? You still have stitches.

514
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:41,626
Yeah, which is why I need a break.

515
00:36:41,626 --> 00:36:45,799
I have a servant as well, it'll be a nice vacation.

516
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:52,626
- Should we? 
 - Yeah? Too harsh?

517
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:54,426
Hey!

518
00:36:54,426 --> 00:36:56,999
There are 3 people here.

519
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:59,999
It's rude to whisper and leave someone out.

520
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:01,417
Sorry.

521
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:03,718
Annoying...

522
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,499
- Uncle! 
 - What's wrong!

523
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:11,501
Are you okay?

524
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:14,001
Oh, my leg. Oh, it hurts.

525
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:16,799
I'm all right. Just my leg.

526
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,375
It's uncomfortably silent...

527
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:40,250
Hey, Jihoo?

528
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,201
Take your job seriously.

529
00:37:44,876 --> 00:37:45,876
Hey.

530
00:37:45,966 --> 00:37:48,766
 We'll bring back treats.

531
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,851
No...

532
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:53,900
Wait, no.

533
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:00,751
No, no...

534
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:02,275
Hurry, get in!

535
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:04,501
You can't leave without me.

536
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:06,125
You can run now! You're healed.

537
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,209
Get some rest.

538
00:38:07,209 --> 00:38:09,999
Big brother, wait, wait!

539
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:11,125
Bye.

540
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,125
Jihoo, I'll let you off all the wishes remaining!

541
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,542
Just wait! Come on, wait for me.

542
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:17,999
I packed your bag and washed your toes yesterday.

543
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:20,375
I completed all 100! Bye, Uncle!

544
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:22,375
- Wait, guys. 
 - We'll bring back treats!

545
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:25,999
Big brother! You're joking.

546
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,575
This way, turn the car.

547
00:38:27,626 --> 00:38:30,018
Take a lap back here.

548
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:32,417
How could they really leave?

549
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:34,184
Big brother!

550
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:40,880

551
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:46,617
You didn't decide where to go?

552
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:48,642
Isn't it exciting?

553
00:38:48,642 --> 00:38:50,792
Always too optimistic.

554
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:53,726
I thought you planned something out.

555
00:38:53,726 --> 00:39:00,217
Let's plan right now. Which direction? West? East? South?

556
00:39:00,217 --> 00:39:01,999
South is too far right?

557
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:03,499
It is far.

558
00:39:03,499 --> 00:39:06,792
Then let's go East, it's beautiful there.

559
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:09,142
What about sleeping? Hotel? An inn?

560
00:39:09,142 --> 00:39:10,999
Hotel, of course.

561
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:14,442
Right? Hotel breakfasts are the best.

562
00:39:14,442 --> 00:39:17,742
Instant noodles in the morning!

563
00:39:17,742 --> 00:39:19,499
Ramen!

564
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,999
It's not healthy to begin the day with noodles.

565
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:24,918
It's okay, it's a vacation.

566
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:28,999
Jihoo, let's eat ramen, while watching the ocean view.

567
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:29,692
Deal!

568
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:31,967
- Deal? 
 - Deal.

569
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:38,342
You guys don't have much in common, I'm worried.

570
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:44,476
Thank you.

571
00:39:44,476 --> 00:39:46,867
For liking my mother.

572
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:55,592
Thank you.

573
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:58,818
Show me all the receipts, I'll pay half.

574
00:39:58,818 --> 00:40:01,942
- No, it's okay. 
 - No, I insist.

575
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,067
Can you handle it?

576
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:06,267
You said it was a budget trip.

577
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:18,117
What's wrong?

578
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,599
It's Jihoo's father.

579
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:29,699
Take the kids to the car.

580
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:54,499
Huh?

581
00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:55,967
What the heck?

582
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:59,999
Hey, it's been so long! How've you been?

583
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:00,999
- What? 
 - Who are you?

584
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:01,999
Who is he?

585
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:03,918
How would I know, do you know me?

586
00:41:03,918 --> 00:41:05,999
- Soochang, it's me! 
 - What?

587
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:07,542
You don't remember me?

588
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:10,699
I'm not Soochang.

589
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:14,799
Oh, right...

590
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:20,792
Soochang, are you still upset with me?

591
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:23,742
Just say so, don't act like you don't know me.

592
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:26,418
I said I'm not Soochang!

593
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:29,417
Oh... I guess you aren't him.

594
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:32,718
My apologies. You look like my friend.

595
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:34,792
It's okay, it happens.

596
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,767
You look just like him.

597
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:42,618
I really thought it was him, sorry.

598
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:47,142
Jeez.

599
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:52,417
Let's go.

600
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:53,792
Huh?..

601
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:08,799
You want a potato?

602
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:11,042
No, I'm saving my belly for dinner.

603
00:42:11,042 --> 00:42:15,567
Is it good? You've always wanted to try truck stop food.

604
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:16,942
Well, just so-so.

605
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:19,667
It's more about the atmosphere, not the taste.

606
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:23,399
But my uncle cooks this way better.

607
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:27,167
I hope he's taking care of himself.

608
00:42:27,818 --> 00:42:32,599
They all leave, yeah just leave me.

609
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:35,117
Are you lonely?

610
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:38,217
Me? Nope, I'm not.

611
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:42,899
Loneliness is a luxury I can't afford.

612
00:42:42,899 --> 00:42:47,292
They say the last steps in life are spent alone.

613
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:55,442
Drinking on an empty stomach is terrible.

614
00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:13,192
 - Welcome.  
 - Goodbye.

615
00:43:13,192 --> 00:43:15,392
Welcome, please come this way.

616
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,092
I'll clean the table right away.

617
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,910
 Please, have a seat.

618
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:30,792
Do you mind sharing a table with her?

619
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:33,417
I noticed you know each other.

620
00:43:33,417 --> 00:43:35,667
I'm sorry, I have this...

621
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:39,999
Excuse me. Ma'am, I'll move over there.

622
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:41,867
Thank you.

623
00:43:53,042 --> 00:43:55,417
How are you feeling?

624
00:43:55,417 --> 00:44:00,499
Huh? Oh... Yeah...

625
00:44:00,499 --> 00:44:02,967
I'm all right.

626
00:44:02,967 --> 00:44:06,999
It'll be bad if any of the moms see us together.

627
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:11,292
It's okay. I've decided not to care about that anymore.

628
00:44:37,292 --> 00:44:41,792
Excuse me, Teacher, I have a question for you.

629
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:43,518
Did you...

630
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:48,742
Did you visit me in the hospital?

631
00:44:52,417 --> 00:44:57,442
No, why would I go there?

632
00:44:57,442 --> 00:45:00,599
You're right!  It's impossible, why would you?

633
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:03,042
But why? Why're you asking?

634
00:45:03,042 --> 00:45:07,542
I must've been confused, I thought I saw you.

635
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:12,442
You didn't. It wasn't me.

636
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:18,699
Right, well enjoy your food.

637
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:24,199
I've also decided to be your fan.

638
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:25,142
What?

639
00:45:25,142 --> 00:45:29,017
I don't have to listen to J. King's orders.

640
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:33,667
I was just worried about the moms misunderstanding us.

641
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:34,999
What misunderstanding?

642
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:36,999
You have a boyfriend.

643
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:38,992
I broke up.

644
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:46,667
I'm going to do what I want from now on.

645
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:49,042
Because I'm a flexible woman.

646
00:45:54,367 --> 00:45:59,518
Do you want to come over to my house after?

647
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:02,667
What?

648
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:25,417
Can you please wait here?

649
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:28,242
Sure, but here?

650
00:46:28,999 --> 00:46:31,192
Okay, here...

651
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:35,499
What the hell are you thinking?

652
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:54,292
Wow, all this...

653
00:46:55,042 --> 00:46:57,318
I've never seen that one.

654
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:04,999
When did... How did you...

655
00:47:04,999 --> 00:47:09,367
I'm a fan that wanted to be helpful.

656
00:47:11,342 --> 00:47:16,099
I heard your new song, "Time to Say Goodbye."

657
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:20,667
I saw a lot of people following and liking on SoriCloud.

658
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:26,518
Yeah, I saw the response too, but I'm not good at all with this.

659
00:47:26,518 --> 00:47:29,167
I'm an expert in career education.

660
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:30,667
I have a license, too.

661
00:47:30,667 --> 00:47:35,667
I've never managed a singer, but I'd like to help.

662
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:36,867
Really?

663
00:47:37,642 --> 00:47:38,918
You aren't interested?

664
00:47:38,918 --> 00:47:40,867
Of course, I am.

665
00:47:41,999 --> 00:47:43,699
Ms. Manager.

666
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,880
My goodness.

667
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:51,299
Wow! The ocean!

668
00:47:51,299 --> 00:47:53,667
This is amazing! I see the ocean!

669
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:54,999
Go that way, I'll go here.

670
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:57,342
- Go left. 
 - Okay.

671
00:48:00,742 --> 00:48:03,467
How's the view?

672
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:07,042
I want that room, to myself.

673
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:09,417
Then I'll take that one! Also by myself.

674
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:14,067
Then there's only one room left...

675
00:48:19,667 --> 00:48:21,617
What's the problem?

676
00:48:21,617 --> 00:48:24,417
We take a room each, she can take the other.

677
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:26,392
You sleep out here on the sofa.

678
00:48:26,392 --> 00:48:27,542
The sofa?

679
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:29,500
You sleep well anywhere.

680
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:33,783
You said you didn't prepare.

681
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:36,342
The breakfast is really good, too.

682
00:48:36,342 --> 00:48:38,292
I hate surprises, it's selfish.

683
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:40,167
You had fun all by yourself.

684
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:43,292
If you told us to begin with, she would have been happier.

685
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:45,792
She's probably happier now.

686
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:48,542
Right? Yes!

687
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:51,642
You're on his side now?

688
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:53,067
Let's go out to the beach.

689
00:48:53,067 --> 00:48:54,999
The beach!

690
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:56,292
Let's collect shells!

691
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:57,667
Dip our feet in!

692
00:48:57,667 --> 00:49:00,667
Let's go!

693
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:02,799
I want to go inside!

694
00:49:13,542 --> 00:49:17,326
How is this your first time?

695
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:21,834
I know. It's embarrassing, right?

696
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:30,783
I can't imagine how tough your life was.

697
00:49:31,392 --> 00:49:34,899
I don't want your pity.

698
00:49:37,792 --> 00:49:40,525
Why'd you avoid him?

699
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:43,999
He might take Jihoo away.

700
00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:45,667
Take him?

701
00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:47,292
You don't have custody?

702
00:49:47,292 --> 00:49:48,667
I do.

703
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:50,267
Then, how could he?

704
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:53,167
They're scarier than the law.

705
00:49:54,642 --> 00:49:56,518
How's that possible?

706
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:04,699
I was beat my entire marriage.

707
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:08,092
I could take it.

708
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:12,467
But they started to beat Jihoo.

709
00:50:13,667 --> 00:50:19,342
I collected evidence of our beatings, then got divorced.

710
00:50:21,392 --> 00:50:23,042
You saw it today.

711
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:27,099
We're always terrified of getting caught.

712
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:30,867
This is why we should just stay friends.

713
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:36,084
I want to be more than that.

714
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:42,650
Sorry, but you're not my type.

715
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,792
What don't you like about me?

716
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,542
What do you mean? Then, why do you like me?

717
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:51,009
Why can't I like you?

718
00:50:52,918 --> 00:50:58,067
If I depend on you, I can't be strong.

719
00:50:58,067 --> 00:51:01,892
Before a woman, I am a mother.

720
00:51:02,417 --> 00:51:05,492
Are you really rejecting me?

721
00:51:08,267 --> 00:51:10,599
Let's be good friends.

722
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:14,599
Neighbors raising kids together.

723
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:22,101
Then you do that. I'll continue to like you.

724
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:31,499
Oh...

725
00:52:11,542 --> 00:52:16,599
 I've never seen my mother that happy before.

726
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:19,999
 I slowly began to forget,

727
00:52:19,999 --> 00:52:24,476
 how life was living with my grandma.

728
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:41,292
How'd they know I changed the password?

729
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:44,999
Too bad, no ones home.

730
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:46,918
Huh?

731
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:51,809
Oh, Teacher.

732
00:52:54,292 --> 00:52:55,959
Lunch?

733
00:52:56,999 --> 00:52:59,792
Not yet, but I should eat soon.

734
00:52:59,792 --> 00:53:01,799
Where are you?

735
00:53:02,417 --> 00:53:03,692
At home?

736
00:53:03,692 --> 00:53:05,718
At my home?

737
00:53:05,718 --> 00:53:06,918
Why...?

738
00:53:08,899 --> 00:53:10,901
Oh... In front of my home...

739
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:13,442
Please wait...

740
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:32,642
Yes, on my way, I'm coming.

741
00:53:35,999 --> 00:53:38,142
Hello.

742
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:41,618
What brings you here?

743
00:53:42,292 --> 00:53:46,242
You aren't fully recovered, everyone's away.

744
00:53:46,242 --> 00:53:51,099
I'm not as good as you, but I cooked for you.

745
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:55,942
No, how did you think of such a beautiful thing?

746
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:57,999
I'm J. King's manager.

747
00:53:57,999 --> 00:54:01,217
I'm responsible for your health.

748
00:54:01,217 --> 00:54:03,892
Well, enjoy.

749
00:54:03,892 --> 00:54:05,792
Thanks, but...

750
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:11,926
You came all the way here...

751
00:54:11,926 --> 00:54:16,492
It'd be weird for me to invite you... inside. Right?

752
00:54:16,492 --> 00:54:20,467
- Probably. 
 - Probably.

753
00:54:21,899 --> 00:54:23,399
Well, let's go.

754
00:54:23,399 --> 00:54:25,417
Huh?

755
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:30,899
Teacher?

756
00:54:30,899 --> 00:54:32,992
Oh my, hello.

757
00:54:32,992 --> 00:54:35,692
You were leaving my house?

758
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:41,325
That...

759
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:46,099
I'll be on my way.

760
00:54:50,718 --> 00:54:52,692
Wait... Umm...

761
00:54:52,692 --> 00:54:56,225
Don't bother, I'll just make it worse.

762
00:55:00,692 --> 00:55:03,192
I was worried but you've been happy.

763
00:55:03,192 --> 00:55:05,142
You must've been so happy we left.

764
00:55:05,142 --> 00:55:07,899
Who are you? Don't talk to me.

765
00:55:07,899 --> 00:55:10,317
Uncle, I brought you treats.

766
00:55:10,317 --> 00:55:12,818
I can't eat it but they say it's amazing.

767
00:55:12,818 --> 00:55:14,567
And who's this kid?

768
00:55:14,567 --> 00:55:16,000
How about grilled squid?

769
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,899
The famous grilled squid from Gangwon Province?

770
00:55:17,899 --> 00:55:21,601
 I'm not buying anything, leave me.

771
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:27,099
- Hey! 
  - Mom!

772
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:30,192
How dare you!

773
00:55:30,192 --> 00:55:32,442
His door is locked.

774
00:55:32,442 --> 00:55:35,318
 What did you do to my room?

775
00:55:35,318 --> 00:55:36,842
 Open the door this instant.

776
00:55:36,842 --> 00:55:38,217
 What did you do in my room?

777
00:55:38,217 --> 00:55:41,018
Why, why?

778
00:55:44,417 --> 00:55:47,626
Good work, Lawyer Jang.

779
00:55:47,626 --> 00:55:53,309
Destroy all the files, no one can find out about this.

780
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,100

781
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,800

782
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,130

783
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:11,620

784
00:56:42,792 --> 00:56:44,842
Do you want this?

785
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:49,659
Where'd you get it? It's pretty.

786
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:51,783
You can have it.

787
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:54,584
Mingi...

788
00:56:55,042 --> 00:56:57,167
Just in case...

789
00:56:57,167 --> 00:57:00,267
If something bad happens, don't be worried.

790
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,476
What are you saying?

791
00:57:07,292 --> 00:57:10,542
It's been so long since you wore that.

792
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:13,167
Who are you? Why is a child talking to me?

793
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:15,542
It's been a week, get over yourself.

794
00:57:15,542 --> 00:57:18,042
I don't speak when I'm mad.

795
00:57:18,042 --> 00:57:20,417
I'm keeping this up for 10 months.

796
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:23,999
Such strong willpower. Oh, how I raised you well.

797
00:57:23,999 --> 00:57:26,167
Who are you? I raised myself.

798
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:27,999
Why are you all dressed up?

799
00:57:27,999 --> 00:57:31,792
I have a meeting with a record label, my manager is coming.

800
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:33,417
Wow! Awesome!

801
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:35,492
Congratulations, little brother!

802
00:57:36,617 --> 00:57:38,692
I think he's really butt hurt.

803
00:57:38,692 --> 00:57:42,900
He's still responding, it'll be fine soon.

804
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:49,126
Oh, my car keys.

805
00:57:49,792 --> 00:57:51,799
My car keys.

806
00:57:51,799 --> 00:57:53,918
No car anymore?

807
00:57:53,918 --> 00:57:56,292
I guess I'll have a few drinks with my manager.

808
00:57:56,292 --> 00:58:00,017
What can I do? I have no choice.

809
00:58:02,999 --> 00:58:06,042
Stop following me Jihoo, I know it's you.

810
00:58:06,042 --> 00:58:06,999
I'm going without you.

811
00:58:06,999 --> 00:58:08,442
Oh, you scared me!

812
00:58:11,999 --> 00:58:14,718
Jang Dogyeong? You little brat!

813
00:58:14,718 --> 00:58:18,542
How dare a young man stab someone!

814
00:58:18,542 --> 00:58:21,999
I almost died! I almost died, you asshole!

815
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:25,267
I'm taking you to the cops, follow me.

816
00:58:26,792 --> 00:58:29,042
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

817
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:31,918
Sorry? You think an apology is enough?

818
00:58:31,918 --> 00:58:34,942
Stay right here, don't run away.

819
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:40,542
Don't move, stay put.

820
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:41,792
Don't mo...

821
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:44,042
It's everything I have.

822
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:47,392
I'm really sorry, I'll take my punishment.

823
00:58:49,142 --> 00:58:52,818
 Yes, Seongjak Police, Detective Choi speaking.

824
00:58:52,818 --> 00:58:55,142
Hello, I'm Wang Joonhyeok.

825
00:58:57,792 --> 00:58:59,383
How are you doing?

826
00:59:00,918 --> 00:59:03,399
I was wondering if you caught the guy.

827
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,792
Okay...

828
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:20,767
Did you eat?

829
00:59:20,792 --> 00:59:21,918
Pardon?

830
00:59:21,918 --> 00:59:23,892
Have you eaten anything?

831
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:25,999
No.

832
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:29,783
Get up, let's eat. Then turn yourself in.

833
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:36,999
I was going to beat you up right away!

834
00:59:36,999 --> 00:59:39,542
Here I am buying you lunch.

835
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,667
This year, I swear...

836
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:44,999
Santa better give me the jackpot, I deserve something amazing.

837
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:45,918
You agree, right?

838
00:59:45,918 --> 00:59:50,267
Police. Jang Dogyeong, come with us.

839
00:59:50,292 --> 00:59:54,992
Wait!  Which police station are you from?

840
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,934
Just step aside.

841
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:04,992
You guys aren't the police!

842
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:08,299
I know the detective in charge.

843
01:00:08,299 --> 01:00:11,318
Move, unless you want to die.

844
01:00:12,918 --> 01:00:14,999
Let's move aside for...

845
01:00:14,999 --> 01:00:15,999
Get him, hey!

846
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,080
Run! Run!

847
01:00:20,542 --> 01:00:22,842
Stop!

848
01:00:22,842 --> 01:00:24,600
Run!

849
01:00:25,959 --> 01:00:27,209
Get back here!

850
01:00:32,918 --> 01:00:34,925
Get him!

851
01:00:36,918 --> 01:00:38,584
Stop right there!

852
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:45,999
What do we do?

853
01:00:45,999 --> 01:00:47,542
Why am I running with you?

854
01:00:47,542 --> 01:00:49,918
Who are they? Thugs?

855
01:00:49,918 --> 01:00:51,999
Did the Diamond send them?

856
01:00:51,999 --> 01:00:57,099
Just hide... Wait, no. Let's call the cops.

857
01:00:57,099 --> 01:00:59,042
This leads to the main street, go first.

858
01:00:59,042 --> 01:01:01,792
I can't go, you go first.

859
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:04,801
They won't actually kill me, just go ahead.

860
01:01:04,801 --> 01:01:07,518
It's all my fault. Now go, Sir.

861
01:01:07,518 --> 01:01:09,292
Don't call me, Sir. I'm not old.  Call me, Brother.

862
01:01:09,292 --> 01:01:10,542
Is that important right now?

863
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,667
I can't afford to ruin this suit.

864
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:14,799
This is crazy!

865
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:21,167
I dropped it in water, it's all wet!

866
01:01:21,167 --> 01:01:23,792
I don't think this is going to work.

867
01:01:23,792 --> 01:01:25,967
We're almost in, push!

868
01:01:25,967 --> 01:01:27,292
Wait, just wait.

869
01:01:30,999 --> 01:01:33,292
 Geez...

870
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:05,542
It's so cold.

871
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:07,799
I'm freezing.

872
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:10,799
Where are we?

873
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:12,292
Where is this?

874
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:15,667
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

875
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:16,999
Hey, wake up.

876
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,292
Are you dead?

877
01:02:18,292 --> 01:02:20,834
Hey, wake up!  Get up!

878
01:02:22,018 --> 01:02:24,899
- Where are we? 
 - I don't know.

879
01:02:24,899 --> 01:02:28,618
I think we're in a freezer.

880
01:02:29,918 --> 01:02:31,642
Give me your phone.

881
01:02:31,642 --> 01:02:33,867
I didn't want to get tracked, so I threw it away.

882
01:02:35,142 --> 01:02:37,417
Oh no... My suit jacket.

883
01:02:37,417 --> 01:02:41,425
The money you gave me is in that jacket too.

884
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:46,918
What are they trying to do?

885
01:02:46,918 --> 01:02:51,334
Do you think they'll dump our bodies in the ocean?

886
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,184
What?

887
01:02:53,184 --> 01:02:58,292
Are they going to hang us? Maybe burn us? Bury us?

888
01:02:58,292 --> 01:03:00,267
Oh, jeez, this is driving me nuts.

889
01:03:03,567 --> 01:03:06,899
- Is that blood? 
 - Blood?

890
01:03:06,899 --> 01:03:10,399
I guess this is where they kill people.

891
01:03:10,417 --> 01:03:12,542
I got it.

892
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:17,642
They kill us here, then take our organs.

893
01:03:17,642 --> 01:03:19,592
This is insane.

894
01:03:19,592 --> 01:03:22,167
Help! Anyone out there?

895
01:03:22,167 --> 01:03:24,999
Help!  We're inside!

896
01:03:24,999 --> 01:03:27,950
Please help! We're stuck inside!

897
01:03:30,999 --> 01:03:34,292
You bastards! We're inside!

898
01:03:34,292 --> 01:03:39,999
I have a meeting today! My manager is waiting!

899
01:03:41,792 --> 01:03:45,626
 The phone you are trying to reach is unavailable...

900
01:03:52,142 --> 01:03:54,467
You're cold?

901
01:03:56,317 --> 01:04:02,259
Should we hug each other?

902
01:04:02,259 --> 01:04:05,542
Don't die. Don't die.

903
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:09,618
If you die, I'll be too scared.

904
01:04:09,618 --> 01:04:14,142
Let's die together at the same time.

905
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:17,417
Hey, wake up.

906
01:04:17,417 --> 01:04:22,342
Wake up, just talk to me.

907
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:26,242
I just want to die.

908
01:04:26,242 --> 01:04:28,567
I'll be in prison anyways.

909
01:04:28,567 --> 01:04:31,999
That's why you don't stab people.

910
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:35,692
Let's just make it through this.

911
01:04:35,692 --> 01:04:38,917
If you live, you can figure out life.

912
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:43,742
They say it's better to roll in dog poop, have hope!

913
01:04:43,742 --> 01:04:48,299
There could be a miracle, someone might save us.

914
01:04:48,299 --> 01:04:51,167
Miracle? There's no such thing.

915
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:56,067
Miracles aren't supposed to be fancy.

916
01:04:56,067 --> 01:05:02,167
Miracles... are like warm meals.

917
01:05:07,667 --> 01:05:13,092
I wanted to just end it a long time ago.

918
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:18,792
I lost everything I saved for 10 years.

919
01:05:18,792 --> 01:05:23,192
I lost my family, girlfriend, and friends.

920
01:05:24,042 --> 01:05:28,367
I gave up and went to the ocean.

921
01:05:37,417 --> 01:05:41,170
But before I jumped,

922
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:43,990
I smelled something amazing.

923
01:05:50,966 --> 01:05:52,933

924
01:05:52,999 --> 01:05:54,799
Even on the brink of death,

925
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:58,117
I just wanted a bite.

926
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:01,567
But...

927
01:06:02,999 --> 01:06:07,267
As I was eating this delicious food,

928
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:14,999
I didn't want to die, leaving behind all that tasty foods.

929
01:06:17,999 --> 01:06:24,342
That warm meal I had that day, was a miracle.

930
01:06:26,142 --> 01:06:28,292
I ate and gained courage.

931
01:06:28,292 --> 01:06:33,367
I worked hard and paid off my debt in a year.

932
01:06:33,899 --> 01:06:36,142
Most people...

933
01:06:36,142 --> 01:06:38,567
They don't have an extraordinary reason to live.

934
01:06:38,567 --> 01:06:44,542
We all have our small reasons to live for.

935
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:51,142
I just want warm broth with oysters this winter.

936
01:06:51,142 --> 01:06:54,067
Maybe some fried fish.

937
01:06:54,067 --> 01:07:00,499
Next year, a bowl of Pyongyang cold noodles.

938
01:07:00,499 --> 01:07:05,642
Just eating what you want and living is the best.

939
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:11,167
Are you okay?

940
01:07:11,167 --> 01:07:12,959
Sir?

941
01:07:13,999 --> 01:07:16,090
I'm not a sir...

942
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:20,050
I'm like an older brother.

943
01:07:22,567 --> 01:07:24,942
Just keep talking.

944
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:28,967
My dream is a musician.

945
01:07:28,967 --> 01:07:33,942
I am one, but I'm not famous...

946
01:07:38,999 --> 01:07:42,167
When will I...

947
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:45,467
Sir, do you have a lighter?

948
01:07:45,467 --> 01:07:48,799
No, I have nothing.

949
01:07:49,417 --> 01:07:51,967
Why do you need one?

950
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:55,067
I majored in chemical engineering.

951
01:07:55,067 --> 01:07:59,110
I can ignite the dust and cause an explosion.

952
01:08:00,467 --> 01:08:05,667
You sounded really cool just now.

953
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:08,842
I need a lighter.

954
01:08:08,842 --> 01:08:10,399
I don't have one.

955
01:08:10,399 --> 01:08:16,767
If there is one, it'll be a miracle.

956
01:08:30,542 --> 01:08:32,367
Hey.

957
01:08:48,818 --> 01:08:51,417
Hey, MacGyver.

958
01:08:51,999 --> 01:08:54,542
Don't be too worried.

959
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:57,267
I'll take your side in court.

960
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:01,999
I have to go somewhere before.

961
01:09:09,042 --> 01:09:10,918
Detective,

962
01:09:10,918 --> 01:09:12,542
do you know what I've been through?

963
01:09:12,542 --> 01:09:14,467
- Please wait. 
 - I almost froz...

964
01:09:14,467 --> 01:09:19,399
He's turning himself in, please give him a moment.

965
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:21,799
What about me?

966
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:34,130

967
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:51,899
Detective, he turned himself in and cooperated.

968
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:54,317
Just let us do our job.

969
01:09:54,317 --> 01:09:56,599
He turned himself in.

970
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:01,918
- Thank you. 
 - Yeah...

971
01:10:01,918 --> 01:10:04,192
Sir, you're my miracle.

972
01:10:04,192 --> 01:10:06,676
I'm not a sir.

973
01:10:07,767 --> 01:10:09,983
Thanks, Uncle.

974
01:10:09,983 --> 01:10:12,380
I'll buy you a warm meal soon.

975
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:14,440
Go on now.

976
01:10:14,442 --> 01:10:16,317
Let's go.

977
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:20,800
He turned himself in.

978
01:10:27,542 --> 01:10:30,099
Dogyeong did what?

979
01:10:30,099 --> 01:10:33,242
Oh okay, all right.

980
01:10:33,242 --> 01:10:35,810
Where's Chaeyoung?

981
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:38,640
It's almost time for her flight.

982
01:10:38,642 --> 01:10:40,667
Mingi, where's your sister?

983
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:43,590
She doesn't even have a phone.

984
01:10:44,342 --> 01:10:46,999
She took my phone.

985
01:10:52,918 --> 01:10:55,667
Oh, Chaeyoung.

986
01:10:56,692 --> 01:10:59,467
Do you live here?

987
01:11:08,792 --> 01:11:11,167
 It'll be really pretty.

988
01:11:17,142 --> 01:11:20,718
 I'll close the curtains, 1, 2, 3!

989
01:11:22,792 --> 01:11:25,999
 - It's really pretty right? 
 - I love it.

990
01:11:28,392 --> 01:11:30,192
 Chaeyoung.

991
01:11:30,792 --> 01:11:32,417
 - You got it? 
 - Yeah.

992
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:34,042
 - We look cute. 
 - Yup.

993
01:11:34,042 --> 01:11:36,642
 - How about here? 
 - Perfect.

994
01:11:36,642 --> 01:11:39,918
 - I really love it. 
 - Me too.

995
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:53,567
Have you seen the photos that were stuck in here?

996
01:11:53,567 --> 01:11:56,292
Oh, wait.

997
01:12:01,792 --> 01:12:06,099
This was yours...

998
01:12:06,099 --> 01:12:08,042
Yes.

999
01:12:09,517 --> 01:12:13,799
I wanted to come here one last time, before I leave...

1000
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:20,742
I'm sorry for bad-mouthing him.

1001
01:12:20,742 --> 01:12:23,367
It's all my mom's fault.

1002
01:12:23,367 --> 01:12:26,899
She lied about everything.

1003
01:12:33,133 --> 01:12:34,533

1004
01:12:48,967 --> 01:12:51,292
Why does this feel strange...

1005
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:26,542
Chaeyoung!

1006
01:13:26,542 --> 01:13:29,125
Chaeyoung, open your eyes!

1007
01:13:29,899 --> 01:13:31,842
Chaeyoung!

1008
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:35,067
Chaeyoung!

1009
01:13:35,067 --> 01:13:37,042
Chaeyoung!

1010
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:40,699
Chaeyoung, open your eyes!

1011
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:42,342
What is this?

1012
01:13:42,342 --> 01:13:44,209
What's going on? Where are you going?

1013
01:13:44,209 --> 01:13:46,834
Why are you taking her?

1014
01:13:48,267 --> 01:13:50,167
What happened?

1015
01:13:52,040 --> 01:14:01,980

1016
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:29,990

1017
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:33,718
 By the time I went up, she had already jumped.

1018
01:14:33,718 --> 01:14:37,125
 She pushed my daughter... She Killed her!

1019
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:40,000
 - She didn't, right? 
 - I would never do that! That's crazy!

1020
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,399
 Do we have any CCTV evidence or witnesses?

1021
01:14:43,399 --> 01:14:45,283
 What did you say?

1022
01:14:45,283 --> 01:14:47,634
 Please, everything is a lie, please.

1023
01:14:47,634 --> 01:14:49,000
 Please believe me, congressman.

1024
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,125
 If they figure out your false testimony, we're all screwed!

1025
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:53,501
 It's my fault.

1026
01:14:53,501 --> 01:14:54,442
 Sis! Sis!

1027
01:14:54,442 --> 01:14:56,459
 Isn't her well-being the most important?

1028
01:14:56,459 --> 01:14:59,050
 What are you trying to protect?

1029
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:01,699
 - Mom! 
 - Ji-hoo, I'm okay.

1030
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,567
 Don't wake up, just die.

1031
01:15:06,567 --> 01:15:09,375
 Just die!

1032
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:11,799
 How do I help her?

1033
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:16,725
 If she dies... will I be a murderer?
