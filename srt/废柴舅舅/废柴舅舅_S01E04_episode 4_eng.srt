1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,410

2
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:11,375

3
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:15,899

4
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:22,000

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,401

6
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:33,426

7
00:00:33,426 --> 00:00:37,799

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,000

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,967

10
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,299
 J. King!

11
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:56,942
 J. King!

12
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:01,042
 J. King! J. King!

13
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:09,201
 J. King! I'm here for you!

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:19,990

15
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:36,718
I would have never thought the beanie girl was you.

16
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:39,799
 Boom!

17
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:44,459
Do you remember how I gave you my scarf?

18
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,099
 Aren't you freezing? You might catch a cold!

19
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:51,684
 Thank you!

20
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:56,042
Remember? I still have it with me.

21
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:58,642
No way!

22
00:01:59,592 --> 00:02:03,142
So you made two, kept one and gave me one?

23
00:02:03,142 --> 00:02:04,467
Yes.

24
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:06,292
Smooth move.

25
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,584
It's a couple keyring! You were a real fan!

26
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:11,634
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

27
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:14,334
You said you'd run away from fans.

28
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:19,009
I was embarrassed. I don't have fans anymore.

29
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,584
Why are you still my fan?

30
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:23,999
So many famous artists out there...

31
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:27,359
When I watched J. King win first place,

32
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:29,334
it gave me a lot of courage.

33
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:32,784
It proved how effort can really overcome.

34
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:36,634
J. King helped me fulfill my dreams to be a teacher.

35
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:41,334
So now, I'll support you into becoming a singer,

36
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:46,499
that gives courage to even more people, forever.

37
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:53,083
Forever? You'll be mine... Wait no, no...

38
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:57,309
Not mine, but my fan forever?

39
00:02:57,309 --> 00:03:03,759
Sure, I'll be your fan and be by your side, forever.

40
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,999
Forever...

41
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:20,799
Hey, Jaeseo, what time is it in New York?

42
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,017
Yeah, I'm home now.

43
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,834
You can't come back this month?

44
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,984
You must be really busy.

45
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:36,709
Vacation? I'm not sure if I can go.

46
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:40,599
Of course, I miss you.

47
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,899
Beanie, beanie, beanie.

48
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:46,834
Beanie girl is the teacher, the teacher is beanie girl.

49
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,083
Beanie teacher.

50
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:52,659
What a coincidence! This is destiny!

51
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:54,334
Wait...

52
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,109
That means...

53
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:58,359
Twelve years of couple keyrings.

54
00:03:58,359 --> 00:03:59,899
Wow!

55
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:01,734
Smooth!

56
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:05,959
Hwaeum's a smooth... smooth girl.

57
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,699
Huh? Where'd it go?

58
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:15,459
Is it in my car?

59
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,699
 He looks like you.

60
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,209
Son, shouldn't you go to bed?

61
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:39,309
I will. Turn off the lights.

62
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:42,009
Goodnight.

63
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,190

64
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,018

65
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:58,167
Debt collectors made things worse with my wife...

66
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,467
We eventually divorced.

67
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:04,642
I began to rely on alcohol...

68
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:09,899
 How dare you lie to me and study music!

69
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:10,918
 Let go!

70
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:14,367
 - What? MIDI lessons? 
 - It's my fault.

71
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,067
 - Jihoo did nothing wrong! 
 - Bring him inside!

72
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:22,792
 Jihoo... Jihoo! Let go!

73
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,417
 Jihoo!

74
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:26,167
 Music is ridiculous!

75
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:31,518
 You want to be a broke clown like your uncle?

76
00:05:31,518 --> 00:05:35,492
 Or kill yourself like your grandfather?

77
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:41,999
 Hello, I'm the director of the MIDI lessons.

78
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:45,467
 I heard Jihoo can't join us anymore.

79
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:50,799
 I'm worried. His notes have alarming lyrics.

80
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:56,999

81
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:58,751

82
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,584

83
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,492
 Mom.

84
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,242
 No, no...

85
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:18,467
 No, Jihoo.

86
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:22,983
 Mom? Are you drunk again?

87
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,267
While I drank away my pain...

88
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:30,192
my son was dying.

89
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:34,000
After 12 years,

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,424
I decided to run away.

91
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,184

Looks delicious.

92
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:49,167
 I hereby designate the plaintiff as legal guardian.

93
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,999
 This way.

94
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:02,134
 Here, an allowance.

95
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,501
I don't want to drink anymore.

96
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:14,626
I'm all cured now, please let me leave.

97
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:17,200
You still have trouble sleeping.

98
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,800
I'm just worried, that's all.

99
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,876
His grandmother might come for him.

100
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,999
I really shouldn't have come in the first place.

101
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,899
Can't you at least give me my phone?

102
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,567
We're speaking with your family.

103
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,876
Don't worry, and focus on rehabilitation.

104
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:38,401
My son can't do anything without me there.

105
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:41,999
We've never been apart, he has separation anxiety.

106
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:45,976
I think you're the one with separation anxiety.

107
00:07:45,976 --> 00:07:46,999
What?

108
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:52,676
If you can't take care of yourself, how will you take care of him?

109
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,692
My son, is alone, without his mother!

110
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:05,217
I hope this helps.

111
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,767

112
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:21,699
 To my loving mother, I miss dearly...

113
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:37,667
 Mom, I'm doing well these days.

114
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:45,167
Mom's scent.

115
00:08:50,283 --> 00:08:53,899
 Uncle has been really busy.

116
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:56,992
 He became the bluebird.

117
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:58,899

118
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,242
Did you eat? Take your pills?

119
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:15,999
Stop. This isn't what the bluebird does.

120
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:18,200
No way. I'm supposed to help with everything, aren't I?

121
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,892
My attire shows my timeless fashion sense. It's untamable.

122
00:09:23,892 --> 00:09:26,099
Hey, did you know?

123
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,967
It's my first time being a leader.

124
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,142
Anyone can tell.

125
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:32,199
Did you see my framed official appointment letter?

126
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:34,417
You put it next to my breakfast...

127
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:35,818
Wait! Where are you going?

128
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:38,667
- Take a picture of me. 
 - Take a selfie.

129
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,718
No, it feels different.

130
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:43,599
Take hundreds, we'll get a perfect one.

131
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,767
He overdoes everything.

132
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:59,742
There's no overdoing safety.

133
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:16,042
 Uncle goes to school more often than I do.

134
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:22,618
 He goes to every father's meeting.

135
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,801
 And all mother's meetings, too.

136
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:27,900
Let's hang it. Up here.

137
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,983
 We don't argue anymore, don't worry.

138
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:36,292
 He's still bad at everything...

139
00:10:37,117 --> 00:10:39,667
 Oh right!  Every weekend,

140
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:42,542
 I take MIDI lessons at uncle's friend's academy.

141
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:46,492
Pay me back? Don't you have a credit card?

142
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:48,584
Just pay in small installments!

143
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:51,199
Music doesn't work that way!

144
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:54,742
How can a musician, say such things?

145
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:59,118
So dirty. Your glasses need so much work.

146
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,599
Your scratching them up!

147
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:09,509
 And, Mom, I finally...

148
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:12,667
 joined the after-school orchestra.

149
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:18,642
 I'm so happy, I'm finally doing music. I love it.

150
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:22,999
 I want you to hear me someday.

151
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:36,099
He's doing a bit too well without me.

152
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:38,142
I'm a little jealous.

153
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:48,767
Will Wang Joonhyeok score the winning goal?

154
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:50,809
- He shoots! 
 - No goal.

155
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:53,999
Will Joonhyeok be able to score ever again?

156
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:58,167
No goal. No goal. No goal...

157
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:04,367
Hey, I'm seriously terrible at everything.

158
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:05,417
Look.

159
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:07,567
Usually people...

160
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,092
can do this...

161
00:12:09,092 --> 00:12:10,817
It shouldn't be difficult...

162
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:15,076
It should work, but I just can't...

163
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:18,600
I'm the most talented yet untalented.

164
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,934
Don't eat that! It's dirty!

165
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:24,618
Dirty? What's dirty? This?

166
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,992
Hey, you...

167
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:28,899
Smell it. Smells like chicken poop.

168
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:30,892
- Stop, please! 
 - You smell it, right?

169
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:34,242
I'm simply trying to get your immunity stronger.

170
00:12:34,242 --> 00:12:36,409
I'm like the human ginseng! Super healthy.

171
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:38,899
I think you've gotten healthier thanks to me.

172
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:41,492
Right? Being less neat freaky?

173
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,784
Uncle, write Mom a letter.

174
00:12:45,784 --> 00:12:47,118
No thanks.

175
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:49,820
If you can't, just write.

176
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,780
"I will not cause problems..."

177
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,067
- Write it. 
 - Hey!

178
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,999
If I write, it becomes a poem.

179
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:01,567
I was a medieval bard in my previous life.

180
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:06,442
You can hear harps and birds sing when I begin to write.

181
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:10,550
Do you want me to write you a poem?

182
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:35,492
Are you crying?

183
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:38,718
Oh my... I was too focused.

184
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:44,267
I get too emotionally invested when I write...

185
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:47,292
- So cringe! 
 - What? Show me.

186
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:51,342
- Did you say I love you? 
 - No, she's my sister.

187
00:13:51,342 --> 00:13:53,018
You wrote that you love her, right?

188
00:13:53,018 --> 00:13:54,567
- Show me. 
 - Nope.

189
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,192
- I want to see it! 
 - It's none of your business.

190
00:13:57,192 --> 00:13:59,167
I know you wrote I love you!

191
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,892
- Show me! 
 - No, I said no.

192
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:04,017
Stop!

193
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:08,667
 I was always alone, in lost time, waiting for you.

194
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:13,667
 Now I'm able to fill it up by spending time with Jihoo.

195
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,418
 and...

196
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:21,217
 I'm glad Jihoo doesn't know that type of loneliness.

197
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,017
- What're you doing? 
 - Jeez!

198
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:43,067
I prepared a surprise gift for my biggest fan!

199
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,009
Why'd you come so early?

200
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,342
Is it for me?

201
00:14:48,342 --> 00:14:50,217
You already gave me these.

202
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:52,318
That's for our teacher's precious feet.

203
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:57,499
This plant ventilates micro dust in the air.

204
00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:59,992
Don't give it water, I'll do it myself.

205
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:03,092
I'm such a successful fan.

206
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:05,599
You're too kind, all I do is receive!

207
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:07,667
I am well known for good fan service.

208
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:10,517
And wait! More fan service...

209
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:11,992
Tada!

210
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:15,892
I know how curious you were about my attire.

211
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:18,084
What? Um, yes.

212
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,167
I'll show you, I have many angles.

213
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:21,792
Tada, tada!

214
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,934
Send them to me, thanks.

215
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:26,917
Did you hear about the Water Volume Band?

216
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:30,499
Yeah, the vocalist quit after an incident, right?

217
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:34,518
Did you know they're hosting open auditions?

218
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,742
They didn't disband? In need of a vocalist?

219
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:39,867
Yes, I think the band and you are a great fit.

220
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:45,267
Sure! Middle-aged men's CN Black. When is it? 
  (In reference to the Korean band, CN Blue)

221
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:48,367
This Friday. Is it too soon?

222
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:53,317
Never too soon. I'm always prepared.

223
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:57,167
How'd you find out about the auditions?

224
00:15:57,167 --> 00:16:02,899
You're so good to me, I wanted to repay the favor.

225
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:05,999
Oh, my lovely fan! How could I ever repay you?

226
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:12,518
How's this! Come with me to the audition.

227
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:15,384
The perfect opportunity to cheer for me! Sound fun?

228
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:18,118
- Can I really come? 
 - Sounds fun, right?

229
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:22,226
But... you can't let people at school find out.

230
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:24,092
Okay.

231
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:27,342
It's too obvious right now. Okay, better.

232
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:28,899
Way too obvious!

233
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:32,084
Okay, perfect!

234
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:37,259

235
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,634
The school change is moving really fast.

236
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:42,009
It's for the kids, we shouldn't waste time.

237
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:45,009
Isn't this an agreement for library regulations?

238
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:48,899
Is it okay to add school system changes to this?

239
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:52,934
I was just worried for us.

240
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:54,109
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:56,934
No one will find out, if we all stay quiet.

242
00:16:56,934 --> 00:17:00,259
Jihoo's father will go crazy if he finds out.

243
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:04,384
Yeah, all the renters won't even know what hit them.

244
00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:06,109
So annoying!

245
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,499
They want us to send our kids to experience kimchi-making!

246
00:17:09,499 --> 00:17:14,109
How can a school focus on kimchi, and not studies?

247
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:16,084
It's like a job experience.

248
00:17:16,084 --> 00:17:18,399
Our homeroom teacher is an expert career coach.

249
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:20,059
- She has awards! 
 - So what?

250
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:24,034
Still kimchi-making? So our kids grow up to make side dishes?

251
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:28,399
All careers are equal. Let's just focus on our work here.

252
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:31,483
Chaeyoung attends an elite school, you don't know our worries.

253
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:36,409
She should make them study! I don't like her one bit.

254
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:39,383
Today, you become Korean chefs,

255
00:17:39,383 --> 00:17:41,726

preparing kimchi.

256
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:45,799
Some of you dream to be a chef, right?

257
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,684
Not bad?

258
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,084
Here.

259
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:06,609
Thank you.

260
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,209
Good work.

261
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:17,909
When will Jihoo's mother be out?

262
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:22,109
I don't know, she's worse than we thought.

263
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:27,199
Can I ask you something personal?

264
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,375
What do you find attractive about my sister?

265
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,776
That's too personal.

266
00:18:35,776 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm her brother. I have a right to know.

267
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,826
I don't think she's interested in me.

268
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:44,300
- She doesn't even reply. 
 - My sister?

269
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:49,701
Ah, the phone. They took her phone away.

270
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,750
Oh.

271
00:18:56,199 --> 00:19:01,951
You have strange taste, but I respect it.

272
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:05,976
Thank you for helping out today.

273
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:09,176
I don't see many mothers here, why is that?

274
00:19:09,176 --> 00:19:14,400
I think the Momvelies are being too uncooperative.

275
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,176
Do they challenge my rightful authority as bluebird?

276
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:22,651
Another text.

277
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:25,101
Look, look.

278
00:19:25,101 --> 00:19:27,851
After becoming bluebird, he texts way too much.

279
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:30,325
Who could have been the last vote?

280
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:34,851
The last person voting intentionally screwed us over!

281
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:38,251
It could be Jihoo's father.

282
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:40,051
What's so funny?

283
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:42,499
He's been disagreeing with everything we do.

284
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:47,101
Now look, we have to work in secrecy.

285
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:51,400
Sorry, Sis, I should've been the bluebird.

286
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,299
Sodam was missing, it's okay.

287
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:59,499
Let's give Jihoo's father busy work so he doesn't find out.

288
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:02,051
He works really hard.

289
00:20:02,051 --> 00:20:05,501
There's no point, he does nothing right.

290
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,840

291
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,520
 Wow!

292
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,570

293
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,609
Everyone, stay quiet until the school system change.

294
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:28,176
Of course, he'll ruin everything if he finds out.

295
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:30,825
- Ruin what? 
 - Oh my! Jeez!

296
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:33,467
- What? What will I ruin? 
 - It's nothing.

297
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:36,900
There was a sale, we bought groceries.

298
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,801
Oh really? I need groceries, too.

299
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:41,026
What'd you buy? What was on sale? Show me.

300
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:45,650
Nothing much. But thanks to you working so hard,

301
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,299
we have time to relax and shop around.

302
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:49,767
Great kimchi work today.

303
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:53,801
I can see through your two faces, Ms. Diamond.

304
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:55,051
Just take one of these.

305
00:20:55,051 --> 00:20:58,425
The kids made this kimchi.

306
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,675
It's delicious.

307
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:04,425
Sodam's was the best. Did she learn from her mother?

308
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:06,425
Here's Sechan's.

309
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:10,176
He did all the heavy lifting, everyone applauded him.

310
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:13,801
And last but not least, for our Diamond.

311
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:16,218
I don't think Mingi likes green onions.

312
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:20,299
You should mince it in his food, so he doesn't taste it.

313
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:23,151
Green... onions...

314
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:28,299
One last thing. Can I post a notice at your club?

315
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:30,801
Notice? What notice?

316
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:36,199
Someone tried to break into my home.

317
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:38,299
- Who? 
 - I don't know.

318
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:41,199
I chased him but he got away.

319
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:46,700
This is from the CCTV.  It's too dark to see his face.

320
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,051
Oh my...

321
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:51,134
Have you been busy?

322
00:21:51,134 --> 00:21:55,550
I'm not even married, don't be crazy...

323
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:03,951
I mean, what? The kimchi was so good today.

324
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:06,099
Everyone just becareful.

325
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:07,875
Isn't this strange, too?

326
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:14,199
This was left behind in our apartment. In our closet.

327
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,625
In your closet?

328
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,926
Strange, right?

329
00:22:17,926 --> 00:22:21,425
There's a lot of strange things going on...

330
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:25,951
Which is why you should be safe and post the notice.

331
00:22:25,951 --> 00:22:29,299
Who does he think he is? Trying to order the Ro-Moms.

332
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:32,799
Don't make accusations. You might affect our apartment price.

333
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,926
Is that your concern? Our safety is at stake.

334
00:22:35,926 --> 00:22:38,575
All right, we get it. You may leave now.

335
00:22:38,575 --> 00:22:42,176
Why don't you focus on getting yourself a job?

336
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:46,176
Didn't Jihoo's mother quit her job?

337
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:49,500
Thanks to all of you, she was fired.

338
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,299
I do have a job. At night...

339
00:22:54,299 --> 00:23:00,299
As an artist, inspiration comes at night.

340
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:03,399
As if I was an old lady...

341
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:07,142
You can laugh, I know it's funny.

342
00:23:07,142 --> 00:23:11,199
I have to prepare for my audition. I'm so busy.

343
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:13,725
Oh my god!

344
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,801
Who does he think he is? He's so annoying.

345
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:20,009
Isn't it strange though?

346
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:24,150
Who's could it be... The ultrasound picture...

347
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,299
It's me. Has Chaeyoung been outside?

348
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:33,550
 No, she's with me all 24 hours.

349
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,726
Are you sure she doesn't have a phone?

350
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:40,701
 Of course, don't worry. She's completely isolated.

351
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:42,592
How's she doing?

352
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,300
 She's getting better.

353
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,359
We have walks in the fresh air once a day.

354
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,926
At this rate, I think she can pass her high school exam.

355
00:23:52,926 --> 00:23:55,299
Don't lose focus.

356
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:58,299
Do not let her out, under any circumstances.

357
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:00,451
 Yes, Ma'am.

358
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:03,525

359
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:09,926
How did you get all these agreements?

360
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:12,926
You're ferocious, Ms. Park.

361
00:24:12,926 --> 00:24:14,801
We shouldn't waste time.

362
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:18,850
When the elections begin, every candidate will

363
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,451
want to be the person bringing in the school change.

364
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:26,550
How many of the renter's kids attend Dongmin Elementary?

365
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,099
About 10 households. One family is moving out.

366
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:32,526
16 kids in total. A couple renter's kids per class.

367
00:24:33,176 --> 00:24:35,425
Won't renters be a problem?

368
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:39,092
Even at Mingi's birthday, a renter acted out.

369
00:24:39,092 --> 00:24:43,325
Leave it to me. There's always a way.

370
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:50,099
Worst case scenario, we can force a transfer.

371
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:52,126
I'm glad I moved schools.

372
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:55,176
- Said the kid getting bullied. 
 - Not anymore!

373
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:57,199
No one bullies me anymore.

374
00:24:57,199 --> 00:25:00,750
Of course they don't! I'm the bluebird now!

375
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,200
Yeah, sure. Everything is thanks to you.

376
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,826
Yes, of course it is.

377
00:25:04,826 --> 00:25:07,850
You two are close now.

378
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,460
It's usually hard for you to make new friends.

379
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,800
Someone once said, I can move people's hearts.

380
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,100
Don't smirk, it's true.

381
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,701
How are you mom? Do you feel better?

382
00:25:21,701 --> 00:25:25,051
I'm doing fine. I'm allowed to go out now.

383
00:25:25,051 --> 00:25:29,026
Really? Then can you spend your birthday with us?

384
00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:31,550
- It's my birthday? 
 - How'd you forget?

385
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:34,076
What do you want as a gift?

386
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:37,500
I've never had birthday gifts before.

387
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,126
- You never gave her anything? 
 - Life was tough back then.

388
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:42,242
Hey, happy birthday.

389
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:46,425
She practically raised you like a son! You're terrible!

390
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:49,299
She didn't raise me.

391
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,617
Have you seen a mother steal from her child?

392
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:53,899
That's not what happened!

393
00:25:55,425 --> 00:25:59,176
I'll pay you back. I swear I will.

394
00:25:59,176 --> 00:26:01,709
Oh, why thank you.

395
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:06,076
How about you? Why didn't you get her anything?

396
00:26:06,076 --> 00:26:10,175
I couldn't before, but now I can.

397
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:13,084
Such a good son, how incredible.

398
00:26:13,084 --> 00:26:15,926
Hey, let's go. I have to prepare for my audition.

399
00:26:15,926 --> 00:26:18,626
- Leaving already? 
 - Let's go.

400
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,576
Go on.

401
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:38,134
Let's go.

402
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:52,350
Come see us whenever.

403
00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:01,600
We can have a birthday party this weekend or not, I don't care.

404
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:04,851
Really? Mom, let's celebrate!

405
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:08,199
- Thanks, Uncle! 
 - Whatever, let's go.

406
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:23,326
Go on.

407
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:33,051
You deserve this now.

408
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:34,876
Oh, thank you.

409
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:45,550

410
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:50,534
 I was wondering if you were okay.

411
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:54,375
 I'd like to buy you dinner once you're out.

412
00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:12,884

413
00:28:17,176 --> 00:28:20,176
 Sorry for the late reply.

414
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:25,575
 But there's no reason for you to buy me dinner.

415
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,299
 See you this weekend.

416
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:34,326
 I was invited to your party by Joonhyeok.

417
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:39,801
Why is he going around inviting people?

418
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,067
So annoying.

419
00:28:52,675 --> 00:29:00,299
It was a mother and son, I haven't seen them in days.

420
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:03,650
All their belongings are here. They'll be back.

421
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,534
Are you the father?

422
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:32,500

423
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,192
What? Smuggle?

424
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,500
You said you found them.

425
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:41,051
Did she go crazy?

426
00:29:41,051 --> 00:29:43,299
I'm going to lose my mind!

427
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:46,600
Shut up, I can't think.

428
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,199
Calm down and tell him to find them!

429
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:52,425
Find out where they went!

430
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:57,225
 He took everything, I think he believes they left.

431
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:03,001
She could still be in Korea.

432
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,483
What?

433
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:06,717
Are you Sherlock Holmes now?

434
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,299
Hey.

435
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:11,575
Don't you know how sly she can be?

436
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:13,034
She's a snake!

437
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:17,067
If she's still here, evidence of insurance, school,

438
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:20,501
even her phone. She knows she'd get caught!

439
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:22,551
Identies...

440
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,199
Can be borrowed.

441
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,475
Some tea, Ma'am.

442
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:35,176
♪ Lonely ♪

443
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:43,999
♪ Always waiting ♪

444
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,400
- Was the other one better? 
 - Both were bad.

445
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,001
- It's like you're trying to fail. 
 - screw you.

446
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:59,560
- How was it? 
 - Oh, hmm...

447
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:04,825
How can I describe this...

448
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:07,199
Feels like forced emotions.

449
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,592
Yeah, exactly!

450
00:31:09,592 --> 00:31:12,299
Like cooking stew with expensive ingredients!

451
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:17,299
Like eating your own food and saying it's the best.

452
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:20,300
- Stone-cold killer. 
 - You're great with lyrics!

453
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,300
Well, I'm really curious.

454
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,884
He claims he writes music when he can't express himself.

455
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,801
What could a little brat have to say anyways?

456
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:31,330
Write your lyrics again, to fit with the band.

457
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:34,299
I promised to take the teacher, what should I do?

458
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:38,299
I want to sing for my mom, as her birthday gift.

459
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:43,259
Why don't you sing on stage here, for her party?

460
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:46,826
I have stage fright, I can't sing.

461
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:49,176
You performed well at the department store!

462
00:31:49,176 --> 00:31:52,099
That wasn't singing.

463
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:54,199
- You suck at singing huh? 
 - No, it's not that.

464
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:56,299
I'm really good at singing.

465
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:00,151
I'm going to grow up to be a singer.

466
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:03,425
Do you think stage fright just disappears?

467
00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:05,299
- It doesn't? 
 - Nope.

468
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,542
You have to get over it.

469
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:08,926
Music can be your hobby.

470
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:11,176
No need to get on stage, just another hobby.

471
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:15,176
Hobby? Have you even seen him play music?

472
00:32:15,176 --> 00:32:19,550
Did your mom risk everything for a hobby?

473
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,775
She must be insane, moving you to an autonomous school,

474
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:26,592
getting treated like crap by everyone, and all for what?

475
00:32:26,592 --> 00:32:30,400
If you really care about her, get over it and sing on stage!

476
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,325
Why are you getting mad at him!

477
00:32:34,325 --> 00:32:37,351
Don't mind him, it's because his life sucks.

478
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:41,501
I'll help you, don't worry little bird.

479
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:49,300
I want to be on stage but...

480
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:54,476
my mom might get sad if I use my inhaler on stage.

481
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,300
Should we try 'it'?

482
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,500
Are you crazy! It's too dangerous for a child!

483
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,575
What other options do we have?

484
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:10,880
- What is it? 
 - It's dangerous...

485
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:14,801
Is he addicted to it?

486
00:33:14,801 --> 00:33:20,451
Welcome to Dr. Juno's Stage Fright Clinic.

487
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,299
You will become an eagle.

488
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:27,842
You will become the predator of the skies.

489
00:33:27,842 --> 00:33:33,800
The little rabbits sitting in the audience, are all your prey.

490
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,150
Don't look, stop.

491
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,376
Hey!

492
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:48,425
Hey, you little!

493
00:33:48,425 --> 00:33:50,125
You piece of...

494
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:56,151
I'll do anything. What is it?

495
00:33:56,151 --> 00:34:01,176
- Is it medication? 
 - It's far more dangerous than that.

496
00:34:01,176 --> 00:34:02,359
Possession.

497
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,600
- Possession? 
 - Don't forget.

498
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,583
If you don't become yourself again when the show is over...

499
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,201
Stop!

500
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:12,851
You become a self-absorbed loser like him.

501
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:27,051
All musicians have a muse that inspires them.

502
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:31,218
Close your eyes, imagine your muse...

503
00:34:31,218 --> 00:34:33,525
Summon your muse here.

504
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:35,092
Focus!

505
00:34:35,092 --> 00:34:36,801
It won't be easy.

506
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:38,426
Oh, jeez!

507
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,075
Good job.

508
00:34:41,075 --> 00:34:45,550
Your muse is interested in someone else.

509
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,576
- Who? 
 - Mappu?

510
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:53,825
Exactly.

511
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:58,609
You are now JUST BE's main vocal and rapper, Mappu.

512
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:01,500
Copy me, I am Mappu.

513
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,550
I am Mappu.

514
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:08,051
- I will go on stage. 
 - I will go on stage.

515
00:35:08,051 --> 00:35:11,725
- And absolutely kill it. 
 - And absolutely kill it.

516
00:35:11,725 --> 00:35:13,126
I am...

517
00:35:13,126 --> 00:35:17,484
- Mappu. 
 - I am Mappu.

518
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:21,376
I am...

519
00:35:21,376 --> 00:35:23,626
Mappu.

520
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:25,784
- I am... 
 - I am...

521
00:35:52,801 --> 00:36:02,300
 Min Jihoo! Min Jihoo!

522
00:36:12,675 --> 00:36:17,501
Don't just move your lips, say it.

523
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:22,226
I thought you were going to kill it? Come on now.

524
00:36:22,226 --> 00:36:26,751
He can't be helped.

525
00:36:27,592 --> 00:36:30,475
If possession doesn't work, it's hopeless.

526
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:34,699
I told you I couldn't do it.

527
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,680

528
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:58,717
- You didn't sleep? 
 - I can't find the lyrics.

529
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,634
Why? I thought you were a poet?

530
00:37:01,634 --> 00:37:06,499
A medieval bard in a past life?

531
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:11,418
I think it's the pressure. Please help me.

532
00:37:11,418 --> 00:37:13,017
Hey.

533
00:37:13,017 --> 00:37:14,926
You have a grey lyrics book, right?

534
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:17,542
You have all your lyrics in it?

535
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:19,842
How'd you know?

536
00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:23,218
Did you see it? Did you look through it?

537
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:26,467
Don't get angry, I didn't read it.

538
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:30,067
I'm not some immoral prick who'd look at another's things.

539
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:35,142
Well, I used to be, before I became the bluebird.

540
00:37:35,142 --> 00:37:37,242
I'm born again.

541
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,967
Just show me.

542
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:43,017
You can't even sing anyways.

543
00:37:43,017 --> 00:37:45,050
- I don't want to. 
 - Hey.

544
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,167
I'll grant you three wishes.

545
00:37:48,842 --> 00:37:53,199
Like a genie. Think about Aladdin.

546
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:57,567
I don't have any wishes.

547
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,218
I know one of our wishes.

548
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:03,051
I'll make Sodam into your girlfriend.

549
00:38:03,051 --> 00:38:05,009
I have three superpowers.

550
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:08,718
Musical talent, cooking, and lastly...

551
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:09,842
womanizing.

552
00:38:09,842 --> 00:38:11,299
I don't think so.

553
00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:16,334
Your ex dumped you and our teacher isn't interested.

554
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:24,842
I don't need your help. For our next field trip...

555
00:38:24,842 --> 00:38:28,299
Sodam signed up for the same one as me.

556
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:30,299
Green...

557
00:38:30,299 --> 00:38:32,042
light!

558
00:38:50,092 --> 00:38:51,642
Uncle!

559
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:54,799
All right, all right.

560
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:58,542
He hears everything...

561
00:39:06,917 --> 00:39:11,092
Don't even think of going into my room.

562
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:14,992
Hey!

563
00:39:14,992 --> 00:39:17,299
Like any artist,

564
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:20,117
I lose my mind without inspiration.

565
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:22,117
But look at me now.

566
00:39:22,117 --> 00:39:23,592
I'm peaceful, right?

567
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:28,592
How so? I summoned my muse.

568
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:31,342
- You sure? 
 - I'm sure, 100%.

569
00:39:31,342 --> 00:39:34,842
Do you really think I need a kid's lyrics?

570
00:39:34,842 --> 00:39:36,967
Yours aren't even good enough for Water Volume.

571
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:39,599
Go to school. I'll see you later.

572
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,434
I'm almost done, almost done...

573
00:39:57,342 --> 00:40:00,292
Now, where could it be...

574
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:02,717
This is too obvious.

575
00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:05,867
You're smarter than that.

576
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:10,817
If I was sly little Jihoo, where would I...

577
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:13,517
Where could it be...

578
00:40:14,442 --> 00:40:16,492
What the Hell...

579
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:17,592
Where is it...

580
00:40:17,592 --> 00:40:20,142
Oh my...

581
00:40:20,142 --> 00:40:21,550
Sly little bastard.

582
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,842
Really outdid himself.

583
00:40:23,842 --> 00:40:28,842
Hiding it up there... Let's have a look.

584
00:40:28,842 --> 00:40:30,592
Oh, here.

585
00:40:30,592 --> 00:40:32,092
 You immoral liar!

586
00:40:32,092 --> 00:40:34,092
Oh my god!

587
00:40:34,092 --> 00:40:36,867
I'm hearing things.

588
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:41,699
Yup! I'm immoral. I've always been.

589
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:44,242
Okay, here it is.

590
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:48,125
Shouldn't be alive. The seed of misfortune.

591
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:51,999
What? Why is this so dark.

592
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:54,718
Little kid trying to be edgy.

593
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,967
Mother should never have had me.

594
00:40:57,967 --> 00:41:03,459
Choke myself to death. Stop my heart from beating.

595
00:41:04,299 --> 00:41:06,799
Please stop me.

596
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,799
Just kill me.

597
00:41:24,342 --> 00:41:28,992
Is something wrong? You look upset.

598
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:32,392
How's Jihoo?

599
00:41:32,392 --> 00:41:35,017
Is he different from the others?

600
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:41,359
At first, he was very careful and withdrawn.

601
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,499
But he tries his best. Which is really important.

602
00:41:45,499 --> 00:41:48,842
He's been brighter since you showed up.

603
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:51,042
He depends on you a lot.

604
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,218
I've done nothing for him.

605
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:56,892
He'll get better. Don't be so worried.

606
00:41:56,892 --> 00:42:01,299
Jihoo is lucky to have a teacher like you.

607
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:03,817
Makes me want to work even harder.

608
00:42:03,817 --> 00:42:07,342
Beanie girl became a great teacher.

609
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:09,792
A really great teacher.

610
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:11,509
Thanks to J. King.

611
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:13,967
Hey, everyone, can we stop for a moment?

612
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:15,467
 - Yes. 
 - Yes.

613
00:42:15,467 --> 00:42:18,218
We will be exploring this garden.

614
00:42:18,218 --> 00:42:21,218
Observe all sorts of living plants,

615
00:42:21,218 --> 00:42:24,592
and feel the importance of life.

616
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:26,092
 - Yes. 
 - Yes.

617
00:42:26,092 --> 00:42:29,842
Don't forget to take notes for the group presentation!

618
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:30,967
 - Yes. 
 - Yes.

619
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:34,683
Let's all take a picture. Everyone over there.

620
00:42:34,717 --> 00:42:38,692
Picture time! Everyone move to the back!

621
00:42:38,717 --> 00:42:40,999
I'll take it for you.

622
00:42:40,999 --> 00:42:42,717
Just press this twice.

623
00:42:42,717 --> 00:42:46,592
Such a pretty keyring, suitable for a couple.

624
00:42:46,592 --> 00:42:51,299
Everyone smile. One, two, three!

625
00:42:51,299 --> 00:42:53,299
Take a photo with us.

626
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:57,717
Pardon me, could you please take a photo?

627
00:42:57,717 --> 00:43:00,200
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

628
00:43:02,092 --> 00:43:05,167
One, two, three!

629
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,218
- J. King, are you okay? 
 - Yeah, of course.

630
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:16,299
Wow! What's all this?

631
00:43:16,299 --> 00:43:18,299
You prepared all of this?

632
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:21,051
This is amazing, I should've prepared more.

633
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:24,550
Reverse tributing is trending these days.

634
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:25,942
Please, try some.

635
00:43:25,942 --> 00:43:30,767
- Oh, you want a photo? 
 - Is that okay?

636
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:33,067
Here...

637
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:34,717
Teacher?

638
00:43:34,717 --> 00:43:37,217
If we're done eating, can we play?

639
00:43:37,217 --> 00:43:38,767
Why not?

640
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:42,842
Everyone can go play but be back here by 1:00.

641
00:43:42,842 --> 00:43:44,118
 - Yes. 
 - Yes.

642
00:43:44,118 --> 00:43:47,592
Don't go anywhere near the water there, okay?

643
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:48,550
 - Yes. 
 - Yes.

644
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:51,299
- What polite children! 
  - Yes!

645
00:43:51,299 --> 00:43:52,218
Be safe!

646
00:43:52,218 --> 00:43:53,920
Let's go later.

647
00:43:58,617 --> 00:44:01,742
How's the audition going?

648
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:06,217
I'm preparing an original song instead of a cover.

649
00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:08,342
Really?

650
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:12,076
Want to hear the lyrics?

651
00:44:12,076 --> 00:44:14,392
Can I?

652
00:44:17,717 --> 00:44:20,317
It's my first time sharing.

653
00:44:20,317 --> 00:44:22,092
Have a look.

654
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:27,834
Oh my...

655
00:44:28,842 --> 00:44:31,092
- What? 
 - Umm...

656
00:44:31,092 --> 00:44:33,299
A lot of grammar mistakes.

657
00:44:33,299 --> 00:44:36,999
- Oh, yeah. 
 - I'll correct them for you.

658
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:44,592
Is it bad?

659
00:44:44,592 --> 00:44:49,417
J. King... You're a genius.

660
00:44:50,218 --> 00:44:52,842
Oh, thank God! I was so worried.

661
00:44:52,842 --> 00:44:56,259
Don't be worried you'll be great.

662
00:44:56,259 --> 00:44:58,299
The lyrics are really good.

663
00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:01,342
Thank you so much. You always cheer me up.

664
00:45:01,342 --> 00:45:05,900
- Am I really that supportive? 
 - More than that.

665
00:45:07,259 --> 00:45:09,425
Could there be a luckier fan than me?

666
00:45:09,425 --> 00:45:12,892
I get to see your lyrics before anyone,

667
00:45:12,892 --> 00:45:16,109
I get to eat food you cooked yourself.

668
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:23,440
I don't even feel like I'm at work, I'm so happy.

669
00:45:24,117 --> 00:45:25,867
Thank you.

670
00:45:28,118 --> 00:45:29,992
I have a question.

671
00:45:31,134 --> 00:45:33,942
Teacher, I'm a bit confused.

672
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:37,717
Do you happen to...

673
00:45:39,018 --> 00:45:43,967
think of me as more than a friend?

674
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:45,118
What?

675
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:49,699
Our relationship is parent-teacher, right?

676
00:45:49,717 --> 00:45:51,218
Yes, of course.

677
00:45:51,299 --> 00:45:56,342
From a different perspective, you're my fan...

678
00:45:56,342 --> 00:45:57,642
and I'm your...

679
00:45:57,642 --> 00:45:59,892
Star! My one-pick!

680
00:45:59,892 --> 00:46:03,867
J. King is my shining star!

681
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:07,199
I'm such an old man now.

682
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:11,492
Back then that would make me cringe. Now I love it.

683
00:46:14,842 --> 00:46:18,675
I know that you like me because your my fan,

684
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:23,983
but I feel shy as if you proposed to me or something.

685
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:29,218
Maybe it's because you're so good to Jihoo.

686
00:46:29,218 --> 00:46:33,242
I just really like you a lot.

687
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:43,067
I like you.

688
00:46:44,842 --> 00:46:46,542
Really?

689
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:52,599
Really...? You like me?

690
00:46:57,299 --> 00:47:00,342
But I have a boyfriend.

691
00:47:03,383 --> 00:47:04,350
What?

692
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:09,299
I really like you, J. King,

693
00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:12,299
but my feelings are... I like you, but...

694
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:15,392
- How could I... 
 - I like you as a fan!

695
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:20,999
I like you as a fan.

696
00:47:20,999 --> 00:47:22,542
A fan...

697
00:47:23,592 --> 00:47:25,499
Oh, my!

698
00:47:25,499 --> 00:47:29,299
Did you think that I liked you in some other way?

699
00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:32,092
- Oh my... I'm so sorry! 
 - I just assumed...

700
00:47:32,092 --> 00:47:35,742
Don't be sorry, it's okay. Let's eat, Teacher.

701
00:47:35,742 --> 00:47:39,742
Out of all my fans you're my favorite.

702
00:47:39,742 --> 00:47:41,467
- Thank you for all this! 
 - Yup.

703
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:42,967
I'm so embarrassed.

704
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:45,467
You really misunderstood.

705
00:47:47,509 --> 00:47:48,342
Yeah?

706
00:47:48,342 --> 00:47:51,034
Then today is our day one?

707
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,299
Okay.

708
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:00,392
Hey, Mingi, where are you going?

709
00:48:00,392 --> 00:48:02,342
Hey, Mingi!

710
00:48:11,342 --> 00:48:13,784
Mingi!

711
00:48:13,784 --> 00:48:15,642
 Mingi!

712
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,167
What?

713
00:48:18,884 --> 00:48:19,884
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

714
00:48:19,884 --> 00:48:21,051
Mingi!

715
00:48:21,051 --> 00:48:22,467
- Move, move, move! 
 - Teacher!

716
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:23,717
Move, move, move!

717
00:48:23,717 --> 00:48:26,299
No, Jihoo! Don't, it's dangerous!

718
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:28,299
Jihoo, stop!

719
00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:29,942
Move! Move!

720
00:48:29,942 --> 00:48:32,051
Mingi! Mingi!

721
00:48:38,342 --> 00:48:44,017
Are you still cold? Your mother will be here soon.

722
00:48:44,017 --> 00:48:46,267
Mingi! Mingi!

723
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:49,842
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

724
00:48:49,842 --> 00:48:51,300
Just give me new clothes!

725
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,592
Greetings, Mother.

726
00:48:53,592 --> 00:48:54,675
What happened?

727
00:48:54,675 --> 00:48:57,199
Where the hell were you when he fell?

728
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:58,867
I'm so sorry.

729
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:02,299
Teacher warned us not to go there.

730
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:05,267
He didn't listen and fell in by himself.

731
00:49:05,299 --> 00:49:08,642
If it wasn't for Jihoo and his father, it could've been worse.

732
00:49:11,018 --> 00:49:14,417
He was injured while saving Mingi.

733
00:49:18,467 --> 00:49:22,417
Doc, will I ever walk again?

734
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:25,318
- Yeah... 
 - How many stitches?

735
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:27,250
A total of zero.

736
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:32,218
I'm in excruciating pain.

737
00:49:32,218 --> 00:49:37,417
Doc, why does my heart hurt so much?

738
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:40,309
That's impossible.

739
00:49:45,717 --> 00:49:50,299
How can a homeroom teacher be so irresponsible?

740
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:53,318
She was busy.

741
00:49:53,318 --> 00:49:56,417
- With her love life. 
 - What?

742
00:49:56,417 --> 00:49:59,459
She's in love with Jihoo's father.

743
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:01,867
There's no way.

744
00:50:01,867 --> 00:50:04,601
They have matching keyrings.

745
00:50:10,892 --> 00:50:14,059
Thanks for coming. I thought I'd never walk again.

746
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:17,299
What you did was amazing, saving that kid.

747
00:50:17,299 --> 00:50:20,442
Why did you try and save Mingi?

748
00:50:20,442 --> 00:50:25,667
The water was so dirty, I thought you had OCD.

749
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:29,918
Did you want to look cool in front of Sodam?

750
00:50:30,999 --> 00:50:34,259
Why are you mad?

751
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:38,870
You don't know how I feel. You don't know anything.

752
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:47,867
Wait! Wait.

753
00:50:47,867 --> 00:50:49,767
- What're you doing? 
 - Where do you live?

754
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:52,890
Do you live here? Wait! Wait!

755
00:50:57,999 --> 00:51:01,692
Hey! Hey!

756
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:03,199
Let's just talk! Stop running away, hey!

757
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:04,799
Wait! Wait!

758
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:07,167
He got away...

759
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:08,399
I'm injured again...

760
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,075
Hey!

761
00:51:12,376 --> 00:51:16,159

762
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:18,399
How are you so good at drawing?

763
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:22,399
It's like a photo. You should be a painter!

764
00:51:22,399 --> 00:51:24,334
My father used to be...

765
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:26,018
Does it look like him?

766
00:51:26,018 --> 00:51:27,342
Absolutely the same.

767
00:51:27,342 --> 00:51:28,492
- It's the same right? 
 - Right?

768
00:51:28,492 --> 00:51:31,267
- It's the same, completely! 
 - Glad to hear it.

769
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:34,392
- Uncle, can you draw like that? 
 - Of course.

770
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:37,110
We'll get him in no time!

771
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:49,317

772
00:51:49,317 --> 00:51:53,317
Dropped again! Why is it constantly dropping?

773
00:51:53,317 --> 00:51:54,567
Hey.

774
00:51:54,567 --> 00:51:56,717
Where are you going all dolled-up?

775
00:51:56,717 --> 00:51:58,534
A meeting.

776
00:51:58,534 --> 00:52:02,409
- About the school change. 
 - That's today?

777
00:52:02,409 --> 00:52:05,267
- They didn't hand out all the agreements. 
 - That's true.

778
00:52:05,267 --> 00:52:07,842
I'm not sure if we should be doing this.

779
00:52:07,842 --> 00:52:09,759
Just do as she tells you to.

780
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:12,342
- She'll throw you a bone. 
 - Whatever.

781
00:52:12,342 --> 00:52:14,225
Sure.

782
00:52:25,926 --> 00:52:28,767
A meeting? I never heard of it. What's it about?

783
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:32,099
I think it's about the school system changing.

784
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:33,583
School change...

785
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,867
What do you mean?

786
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:38,876
If that happens, will Jihoo move away?

787
00:52:38,876 --> 00:52:43,017
Please help us, you're the bluebird.

788
00:52:43,017 --> 00:52:46,984
I'm not ready to break up with Jihoo yet.

789
00:52:46,984 --> 00:52:49,759
Why didn't anyone tell me about this?

790
00:52:49,759 --> 00:52:52,034
Yes, Teacher.

791
00:52:52,034 --> 00:52:53,892
I just heard.

792
00:52:53,892 --> 00:52:56,734
They don't even have everyone's consent, how could they?

793
00:52:56,734 --> 00:53:02,634
I don't know. I think they did something secretly.

794
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:06,684
Let me figure this out.

795
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:10,218
What are they planning? This is making me crazy!

796
00:53:10,218 --> 00:53:12,780
I'll look into it.

797
00:53:22,009 --> 00:53:23,899
Is it here?

798
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:32,600
 Parent Communication Metting with Representative Hwang Geunyoung

799
00:53:37,817 --> 00:53:40,700

800
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:16,067
Why is that old hag here?

801
00:54:16,067 --> 00:54:18,217
How did she come...

802
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:19,934
Lets see...

803
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:29,299
For a long time we have fought to change the school system.

804
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:35,009
Finally, we have some fortunate outcomes.

805
00:54:35,009 --> 00:54:36,467
The parent's consent forms.

806
00:54:36,467 --> 00:54:39,699
We will look at them as fast as possible.

807
00:54:39,699 --> 00:54:43,390
How do we know those are real?

808
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:49,642
How the hell did he find out about us!

809
00:54:49,642 --> 00:54:51,701
Who are you?

810
00:54:51,701 --> 00:54:52,692
Is it that renter?

811
00:54:52,692 --> 00:54:59,899
I'm a parent as well, I've never signed anything.

812
00:54:59,899 --> 00:55:03,500
We don't need every single parent's consent, right?

813
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,599
That's true...

814
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:07,199
Just stop! What're you doing? You should leave.

815
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:09,242
You should be embarrassed! Get out!

816
00:55:09,242 --> 00:55:13,242
I deserve to be here more than you! I'm the bluebird!

817
00:55:13,242 --> 00:55:17,199
What do Momvelies think they are? And the Diamond?

818
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:20,342
How can you decide the fate of our school?

819
00:55:20,342 --> 00:55:24,625
Don't film me! I have rights! Stop filming, please!

820
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,642
Security! Get rid of him!

821
00:55:26,642 --> 00:55:27,809
Let go! Let go of me!

822
00:55:27,809 --> 00:55:29,842
Come on! Let go of me!

823
00:55:29,842 --> 00:55:31,542
It's a mess, let's leave.

824
00:55:31,542 --> 00:55:34,767
Sir! Representative! Do you remember me?

825
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:37,267
It's me.

826
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:41,199
Remember the birthday party? I heard everything.

827
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:43,142
Votes in exchange for the school change?

828
00:55:43,142 --> 00:55:44,967
Those two are best friends.

829
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:48,399
He's involved on an intimate and personal level?

830
00:55:48,399 --> 00:55:49,784
Of course! He really is!

831
00:55:49,784 --> 00:55:54,325
They're changing the entire school by themselves!

832
00:55:54,325 --> 00:55:55,742
What's going on?

833
00:55:55,742 --> 00:55:58,409
Don't kick me out!  Let go of me!

834
00:55:58,409 --> 00:55:59,517
Let go! Let's just talk.

835
00:55:59,517 --> 00:56:02,299
Let go! You should vote fairly!

836
00:56:02,299 --> 00:56:06,300
I worked hard to become the bluebird to stop all of you!

837
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,318
You think I don't know why you're doing this?

838
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:10,392
Apartment prices! You want them higher!

839
00:56:10,392 --> 00:56:14,059
As for me? I care about the kids!

840
00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:16,799
You can't do this to the kids!

841
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,934
Children are powerless!

842
00:56:18,934 --> 00:56:21,099
Don't you care about what the kids want?

843
00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:22,867
Let go!

844
00:56:22,867 --> 00:56:24,942
What the hell is this conference!

845
00:56:24,942 --> 00:56:28,340
Can we just talk... Ouch! Let go!

846
00:56:29,642 --> 00:56:32,680
- Are you okay? 
- Are you okay?

847
00:56:44,242 --> 00:56:47,118
Audition! I have to get to my audition!

848
00:56:47,118 --> 00:56:48,267
The teacher's waiting for me.

849
00:56:48,267 --> 00:56:50,634
My audition! Now let me out, please.

850
00:56:50,634 --> 00:56:52,692
I didn't do anything on purpose.

851
00:56:52,692 --> 00:56:54,199
Please quiet down!

852
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:57,499
Let's be peaceful, you're a handsome guy...

853
00:56:57,499 --> 00:56:59,918
Do you know what's important?

854
00:56:59,918 --> 00:57:01,759
My audition is the most important.

855
00:57:01,759 --> 00:57:03,683
Hey, raise the volume.

856
00:57:03,683 --> 00:57:06,659
It's out of our hands now.

857
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:08,892
 The man who attacked security

858
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:13,092
 is a jobless man in his 30's living in the rental apartments.

859
00:57:13,092 --> 00:57:15,892
This is really blowing up.

860
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:18,325
 He's really violent all the time.

861
00:57:18,325 --> 00:57:20,559
 He drinks alcohol by the playground.

862
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,009
 I heard he was a mental patient.

863
00:57:23,009 --> 00:57:24,299
What's wrong with all of you!

864
00:57:24,299 --> 00:57:27,534
 All the kids are terrified of this man.

865
00:57:27,534 --> 00:57:31,999
 Police have received reports of child molestation...

866
00:57:31,999 --> 00:57:36,992
 ...romantically involved with Teacher S. of the school.

867
00:57:36,992 --> 00:57:40,534
 ...Teacher S is currently under investigation for

868
00:57:40,534 --> 00:57:42,425
 purposely putting a child in danger.

869
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:44,634
Excuse me, that's not true.

870
00:57:44,634 --> 00:57:46,659
Please let me out.

871
00:57:46,659 --> 00:57:47,692
Excuse me!

872
00:57:47,692 --> 00:57:51,342
 He has also approached the Korean People's Party,

873
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:57,492
 threatening with false accusations in exchange for money.

874
00:57:58,867 --> 00:58:00,842
Excuse me!

875
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:13,400
Principal, it's not true.

876
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,718
She did nothing wrong.

877
00:58:17,434 --> 00:58:19,517
Go ahead and explain.

878
00:58:19,517 --> 00:58:21,842
There's nothing to explain. Everything is false.

879
00:58:21,842 --> 00:58:24,792
- False? 
 - Yes, complete false.

880
00:58:25,517 --> 00:58:28,892
Explain the musical note keyring.

881
00:58:28,892 --> 00:58:30,618
What?

882
00:58:32,434 --> 00:58:35,442
I heard it's a couple accessory?

883
00:58:36,276 --> 00:58:38,025
That's...

884
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,918
It's not what you think.

885
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:45,367
I gave that to him when I was young.

886
00:58:45,367 --> 00:58:47,599
I'm his fan.

887
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,642
- Fan? 
 - Yes.

888
00:58:49,642 --> 00:58:52,799
He's a musician that I liked.

889
00:58:53,517 --> 00:59:01,067
What about your date while my kid was drowning?

890
00:59:02,517 --> 00:59:03,367
That's...

891
00:59:03,367 --> 00:59:06,199
Does any of this make sense, Teacher?

892
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:11,009
You both have significant others, this is unacceptable.

893
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:13,480
I'm not married.

894
00:59:16,092 --> 00:59:18,767
- Don't... 
 - What did you say?

895
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:21,501
I'm not Jihoo's father, I'm his uncle.

896
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:25,842
I'm not married, she isn't either...

897
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:29,618
It's not true, but what's so wrong if it were?

898
00:59:29,618 --> 00:59:32,667
We're both unmarried and young.

899
00:59:33,575 --> 00:59:37,799
Were you aware that he wasn't the father?

900
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:41,692
Jihoo was transferred under the secrecy system.

901
00:59:41,692 --> 00:59:43,342
Wait then...

902
00:59:43,342 --> 00:59:47,925
You knew he wasn't a parent and made him bluebird?

903
00:59:47,925 --> 00:59:51,692
Uncles have the same right to be guardians.

904
00:59:51,692 --> 00:59:56,192
So you admit to knowing and lying?

905
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,899
Then I should take thissomewhere else.

906
00:59:58,899 --> 01:00:01,492
I'll speak with the school district.

907
01:00:01,492 --> 01:00:03,459
Fine.

908
01:00:03,459 --> 01:00:07,534
I lied that I was his father, is that so bad?

909
01:00:07,534 --> 01:00:11,400
Everyone has family problems, what's so wrong?

910
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,625
Because I bothered your conference?

911
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:19,299
Is that why you came up with lies and are hunting her down?

912
01:00:19,299 --> 01:00:22,199
Why are you trying to ruin her life?

913
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:24,767
Ruin her life?

914
01:00:24,767 --> 01:00:28,434
I am preventing a danger.

915
01:00:28,434 --> 01:00:31,984
I am protecting what I have, with everything it takes.

916
01:00:31,984 --> 01:00:35,920
If I don't, someone might take it.

917
01:00:42,509 --> 01:00:44,834
I am sorry.

918
01:00:44,834 --> 01:00:49,550
Berry classroom will have a substitute. Take a break.

919
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,217
What?

920
01:00:52,192 --> 01:00:53,625
Just do as I say.

921
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:57,983
I'm trying to help you from losing your license.

922
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,999
Principal, this is not right.

923
01:00:59,999 --> 01:01:02,417
She didn't do anything wrong to deserve this.

924
01:01:02,417 --> 01:01:05,918
You know how great of a teacher she is.

925
01:01:05,918 --> 01:01:08,809
Do you know how hard she worked to become a teacher?

926
01:01:08,809 --> 01:01:13,876
You won't be able to fulfill your dreams here anyways.

927
01:01:13,876 --> 01:01:18,192
Take a break, look for another autonomous school.

928
01:01:18,192 --> 01:01:21,900
Jihoo should look for a new school, too.

929
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,059
What?

930
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:28,575
Our school is changing into a normal system.

931
01:01:28,575 --> 01:01:31,799
I received the confirmation.

932
01:01:31,799 --> 01:01:33,899
What?

933
01:01:39,601 --> 01:01:43,199
We are one step closer to a greater Songjak district.

934
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,600
I feel like we're already at the top!

935
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,842
You did so well, Diamond.

936
01:01:48,842 --> 01:01:52,799
Should we chant our cheer? It's been so long!

937
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,867
One-stop education district! First-class Sungjak district!

938
01:01:55,867 --> 01:02:00,270
 One-stop education district! First-class Sungjak district!

939
01:02:15,218 --> 01:02:17,317
Uncle?

940
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:02,084

941
01:03:02,084 --> 01:03:03,867
 Did you leave?

942
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:06,042
 Without me?

943
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:46,190

944
01:03:53,399 --> 01:03:56,460

945
01:04:07,792 --> 01:04:10,142
 Just grow up healthily

946
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:14,620
 Congratulations on your first birthday. Your uncle.

947
01:04:20,792 --> 01:04:25,618
Is this all mine?

948
01:04:28,701 --> 01:04:33,900
 Congratulations on your third birthday. Your uncle.

949
01:04:50,292 --> 01:04:55,100

950
01:04:56,717 --> 01:04:59,899
 It's for a 7-year-old, is this the right size?

951
01:04:59,899 --> 01:05:03,025
 - How much for this? 
 - 29,000 won.

952
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:05,425
 I've been busy, sorry I haven't seen you yet.

953
01:05:05,425 --> 01:05:10,299
 For your 7th Christmas gift! Your uncle.

954
01:05:10,299 --> 01:05:16,967
 P.S. when we meet, let's play with this together.

955
01:05:16,967 --> 01:05:19,450
Liar.

956
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:43,892
Thank you for taking care of Jihoo.

957
01:05:43,892 --> 01:05:48,099
I tried to leave, but they wouldn't let me.

958
01:05:48,099 --> 01:05:49,659
Is it okay to leave this soon?

959
01:05:49,659 --> 01:05:54,142
I have to. I should've never come.

960
01:05:54,142 --> 01:05:58,859
I can go home myself, where are the kids?

961
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:02,076
The bar owner is babysitting them.

962
01:06:02,076 --> 01:06:03,892
I, umm...

963
01:06:04,867 --> 01:06:08,609
It's still your birthday.

964
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:13,559
Congratulations.

965
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:19,267
You don't want it?

966
01:06:22,801 --> 01:06:26,610
It's my... first time receiving...

967
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:31,834
Thank you.

968
01:06:33,299 --> 01:06:36,599
- Thank you, we're leaving! 
 - Thank you.

969
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:37,842
You're leaving?

970
01:06:37,842 --> 01:06:42,892
Already? No, no. I prepared soup.

971
01:06:42,892 --> 01:06:44,400
Thank you but we should. Thank you.

972
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,099
No, no. Wait, at least eat this and go!

973
01:06:48,099 --> 01:06:50,599
Come, hurry up!

974
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:52,117
Birthday cake!

975
01:06:52,117 --> 01:06:54,092
Just have some, take a seat.

976
01:06:54,092 --> 01:06:57,209
Don't worry, he'll be back.

977
01:06:57,209 --> 01:07:00,826
We can't skip your birthday for him!

978
01:07:00,826 --> 01:07:02,142
Right?

979
01:07:02,142 --> 01:07:05,199
How old? What grade are you in now?

980
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:07,659
Get the candles.

981
01:07:10,492 --> 01:07:14,850
Has Uncle called?

982
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:16,299
No.

983
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,599
Everyone's here.

984
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:21,109
- Oh! 
 - You came.

985
01:07:21,992 --> 01:07:24,167
Come sit with us. We just began.

986
01:07:24,167 --> 01:07:28,942
This works out, I wanted to say something.

987
01:07:28,942 --> 01:07:32,199
Come, sit, sit down. Eat some cake.

988
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:34,926
You look terrible!

989
01:07:35,592 --> 01:07:37,517
I think...

990
01:07:37,517 --> 01:07:40,926
I have to get back to Incheon.

991
01:07:40,926 --> 01:07:44,867
Captain said he had a slot open for me.

992
01:07:44,867 --> 01:07:51,380
You should get a sitter for Jihoo.

993
01:07:56,842 --> 01:07:58,667
What're you doing!

994
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:01,342
He always runs away under pressure.

995
01:08:01,342 --> 01:08:03,167
Hyeok.

996
01:08:04,076 --> 01:08:06,299
Don't do this.

997
01:08:07,759 --> 01:08:10,300
I ruined everything.

998
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,099
I acted out and ruined everything.

999
01:08:12,099 --> 01:08:14,425
It's not ruined, it's okay. I'm here.

1000
01:08:14,425 --> 01:08:16,259
No.

1001
01:08:17,076 --> 01:08:19,851
Teacher lost her job because of me.

1002
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:22,117
And the school is changing.

1003
01:08:22,117 --> 01:08:26,990
Jihoo might have to transfer again.

1004
01:08:29,342 --> 01:08:30,850
He can do it.

1005
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:33,701
He's done it before, he'll be okay.

1006
01:08:33,701 --> 01:08:35,642
It's not okay. I'll ruin things again.

1007
01:08:35,642 --> 01:08:39,083
You know, I ruin everything.

1008
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:41,499
That's why you never contacted me.

1009
01:08:41,499 --> 01:08:47,099
No matter how hard, no matter how bad they beat you,

1010
01:08:47,099 --> 01:08:49,842
I'm such a useless person.

1011
01:08:50,642 --> 01:08:54,901
Why would anyone contact me for help?

1012
01:08:56,842 --> 01:08:59,100
I'm scared.

1013
01:09:00,099 --> 01:09:02,999
I'm scared I'll get Jihoo hurt.

1014
01:09:02,999 --> 01:09:06,042
What if I cause his grandmother to find him?

1015
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:08,142
So just...

1016
01:09:09,267 --> 01:09:11,876
Don't contact me again.

1017
01:09:14,467 --> 01:09:20,342

You didn't go to the army?

1034
01:11:29,299 --> 01:11:34,218
Life must be good, you look even better.

1035
01:11:36,099 --> 01:11:41,300
Why'd you go to their house?

1036
01:11:42,492 --> 01:11:46,599
I left something important.

1037
01:11:46,599 --> 01:11:50,450
Something important to us.

1038
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:10,280

1039
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:35,130

1040
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:38,700
 Your uncle and our teacher, have a thing?

1041
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,018
 Nope, no.

1042
01:12:40,018 --> 01:12:43,018
 Someone like Noeul's father. I'd divorce in a heartbeat.

1043
01:12:43,018 --> 01:12:46,009
 Single women in our neighborhood, are all after him.

1044
01:12:46,009 --> 01:12:49,399
 He wouldn't be interested in a divorced lady with kids.

1045
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:51,399
 You got me fired.

1046
01:12:51,399 --> 01:12:54,992
 Will you move following the school change?

1047
01:12:54,992 --> 01:12:56,534
 Say whatever you want.

1048
01:12:56,534 --> 01:12:59,250
 What isn't true, can't hurt me.

1049
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,784
 What anonymous post?

1050
01:13:00,784 --> 01:13:03,099
 The school change was a scam...

1051
01:13:03,099 --> 01:13:04,701
 - So what now? 
 - What?

1052
01:13:04,701 --> 01:13:06,826
 Can we turn everything back?

1053
01:13:06,826 --> 01:13:11,109
 If you're going to steal them, you have to succeed today.

1054
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:15,099
 I would do anything to make sure you win the election.

1055
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,834
 You can find yourself in danger.

1056
01:13:16,834 --> 01:13:22,170
 If I can restore what they lost, I don't care what happens to me.
