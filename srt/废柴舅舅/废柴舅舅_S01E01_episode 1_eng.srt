1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460

2
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:11,401

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,909

4
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:21,999

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,467

6
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:33,525

7
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:37,792

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,980

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,959

10
00:00:50,990 --> 00:01:00,000

11
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:14,959

12
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:34,108
Is there any progress in changing our kids' school from autonomous to normal?

13
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:36,366
I asked my kid's homeroom teacher, but he's completely clueless.

14
00:01:36,366 --> 00:01:38,666
Even the principal is clueless!

15
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:42,392
Only our "Royal Momvely Diamond" knows. She's even more powerful than the principal.

16
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:47,618
- You're right. Didn't she have brunch with the Minister of Education last week? 
 - Of course.

17
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:50,592
Do you think there'll be any good news? So why were we all summoned today?

18
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:55,117
Royal Momvely Diamond is here.

19
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:56,592
Hello.

20
00:02:00,192 --> 00:02:02,341
You're moving to a nice neighborhood.

21
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:04,483
Seongjak district is blowing up these days.

22
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:06,491
You are aware of the craze behind Gangnam district 4, right?

23
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:10,066
After this tunnel was made and going to Gangnam became so fast.

24
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:13,967
All you have to do is live here a bit and move to Gangnam. Right?

25
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,442
Sure...

26
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:28,941
I've asked for everyone to come today to announce some good news.

27
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,991
I'm sure everyone knows about the top 1% after-school academy in Gangnam?

28
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:36,650
Of course. The daily trips driving back and forth from there is such a pain.

29
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,024
Seriously.

30
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:43,166
They've decided to open their main academy here,

31
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,167
in the Seongjak district.

32
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,466
Really?

33
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:52,267
Even the native teachers will rotate between Gangnam and here.

34
00:02:57,717 --> 00:03:02,998
Our Ro-Mom Gold's children will all receive a 50% discount and be exempted from the level test.

35
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:05,751
No way! A 50% discount!

36
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:08,717
What is our goal?

37
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:12,518
 One-stop education district ! First-class Seongjak district!

38
00:03:12,518 --> 00:03:18,117
Then maybe our kids have a chance at an Elite High School like Chaeyoung.

39
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:25,066
How dare you secretly run away.

40
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:28,166
I'm sure you're well aware of what I'll do to you once I find you.

41
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:31,591
So stop messing around, and bring back my grandson.

42
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:34,598
Mom! Mom, mom, mom! All of Jihoo's things are gone!

43
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:37,817
When the hell did they plan this?

44
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,191
Shut your mouth.

45
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:42,717
Wang Joonhee! Jihoo! Where are you? Where'd you guys run off to?

46
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:45,166
I said, be quiet. I'm recording.

47
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:48,817
Recording? Who in their right mind would want to hear your voice?

48
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:51,026
It gives me chills just thinking about it.

49
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,942
Mrs. Jang, you really didn't see anything?

50
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:02,791
I had absolutely no idea, Ma'am.

51
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:06,717
Don't lie to me. How the hell could you not know?

52
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:09,941
Should I go through the CCTV and fire all of you?

53
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:11,898
Wretched girl!

54
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:14,241
She can try but...

55
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:20,166
a broke single mother will never be treated with respect!

56
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:24,066
I said no. Rental apartment residents cannot use this entrance.

57
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:27,416
Sir, we didn't know. If you let us in just this once, we won't use it again.

58
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:30,466
Are you actually serious right now? What the hell has the world come to!

59
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:33,541
Look behind us. How do you expect us to back out?

60
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,441
Look at the quality of the moving truck. What is that?

61
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,191
They seem to be moving into the rental apartment, right?

62
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:39,417
They should just let them through.

63
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:40,898
How could they even back out?

64
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:43,998
Can't they let them in and make them take a U-turn out?

65
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:46,492
I don't like them using our entrance.

66
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:49,341
Oh my! The security let them through?

67
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:51,941
They just simply can't do their jobs properly.

68
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:54,526
Calm down, everyone.

69
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:57,216
It's not their fault they live in the rentals, right?

70
00:04:57,216 --> 00:04:59,858
The fault is on those who built this place, thinking that mixing these rental residents

71
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,791
with us will create a more extensive community...

72
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:04,317
Hey, is that a child in the taxi?

73
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:07,898
Another kid from a resident family joining our kids?

74
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:09,898
So annoying!

75
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:11,416
It's so annoying that our school is autonomous.

76
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:14,742
Those rental residents are the reason why our apartments aren't doubling in price!

77
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:33,742
 It truly was a strange neighborhood.

78
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:47,118
 Someone stands precariously on the roof railing, then jumps off.

79
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:48,741
 Why would she do this here?

80
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:50,617
 Even in death she's causing other's harm!

81
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:54,067
 What if rumors spread? Our apartment prices might fall!

82
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:59,599
 A neighborhood that fears apartment prices more than death...

83
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:04,566
 Everyone living here is ready.

84
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:10,040
 Ready to eliminate anything or anyone that could interfere with property prices...

85
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:12,942
Please, drink this.

86
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,599
 We could feel it in the cold looks they were giving us.

87
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:27,142
 Soon enough, they would kick us out of here.

88
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,898
How is it?

89
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:33,918
This is our home now!

90
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:36,918
Not ours, just where we live.

91
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,291
Son, do you always have to be factual?

92
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:42,067
Nope!

93
00:06:51,342 --> 00:06:57,399
 And there is no one here to protect us.

94
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,040

95
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:20,998
 ♪ Oh! How beautiful things suit me but ♪

96
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:25,999

 ♪ I'll forever find my way towards... ♪

103
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,416
Do you even have a conscience?

104
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:14,998
You slept all day, and now you're playing around?

105
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:18,917
Sorry, did you pull all of them out?

106
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:20,541
Let's see what we have!

107
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,416
You guys are amazing! What a fulfilling day.

108
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:27,541
Not bad, but we didn't really get much today.

109
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:29,441
What should I do? Should I help?

110
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:32,333
Hey, you little brat! Move and go play over there.

111
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:36,376
I'm not playing. I have to earn my keep.

112
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,591
My God, you're useless.

113
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:44,899
Aren't you used to this by now?

114
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,292
My soul and body are sensitive.

115
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,867
As an artist, even my five major organs are sensitive.

116
00:08:58,867 --> 00:09:03,899
Seriously! Captain, do we really have to pay that guy?

117
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:09,591
I am always grateful! Thank you so much!

118
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,892
Hey, catch these ones, too!

119
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,492
Look here! There are so many!

120
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,799
Let's just eat what we have left today, not much to work with...

121
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,717
The big man upstairs...

122
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:37,041
must be a fair God.

123
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:42,142
What would this useless guy be without his incredible cooking skills?

124
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,750
You remember, right?

125
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,617
Incentives on top of deep-sea fishing basic salary.

126
00:09:47,617 --> 00:09:50,192
I've got real coffee for dessert!

127
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:52,798
You greedy little thief. Why the hell do you deserve an incentive!

128
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:56,691
You're playing our captain for a fool!

129
00:09:56,691 --> 00:10:00,591
If you buy me some working clothes, I'll cook all three meals.

130
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:04,566
Jeez, all you care about is money.

131
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:07,067
Who in the world doesn't care about money the most?

132
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:08,067
That's true.

133
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:12,541
When I was a kid, I really thought that money was the most important.

134
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,817
But as I grew up and saw the world,

135
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:19,699
I realized, money really is the most important!

136
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:23,374

137
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,592

138
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:30,618
Old man, is it really necessary to call me?

139
00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:34,392
Boss man of Hot Bar, how've you been?

140
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:37,998
How'd you get the money you sent me?

141
00:10:37,998 --> 00:10:40,066
Did you sell a kidney or something?

142
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:42,899
So dramatic.

143
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,491
Sorry for the delay. And I couldn't send the interest.

144
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:48,492
Did I ever ask you to pay me back?

145
00:10:48,492 --> 00:10:51,167
 Did you go MIA just to make some money?

146
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:55,566
Hey, by any chance have you heard anything about Bongpyo?

147
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:56,898
 Of course not!

148
00:10:56,898 --> 00:11:02,898
If the police can't even find him, I'm sure he's on an anchovy fishing ship.

149
00:11:02,898 --> 00:11:04,292
Where are you?

150
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:05,999
Me?

151
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,108
You know, just here and there.

152
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:10,798
Stop dicking around and come back. Just come and work here.

153
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:13,817
I paid you back. Why would I return?

154
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:15,617
I've got to save some money and get back to it!

155
00:11:15,617 --> 00:11:19,799
When are you coming? Yeonjoo is waiting for you.

156
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:23,066
No way? There is nobody.

157
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:25,358
 She's blunt,

158
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:29,567
thoughtless, but strangely loyal?

159
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,216
How can you say that about your own daughter?

160
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:33,998
If your daughter broke up with a guy like me, you should be telling her that

161
00:11:33,998 --> 00:11:37,416
it was a smart move and that dating me was a mistake!

162
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,191
You shouldn't try and support us.

163
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:42,566
She's dating someone worse than you...

164
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:45,898
Come on.  There's no way...

165
00:11:45,898 --> 00:11:49,798
Anyways, I can't go right now. I can but I won't.

166
00:11:49,798 --> 00:11:53,041
So, stay healthy, old man.

167
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:54,809
 Hey, J. King...

168
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,374
 That was JUST BE's comeback.

169
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,708
 JUST BE is back after an 8 month hiatus.

170
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:22,291
 They sound even better.

171
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:24,291
 Thank you for an amazing performance.

172
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,166

Joonhyeok! Joonhyeok!

185
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:09,998
Yeonjoo, stop running around. You might fall.

186
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:11,416
Look! Look! A news article!

187
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:12,666
She said he's in the news!

188
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,267
"Today, May 20th, at the Red Square M Hall,

189
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:18,666
Unisex member Seonah's solo album showcase!

190
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:21,541
The final winner of Super Dream Voice Season 2,

191
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:24,967
J. King will appear as a guest!"

192
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:31,092
"J. King was immediately defrauded of his entire prize money...

193
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:33,799
His album 'Something' was scheduled to be released but was canceled.

194
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,998
After a hiatus of more than 10 years, he was completely forgotten by the public..."

195
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:42,492
Jeez, why is Bongpyo writing an article with all these unnecessary details?

196
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:44,166
Well, it's all true.

197
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:47,416
Damn Joonhyeok, you really had a rough 10 years, huh?

198
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:51,567
Forget about the past. You got this, you're going to make it!

199
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:56,541
Success! Success!

200
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:59,499
 Come back! Come back!

201
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:02,042
 Make it! Make it!

202
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:06,998
No, sorry, you cannot enter this way.

203
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,342
Please use the main entrance.

204
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:11,592
Oh, he's J. King. Seonah's guest artist.

205
00:14:11,592 --> 00:14:14,416
Hi, everyone, I'm J. King.

206
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:17,392
Our guest artist already arrived...

207
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:19,767
There must be a mistake.

208
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:21,892
Please wait.

209
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:23,792
Nothing?

210
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,499
I'll call him.

211
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:31,892
Do we have more guest artists?

212
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:34,792
Someone is here constantly claiming that he's a guest today...

213
00:14:35,392 --> 00:14:37,017
Yeah.

214
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:42,967
Excuse me. I think you're mistaken.

215
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:45,699
Mistaken? What do you mean mistaken?

216
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:52,767
Look. It's an article proving his gig today.

217
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,917
- He's not answering? 
 - Yeah, no answer.

218
00:14:54,918 --> 00:14:58,099
Can you call Chief Hong from inside?

219
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:01,249
- Who? 
 - Mr. Hong. He's my friend,

220
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,167
Chief of production at JYB Records. Hong Bongpyo.

221
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:09,399
We've never heard of such a person.

222
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,475
Chief Hong? Hong Bongpyo...

223
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:14,083
Can't he hear?

224
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:19,692
Well, how about Yoon... What was it? Why can't I remember?

225
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:23,718
Oh, Director Yoon Jioh?

226
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:26,467
He's at our headquarters.

227
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,917
Can I have his number, please?

228
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:32,942
- You don't have his number? 
 - Yeah. I never had a reason to meet him.

229
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:34,918
That's Bongpyo's job.

230
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:39,998
How could you not know? You've never met him?

231
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:41,249
Yeonjoo, just wait.

232
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,082
A lot going on in my head right now, give me a second.

233
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,042
Excuse me...

234
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,541
Can I please have his number? I really need to speak with him.

235
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:50,917
Actually, you don't have to give me his number, just call him for me.

236
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:54,041
Mr. Hong, I mean Bongpyo. He's my friend from the military.

237
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:57,917
We randomly met at a bar a year ago. He asked me to work on my music with him.

238
00:15:57,918 --> 00:16:01,899
I took out my apartment deposit and even got a loan to produce songs and promote them.

239
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:05,625
Wait, umm, I've even paid for this promotion...

240
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,600
I'm going crazy!

241
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,742
He said JYB Records would reimburse me afterward.

242
00:16:12,742 --> 00:16:15,492
Seriously? Is this a joke or something?

243
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:18,998
Excuse me. I have to get on stage. I'm running late, can we just...

244
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:20,416
Sorry but, I'll be on stage...

245
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:21,842
Wait, wait.

246
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:24,899
Just wait! Hey, let me in!

247
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,791
I'm J. King. You know me, right? I'm the winner of Super Dream Voice season 2.

248
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:28,998
I'm J. King.

249
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:32,166
I'm J. King. I'm the winner of Super Dream Voice season 2.

250
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:33,958
I'm J. King.

251
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,750
Let go of me! Get off of me!

252
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:42,434
I'm J. King. Get off of me!

253
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,166
I sacrificed everything for this...

254
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,998
Let go of me! Get off of me!

255
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:47,792
Let go of me!

256
00:16:56,999 --> 00:17:00,166
I can't believe you didn't check if the contract was real or not.

257
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:03,217
How could you be so stupidly trusting!

258
00:17:03,217 --> 00:17:06,998
I trusted him because he was my friend.

259
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:08,791
Don't you learn from your mistakes?

260
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,999
Even your family defrauds you, do you think a friend is more trustworthy?

261
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,541
Friend?

262
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:16,067
What kind of a friend would set you up and screw you like this?

263
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:20,367
He made fake posters, fake articles just to stab you in the back!

264
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:21,750
Didn't you hear?

265
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:24,541
He came here and begged them to put me on stage!

266
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,283
How much did he take from you for marketing?

267
00:17:26,283 --> 00:17:28,275
All he did was bring over some CDs and ask if you could perform.

268
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:30,609
That's it. Who can't do that?

269
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:32,442
How are you standing up for him right now?

270
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:36,041
I'm not taking his side!

271
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:40,067
Yeah, my sister screwed me over, and now my best friend?

272
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:42,692
Admitting that would make my life feel worthless.

273
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:45,234
Want me to make it worse?

274
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:49,367
Now your girlfriend is leaving you.

275
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:51,118
What?

276
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:53,218
Pay my dad back.

277
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,367
Sell all this shit or whatever it takes. Just pay him back!

278
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,142
Yeonjoo.

279
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,718
- Hello? 
 -  Mr. J. King, we heard your CD that Hong Bongpyo gave us.

280
00:18:32,718 --> 00:18:35,317
Would you like to sell us your tracks?

281
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:37,776
 We're just buying and holding onto many tracks.

282
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,859
 I heard about your situation. What a shame.

283
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:42,167
 We'll conpensate you generously.

284
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:40,018
This is everything I need.

285
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:42,666
Does that mean my son's Secret Transfer Request can be finalized?

286
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:46,416
Yes, you are his only designated guardian as of now,

287
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:52,267
nobody is allowed to pick him up from our school without your permission.

288
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:54,392
Thank you, please take good care of him.

289
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:58,166
From what I see, Jihoo has performed exceptionally well academically.

290
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:01,333
We are an autonomous school, so our education program is a bit different...

291
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,541
Were you aware?

292
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:04,998
That's why we decided to come to this school.

293
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:07,291
Jihoo is really interested in music.

294
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:08,750
That's great.

295
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:11,467
If there's anything that worries you, please let me know.

296
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:13,592
I'll take good care of him.

297
00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:15,567
Thank you.

298
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:27,467
The after-school orchestra has no open slots at the moment.

299
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:33,267
Are you Jihoo's mother? Your son just transferred, right?

300
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,567
Yes, how'd you...

301
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,676
My daughter and I saw you move in.

302
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:38,625
I heard your son joined my daughter's classroom.

303
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:40,718
I'm the father of Joo Noeul in the Berry classroom.

304
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:43,392
- Oh, hello. 
 - Hello.

305
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:44,860
Here.

306
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:49,150
Put this ticket in, they'll contact you.

307
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,842
- Will it take long? 
 - I'm not too sure,

308
00:20:52,842 --> 00:20:56,192
but students transfer frequently. It won't be too long.

309
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:03,742
- Oh my, Noeul's father. Right? 
 - Hello, Sodam's mother.

310
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:09,333
Oh, she's the mother of Min Jihoo. He just transferred to our school and joined our Berry classroom.

311
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,468
Oh...

312
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:12,875
- Hello. 
 - Oh, hello.

313
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:14,625
I'm Ye Sodam's mother.

314
00:21:14,626 --> 00:21:19,374
I was going to add you to our group chat. I'm the temporary "Blue Bird".

315
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,399
- Blue Bird? 
 - Oh my...

316
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:23,283
You don't know anything?

317
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:26,998
- You haven't signed up for our Ro-Mom either? 
 - What is that? "Ro-Mom"?

318
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:30,099
My, my... You don't know our "Ro-Mom"?

319
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:32,417
The Royal Momvely.

320
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,917
Yeah, it's my first time hearing of it.

321
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,667
Which building did you move into?

322
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:40,208
Same as me, building 3507.

323
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:44,342
Thank goodness. I'm glad you're not a rental resident.

324
00:21:44,342 --> 00:21:47,541
Well, we can all meet and greet each other at the class meeting.

325
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:50,242
I have to head out now.

326
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:57,124
I guess there's discrimination against renters?

327
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,541
Yes. Extreme discrimination.

328
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,041
Sorry if I overstepped.

329
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:03,692
I didn't want you to suffer from unwarranted discrimination.

330
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:07,018
That's what I thought. I guess I was right.

331
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:09,784
Anyways, that whole "Ro-Mom" thing?

332
00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:13,041
What exactly is it? Do I have to sign up?

333
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:17,018
It's a club that only residents of famous brand apartments in Seongjak district can join...

334
00:22:17,018 --> 00:22:21,492
It's like a social club where moms share information and hang out together...

335
00:22:21,492 --> 00:22:26,509
I'm a renter, so I guess I can't join? How lame.

336
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:32,525
If there's any useful information for your son, I'll let you know.

337
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:34,942
Thank you.

338
00:22:35,942 --> 00:22:38,791
She's not a renter? All right.

339
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:43,217
Me? At the catering place with Hyeryeong, preparing for Mingi's birthday.

340
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:48,392
Huh? Okay, I'll ask.

341
00:22:48,918 --> 00:22:52,917
She wants to know if Chaeyoung is coming to Mingi's birthday party.

342
00:22:52,918 --> 00:22:55,998
I'm not sure if my Chaeyoung can. She probably can't?

343
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:56,999
This too.

344
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:57,999
That's what I thought. She's so rude to even ask.

345
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,500
Chaeyoung's probably extremely busy at her elite boarding school.

346
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:03,998
Sodam isn't as smart as Chaeyoung.

347
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:06,142
The only thing she's good at is putting makeup on, like her mother.

348
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:08,666
She's beautiful, just like her mother. No harm.

349
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,218
These days, even beauty is considered a skill.

350
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:15,692
Oh! The new student who just transferred to our classroom... Jihoo? They say he isn't a son of a renter.

351
00:23:15,692 --> 00:23:17,541
I thought so.

352
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:20,899
Mingi was worried. He said he's extremely smart.

353
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:25,867
Is she kind of blunt? She doesn't even know our "Ro-Mom."

354
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:33,717
She must be a working mom, which would explain why she doesn't know.

355
00:23:33,717 --> 00:23:37,042
What's her profession?

356
00:23:44,676 --> 00:23:47,708
It's not seasoned correctly.

357
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:50,899
It's alright if you think it's home-cooked, but it's a bit bland as a commercial side dish.

358
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:53,500
Everyone I know who has a cooking license has the same problem.

359
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:56,626
It's because they learned how to cook through books.

360
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:59,666
She's really good with ingredients that are hard to work with.

361
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:01,918
Cooking is your hobby?

362
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:05,142
A lot of moms think they're good at cooking because they hear compliments.

363
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:08,041
"Your food is so good! You should open up a side dish store."

364
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:10,899
Everyone believes their cooking is great and fails miserably.

365
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:13,291
Doing this professionally is a whole different story.

366
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:16,998
We have to produce in massive quantities, and you're just too skinny and weak.

367
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:19,041
I told you, I can do everything on my own.

368
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,942
I'll contact you.

369
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:23,999
I seasoned the food a bit less than usual

370
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:26,342
since there is an elementary school and kindergarten nearby,

371
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:30,467
and most of your customers are buying for their children.

372
00:24:30,467 --> 00:24:35,134
Provocative dishes taste good at first, but they get old, and customers won't return.

373
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:39,583
And I don't cook as a hobby.

374
00:24:39,584 --> 00:24:41,799
I have to earn money to raise my child.

375
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:45,899
I prepared a lot for this job and also got my license.

376
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:48,791
Also, I'm stronger than anyone.

377
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:51,542
Try me.

378
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:57,291
Mom, congratulations on finding a job.

379
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:59,917
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

380
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:05,767
- Why Sprite? 
 - I'm not going to drink anymore.

381
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:08,041
I'm living happily with my son.

382
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:11,792
I don't need alcohol anymore, right?

383
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:13,592
I've got a job that pays.

384
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:17,175
Everything's going to be great moving forward.

385
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:22,899
Do you really think grandma won't be able to find us?

386
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:27,099
Don't worry. I've got everything under control.

387
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:28,899
You don't trust your own mother?

388
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:30,609
I do.

389
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:37,267
Son, have you made any friends in your class?

390
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:40,208
Your teacher told me to sign you up for some sports.

391
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:42,541
Boys that play sports are popular, you know?

392
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,618
You know I suck at sports.

393
00:25:44,618 --> 00:25:47,998
Exactly, you're just like your uncle.

394
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:51,417
Your uncle was always terrible at sports.

395
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:55,117
How would I know? I've never met him.

396
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,666
You should take a break during the closed season.

397
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,208
Why are you working so hard?

398
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:06,584
You have to take care of your health as well.

399
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:08,317
Hey!

400
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:11,442
I need to work to stay healthy.

401
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,942
Hey!

402
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,159
Hello?

403
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:29,692
Yes. Yeah. Wait a moment, please.

404
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:33,199
Hey, hey, hey...

405
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:36,541
Hey, hey, it's a girl.

406
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:38,799
A girl? Why would a girl be calling me?

407
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,099
Here, speakerphone.

408
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,499
Yes, here he is. Please speak up!

409
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:47,998
- Speak. Hurry! 
 - Hello?

410
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:50,000
 Do you have time right now?

411
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,584
I've always got time!

412
00:26:52,584 --> 00:26:54,333
I don't know this voice.

413
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:57,417
She just said "Hyuk"

414
00:26:57,417 --> 00:27:00,742
- Hello? 
  - Hyuk, it's your sister.

415
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:04,718
You had a sister? You said you didn't have any family.

416
00:27:04,718 --> 00:27:06,041
 Hello?

417
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:10,500
 I'll explain later, but I'm in a bit of a hurry right now. Can you come over?

418
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:13,999
 It's about Jihoo. Your nephew.

419
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,618
Nephew?

420
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:17,998
Hey, tell her you're going.

421
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:19,292
 Hyuk.

422
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:22,041
He'll go. Don't worry. I'll make sure he does.

423
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:25,900
-  Thank you. I'll text you my address.  
 - All right.

424
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,291
Hey! He can't make me go! What's the meaning of all this?

425
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:32,041
Why are you contacting me? Why not YOUR son's grandmother or father?

426
00:27:32,042 --> 00:27:34,818
 I'm asking you, please... Just come over.

427
00:27:34,818 --> 00:27:38,518
- She's asking very politely. 
 - Just, just hang up the phone. Gosh!

428
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:41,042
 Hyuk, I'm divorced.

429
00:27:42,192 --> 00:27:44,992
 We just moved to a new neighborhood, Jihoo doesn't know his way around the area.

430
00:27:44,992 --> 00:27:49,292
 You're the only person who can help Jihoo.

431
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:52,741
Hey, hey, hey! You might as well.

432
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:54,992
If you get on a deep-sea fishing ship, you won't be back for months.

433
00:27:54,992 --> 00:27:56,292
I said it's fine. I'm not going to go.

434
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:57,998
What do you mean "fine"?

435
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:00,041
I don't know why you and your sister don't see each other but

436
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:02,041
don't hold hate and be cold to others.

437
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:04,217
You'll be the one left colder.

438
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:06,420
Hey!

439
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:08,999
Does everyone take me for a fool?

440
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:12,709
 I'm in the emergency r...

441
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:19,099
Let's see what we have here.

442
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:21,042
I've got to cut through your shirt.

443
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:36,516
- Mom. 
 - Ro-Mom Diamond is incredible.

444
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:39,291
How did they manage to bring the top 1% academy to the Seongjak district?

445
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:42,267
It's a dream come true.

446
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,100
- I heard Ro-Mom Gold even get discounts. 
 - I'm so jealous.

447
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:49,442
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

448
00:28:53,117 --> 00:28:57,592
Jeez, what a nice neighborhood.

449
00:28:57,592 --> 00:29:00,699
I guess someone's been living a good life.

450
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:05,298
Hey kid? Oh, never mind, um nothing.

451
00:29:05,298 --> 00:29:06,834
Sorry.

452
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:09,667
Did he seriously dress like that to pick up his child?

453
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,618
Oh my god, he smells.

454
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:14,292
He's not a parent. I've never seen him before.

455
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:16,241
Is he a driver from the academy or something?

456
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:18,208
Does that look like an academy vehicle to you?

457
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:21,998
If it wasn't for the captain, I would've never came.

458
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:22,999
Oh my!

459
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,541
- What is he doing? 
 - Should we stop him?

460
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:29,709
Remember the news about some crazy guy who threatened children with a knife?

461
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:32,825
I think he's walking in! Call security!

462
00:29:32,825 --> 00:29:34,366
Somebody grab him! Don't let him in!

463
00:29:34,366 --> 00:29:36,291
Stop him! Don't let him in!

464
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:39,683
Excuse me, wait! Wait, wait!

465
00:29:39,683 --> 00:29:41,641
- Wait, I said wait! 
 - What? Why?

466
00:29:41,641 --> 00:29:43,617
No!

467
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:45,998
Where do you think you're going?

468
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:47,641
Who are you here for?

469
00:29:47,641 --> 00:29:50,742
Oh, umm...

470
00:29:50,742 --> 00:29:52,766
I don't know him yet.

471
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:56,408
Oh my god, what are you saying? Are you a kidnapper or something?

472
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:59,418
Huh? No, I don't kidnap people.

473
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,992
You're not going anywhere! I called security. Stop him!

474
00:30:04,992 --> 00:30:08,567
Security for what? I've got to go!

475
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,842
You ripped my shirt!

476
00:30:16,842 --> 00:30:19,499
It's all torn. Look what you've done!

477
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:22,999
Here, here!  Here, the pervert is here!

478
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:25,042
Pervert? Here, here!

479
00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:26,209
Here, here!

480
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:35,391
- Oh my god! 
 - Oh my...

481
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:39,125
- Oh my... 
 - Did you see his chest?

482
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:44,451
Why am I running away?

483
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:51,042
Wow, look at how free-spirited my outfit is today...

484
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:52,667
Who can I blame? I seriously look like a creep.

485
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:56,734
Which classroom was it? Fruit?

486
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:59,518
Fruit punch?

487
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:03,198
Not plum... Berry

488
00:31:03,198 --> 00:31:05,098
Right! Berry, berry...

489
00:31:05,098 --> 00:31:06,983
Berry, berry, berry!

490
00:31:06,983 --> 00:31:10,134
Okay! Berry!

491
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,867
Hey you.

492
00:31:14,118 --> 00:31:15,992
Are you Min Jihoo?

493
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,751

494
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:29,867
Look at how white you are. You look like some rich guy's son.

495
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:32,899
Your mom had some things to do. She couldn't pick you up today.

496
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:35,584
She asked me to send you to some after-school academy?

497
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:38,516
Then bring you back home safely. Let's go.

498
00:31:38,516 --> 00:31:40,992
I'm not Min Jihoo.

499
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:46,891
Your name is right there. And you look just like your mother.

500
00:31:46,891 --> 00:31:49,041
I borrowed this from Jihoo yesterday.

501
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,891
He's still in the classroom.

502
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:52,418
Oh yeah?

503
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:57,242
Sorry! Sorry! My mistake.

504
00:31:57,242 --> 00:32:01,942
All you kids look the same these days.

505
00:32:01,942 --> 00:32:04,692
Huh? There's no one here.

506
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:10,418
What? There's no one here.

507
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:13,418
Hey, why'd you... Why'd you lock the door?

508
00:32:13,418 --> 00:32:15,942
Hey, kid!

509
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:18,792
Hey, kid! Why'd you lock this!

510
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:26,142
Somone unlock this!

511
00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:29,141
Is it a fire? Excuse me!

512
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:33,541
Im trapped... I'm... Trapped... It's a fire, fire!

513
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:36,549
- What the... 
 - I've got you...

514
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:39,558
- You're the pervert kidnapper! 
 - No, no, a misunderstanding!

515
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:43,191
- How dare you show yourself again and threaten our children! 
 - I said it's a misunderstanding!!

516
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:57,000
Hey!

517
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:06,842
Seriously tying up an injured man?

518
00:33:06,842 --> 00:33:09,999
Are you sure you don't know him?

519
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:13,017
- Yes. 
 - Hey, I don't know you either.

520
00:33:13,017 --> 00:33:16,098
You know that's really not helping you, right?

521
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:18,998
The police are almost here.

522
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:21,299
Don't even bother talking to him.

523
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:25,198
You take your job seriously, old man. I truly respect you.

524
00:33:25,198 --> 00:33:28,516
Yeah, I guess it's part of your job to be suspicious towards everyone.

525
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:32,041
There's a lot of crazy people out there, you know? Right?

526
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:34,292
I really understand where you're coming from.

527
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:36,991
Jihoo! Are you okay?

528
00:33:36,991 --> 00:33:39,799
Where's your uncle? He isn't here?

529
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,799
Uncle?

530
00:33:46,642 --> 00:33:51,566
Oh my, why is he tied up? Untie him!

531
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:54,767
I heard from your mother that your uncle would be picking you up today.

532
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:56,391
It's fine, I'm all right.

533
00:33:56,391 --> 00:33:58,708
Why didn't you say you were his uncle?

534
00:33:58,709 --> 00:34:00,999
You could have mentioned that you guys are family.

535
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,900
- Family?
 - They both said they didn't know each other...

536
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:06,998
She mentioned that they wouldn't know each other's faces.

537
00:34:06,998 --> 00:34:10,000
- I'm so sorry. 
 - Yup.

538
00:34:16,517 --> 00:34:18,092
Oh my!

539
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:21,959
Why, what's wrong?

540
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,518
He isn't Jihoo's uncle?

541
00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:27,042
- No, I... 
 - He's not?

542
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:29,542
- Nothing... 
 - What?

543
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:34,699
Oh, no. I mean, yes. He is Jihoo's uncle.

544
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,098
- Sorry. 
 - It's all right.

545
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:39,317
You scared me...

546
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:47,101
Do you have a mental condition or something? What's wrong?

547
00:34:47,101 --> 00:34:51,349
You lied to me about who you were and tripped me.

548
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:54,175
You're seriously a bad kid.

549
00:34:56,776 --> 00:35:01,599
Hey! Use your words! Do you think you can just gesture things to me?

550
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:07,900
I think I know her.

551
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,899
Hey, by the way, what's the name of your teacher?

552
00:35:10,899 --> 00:35:13,925
I feel like I've seen her somewhere.

553
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:15,867
I seriously doubt that.

554
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:17,999
I seriously doubt that.

555
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:20,899
- So immature. 
 - Yeah. Agreed.

556
00:35:26,899 --> 00:35:29,098
What is that? Brain structure?

557
00:35:29,098 --> 00:35:32,975
I can tell what the children are interested in.

558
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:34,899
You try so many things.

559
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:38,734
Why were you so surprised at that guy?

560
00:35:38,734 --> 00:35:40,400
Do you know him?

561
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,000
Who, me?

562
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,124
I guess there's no way you could know him.

563
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:47,301
That's that kid, right?

564
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:49,667
The kid who transferred secretly because of domestic violence.

565
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:52,109
Please, shush.

566
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,266
What was that guy thinking anyway?

567
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:56,692
He should've dressed up a little bit. It's a school, for God's sake.

568
00:35:56,692 --> 00:35:58,998
The neighborhood is rough towards renter kids as it is.

569
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:02,467
Do appearances really matter that much?

570
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:05,126
- 10,000 won. 
 - Yes.

571
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:11,067
What am I doing? I'm broke as it is.

572
00:36:11,067 --> 00:36:13,499
You!

573
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:15,599
You have money, right?

574
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,792
And is that yours?

575
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:30,367
Hey, give it here. Why should I pay for gas?

576
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:32,391
Let go, don't touch me. Get away!

577
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:35,042
Do you know how hard I worked for this money?

578
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:44,198
Do you need help? Should I call the police?

579
00:36:44,198 --> 00:36:47,042
Police? Why?

580
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:49,492
Hey, what's wrong with your face?

581
00:36:49,492 --> 00:36:54,442
Hey, what's wrong? You can't joke about things like this.

582
00:36:56,876 --> 00:37:01,198
Excuse me. I hate it as much as this kid, but I'm his legal guardian. I'm his uncle.

583
00:37:01,198 --> 00:37:04,898
- Is it okay for an uncle to take a child's money? 
 - I have my reasons.

584
00:37:04,898 --> 00:37:08,491
What reasons could anyone possibly have for taking a kid's money?

585
00:37:08,491 --> 00:37:10,899
The majority of perpetrators of child violence are family members.

586
00:37:10,899 --> 00:37:14,699
Oh, okay, great. Can you move now?

587
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,417
Are you crazy? Hey kid, if you want me to call the police, raise a finger.

588
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:20,041
If you don't, raise two.

589
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:23,241
He can just say it. Why does he have to use fingers?

590
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,292
Go ahead, raise two fingers.

591
00:37:29,467 --> 00:37:31,492
Seriously!

592
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:37,109
Filling up 10,000 won worth of gas, right away!

593
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:39,317
Let me get some coupons.

594
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:06,917
Are you Jihoo's father?

595
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,792
Oh, there's no way.

596
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:11,266
I don't know that kid. He's terrible at sports.

597
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:12,791
I have no idea who that is.

598
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:15,998
See that girl smashing serves like a professional?

599
00:38:16,198 --> 00:38:18,667
I'm her father.

600
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:22,992
How nice.

601
00:38:22,992 --> 00:38:26,467
But that's strange. She's my daughter.

602
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:30,084
I'm just joking.

603
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:33,717
Oh, of course.

604
00:38:33,717 --> 00:38:35,291
- How funny... 
 - Funny right?

605
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:37,433
Of course, I'm joking! Nice to meet you.

606
00:38:37,433 --> 00:38:40,998
It's good to see you, Jihoo's father. I met the mother the other day.

607
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,200
- Oh, right, right.
 - Will you be joining us for the classroom get-together?

608
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:46,591
Get together?

609
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:49,567
Come to the Taekwondo gym of the shopping mall by 11:00 on Saturday.

610
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:52,041
Everyone only gets together once a year,

611
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:55,299
so it's important that you make it.

612
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,317
Why're you calling again?

613
00:38:57,317 --> 00:39:00,117
Why're you calling again?

614
00:39:00,117 --> 00:39:02,918
What? Who? You saw Bongpyo?

615
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:04,999
Where are you right now!

616
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:08,866
I'm on my way! Just wait! Yeah, all right, I'll see you soon!

617
00:39:17,742 --> 00:39:20,218
Hey! We've got to go. Hurry, now!

618
00:39:20,218 --> 00:39:23,418
- Can't. 
 - What do you mean you can't? What?

619
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:26,342
You're smart, think of something! Come on!

620
00:39:26,342 --> 00:39:27,892
10,000 won.

621
00:39:27,892 --> 00:39:29,816
You little...!

622
00:39:29,816 --> 00:39:32,791
All right, whatever! Just think of something!

623
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:36,242
Ouch!

624
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:39,591
Hey, hey! Are you okay?

625
00:39:39,591 --> 00:39:43,417
Is it your ankle? You sprained your ankle, huh?

626
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:46,999
We have to get you to the E.R! Don't worry everyone, I've got this!

627
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:05,416
- Where are we going? 
 - To catch a crook.

628
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:06,393
Did you get scammed?

629
00:40:06,393 --> 00:40:11,217
Yeah! If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be living like this!

630
00:40:13,067 --> 00:40:14,567
Wait.

631
00:40:15,342 --> 00:40:18,099
Your mother never told you about me?

632
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:20,998
Like what I do or how I am?

633
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:24,666
- Not really... 
 - Jeez, seriously? Wow...

634
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:25,917
You have a phone, right?

635
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:29,018
- Look my name up. 
 - No charge.

636
00:40:29,018 --> 00:40:32,742
You know who I am?

637
00:40:33,717 --> 00:40:37,199
Do I really have to say it myself?

638
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:41,998
Hey, I... won first place.

639
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:44,799
I won a big and famous, prestigious award.

640
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:48,666
Look me up on YouTube. There are tons of videos of me.

641
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:52,242
Have a look when you can.

642
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:56,666
If it wasn't for that bastard Bongpyo...

643
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:59,541
Just wait, you thief! I'm going to end your life today.

644
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:01,367
How could you do this to me! You scamming jack!

645
00:41:03,392 --> 00:41:07,917
You asshole! Seriously? You're so annoying!

646
00:41:07,918 --> 00:41:10,742
I really thought Bongpyo showed up!

647
00:41:10,742 --> 00:41:13,767
Why would he show up? It's like walking into a death trap!

648
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:15,998
You seriously are stupid.

649
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:17,999
Making fun of you is the best part of my day.

650
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,998
Oh my god. You're so annoying.

651
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:23,151
Try me again, seriously!

652
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:27,709
I called you over because I missed you.

653
00:41:27,709 --> 00:41:31,283
Where were you? How'd you show up so fast?

654
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:34,617
I mean, no matter how urgent it is, how could you show up wearing that?

655
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:35,867
Yeonjoo is going to arrive soon.

656
00:41:35,867 --> 00:41:37,318
Joonhyeok?

657
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,775
Yeonjoo...

658
00:41:42,775 --> 00:41:44,967
Greet him. He's Yeonjoo's new date.

659
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:47,299
You've heard about him? He's J. King.

660
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:51,124
I've heard so much about you. Nice to meet you.

661
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:52,992
Yeah, well...

662
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:56,509
Seriously, what are you wearing?

663
00:41:57,442 --> 00:41:58,998
Geez...

664
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:02,292
But, sir, do you know this kid?

665
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:07,392
He was fidgeting around outside and said his father is inside.

666
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,167
Hey, you were supposed to wait in the car.

667
00:42:11,867 --> 00:42:14,666
Leaving me in a car by myself is child abuse.

668
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:17,791
Back in the day, 5th graders were old enough to have their own kids.

669
00:42:17,792 --> 00:42:20,684
Wait, are you saying that this child is yours?

670
00:42:20,684 --> 00:42:25,998
- So... He even has a kid? 
 - What's wrong with having a kid!

671
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:27,998
My father raised me all by himself.

672
00:42:27,999 --> 00:42:30,218
Is that wrong?

673
00:42:30,218 --> 00:42:32,418
Keep calling me dad.

674
00:42:34,918 --> 00:42:36,249
Come inside. I think we need to talk.

675
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,684
Okay.

676
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:46,617
Why didn't you tell me you had a kid? Then where's his mother?

677
00:42:46,617 --> 00:42:48,299
She d... died...

678
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:52,998
You should've told me.

679
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:56,000
You think I'm the kind of girl that can't understand?

680
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,201
I feel so bad for that kid.

681
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,700
Is it really necessary for you to be sitting there?

682
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:09,900
It's okay. We share everything together.

683
00:43:09,918 --> 00:43:13,018
A year ago you shared everything with me.

684
00:43:13,018 --> 00:43:17,099
Don't blame me. I waited more than a hundred days for you.

685
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:18,999
You've gotten prettier.

686
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,742
Really?

687
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:26,291
What's wrong? Should I get you something to drink?

688
00:43:26,292 --> 00:43:28,099
Could you, please?

689
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:30,799
And get one for J. King, too.

690
00:43:30,799 --> 00:43:33,833
You're so sweet.

691
00:43:33,834 --> 00:43:36,009
He's not so bad.

692
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:43,650
She is kind of blunt, simple, and nice.

693
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:46,159
Listen up, you miserable failure.

694
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,183
What?

695
00:43:47,183 --> 00:43:50,041
You got scammed by your family, then your best friend,

696
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:52,734
and to top it off, Yeonjoo dumped you, right?

697
00:43:52,734 --> 00:43:58,583
Plus, how stupid are you to sell your hit songs for chump change?

698
00:44:02,134 --> 00:44:04,208
I heard she met someone worse than me,

699
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:09,409
I couldn't picture anyone worse than me, but here you are.

700
00:44:09,459 --> 00:44:13,958
When she comes back with the drinks, then leave and never come back.

701
00:44:13,959 --> 00:44:16,166
Hey, I worked here for years.

702
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:17,583
Human beings have a thing called "relationships," okay?

703
00:44:17,584 --> 00:44:20,666
You must have an insane network of people.

704
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:22,833
At that age, working part-time like a loser with no real job...

705
00:44:22,834 --> 00:44:25,998
What do you for a living to be such a piece of crap?

706
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:30,983
I'm a doctor. A dermatologist. With a lot of money.

707
00:44:30,983 --> 00:44:34,082
You know she likes money, right? She happens to love Botox as well.

708
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:37,534
I give her the best shots made internationally.

709
00:44:37,534 --> 00:44:39,299
Getting angry?

710
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:43,367
I've never seen a character like you before.

711
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:46,309
How should I react to your crap?

712
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:49,009
What does she see in you?

713
00:44:49,009 --> 00:44:50,984
Are you Korean?

714
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:56,418
Drink up. It's non-alcoholic.

715
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:03,998
- Excuse me, but... 
 - Yes.

716
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:08,784
- Why are you wearing girl clothes? 
 - Girl's clothes?

717
00:45:08,784 --> 00:45:11,309
You're right, it is for women.

718
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:15,283
But dressing like this comforts my heart.

719
00:45:15,283 --> 00:45:20,499
When I wear this, the softness inside me puts me at ease.

720
00:45:20,499 --> 00:45:21,683
Don't you have anything like that?

721
00:45:21,683 --> 00:45:26,899
Something like a doll or anything that brings you peace?

722
00:45:26,899 --> 00:45:32,809
When I was young, I had a blanket I always had when I went to bed.

723
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:34,409
It was soft...

724
00:45:35,634 --> 00:45:40,416
But my grandmother said a growing boy shouldn't have such blankets,

725
00:45:40,417 --> 00:45:42,333
then tore it to pieces and threw it out.

726
00:45:42,334 --> 00:45:46,834
Your grandmother is really mean.

727
00:45:46,834 --> 00:45:51,618
Then, what brings you at ease now?

728
00:45:52,525 --> 00:45:53,883
Playing the piano?

729
00:45:53,883 --> 00:45:56,884
I like making music or writing lyrics.

730
00:45:56,884 --> 00:46:01,734
Oh, that's marvelous. Your father is a highly talented musician.

731
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:06,184
He's not my father.

732
00:46:06,184 --> 00:46:07,809
I know.

733
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:11,934
You're probably his nephew?

734
00:46:11,934 --> 00:46:17,399
J. King always kept a younger photo of you in his wallet.

735
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,209
You grew up so much...

736
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:27,199
Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

737
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,230
Understand?

738
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,659
Leaving so soon?

739
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,500
Let him be. He must have some pressing matters.

740
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,759
Yeonjoo...

741
00:46:43,459 --> 00:46:47,683
Not returning to you even when I knew you were waiting was...

742
00:46:48,209 --> 00:46:50,834
For you, not me.

743
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,609
I didn't want you to be part of my futureless life,

744
00:46:54,609 --> 00:47:01,009
But... I really do regret letting you go.

745
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:04,309
Because of the piece of crap behind you.

746
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:08,082
I understand if you're angry,

747
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:11,109
but can't you be cool and be happy for us?

748
00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:16,583
Juno loves me even when he knows everything about our history.

749
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,999
I'm happy these days.

750
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,309
Are you a psychopath? Or just a moron?

751
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:21,708
Joonhyeok!

752
00:47:21,709 --> 00:47:23,708
You didn't see what that guy was doing?

753
00:47:23,709 --> 00:47:26,998
He's literally a piece of trash! Is there a CCTV?

754
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:29,583
- Seriously, just stop. 
 - Yeonjoo, I'm all right.

755
00:47:29,584 --> 00:47:31,998
Psychoanalytically, he's probably going through a lot right now...

756
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:36,309
Hey, psychoanalysis... dig into your own head.

757
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:40,199
I said stop!

758
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:13,559
Not that. Give me the 20,000 won I gave you.

759
00:48:14,751 --> 00:48:17,309
You won't regret it. I promise.

760
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:54,109
- It's good, huh? 
 - Yes.

761
00:48:54,909 --> 00:48:59,317
- Were you a singer? 
 - I still am!

762
00:49:00,299 --> 00:49:02,499
My dream is to become a musician.

763
00:49:03,534 --> 00:49:06,909
Did you give up on your dream?

764
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:10,567
I didn't give up. You stole it from me.

765
00:49:10,584 --> 00:49:12,159
What?

766
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:15,799
You! You stole my dreams.

767
00:49:16,899 --> 00:49:21,599
My dreams were stolen when you were born, so you're now my dream.

768
00:49:23,183 --> 00:49:25,625
You were the first button.

769
00:49:25,626 --> 00:49:28,099
You were the start of my life going downhill.

770
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:33,359
My dreams, my life, everything... get it?

771
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:44,299
Your father never cooked this stuff for you?

772
00:49:45,834 --> 00:49:49,082
I never had food like this before.

773
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:52,159
Of course, I'm the only one who can make it.

774
00:49:54,484 --> 00:49:58,859
Then I guess it's the last time I'll eat it.

775
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,959
Goodbye.

776
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:18,834
Hey, where are you going? I'll drop you off.

777
00:50:20,459 --> 00:50:22,199
I can go by myself.

778
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:25,334
No, you're joking. Get in. I'll take you.

779
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:30,609
Hey, can't you hear me?

780
00:50:31,183 --> 00:50:33,499
An adult is talking to you!

781
00:50:34,083 --> 00:50:37,899
Whatever, do what you want. I don't care either way.

782
00:50:37,899 --> 00:50:40,234
Stay or leave! I don't care!

783
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,630
Hey !

784
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,550

785
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:26,840

786
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,650
 Oh my!

787
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:12,958
 He's coming! He's coming!

788
00:52:12,959 --> 00:52:16,009
 He's here. He's coming! J. King!

789
00:52:20,709 --> 00:52:21,833
 J. King!

790
00:52:21,834 --> 00:52:23,959
 J. King! J. King!

791
00:52:58,059 --> 00:52:59,799
 J. King!

792
00:53:05,142 --> 00:53:07,276
 Thanks.

793
00:53:07,276 --> 00:53:11,583
 Aren't you freezing? You might catch a cold!

794
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:13,699
 Thank you!

795
00:53:17,884 --> 00:53:20,999
 I made it myself.

796
00:53:25,675 --> 00:53:29,883
 Wow, it's beautiful! Thanks.

797
00:53:31,034 --> 00:53:32,642
 Boom!

798
00:53:55,709 --> 00:54:00,759
Oh Chef, it's fine. I just got back from the hospital.

799
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:01,660
No, no.

800
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:05,183
It's not like you spilled it on me on purpose. I'm really okay.

801
00:54:05,834 --> 00:54:10,999
I'll make up the time I missed today on Sunday.

802
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:14,284
Yes, don't worry.

803
00:54:38,534 --> 00:54:41,998
- We have to go in through the back. 
 - Why?

804
00:54:41,999 --> 00:54:46,583
Renters have to use the back gate.

805
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,809
Why are you guys renters?

806
00:54:58,434 --> 00:55:02,159
Why'd you come so late? Why is your phone off?

807
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:03,642
Where's your uncle?

808
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:06,425
Hyeok...

809
00:55:06,999 --> 00:55:09,850
Come in for a second, let's talk.

810
00:55:14,959 --> 00:55:18,634
Can you change the light bulb?

811
00:55:18,634 --> 00:55:22,617
Mom, what's wrong with your arm? Are you hurt?

812
00:55:22,617 --> 00:55:24,499
It's nothing...

813
00:55:45,918 --> 00:55:47,934
He's terrible, isn't he?

814
00:55:48,459 --> 00:55:50,609
Just call someone to do this stuff!

815
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:53,634
I don't want rumors to spread that I'm divorced.

816
00:55:53,634 --> 00:55:58,059
And I don't want to lie that my husband's working late and stuff, you know?

817
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:00,708
Then why'd you get divorced! You want to lie for the rest of your life?

818
00:56:00,709 --> 00:56:02,998
How crazy are you if you have no one to help you with this?

819
00:56:02,999 --> 00:56:07,084
I can do it myself. I just need help today because of my arm.

820
00:56:08,409 --> 00:56:10,750
It's been 10 years, how happy am I to see you.

821
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,199
Have dinner.

822
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:17,392
- Go wash your hands, let's eat dinner. 
 - We already ate.

823
00:56:17,392 --> 00:56:18,934
What did you eat?

824
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:21,575
What did you feed him? He can't eat certain things.

825
00:56:21,575 --> 00:56:23,183
We didn't eat anything bad.

826
00:56:23,183 --> 00:56:25,909
He can eat whatever he wants. He won't die.

827
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:30,659
The pain is worse than dying. He has atopy, just like you.

828
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:34,584
Don't you remember, I fixed your atopy by feeding you good food.

829
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:47,434
Jihoo, get changed and do your homework.

830
00:56:49,209 --> 00:56:52,217
Don't worry, okay?

831
00:57:08,626 --> 00:57:11,659
Oh! Hello, Sodam's mother.

832
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:16,899
A classroom get-together? Saturday?

833
00:57:16,899 --> 00:57:19,859
Oh... I have to work on Saturday...

834
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:21,859
Is it okay to just send Jihoo?

835
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:24,834
His father is busy on Saturday as well.

836
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:27,998
Yes, unfortunately...

837
00:57:27,999 --> 00:57:29,950
Yes...

838
00:57:31,076 --> 00:57:33,199
Hyeok.

839
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,642
Hyeok.

840
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:40,409
Did you know Jihoo does music? He's talented, just like you.

841
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:46,384
Why'd you get divorced?

842
00:57:46,384 --> 00:57:47,909
Did you lose all the money or something?

843
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:50,390
No, nothing like that.

844
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:53,998
You think this is funny? You think raising a kid is a joke?

845
00:57:53,999 --> 00:57:57,609
How long can you keep up your lies about not being divorced!

846
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:01,583
If you're not confident, you should have left the kid with his rich father!

847
00:58:01,584 --> 00:58:03,958
Music? You think music is a joke?

848
00:58:03,959 --> 00:58:06,399
Do you know how expensive it is to do music!

849
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,818
Stop screaming. Jihoo can hear.

850
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:12,209
So what! What the hell does he have to do with me?

851
00:58:12,209 --> 00:58:14,642
You're still really angry, huh?

852
00:58:18,334 --> 00:58:21,425
Are you trying to make me the bad guy right now?

853
00:58:21,425 --> 00:58:23,708
Did you forget what you did to me?

854
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:27,934
Even if I get over it, you should never forget!

855
00:58:27,999 --> 00:58:31,082
I didn't forget. I've always felt sorry.

856
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:36,883
You should. You ruined my life to save yours!

857
00:58:36,959 --> 00:58:40,041
Don't be so harsh, I didn't ruin your life.

858
00:58:40,042 --> 00:58:42,559
No?

859
00:58:42,584 --> 00:58:45,383
Do you know how much that money meant to me!

860
00:58:46,709 --> 00:58:48,734
Was it so bad?

861
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:51,134
What?

862
00:58:51,709 --> 00:58:55,998
I raised you on my own, without mom and dad.

863
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:59,659
Is it so bad that I spent that money to get married?

864
00:59:01,334 --> 00:59:02,984
There we go.

865
00:59:02,984 --> 00:59:05,899
The shameless Wang Joonhee as I remember.

866
00:59:05,899 --> 00:59:09,998
Let's call it even and never see each other again.

867
00:59:09,999 --> 00:59:14,367
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just said that because I got angry.

868
00:59:14,367 --> 00:59:18,708
Come on, let's just talk it out. We're family. He's your nephew.

869
00:59:18,709 --> 00:59:21,850
Hey, shut up and listen carefully.

870
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,298
Don't ever fucking call me again.

871
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:28,040
Family? What family?

872
00:59:28,083 --> 00:59:31,009
I don't have a nephew.

873
00:59:38,299 --> 00:59:39,124

874
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:43,558
If rumors get out that a pervert showed up in our area, it'll be terrible

875
00:59:43,558 --> 00:59:45,758
I told the Momvelies to watch their mouth.

876
00:59:45,758 --> 00:59:49,158
Good job. If someone posts something on SNS, our apartment prices will drop.

877
00:59:49,158 --> 00:59:51,998
What is the school saying? Who's the pervert?

878
00:59:51,999 --> 00:59:55,183
They won't tell us his identity. He must be a parent.

879
00:59:55,183 --> 00:59:58,798
He's a renter, right? His attire and his sad-looking car...

880
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:02,183
Let's get this under control. I don't want her to get involved.

881
01:00:02,183 --> 01:00:06,399
Yeah, we don't need to call her in for this little happening. Right?

882
01:00:06,399 --> 01:00:10,109
Who's that guy? Is he drunk?

883
01:00:10,109 --> 01:00:11,800
Excuse me.

884
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,009
Are you crazy! Don't talk to him. He's dangerous!

885
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:16,359
Excuse me.

886
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:20,734
Which apartment do you live in? I've never seen you before.

887
01:00:20,734 --> 01:00:23,708
Did you recently move into the renting apartment building?

888
01:00:23,709 --> 01:00:25,208
I was just about to leave.

889
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:27,483
No, I asked if you moved here.

890
01:00:27,483 --> 01:00:30,267
You should have received a notice from the management office...

891
01:00:30,267 --> 01:00:33,992
If you live in a rental apartment, you can't enter this playground...

892
01:00:33,992 --> 01:00:37,198
Why? It's not even blocked off.

893
01:00:37,198 --> 01:00:39,399
Rules. It's the rules.

894
01:00:39,399 --> 01:00:40,708
What rules?

895
01:00:40,709 --> 01:00:43,858
The maintenance fee for this playground is being paid by the residents here...

896
01:00:43,858 --> 01:00:48,608
Therefore, the use of this playground should only be for residents. Not renters.

897
01:00:48,608 --> 01:00:49,584
Right?

898
01:00:49,585 --> 01:00:52,259
It's just a bench.

899
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:56,399
Shouldn't anyone be able to just sit and take a moment on their own?

900
01:00:56,399 --> 01:00:59,249
Then why did you show up at our school?

901
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,583
Don't worry, I won't show up again.

902
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:04,999
Then promise that you'll never show yourself here.

903
01:01:04,999 --> 01:01:07,884
Sure, let's do that...

904
01:01:07,884 --> 01:01:09,959
Look at him go, so dirty.

905
01:01:09,959 --> 01:01:11,708
See, he's walking towards the rental apartment?

906
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,791
I think he lives there.

907
01:01:13,792 --> 01:01:19,434
I understand that you can mistake me for whatever you want to think,

908
01:01:19,434 --> 01:01:22,799
but constantly saying "rental" or "renters" is extremely strange.

909
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:25,934
You must be so proud of yourself, living in better apartments.

910
01:01:25,934 --> 01:01:31,100
But everyone lives and works hard, no matter where they live.

911
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,759
No one wants to cause inconveniences or harm to others on purpose.

912
01:01:33,759 --> 01:01:37,359
Living here as a renter is causing us harm.

913
01:01:41,709 --> 01:01:44,099
What a day...

914
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:48,309
Being called a pervert, kidnapper, crook, pathetic loser...

915
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:50,984
But what you just said pisses me off the most.

916
01:01:50,984 --> 01:01:54,833
Just living here is harmful? Do you actually hear yourself?

917
01:01:54,834 --> 01:01:56,998
Sir, it's none of your business. Can you just leave?

918
01:01:56,998 --> 01:01:58,583
Listen up!

919
01:01:58,584 --> 01:02:01,734
We never know what will happen in our lives.

920
01:02:01,734 --> 01:02:06,458
Maybe you could be a renter one day, and I live in those nice apartments.

921
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:09,333
Are you putting a curse on us or something?

922
01:02:09,334 --> 01:02:13,834
If you're done drunk talking, can you leave our property now?

923
01:02:16,534 --> 01:02:21,259
Why'd you choose such a pathetic neighborhood?

924
01:02:28,734 --> 01:02:32,708
Your daughter-in-law's phone is on. Let's begin by tracking her.

925
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:36,491
When I find her, should I bring her back?

926
01:02:36,491 --> 01:02:39,159
Just my grandson.

927
01:02:40,999 --> 01:02:43,599
Then, what do I do with the mother?

928
01:02:44,234 --> 01:02:49,425
She should pay for her reckless actions.

929
01:02:49,425 --> 01:02:54,359
Why else would I have come to you?

930
01:02:57,542 --> 01:03:00,734
Does she have any family members that'll cause problems?

931
01:03:00,734 --> 01:03:07,717
She doesn't have friends and hasn't spoken to her brother in years.

932
01:03:15,018 --> 01:03:20,217
Why didn't you tell uncle? You didn't do it.

933
01:03:21,709 --> 01:03:25,834
What's the point? I can't change what has happened.

934
01:03:25,834 --> 01:03:28,734
If he knew, he'd feel worse.

935
01:03:28,734 --> 01:03:31,884
It's better if he thinks it's my fault.

936
01:03:33,983 --> 01:03:37,984
Uncle... isn't coming back anymore?

937
01:03:40,459 --> 01:03:42,799
What do you think of your uncle?

938
01:03:46,134 --> 01:03:48,384
He's weird.

939
01:03:50,567 --> 01:03:53,942
He won't... ever come back, right?

940
01:04:19,334 --> 01:04:23,634
 Thank you for taking care of me today.

941
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:30,834
 I'm sorry for ruining your dreams.

942
01:04:34,209 --> 01:04:36,691
 We're family. He's your nephew.

943
01:04:36,691 --> 01:04:40,075
 Family? What family?

944
01:04:40,075 --> 01:04:42,584
 I don't have a nephew.

945
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:18,834
- Your back! 
 - Let me board first.

946
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,480
Come here.

947
01:05:23,684 --> 01:05:27,917
Well, while everyone is resting on this fine Saturday,

948
01:05:27,918 --> 01:05:31,024
we set sail yet again.

949
01:05:31,024 --> 01:05:32,759
Huh?

950
01:05:32,759 --> 01:05:35,099
What? Why?

951
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:39,159
- It's Saturday? 
 - Yeah. Why?

952
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:41,209
So annoying.

953
01:05:42,884 --> 01:05:44,709
What?

954
01:05:44,709 --> 01:05:47,484
So annoying!

955
01:05:47,484 --> 01:05:53,440
 Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

956
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,980
 Let's go! Let's go!

957
01:05:59,584 --> 01:06:02,333
She seriously just sent her kid?

958
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,258
It's the weekend. How busy can she be?

959
01:06:05,258 --> 01:06:06,525
I know, right?

960
01:06:06,525 --> 01:06:10,809
He just transferred here. Does she even care?

961
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:14,099
She must have her reasons. Let's take care of him.

962
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:17,108
I told his father about today. I guess he couldn't make it.

963
01:06:17,108 --> 01:06:20,459
You've already met Jihoo's father, Noeul's father?

964
01:06:20,459 --> 01:06:23,249
You're such a gentleman.

965
01:06:23,249 --> 01:06:28,560
 Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

966
01:06:56,299 --> 01:06:58,334
Who are you here for?

967
01:06:59,392 --> 01:07:04,083
That kid over there, Min Jihoo. I'm his family.

968
01:07:05,509 --> 01:07:07,999
Family who?

969
01:07:07,999 --> 01:07:10,416
We weren't told beforehand.

970
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:12,659
I'm his uncle.

971
01:07:16,734 --> 01:07:22,309
I'm that kid's uncle.

972
01:07:23,626 --> 01:07:25,534
"Uncle."

973
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:50,050

974
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:17,410

975
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:19,400
 You want to be a loser forever?

976
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,300
 If you moved and transferred to a new school, you should live a new life.

977
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,383
 You're Jihoo's father, right?

978
01:08:24,383 --> 01:08:26,225
 Do all of you need glasses?

979
01:08:26,225 --> 01:08:28,698
 You can't recognize me? Because of my clothes?

980
01:08:28,698 --> 01:08:29,799
 Right? The homeroom teacher?

981
01:08:29,799 --> 01:08:31,575
 I guess he's just like me.

982
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:35,425
 Especially his music talent.

983
01:08:35,425 --> 01:08:37,249
 I think someone mistook your shoes for theirs.

984
01:08:37,249 --> 01:08:41,541
 This isn't an accident. Someone intentionally took them or hid them.

985
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:43,024
 That's ours.

986
01:08:43,024 --> 01:08:46,466
 Apartment 804 has been empty. Did you just move in?

987
01:08:46,466 --> 01:08:49,208
 He lives in a rental and acts like he doesn't.

988
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:52,875
 Don't cross our area and walk around.

989
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:56,082
 Mom didn't do anything wrong. It's all because of me.

990
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:59,491
 You said it yourself. I stole your dreams!

991
01:08:59,491 --> 01:09:01,133
 Leave for good this time.

992
01:09:01,133 --> 01:09:04,660
 You said you wouldn't come. Then you came back.

993
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:12,870

994
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:17,740
