1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,570

2
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:12,401

3
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:16,709

4
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:22,100

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,667

6
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:33,584

7
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:37,940

8
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,290

9
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:50,950

10
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,067
- How do I look? 
 - Perfect!

11
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:58,699
My son is looking incredible!

12
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:01,442
Who's son are you?

13
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:03,042
Wait!

14
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:08,842
What?

15
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:10,199
Just wait.

16
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:14,542
Mom, this... feels weird.

17
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,667
Why? Does it hurt?

18
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:18,784
Have you been taking your pills?

19
00:01:18,784 --> 00:01:21,317
It doesn't hurt, it feels weird.

20
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:24,367
What! Explain it to me!

21
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:27,799
I never felt this before.

22
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:31,867
Could this be happiness?

23
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:33,618
You little...

24
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:35,718
Yes, this is happiness.

25
00:01:35,718 --> 00:01:36,899
You look really cool.

26
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:38,292
Hey!

27
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:40,399
This feels weird.

28
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:41,918
You can't wear that.

29
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:43,718
- You haven't changed? 
 - This is it.

30
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:45,442
What about your hair?

31
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:48,199
This took me an hour. His hair is bad.

32
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,367
Don't touch my hair!

33
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:51,375
Hey! This took me an hour.

34
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,850
Seriously don't!

35
00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:00,010

36
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:04,540
 It was a perfect day.

37
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:09,260

38
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,350

39
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,192
Congressman.

40
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:20,217
The Diamond isn't what it used to be.

41
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:24,217
Congressman ignores you, Momvelies are losing members.

42
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:25,692
Just get out of...

43
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:26,667
Hey!

44
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:32,620
- I was talking... 
 - I'm worried about our Momvely.

45
00:02:43,192 --> 00:02:47,800
- That's it? 
 - I couldn't recognize you. You look so pretty.

46
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,692
- Why? 
 - Nothing.

47
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:02,117
I thought I saw something.

48
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:07,359
Everyone's here, the parking lot was full.

49
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:08,434
A lot of people came.

50
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:13,792
♪ Relax and take a breath ♪

51
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,542
♪ You can cry if you want ♪

52
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:24,017
♪ You're perfect to me ♪

53
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:31,617
♪ Although we are small and weak ♪

54
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:37,599
♪ We can accomplish anything ♪

55
00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:45,590
♪ We can fly like butterflies ♪

56
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:04,242
- You look great. 
  - Greetings, I'm the principal.

57
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:07,417
 What an amazing opening from our choir.

58
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,399
 Absolutely amazing.

59
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:11,300
Great job!

60
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,809
Noeul's magic show is up soon.

61
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:18,201
Really? I should go and cheer for her, I'll be right back.

62
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:22,767
It's like you were born for the stage!

63
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:24,751
It was better than the rehearsals.

64
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:28,999
 One of our school's biggest, newest supporters...

65
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:33,670
 I present to you, the president of Gangto Money.

66
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,742
- What? 
 - Wow! Great!

67
00:04:48,742 --> 00:04:52,350
- Honey, did you know? 
 - No.

68
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:59,401
I wanted to remain as an anonymous supporter. But the principal...

69
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:00,659
Oh my...

70
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:04,267
What do we do?

71
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:08,400
I am the president of Gangto, Shin Hwaja.

72
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:16,167
Watching all the children perform so well

73
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:19,099
reminds me of my grandson. I feel warm inside.

74
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:21,992
Oh my god! Let's get out Jihoo!

75
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:27,292
I will help children grow their dreams.

76
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:29,518
To become...

77
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:31,399
Hurry! Hurry!

78
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:34,267
Jihoo, are you okay? Come to your senses!

79
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,999
Are you okay? Did she know we were here?

80
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:38,918
Where's the car? Hurry and get the car!

81
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:40,942
- Wait! 
 - Oh my!

82
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:44,499
What? Move aside.

83
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:45,899
This is a school.

84
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:48,967
Wang Joonhee? The president wants to see you.

85
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:50,317
Mom, no!

86
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,142
Security! Security! Here, help, here!

87
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:55,317
How dare you hit a child!

88
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:57,442
- Are you crazy? 
 - Is there a problem?

89
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:00,942
This stranger suddenly hit our child! Take them away!

90
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:03,292
- How dare you! 
 - You animals...

91
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:04,918
You should know better!

92
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:08,099
How could you hit him?

93
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:09,999
Don't move!

94
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,867
- Oh! 
 - What do we have here?

95
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,417
Get out! Hey! hey!

96
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,492
Chase them!

97
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:15,292
What do we do? Where are we going?

98
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:18,499
How did they figure out where you were?

99
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:23,599
- Listen to me carefully. 
 - You have a plan?

100
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,726

101
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:30,370

102
00:07:38,342 --> 00:07:42,960
 The number you have reached is unavailable...

103
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:50,992
Step on it!

104
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:55,417
Faster!

105
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:13,342
What the hell!

106
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:22,267
For Christ sake!

107
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:24,710
Cut through them!

108
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:48,334
If you have eyes, drive better!

109
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:52,017
Where'd they go?

110
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:55,742
Cut through them!

111
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:57,399
Damn it!

112
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:14,767
Hey! I warned you to stay away from them.

113
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,842
I've got back up.

114
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,242
How'd you find us? How'd you know where we lived?

115
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:25,392
- You aren't in the position to ask. 
 - Well, I am!

116
00:09:25,392 --> 00:09:31,842
You loser, I saw Jihoo playing the piano on YouTube!

117
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:35,342
If you wanted to hide, you should've stayed hidden.

118
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:40,417
I'm not letting you take either of them.

119
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,392
I don't know where they are.

120
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:45,492
Kidnap me, kill me, do whatever you please.

121
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:50,217
- I'm not telling you anything. 
 - So dramatic, I just want to chat with you.

122
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:52,667
I don't believe you, I know what you people are.

123
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,317
Just stop running away!

124
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:58,017
You ran away like a scared dog.

125
00:09:58,017 --> 00:10:01,167
It was fun. Thrilling.

126
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,392
Are you actually crazy?

127
00:10:04,392 --> 00:10:06,792
I seriously just want to talk.

128
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:10,799
My mom has something to say.

129
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:15,192
Huh?

130
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:19,142
You're just leaving? Don't bother running.

131
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:22,218
I know all of Joonhee's plans.

132
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:24,442
Mrs. Jang snitched.

133
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:40,599
Oh hey. Well, I'm at the...

134
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,999
Yeah...

135
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,767
I don't know...

136
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:46,699
Oh wait, there!

137
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:02,342
Joonhee! Why'd you turn your phone off!

138
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:07,867
They knew my number. They might track me.

139
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:12,099
Sodam's mother, please take care of Noeul today.

140
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:16,167
Something urgent came up, sorry.

141
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,117
Thank you.

142
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:24,367
What was that about? I was right next to you!

143
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:27,267
You were just planning to just disappear?

144
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:30,567
I was going to contact you after relocating.

145
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:32,892
Do you know how worried I was?

146
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,599
I'm sorry.

147
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:38,642
They're from Gangto Money?

148
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:40,818
If they keep chasing you,

149
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:45,918
we can threaten to publicize their domestic violence.

150
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:47,899
There's no point.

151
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:52,667
They're powerful enough to bury the evidence.

152
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:56,792
Do you not trust me? I'll do it, I'll protect you.

153
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:59,967
Sorry to interrupt but...

154
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:02,499
Who's Mrs. Jang?

155
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:05,618
He said she snitched all of your plans.

156
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:09,117
- There's no way... 
 - What are they planning?

157
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:11,792
I thought they would kill me, but they just left.

158
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:14,099
He said he just wanted to talk.

159
00:12:15,717 --> 00:12:18,599
I don't understand anything!

160
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:23,900
 Incheon port?

161
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:27,542
Why?

162
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:31,367
 I'll be there, let's talk.

163
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,717
Don't worry.

164
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:50,817
You look good.

165
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:53,142
You've got a man.

166
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:55,917
What did you do to Mrs. Jang?

167
00:12:56,918 --> 00:12:59,117
What could I do?

168
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:05,099
You still trust her.

169
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:07,099
Foolish...

170
00:13:07,099 --> 00:13:10,667
Money rules over any secret.

171
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:16,167
I'm not going to take Jihoo away.

172
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:20,418
Stop running, continue with your life.

173
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:25,692
We've been watching you for quite some time.

174
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:30,042
Even if we took him back, he'd run straight back to you.

175
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:37,699
I'll wait until he grows up. He'll come to me.

176
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:40,999
When he's older, he'll know what he walked away from.

177
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:43,667
He'll regret leaving us.

178
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,867
Do you expect me to believe you?

179
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:52,217
I'm running for Seongjak congress.

180
00:13:52,217 --> 00:13:54,999
I don't play games, I just win.

181
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:58,842
My district is controlled by 4 congressmen.

182
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:04,526
But here it's different. Also, my grandson resides here.

183
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:11,067
So watch your mouth.

184
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:17,142
Don't tell anyone about your past, or I'll come after you.

185
00:14:17,142 --> 00:14:19,018
Understand?

186
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:35,442
I've asked around, she's telling the truth.

187
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:39,342
She'll publicly announce it tomorrow morning.

188
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:44,342
She's going into politics, she can't do terrible things now.

189
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:49,442
She was just afraid that her past would interfere.

190
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:52,667
Sorry, for scaring you.

191
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,942
Yeah.

192
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:58,799
Get some rest.

193
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:08,399

194
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:15,999
 The number you dialed is not available. Please check again and call back later.

195
00:15:22,492 --> 00:15:26,767
 Joonhee, how are you? How about Jihoo?

196
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:29,999
 Never mind, don't answer anything.

197
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:33,799
 Don't contact me. Stay hidden, okay?

198
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:20,467
 The principal didn't know she was Jihoo's grandmother.

199
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:23,367
 They'll be speaking about it tomorrow.

200
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:26,317
Thank you for looking into it.

201
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:30,742
I understand. I'll be extra, extra careful!

202
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:34,617
But don't scare the child, don't let him notice.

203
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:37,099
Just like that one movie...

204
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:40,317
Locked, okay.

205
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:46,599
Oh my g—!

206
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,799
You slept here?

207
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,499
Hey!

208
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:56,299
You've never served in the military.

209
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:59,292
Soldiers are trained to withstand sleep.

210
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:02,167
Don't be scared. Going to the toilet?

211
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,092
- Yeah... 
 - That way.

212
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:06,567
Take a right, it's the first, no second door.

213
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,517
It's too early for this!

214
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:10,567
Sechan wake up, time for school.

215
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:12,999
Gangto's president, what?

216
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:18,267
Running for congress? That's crazy! Oh my goodness!

217
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,999
Hwang must be pissed! He thought it was over.

218
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,442
Now he has an incredibly powerful opponent!

219
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:27,517
I don't care, I don't think he'll side with us anymore.

220
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:31,692
Why don't we link up with Gangto's president?

221
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:35,317
I am so smart.

222
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,767
Put it around your neck.

223
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:43,492
Blow it when in danger.

224
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:50,399
It's in the news. She's really doing it.

225
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:54,818
President Shin Hwaja, known for philanthropy...

226
00:17:54,818 --> 00:17:58,942
Decides to dedicate her life to the people and society.

227
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:01,317
What a load of crap.

228
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:04,192
Scary old hag.

229
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,900
Just eat.

230
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:09,167
Hey, wait!

231
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:12,942
It might be poisoned.

232
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:15,099
- I cooked the rice. 
 - What about the ingredients?

233
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:16,999
They've watched us for months.

234
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:19,642
They could've snuck in and poisoned everything.

235
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:23,617
Don't eat anything strangers offer you.

236
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:26,117
I'll eat it first, just to be safe.

237
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:28,099
What if it's poisoned, Uncle!

238
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:30,392
It's too late now.

239
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:33,999
Still alive?

240
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:37,092
No poison. Jihoo, eat.

241
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:45,099
- Going to work? 
 - Of course.

242
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:48,392
Mom, stay. Just stay at home, please?

243
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:52,534
It's okay, we have the CCTV and all our neighbors.

244
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:55,992
You stay home, just in case.

245
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:57,892
Why're you going so early?

246
00:18:57,892 --> 00:18:59,999
I have to meet the principal.

247
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:02,342
Hey, take this!

248
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,967
- She never listens. 
 - Phew!

249
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:20,192
Chungshin Security. A requested personal protection.

250
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:27,392
Who...

251
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:38,399
 I was worried. Get to work safely.

252
00:19:42,818 --> 00:19:44,567
I'm sorry.

253
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:49,767
It was an anonymous donation, introduced by Congressman Hwang.

254
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:52,317
I didn't know she was Jihoo's grandmother.

255
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:56,717
Jihoo went through a secret transfer, I would've told you.

256
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:59,199
My sincerest apologies.

257
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:11,542
Why are you speaking with the principal?

258
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,642
Oh, Jihoo's mother?

259
00:20:13,642 --> 00:20:17,267
Send me beansprouts, anchovies, and spicy soup.

260
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:21,992
Oh, I want some warm and fresh egg rolls.

261
00:20:21,992 --> 00:20:26,292
- Excuse me? 
 - Is your pride hurt? Then forget it.

262
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:30,342
An employee is right here, why would I bother calling?

263
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:33,099
I was just trying to help with sales.

264
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:36,767
Is that offensive?

265
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:44,818
How many portions of each?

266
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:48,142
- 1 that feels like 2, got it? 
 - Got it?

267
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,892
She's polite but rude, it's strange.

268
00:20:54,892 --> 00:20:57,742
How dare she, I'm the Diamond.

269
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,992
So principal, what I'm trying to say is...

270
00:21:02,992 --> 00:21:06,042
Just connect me to Gangto's president.

271
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:09,142
Momvelies are always looking for the school's best interest.

272
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:13,392
Weren't you ecstatic when Gangto donated?

273
00:21:13,392 --> 00:21:16,199
We want to approach Gangto and show appreciation.

274
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:19,692
For the school, our district, and our children.

275
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:22,242
Then speak with Jihoo's mother.

276
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:24,099
What?

277
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,799
Why her?

278
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:33,767
She's Gangto's daughter-in-law?

279
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:35,142
Oh my goodness!

280
00:21:35,142 --> 00:21:39,542
Jihoo is the grandson? He's a billionaire?

281
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:42,692
That family was probably laughing at us this whole time.

282
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:46,517
So what! They're divorced and living as renters.

283
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:49,367
Why'd you have to be rude and order from her!

284
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:51,610
You ordered too!

285
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,542
Yes, Congressman Hwang.

286
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:02,417
 You heard Shin Hwaja is running for congress?

287
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:03,999
Yes.

288
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:07,218
 Then why didn't you contact me!

289
00:22:07,218 --> 00:22:10,542
I just heard it now.

290
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,542
 Come to my office for a meeting now!

291
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:15,190
Yes, Congressman, but...

292
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:19,792
We're on his side, I guess...

293
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:24,167
Go meet him. We need to grab onto someone.

294
00:22:26,142 --> 00:22:28,418
Guys! Jihoo!

295
00:22:28,418 --> 00:22:29,718
 - Jihoo? 
 - Jihoo?

296
00:22:29,718 --> 00:22:31,992
 Hello.

297
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:34,767
Where are you? Why is it all red?

298
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:38,700
I'll tell you later, bye!

299
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:49,442
You can find hidden cameras with that?

300
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:54,899
That's what they say... Look for a light...

301
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:58,090
- Here! 
 - It's me!

302
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,840
Okay.

303
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,740
I'm sorry.

304
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,699
- I'm sorry. 
 - It must hurt.

305
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,292
Thank you. You're excused.

306
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:26,342
Thank you.

307
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,692
I spoke with security.

308
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:33,692
They're watching out for strangers and unknown vehicles.

309
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:36,899
We've broadcasted warnings and put up signs.

310
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:39,299
You said it'd be fine.

311
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:42,618
I said I'd make it fine.

312
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:45,899
- You look tired. 
 - Huh?

313
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:48,917
I was busy figuring things out...

314
00:23:51,317 --> 00:23:54,267
I couldn't sleep either.

315
00:23:55,067 --> 00:24:00,242
You ran away in my dreams, I was chasing you down.

316
00:24:00,242 --> 00:24:04,810
I'm sorry. I won't do that again.

317
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:13,899
Then live with me.

318
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:15,499
What?

319
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:23,600
I wanted to give you an extravagant proposal but... I'm sorry for saying this.

320
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:28,942
What are you saying?

321
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:35,842
1 year into our marriage, I can be Jihoo's legal father.

322
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:40,570
I want to protect you both.

323
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,892
You don't have to answer right now.

324
00:24:46,892 --> 00:24:50,717
Just think about it!

325
00:24:52,918 --> 00:24:54,542
All right.

326
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:04,899
Don't close your eyes! Don't close them.

327
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:07,317
Keep them open. 1, 2...

328
00:25:07,317 --> 00:25:09,999
1, 2, 3, 4... As fast as possible.

329
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,934
1, 2, 3, 4...

330
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:13,542
It's a scare tactic. It's all about looking fierce.

331
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:16,217
If you're in a sticky situation...

332
00:25:16,217 --> 00:25:19,892
You can defeat 3 to 4 adults with this technique.

333
00:25:19,892 --> 00:25:21,442
- Aren't you scared? 
 - Never.

334
00:25:21,442 --> 00:25:24,142
If I have these, nothing in the world can scare me.

335
00:25:24,142 --> 00:25:25,842
Huh?

336
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:31,999
- Mom, you okay? 
 - Yes.

337
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:34,542
What're you doing?

338
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:37,218
Self-defense training.

339
00:25:39,442 --> 00:25:42,292
Go change into sweats.

340
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,299
I'm okay.

341
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:45,492
Now!

342
00:25:45,492 --> 00:25:48,792
I'll teach you something else!

343
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:52,042
Focus!

344
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:56,242
Eyes closed... Close you eyes.

345
00:25:57,317 --> 00:26:00,199
Just in case of danger...

346
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:06,392
In order to defeat your fears, you must train!

347
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:12,342
I will teach you the technique of forgetting traumas!

348
00:26:12,342 --> 00:26:13,992
First...

349
00:26:13,992 --> 00:26:20,392
Before we begin, give your gratitude to Song Hwaeum by clapping three times.

350
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:25,109
First: hug technique.

351
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:28,442
If I begin to feel fear inside

352
00:26:28,442 --> 00:26:32,417
about someone from my past attacking me,

353
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:36,099
open your arms and hug yourself.

354
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:39,092
Then pat yourself like this...

355
00:26:39,092 --> 00:26:40,667
It's okay...

356
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:42,392
Try it. It's okay...

357
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,417
- It's okay. 
 - Once more.

358
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:47,010
It's okay. Everything will be fine.

359
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,792
- It's okay. Everything will be fine. 
 - It's okay. Everything will be fine.

360
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:54,518
This technique works incredibly well.

361
00:26:54,518 --> 00:26:56,899
This'll help for the rest of your life.

362
00:26:56,899 --> 00:26:59,167
Especially you!

363
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:03,742
If you want to be a musician, you must prepare with this.

364
00:27:03,742 --> 00:27:07,317
Even when you approach the public with open arms,

365
00:27:07,317 --> 00:27:11,492
not everyone will show you the same affection.

366
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:14,642
I was attacked from all directions.

367
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:18,167
He's got a weird face, his voice sucks...

368
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:21,499
All of these hurtful lies.

369
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:25,099
If I let all that negativity get to me,

370
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:26,717
it's only my loss.

371
00:27:26,717 --> 00:27:30,899
I must learn to love myself, and to protect myself.

372
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,518
My mentality is the most important!

373
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:39,299
Open arms, hug yourself... I'm okay...

374
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:42,999
It's okay. Everything will be fine.

375
00:27:43,892 --> 00:27:47,099
Second: Sealing technique.

376
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:53,317
Negative memories, emotions, things you want to forget...

377
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:56,292
Write them all down.

378
00:27:57,067 --> 00:27:59,999
You can draw them, too.

379
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,918
Good, good, good.

380
00:28:17,918 --> 00:28:20,210
Now...

381
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:30,918
We've just sealed all that negativity in here.

382
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:33,142
It can never come back out.

383
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:36,480
It's practically gone, okay?

384
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,180
What are you doing?

385
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:51,092
Mom, I think I can go to school.

386
00:28:51,092 --> 00:28:55,025
Yeah, you can't hide forever, right?

387
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:59,792
Wait, Jihoo.

388
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:06,992
- What do you think of him? 
 - What do you mean?

389
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:11,199
He wants to protect us.

390
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:13,667
He already is.

391
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:17,990
He wants to become your father.

392
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,999
Is that possible?

393
00:29:25,892 --> 00:29:27,542
Is that okay?

394
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:31,767
I like that! No... I love it!

395
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:35,099
I love it! I love it!

396
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:36,267
What!

397
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:38,017
Uncle!

398
00:29:40,142 --> 00:29:42,492
- Why? 
 - Don't!

399
00:29:51,517 --> 00:29:53,617
- What're you doing? 
 - I'm a bodyguard.

400
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:54,742
Can't you tell?

401
00:29:54,742 --> 00:30:00,367
A bodyguard must wear an all-black suit.

402
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:04,342
Wait!

403
00:30:04,342 --> 00:30:06,042
Wait, wait, wait!

404
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:09,342
Something could be inside!

405
00:30:09,342 --> 00:30:12,099
A poisoned needle with a deadly infection on it!

406
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:15,142
How can I overcome my fears, if you scare me like this?

407
00:30:15,142 --> 00:30:19,299
I'm not trying to scare you, just want you to be careful.

408
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:20,942
Haven't you heard?

409
00:30:20,942 --> 00:30:25,760
You must lose a cow before building a fence.

410
00:30:32,142 --> 00:30:34,918
You stand out too much.

411
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:36,999
No, no.

412
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:39,125
Wait! Which apartment? Which room?

413
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,999
- What? 
 - Apartment and room number?

414
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:45,442
- You've got 5 seconds, 5, 4, 3... 
 - Apt. 3512 Room 403.

415
00:30:45,442 --> 00:30:48,318
You must be new.

416
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:52,792
We're just role playing.

417
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:55,059
It's a school project...

418
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:57,417
Jihoo, let's go.

419
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:02,899
Use each of these cards, one time each.

420
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:05,517
Out of the four possible digits,

421
00:31:05,517 --> 00:31:11,542
find the largest number rounded to 6,000 and

422
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:15,342
also the smallest number.

423
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:20,167
We've studied and practiced rounding up,

424
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:22,759
I will give you 10 minutes.

425
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:24,459
Solve it by yourself.

426
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:27,167
After 10 minutes, we can solve it together.

427
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:29,330
 Yes!

428
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:39,167
He's so annoying.

429
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:43,350
- Uncle, wait there. 
 - Okay, okay.

430
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,892
What's your uncle doing?

431
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:53,342
This is a toilet.

432
00:31:53,342 --> 00:31:55,117
Sorry.

433
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:19,292
Jihoo.

434
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:24,792
I heard you were the grandson of Gangto Money.

435
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:27,567
I'm just me.

436
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:33,617
How'd the trauma lessons go? Did they help?

437
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:36,867
I'm doing everything you taught me, but I'm not sure.

438
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:39,167
I hope it works.

439
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:43,267
He almost faints when seeing any grandmother.

440
00:32:48,492 --> 00:32:52,242
I understand that you can leave such a rich family.

441
00:32:52,242 --> 00:32:56,417
But the least they can do is give you a store or a lot of money.

442
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,918
You live as a renter, working for someone...

443
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:02,167
I seriously can't understand your logic.

444
00:33:04,517 --> 00:33:06,199
Tell me.

445
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:08,042
Did something happen?

446
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:10,367
It's obvious.

447
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:15,099
You took Jihoo, so they must've done something terrible.

448
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:18,999
I can't speak of it, we can get hurt.

449
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:22,499
What? Something really happened?

450
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:30,099
Okay well... We aren't that close, I guess...

451
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:34,292
But I don't have friends anymore, you can tell me if you want.

452
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:36,199
I'm sorry.

453
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:39,892
The Gold Momvelies are frantic.

454
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:43,899
I regret leaving for the first time, I want to see them panic.

455
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,999
What's wrong with them?

456
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:50,367
After Mingi's mother left, their reputation hit the floor.

457
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:54,642
Even Congressman Hwang tried looking for other mom cafes.

458
00:33:54,642 --> 00:33:59,417
Sechan's mother is probably trying so hard to

459
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,367
suck up to Gangto's president.

460
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:04,767
She must be shocked, hearing you're the daughter-in-law.

461
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:08,899
Why are mom cafes obsessed with politics?

462
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:13,918
Moms only care about education and apartment prices.

463
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,717
The more members you have, the more power and influence.

464
00:34:17,717 --> 00:34:23,367
Congress and mom cafes work together to win-win.

465
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:27,492
It creates selfish people like Mingi's mom.

466
00:34:27,492 --> 00:34:29,730
It's our reality.

467
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:35,792
Congressman Hwang is moving to another mom cafe?

468
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:38,099
He said he will if we don't get our members back.

469
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:39,542
So annoying!

470
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:41,918
Why is everyone leaving us?

471
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,292
We don't offer any benefits or developments.

472
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:49,892
Would Gangto's president want us?

473
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:53,517
After everything we did to Jihoo's mother?

474
00:34:53,517 --> 00:34:56,317
We voted for the worst Diamond...

475
00:34:56,317 --> 00:34:58,167
Hey, seriously!

476
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:01,442
Is the Royal Momvely Diamond here?

477
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:03,042
Yes.

478
00:35:24,242 --> 00:35:28,918
As you know, this is my first time running.

479
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,692
I'm independent, but I need help.

480
00:35:31,692 --> 00:35:37,292
I know you've sided with Congressman Hwang, but

481
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:43,092
how would you like to partner up with me?

482
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:50,292
I can provide generous sponsorships and support.

483
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:53,792
Ms. President I have a question...

484
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:56,042
Honey, what are you doing?

485
00:35:56,042 --> 00:36:00,899
I'm just curious why Jihoo's mother divorced...

486
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:04,142
Our members will be curious, too.

487
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:08,099
For us to protect you, we'd need to know why...

488
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:15,142
It's all my fault.

489
00:36:15,142 --> 00:36:17,899
Jihoo is our only successor.

490
00:36:17,899 --> 00:36:21,799
I was very strict with successor training.

491
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:26,167
But as you all know, Jihoo is only interested in music.

492
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:28,317
He rebelled.

493
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:32,820
In a moment of anger...

494
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,667
I hit him.

495
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:42,417
It angered my son and daughter-in-law.

496
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:45,399
We argued about the schooling system.

497
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:49,467
Things just got worse and worse.

498
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:52,899
We split as a family.

499
00:36:52,899 --> 00:36:57,818
It happens to everyone, while raising a child.

500
00:36:57,818 --> 00:37:01,417
Child violence is not okay...

501
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:05,217
I am a human that made a mistake.

502
00:37:05,217 --> 00:37:08,167
I hope you can understand.

503
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:11,292
Older generations can do that.

504
00:37:11,292 --> 00:37:13,567
I regret and repent my actions.

505
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:16,467
You're very down to earth, Mrs. President.

506
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,317
Absolutely.

507
00:37:18,317 --> 00:37:24,467
I hope I get a chance to mend my relationship with Jihoo.

508
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:27,818
And also his mother.

509
00:37:27,818 --> 00:37:32,199
Yes, you should. It'll help with your polls and votes.

510
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,850
Well then...

511
00:37:34,692 --> 00:37:37,042
I trust that you'll help me.

512
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:40,099
Don't worry, Mrs. President.

513
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:42,199
Jihoo's mother is my best friend.

514
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:45,167
Jihoo and my son Sechan, are best friends too.

515
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:49,792
I'd like to invite everyone to my house.

516
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:53,692
Oh, Mrs. President! We'd be honored!

517
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:04,292
Don't be nervous, we knew this was coming.

518
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:08,392
Sealing technique activate!

519
00:38:08,392 --> 00:38:11,192
You buried your fears in the dirt.

520
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:13,467
Take a breath.

521
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:18,499
If it didn't work, use the hugging technique...

522
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:23,267
It's okay...

523
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,918
Right, it's okay.

524
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:26,918
It's okay, it's okay.

525
00:38:26,918 --> 00:38:31,517
Look at her. She's just a small old lady.

526
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,999
She's not scary.

527
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:35,492
She's not scary. She's not scary.

528
00:38:35,492 --> 00:38:38,267
You'll be bigger than her soon.

529
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:39,867
Let's go.

530
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:46,450
Jihoo, say hi to your grandmother!

531
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:50,142
Excuse me? Stay out of it, okay?

532
00:38:50,142 --> 00:38:53,217
- Jihoo's uncle... 
 - Jihoo.

533
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:02,767
I'm sorry.

534
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:07,667
It breaks my heart, thinking about the past.

535
00:39:08,492 --> 00:39:12,817
It's all my fault. Will you forgive me?

536
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:16,942
I can't right now.

537
00:39:17,692 --> 00:39:19,792
Please leave this neighborhood.

538
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:22,792
Don't hurt my mother ever again.

539
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:25,625
Then, I'll forgive you.

540
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:32,042
You've become strong, my little Jihoo.

541
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:36,592
If you need anything, just call me.

542
00:39:36,592 --> 00:39:39,042
I don't need anything.

543
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:40,892
All I need...

544
00:39:44,492 --> 00:39:46,399
I already have.

545
00:39:59,142 --> 00:40:01,542
Great job! Great job!

546
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:02,918
Jihoo.

547
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:06,792
That was amazing.

548
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:15,792
 Since then, my grandmother never came near our home.

549
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:21,317
 And not too long after, something surprising happened.

550
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:30,118
After discovering your music online,

551
00:40:30,118 --> 00:40:32,199
I couldn't believe my eyes or ears!

552
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:37,467
How is it that after all this time, your voice didn't age?

553
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:40,667
I used to be a huge fan.

554
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:42,718
- Really? 
 - Really?

555
00:40:42,718 --> 00:40:45,867
Right! After military service, I struggled to figure out life.

556
00:40:45,867 --> 00:40:48,292
That's when I heard "Your Dream."

557
00:40:48,292 --> 00:40:49,999
Oh my! That's my favorite song.

558
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:54,542
♪ When you feel all alone ♪

559
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:58,199
♪ You can take my hand ♪

560
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:02,999
♪ I'll be by your side ♪

561
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:06,542
Wow, you've got an amazing manager.

562
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:11,492
- I was a huge fan too. 
 - There isn't a hidden camera, right?

563
00:41:11,492 --> 00:41:14,018
- Where's the hidden camera? 
 - No, no way.

564
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:16,918
- Here's the contract, please have a look. 
 - Thank you.

565
00:41:16,918 --> 00:41:19,942
- One for you. 
 - Thank you.

566
00:41:20,742 --> 00:41:24,999
If we sign it, Uncle will release an album again?

567
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:26,199
Of course!

568
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:29,467
Our company focuses on finding new talent, but

569
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:33,918
we also find artists who couldn't reach their potential.

570
00:41:33,918 --> 00:41:38,492
To be honest, our CEO doesn't know J. King.

571
00:41:38,492 --> 00:41:41,018
But I strongly recommended you.

572
00:41:41,018 --> 00:41:43,567
Your music sense and creativity.

573
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,767
I believe you can be one of our main artists.

574
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:48,480
Thank you.

575
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:52,618
Uncle! There's a signing bonus!

576
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:54,717
I'm sorry.

577
00:41:54,717 --> 00:41:57,417
He's my nephew, I've been taking care of him.

578
00:41:57,417 --> 00:42:00,242
We're stuck together 24 hours a day. Is that okay?

579
00:42:00,242 --> 00:42:02,242
Sure, why not?

580
00:42:02,242 --> 00:42:04,499
How much is 50 million won?

581
00:42:06,918 --> 00:42:11,359
How can you not count? It's 5 million, right?

582
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:16,067
It is 50 million.

583
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:22,417
Really?

584
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,742

585
00:42:35,742 --> 00:42:38,167
Now, now, now. A future celebrity is buying

586
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:40,767
It's the highest grade beef!

587
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,567
Noeul, why aren't you eating?

588
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:45,342
You have to be careful people who buy you beef.

589
00:42:45,342 --> 00:42:48,299
The cut line for pure gifting is pork.

590
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:52,617
That's not true, if the person buying is family.

591
00:42:52,617 --> 00:42:54,667
Don't go back on your word.

592
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:58,617
Noeul! Just say thank you, and enjoy the food.

593
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,918
- Jihoo too. 
 - It's so good.

594
00:43:00,918 --> 00:43:04,199
Congratulations. I'm happy for you. Can I have your autograph?

595
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:07,899
I'll be too busy in the future, I'll give you one after we eat.

596
00:43:07,899 --> 00:43:10,717
Can we really use this money?

597
00:43:10,717 --> 00:43:13,542
Did you read through the contract?

598
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:15,918
I did it for him. There's no problem.

599
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:20,167
Only you don't believe in me. I deserve that amount.

600
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:23,392
You've been scammed and tricked many times.

601
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,018
I just have to be careful of you.

602
00:43:26,018 --> 00:43:27,492
What does that mean?

603
00:43:27,492 --> 00:43:29,242
It's nothing.

604
00:43:29,242 --> 00:43:32,217
She stole 100 million won from me.

605
00:43:32,217 --> 00:43:34,192
- Hyeok? 
 - 100 million.

606
00:43:34,192 --> 00:43:37,042
Just eat, enjoy the beef.

607
00:43:37,042 --> 00:43:40,242
- We don't have to share that. 
 - Okay, fine.

608
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,918
Be careful of your wallet.

609
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:45,167
Uncle, Mom didn't do that.

610
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:46,492
Son, just eat.

611
00:43:46,492 --> 00:43:51,009
If it wasn't her, then who did it?

612
00:43:52,918 --> 00:43:55,667
Whomever it was, it's been 10 years. ight?

613
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:59,317
Hey, I'm petty, extremely petty. I'm Petty King, so what?

614
00:43:59,317 --> 00:44:01,899
Hey, just quit it!

615
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:03,792
She's angry. You saw that?

616
00:44:03,792 --> 00:44:05,292
She got mad at me.

617
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:06,999
Big Brother! This is her true face!

618
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:10,999
How nice. An argument to complete the day.

619
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:13,167
When family gathers, there's always a fight.

620
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:17,167
Exactly! We're arguing because we're family!

621
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:21,642
Oh, Joonhee. When will you give me an answer?

622
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:26,999
Don't bring it up now.

623
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:32,142
Jihoo and I already said yes.

624
00:44:32,142 --> 00:44:34,417
Your the only one left.

625
00:44:35,999 --> 00:44:40,367
What? What about me? What's going on?

626
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:44,842
Really?

627
00:44:45,718 --> 00:44:47,417
I like the idea.

628
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:49,292
Yay! Yay!

629
00:44:49,292 --> 00:44:53,818
What is it? Big Brother, what is it?

630
00:44:53,818 --> 00:44:58,942
We've decided to live together, like a real family.

631
00:45:00,918 --> 00:45:03,818
I see...

632
00:45:03,818 --> 00:45:05,799
Why don't I know about this?

633
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:08,299
How come no one told me?

634
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:11,999
- Just be quiet, let it go. 
 - Why didn't...

635
00:45:11,999 --> 00:45:15,167
Joonhyeok, you'll be a famous musician now.

636
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:16,918
I'll protect Joonhee and Jihoo.

637
00:45:16,918 --> 00:45:20,567
Don't worry about them and focus on your music.

638
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:22,592
This is great timing.

639
00:45:22,592 --> 00:45:25,918
The record label wanted to provide me with housing.

640
00:45:25,918 --> 00:45:28,999
That's so cool! Let's be friends.

641
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:32,742
We are friends. We're more than friends, we're family.

642
00:45:32,742 --> 00:45:36,299
Since we're family, call me "uncle."

643
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:39,818
Sure, you even bought dinner.

644
00:45:39,818 --> 00:45:42,167
Uncle!

645
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:45,499
Shall we cheers as a family?

646
00:45:45,499 --> 00:45:47,892
Sure!

647
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:50,999
Cheers! Cheers!

648
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:53,967
- Jihoo is that soju? 
 - No!

649
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:00,699
Look where you're going!

650
00:46:16,918 --> 00:46:18,792
Aren't you spending too much?

651
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:20,999
When can I ever spend like this?

652
00:46:20,999 --> 00:46:22,292
It's my class.

653
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:25,467
Can I see that one? The one on top.

654
00:46:27,542 --> 00:46:31,892
It's your birth ring. I've always wanted to get you one.

655
00:46:36,792 --> 00:46:40,792
- You've bought me plenty. 
 - Try it on, it's my heart.

656
00:46:40,792 --> 00:46:42,592
All of this is thanks to you.

657
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:44,042
You told me to record.

658
00:46:44,042 --> 00:46:45,667
You posted it online.

659
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:47,167
You sent my music to labels.

660
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:49,999
Come to think of it, it's all your doing.

661
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:53,267
I'm just thankful to you, so just accept it.

662
00:46:57,918 --> 00:47:01,417
- I look like a gangster. 
 - You look tough.

663
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:03,342
That's what it is!

664
00:47:03,342 --> 00:47:07,292
Gold is timeless.

665
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:10,667
Gold prices will never drop. They'll only rise.

666
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:12,667
Don't ever sell it.

667
00:47:12,667 --> 00:47:15,592
And never forget this.

668
00:47:15,592 --> 00:47:19,800
This ring will help you in tough times.

669
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:23,092
We'll take it.

670
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:26,218
Thank you.

671
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,618
Uncle, thank you.

672
00:47:29,618 --> 00:47:31,167
Yeah!

673
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:32,367
Boom!

674
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:34,942
Bam, bam!

675
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:40,642
What's that?

676
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:44,342
- For me? 
 - Nice!

677
00:47:44,342 --> 00:47:46,918
- What? 
 - It looks good.

678
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:49,342
Stand still.

679
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:53,167
- What is it? 
 - How did it work again?

680
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:55,699
Oh? I know.

681
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:02,267
Like this.

682
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:05,392
You're getting old, take care of yourself.

683
00:48:05,392 --> 00:48:07,167
- This is nice. 
 - You should wear it out too.

684
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,667
Thank you.

685
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:11,067
It's pretty; go wear it outside too.

686
00:48:11,067 --> 00:48:12,918
You're really cool.

687
00:48:12,918 --> 00:48:17,517
Gifting an ex too? You're like Hollywood classy.

688
00:48:17,517 --> 00:48:22,667
He didn't get you one because he likes you, he likes giving.

689
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,292
How'd you know?

690
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:27,999
This is the difference between the rich and the poor.

691
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:29,542
When rich people gain money,

692
00:48:29,542 --> 00:48:32,918
they worry about where they could invest it.

693
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:34,999
When poor people gain money,

694
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:38,918
they wonder where they could spend it.

695
00:48:38,918 --> 00:48:41,442
What do you mean poor?

696
00:48:41,442 --> 00:48:42,999
I'm about to be rich and famous.

697
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:46,292
You should learn to be humble.

698
00:48:46,292 --> 00:48:50,918
Flaunting and bragging won't get you anywhere.

699
00:48:50,918 --> 00:48:52,292
Oh my, oh my.

700
00:48:52,292 --> 00:48:55,042
Suddenly you're parenting?

701
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:56,999
I'm just happy for you!

702
00:48:56,999 --> 00:48:59,042
I'm glad you finally got your chance.

703
00:48:59,042 --> 00:49:02,042
I'm about to cry.

704
00:49:04,999 --> 00:49:08,142
I love it! It's so pretty.

705
00:49:08,142 --> 00:49:12,717
The company car is for you, why're you giving it to me?

706
00:49:12,717 --> 00:49:15,567
I haven't driven in ages.

707
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:18,999
I guess it was worthwhile raising you.

708
00:49:23,918 --> 00:49:26,567
- That? 
 - Tada!

709
00:49:26,567 --> 00:49:28,192
Not that...

710
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:31,692
Two over...

711
00:49:31,692 --> 00:49:33,399
Next to it.

712
00:49:40,442 --> 00:49:41,792
Tada!

713
00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:44,799
Are you kidding me?

714
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:46,899
That's not all.

715
00:49:46,899 --> 00:49:48,918
Surprise!

716
00:49:49,742 --> 00:49:51,642
Seriously?

717
00:49:55,209 --> 00:50:00,399
 Thank you for raising me!

718
00:50:04,542 --> 00:50:06,499
Don't cry.

719
00:50:09,999 --> 00:50:12,067
Take the keys.

720
00:50:14,992 --> 00:50:16,818
This is pretty bad.

721
00:50:16,818 --> 00:50:18,567
- What do you mean? 
 - Mom!

722
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:21,999
She has to be comfortable!

723
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:25,917
She's a beginner, she should start with something like this.

724
00:50:25,917 --> 00:50:31,099
A brand new car would just stress her out.

725
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:33,392
Clean that right off!

726
00:50:33,999 --> 00:50:36,699
Tada!

727
00:50:39,299 --> 00:50:40,042
Yes!

728
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:44,634
It's a steam iron.

729
00:50:44,634 --> 00:50:49,792
A necessity for a fashionista.

730
00:50:51,267 --> 00:50:53,292
Oh and this! An electric toothbrush.

731
00:50:53,292 --> 00:50:57,618
It's for me since you don't brush your teeth.

732
00:50:57,618 --> 00:51:00,267
Why didn't I buy this for myself before?

733
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:06,167
Mom, don't be mad.

734
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:10,667
What was that necklace earlier?

735
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,275
Necklace, necklace...

736
00:51:13,275 --> 00:51:15,134
Tada!

737
00:51:16,501 --> 00:51:18,159
Pretty right?

738
00:51:19,867 --> 00:51:21,999
It's not for you.

739
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:24,042
Who? Teacher?

740
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:26,542
Don't tell anyone.

741
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:31,799
I'll give it to her at the perfect place at the perfect time.

742
00:51:37,999 --> 00:51:39,592
Now!

743
00:51:39,592 --> 00:51:41,199
Here.

744
00:51:43,718 --> 00:51:45,417
It's not for me again?

745
00:51:45,417 --> 00:51:47,317
Hey, how'd you know?

746
00:51:47,317 --> 00:51:49,999
This one's for Noeul, and that's for Big Brother.

747
00:51:49,999 --> 00:51:51,417
They'll be so happy.

748
00:51:51,417 --> 00:51:56,799
I never expected anything, but I'm upset.

749
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,667
Look at all that!

750
00:52:04,742 --> 00:52:06,767
What?

751
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:07,999
What's what?

752
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:11,692
I bought this and that, got matching attires with Jihoo...

753
00:52:11,692 --> 00:52:16,442
Bought some necessities, I've spent 11,264,000 won.

754
00:52:16,442 --> 00:52:22,142
I also took out emergency money and paid my credit card off.

755
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:24,567
Why should I hold this for you?

756
00:52:24,567 --> 00:52:26,867
You aren't holding it, it's yours.

757
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:35,199
That's enough for public or private college tuition.

758
00:52:41,417 --> 00:52:44,042
Why? What!

759
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:48,799
An uncle is allowed to flex for his only nephew!

760
00:52:50,718 --> 00:52:55,567
Think of it as a wedding gift. I'll earn and get you more.

761
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:01,999
You're emotional? You too?

762
00:53:01,999 --> 00:53:04,717
Stop that.

763
00:53:05,417 --> 00:53:10,292
I'm glad you're happy. Is this the taste of success?

764
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:16,667
Jihoo, just wait. When I make it, I'll do more for you!

765
00:53:18,717 --> 00:53:19,767
How sweet.

766
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:23,317
That's right. It's yours, tada, tada.

767
00:53:23,317 --> 00:53:25,042
I almost forgot.

768
00:53:25,042 --> 00:53:26,899
Our family car.

769
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:29,292
- Drive safe. 
 - It's mine?

770
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:32,999
I knew it! I knew you were messing with me!

771
00:53:32,999 --> 00:53:34,542
Even the key is fancy.

772
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:35,667
It even has airbags...

773
00:53:35,667 --> 00:53:38,942
- Can I press this? 
 - Don't! It's loud.

774
00:53:38,942 --> 00:53:39,918
Where should we go?

775
00:53:39,918 --> 00:53:41,999
Let's go for a drive in the morning.

776
00:53:41,999 --> 00:53:44,999
♪ I don't know how but ♪

777
00:53:44,999 --> 00:53:49,792
♪ If it's all right with you ♪

778
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:54,667
♪ I'll always protect you ♪

779
00:53:56,492 --> 00:54:00,999
♪ If it's alright with you ♪

780
00:54:00,999 --> 00:54:04,442
I think "Bluebird" is better for his vocal range.

781
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:09,999
♪ I'll always be on your side ♪

782
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,192
Hello.

783
00:54:17,417 --> 00:54:19,199
Oh, hey.

784
00:54:19,918 --> 00:54:22,067
Have some snacks.

785
00:54:22,067 --> 00:54:23,192
Jihoo too.

786
00:54:23,192 --> 00:54:26,167
Let's do one more. According to Jihoo,

787
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:28,667
your vocal range is better with "Bluebird."

788
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:30,792
Okay. I'm more comfortable with that song.

789
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:35,667
Your nephew is basically a producer!

790
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:38,792
He's good at producing and singing.

791
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:43,242
I want to duet with him.

792
00:54:43,242 --> 00:54:46,467
- That's not up to you! 
 - It is!

793
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:50,999
Well... No...

794
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:52,499
Yes, sir.

795
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:59,342
Yes, sir. Okay then. I'll try and speak with him.

796
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:07,167
- Umm... 
 - Why? Is there a problem?

797
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:13,999
He heard your recording. He wants to delay our album.

798
00:55:13,999 --> 00:55:16,492
- What? Why? 
 - Why...

799
00:55:16,492 --> 00:55:18,599
Because...

800
00:55:21,342 --> 00:55:24,792
He urgently wants a mini-album, and a showcase!

801
00:55:24,792 --> 00:55:26,999
A showcase?

802
00:55:26,999 --> 00:55:29,167
Starting on stage?

803
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:32,718
Yes, live on YouTube.

804
00:55:32,718 --> 00:55:36,999
He's excited and wants your comeback to be awesome.

805
00:55:36,999 --> 00:55:41,099
You had an upset expression.

806
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:46,267
It's because now I won't even have time for a vacation!

807
00:55:46,267 --> 00:55:49,092
- Jihoo, you're excited, right? 
 - Yes.

808
00:55:49,092 --> 00:55:53,542
- When's the showcase? 
 - Two weeks from now?

809
00:55:53,542 --> 00:55:54,899
Two weeks?

810
00:55:54,899 --> 00:55:59,217
It's really soon. What should I prepare?

811
00:55:59,217 --> 00:56:03,342
Your outfit styling,

812
00:56:03,342 --> 00:56:05,999
dieting, and skin care.

813
00:56:05,999 --> 00:56:07,999
All right.

814
00:56:09,792 --> 00:56:10,918
It begins.

815
00:56:10,918 --> 00:56:13,209
- Congratulations, Uncle! 
 - Yes!

816
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:15,392
My partner!

817
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:23,042
We don't have much to take.

818
00:56:23,042 --> 00:56:27,242
- When are you moving? 
 - After your showcase.

819
00:56:27,292 --> 00:56:28,792
Is that okay?

820
00:56:28,792 --> 00:56:31,392
You seriously aren't having a wedding?

821
00:56:31,392 --> 00:56:33,042
Wedding?

822
00:56:33,042 --> 00:56:34,999
It's the second time for the both of us.

823
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:37,167
You didn't have a wedding on your first.

824
00:56:37,167 --> 00:56:38,667
Let's have a small one.

825
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:41,667
Yeah, Mom. You haven't had a wedding dress.

826
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:47,192
I don't like that stuff, none of it matters.

827
00:56:48,667 --> 00:56:51,417
Give me some.

828
00:56:51,417 --> 00:56:53,542
- Hey. 
 - Move!

829
00:56:53,542 --> 00:56:56,542
- Did you hit me with a rock? 
 - Whatever.

830
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:58,999
Does this even work?

831
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,167
Anything would work on your skin.

832
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:05,917
You're aging at an incredible rate.

833
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:09,167
Son, be nice.

834
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:15,918
You have to get prettier.

835
00:57:15,918 --> 00:57:16,999
This is nice.

836
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:21,692
 We laughed like this over the smallest things.

837
00:57:23,792 --> 00:57:27,699
 I thought only happiness was waiting for us.

838
00:57:27,699 --> 00:57:31,192
 These were the days, we had no doubts.

839
00:57:31,192 --> 00:57:33,992
Look pretty!

840
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:36,999
The password is my birthday.

841
00:57:37,042 --> 00:57:40,292
319...

842
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,692
It's passed.

843
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:47,142
This year it has. But there are many more with you.

844
00:57:47,142 --> 00:57:50,117
- Okay. 
 - After you.

845
00:57:54,999 --> 00:57:58,417
It used to be a storage, but I'll redo the walls.

846
00:57:58,417 --> 00:58:02,192
Is it okay for Jihoo?

847
00:58:02,192 --> 00:58:04,392
What should I prepare?

848
00:58:04,392 --> 00:58:07,667
Don't prepare anything. Just bring yourself.

849
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:12,999
Shouldn't I at least buy blankets? Or dishes?

850
00:58:12,999 --> 00:58:16,567
Then let's go shop for them together.

851
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:22,467
I feel burdened, you're providing everything...

852
00:58:22,467 --> 00:58:24,992
Don't think like that.

853
00:58:25,542 --> 00:58:28,918
I have something for you.

854
00:58:34,417 --> 00:58:37,099
- Insurance? 
 - You don't have any, right?

855
00:58:38,542 --> 00:58:40,667
Anything can happen.

856
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:43,817
At our age, we need at least one of these.

857
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:50,367
The monthly fees are very expensive. It's quite burdensome.

858
00:58:50,367 --> 00:58:54,999
Every month I'll deposit the amount to your account.

859
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:57,118
- Why? 
 - It's a gift.

860
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:59,967
A lot of people gift insurance these days.

861
00:58:59,999 --> 00:59:04,299
You said there was something I had to do.

862
00:59:08,042 --> 00:59:09,892
Sign it.

863
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:14,642
You're funny.

864
00:59:14,642 --> 00:59:16,599
Here.

865
00:59:16,618 --> 00:59:20,692
Reporter Song! I didn't molest anyone!

866
00:59:20,692 --> 00:59:23,342
That was years ago!

867
00:59:23,342 --> 00:59:25,667
Get the article down, now!

868
00:59:31,217 --> 00:59:33,667
- Congressman. 
 - What?

869
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:37,067
The construction site assault case from 8 years ago...

870
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:39,799
A public petition was filed.

871
00:59:39,799 --> 00:59:44,892
The bereaved family reported that you threatened them.

872
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,467
What?

873
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:52,167
- Why are you doing this? 
 - Doing what?

874
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:56,467
It's not like I didn't know you were interested in politics.

875
00:59:56,467 --> 01:00:00,567
Your grandson lives here, I understand.

876
01:00:00,567 --> 01:00:04,342
I even understood when you took the mom cafe from me.

877
01:00:04,342 --> 01:00:08,592
Buy why are you going after my flaws and mistakes?

878
01:00:08,592 --> 01:00:13,092
Congressman, I think you have a misunderstanding.

879
01:00:13,092 --> 01:00:17,167
I do not know anything about your past.

880
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:21,467
Okay. Of course, you don't.

881
01:00:21,467 --> 01:00:25,318
But I know who does.

882
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:29,999
- Is it Park Hyeryeong? 
 - Who?

883
01:00:29,999 --> 01:00:32,999
The previous Momvely Diamond.

884
01:00:32,999 --> 01:00:39,867
Isn't the previous Diamond in prison?

885
01:00:42,999 --> 01:00:48,767
Do you believe that only one person knows your weaknesses?

886
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:54,767
You should get going, I have a busy schedule.

887
01:01:08,567 --> 01:01:11,767
I'm nervous.

888
01:01:11,767 --> 01:01:14,042
How long has it been?

889
01:01:14,042 --> 01:01:17,999
We have a lot of time to rehearse. Don't be worried.

890
01:01:17,999 --> 01:01:22,417
I urgently found this stage, isn't it too small?

891
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:24,792
What do you mean? No one will come anyways.

892
01:01:24,792 --> 01:01:27,217
We have to fill it up.

893
01:01:27,999 --> 01:01:31,792
If you're done here, want to get a drink?

894
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:35,042
Jihoo, your uncle's favorite bar, is Hot Bar. Right?

895
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:37,417
- Yes. 
 - I'd like to but...

896
01:01:37,417 --> 01:01:39,667
I don't want to take Jihoo out drinking.

897
01:01:39,667 --> 01:01:43,417
I'll ask Mom to pick me up after work.

898
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:45,842
Yeah? Should I invite your teacher?

899
01:01:45,842 --> 01:01:47,167
Yes!

900
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:49,842
Okay, let's go.

901
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:53,999
She hasn't called back?

902
01:01:53,999 --> 01:01:55,542
She must be busy, she's not picking up.

903
01:01:55,542 --> 01:01:57,667
Where's your manager?

904
01:01:57,667 --> 01:02:01,042
How will we fill up the entire audience?

905
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:03,792
It would have been nice if you had fans.

906
01:02:03,792 --> 01:02:06,799
You might have hidden fans, like me, around the country.

907
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:10,417
There are so many musicians, no one would remember me.

908
01:02:10,417 --> 01:02:12,542
I have no fans.

909
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:19,290

910
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:21,651
 J. King! Again!

911
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:23,118

912
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:25,999
Yeah, surprise!

913
01:02:25,999 --> 01:02:28,167
What? You knew about this?

914
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:30,199
You planned with Jihoo?

915
01:02:30,199 --> 01:02:32,599
Tada!

916
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:34,999
Teacher!

917
01:02:34,999 --> 01:02:37,292
Your manager did everything.

918
01:02:37,292 --> 01:02:39,492
You surprised me!

919
01:02:39,492 --> 01:02:43,967
- Congratulations! 
 - Thank you.

920
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:47,792
Did you know?

921
01:02:47,792 --> 01:02:53,242
J. King's fan cafe manager J. Queen was her!

922
01:02:53,242 --> 01:02:56,792
Really? You're so sweet.

923
01:02:56,792 --> 01:03:01,342
We e-mailed all your fans individually.

924
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:04,660
Thank you! Thank you!

925
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,800
Uncle, blow them out.

926
01:03:10,417 --> 01:03:12,418
1, 2, 3!

927
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:20,767
Now, now...

928
01:03:20,767 --> 01:03:24,292
Our star! Our bright shining star!

929
01:03:24,292 --> 01:03:28,167
Voice Audition 1st place winner, J. King's fan meeting...

930
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:31,042
will begin!

931
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:41,699
 J. King! J. King!

932
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:45,799

933
01:03:46,626 --> 01:03:48,918
Hello.

934
01:03:48,918 --> 01:03:50,709
I'm on my way home.

935
01:03:50,709 --> 01:03:53,918
 You should've told me. I wouldn't have made other plans.

936
01:03:53,918 --> 01:03:58,699
It was really urgently prepared. I just found out today.

937
01:03:58,699 --> 01:04:01,792
Yes, okay. I'll tell him for you.

938
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:10,417
Busy?

939
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:13,318
Where are you going?

940
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:15,667
- Why are you here? 
 - Let's talk.

941
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:19,399
Don't get near me, keep your distance!

942
01:04:20,417 --> 01:04:24,918
I'm Jihoo's father. I used to be your husband, too.

943
01:04:24,918 --> 01:04:29,167
You might've married me because you got pregnant but...

944
01:04:29,167 --> 01:04:32,417
I was in love with you. You knew that.

945
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:33,999
Seriously...

946
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:38,118
Well, anyways... I'll cut the crap.

947
01:04:38,118 --> 01:04:40,118
Let me get to the point.

948
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:44,099
Isn't he strange? Ju Gyeongil?

949
01:04:49,667 --> 01:04:52,475
- What? 
 - He's suspicious.

950
01:04:52,475 --> 01:04:55,242
He's handsome, smart, and wealthy.

951
01:04:55,242 --> 01:04:58,717
Why would he choose you?

952
01:04:58,717 --> 01:05:02,167
So I looked into him.

953
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:06,999
- Are you crazy? 
 - Crazy?

954
01:05:06,999 --> 01:05:10,867
- You almost died! 
 - What are you talking about?

955
01:05:10,867 --> 01:05:12,692
He's a murderer.

956
01:05:12,692 --> 01:05:13,918
What?

957
01:05:13,918 --> 01:05:18,167
He murdered his wife for insurance money.

958
01:05:19,342 --> 01:05:21,999
He approached you with bad intentions.

959
01:05:21,999 --> 01:05:25,567
You're his next target. You understand?

960
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:31,592
Don't be a fool. Get your head on straight.

961
01:05:41,292 --> 01:05:43,542
Surprised?

962
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:47,742
You really didn't suspect anything.

963
01:05:47,742 --> 01:05:51,117
Stupid.

964
01:05:51,117 --> 01:05:55,542
It's easy to trick innocent and kind people.

965
01:05:55,542 --> 01:05:58,199
Easy to trap...

966
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:04,960
♫  Should I be brave?  ♫

967
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:09,760
♫  Even if I have nothing  ♫

968
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:15,450
♫  My racing heart whispers  ♫

969
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,780
♫  Telling me to fufill my dreams  ♫

970
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:24,450
♫  My dream is to be the bluebird, I'll become the bluebird  ♫

971
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:29,467
♫  I don't care if I fall forwards, as long as I'm moving forward  ♫

972
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:33,292
 It was a perfect day.

973
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:39,290
♫  I don't care if I fall backward, then I'll be able to see the stars  ♫

974
01:06:39,292 --> 01:06:41,999
1, 2, 3!

975
01:06:41,999 --> 01:06:46,760
♫  Towards the skies  ♫

976
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:51,160
♫  I will fly  ♫

977
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:02,734

978
01:07:02,734 --> 01:07:04,759
Jihoo!

979
01:07:04,759 --> 01:07:06,842
Jihoo!

980
01:07:06,842 --> 01:07:10,083
Jihoo, are you okay?

981
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:11,459
What's wrong?

982
01:07:11,459 --> 01:07:13,000
Jihoo, wake up!

983
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,183
What did he eat?

984
01:07:15,183 --> 01:07:16,792
What's wrong with him!

985
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:18,999
Call 911, 911, Call 911!

986
01:07:18,999 --> 01:07:20,742
Jihoo!

987
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:52,630

988
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:58,830

989
01:07:58,834 --> 01:08:00,167
 He's unconscious! Help us!

990
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:02,792
 I don't know what he ate. I didn't see what he ate.

991
01:08:02,792 --> 01:08:05,000
 Don't let anyone speak badly of you.

992
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,867
 If you don't mind your own business, I'll make you regret it. Got it?

993
01:08:08,867 --> 01:08:11,751
 What's... Where'd you get this?

994
01:08:11,751 --> 01:08:15,667
 Mingi's mother moved into the penthouse!

995
01:08:15,667 --> 01:08:19,792
 I am an expert at controlling those women.

996
01:08:19,792 --> 01:08:21,617
 I'll return to your home.

997
01:08:21,617 --> 01:08:22,726
 But I have a condition.

998
01:08:22,726 --> 01:08:25,999
 How can you call yourself his mother? Why would you send him there?

999
01:08:25,999 --> 01:08:28,884
 Don't take him away from my sister because of me.

1000
01:08:28,884 --> 01:08:30,834
 I swear... I'll never show myself to Jihoo again.

1001
01:08:30,834 --> 01:08:34,042
 A special person in my life supported me and gave me courage.

1002
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:36,999
 My loving nephew, I'm grateful for helping me come back.

1003
01:08:36,999 --> 01:08:39,999
 If you know their weaknesses, we are indestructible.

1004
01:08:39,999 --> 01:08:42,999
 You are under arrest for drug-related crimes.

1005
01:08:42,999 --> 01:08:46,092
 This is my stage!

1006
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:52,660

1007
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:58,850
