1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,760

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:12,601

3
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:16,709

4
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:22,100

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,740

6
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:33,626

7
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:38,190

8
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,290

9
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:51,150

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,050

11
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:06,418
Joonhee.

12
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:13,918
Did you see it?

13
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:16,167
What is all that?

14
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:18,142
It's not...

15
00:01:18,142 --> 00:01:20,718
What is that? Why are my photos...

16
00:01:20,718 --> 00:01:23,899
Photos of all our neighborhood women?

17
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:26,192
It's for my next project.

18
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:27,192
What?

19
00:01:27,192 --> 00:01:32,010
I'm a web-comics writer...

20
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:39,092
This movie was based on your comic?

21
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:40,942
Yeah... It's was a while ago.

22
00:01:40,942 --> 00:01:43,867
I took time off to take care of Noeul.

23
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:46,892
I'm preparing for my comeback piece.

24
00:01:47,818 --> 00:01:49,317
Oh, I see.

25
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,717
It's my first time writing from a woman's perspective.

26
00:01:52,717 --> 00:01:55,867
I'm terrible at drawing women.

27
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,717
Noeul did her best to support me.

28
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:02,292
She took photos of everyone for me.

29
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:04,367
Were you surprised?

30
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:10,142
But why... is my photo in the center.

31
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:12,767
You're my main character.

32
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:17,130
Shouldn't main characters be beautiful?

33
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,367
You are beautiful...

34
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:25,592
Want to see?

35
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:28,720
It's a still cut, I even colored it.

36
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:49,190
Do you like it?

37
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,260

38
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,820

39
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:55,999
Hello.

40
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:58,242
- Oh, good morning. 
 - Good morning.

41
00:03:58,242 --> 00:04:00,799
Good morning.

42
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:22,399
What? You think I don't wash?

43
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,799
Uncle, what's wrong? What's going on?

44
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:29,242
I just exercised, exercise, exercise!

45
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:30,417
Oh my god!

46
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,067
What, what, what!

47
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:34,618
Put some pants on.

48
00:04:34,618 --> 00:04:38,692
Mom, he was exercising.

49
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,509
People die when they suddenly change.

50
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,542
Don't ruin my vibe, old lady.

51
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:44,592
I'm going to live forever.

52
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:47,667
Water in the morning is healthy.

53
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:53,342
I want to tell you about our family's new goals and direction.

54
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:56,799
Since I destroyed the Momvelies and their plans,

55
00:04:56,799 --> 00:05:01,699
they will be coming after all of us.

56
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,442
So how do we prepare?

57
00:05:03,442 --> 00:05:08,792
Survive. Our goal is survival.

58
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:11,718
If they hit you? Just say "ouch." Walk away.

59
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:12,999
If they spit on you?

60
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:15,192
Just smile and wipe it off.

61
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:19,067
We will become a family of boars that can't be phased.

62
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:22,799
Family of boars? Terrible naming.

63
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,567
I'm not joking around.

64
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:27,667
Sorry.

65
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:28,899
Now, again.

66
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:34,192
Don't ever talk about moving schools like a loser.

67
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:36,242
So what if the school changes?

68
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:37,467
Why can't you do music?

69
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:38,718
Those are all weak excuses.

70
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:40,942
I never had music education.

71
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:45,492
If it comes down to it, I can teach you music myself.

72
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:48,467
You'd be learning from a top 1% musical genius.

73
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:49,367
Okay.

74
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:50,718
Why aren't you excited?

75
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,192
- Yeah... 
 - Okay.

76
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:55,799
Let's cheer together for our new future.

77
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:58,418
Come on, bring your hands in.

78
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,300
Let's go family!

79
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,940
- Let's go family.  
 - Let's go family.

80
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:05,299
One more time. Where's the energy?

81
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,167
Again, louder.

82
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,292
Let's go family!

83
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:11,318
Enjoy breakfast!

84
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:19,392
It was you! You gave him the audio recording.

85
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:20,992
Are you crazy?

86
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:23,892
Why would I do that? Why?

87
00:06:23,892 --> 00:06:26,618
You've been siding with him! Know your place.

88
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:28,042
My place?

89
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:32,718
How dare you talk about "place" to me?

90
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:37,092
I'm a beauty pageant winner and my husband's a doctor.

91
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:40,642
Some second-tier plastic surgeon? Not impressive.

92
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:43,467
Well, you must be so happy. Right?

93
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:45,799
Living with a cheating car wash owner.

94
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:47,799
My husband is an incredible doctor,

95
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:51,842
the problem is with your ugly face. It can't be helped!

96
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:54,692
The reason you can't have a son is because you're rude!

97
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:55,692
I curse you!

98
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:57,899
I'd rather have no son than a son like yours.

99
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:59,999
Why you little!

100
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:15,342
I will always do whatever it takes for our goals!

101
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:19,860
If you don't like it, you can leave right now!

102
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:31,967
You are all my proud Gold Momvelies, we cannot have conflict from within.

103
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:37,342
Let's forget about what happened, and move on.

104
00:07:37,342 --> 00:07:38,842
We can't just move on.

105
00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:42,317
Jihoo's uncle is responsible for all this mess,

106
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:45,118
he should be our target.

107
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:47,492
I don't want to think about him anymore.

108
00:07:47,492 --> 00:07:51,217
The school system change will happen in due time.

109
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:55,192
I'll proceed with our plans with the congressman.

110
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:59,342
You should focus on the big picture, we'll take care of the rat.

111
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:01,592
That's our specialty, isn't it?

112
00:08:01,592 --> 00:08:04,610
She's right! We can handle him!

113
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:15,092
This month's Gold Momvely Member Package.

114
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:16,467
Good job, everyone.

115
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:20,899
VVIP tickets to the Grande department store fashion show.

116
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:26,692
19th Century Black Pearl Wine Coupon from the Olcanta Shell Rose family in France.

117
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:30,042
Oh, how I love being a Gold Momvely, Sis!

118
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,317
I prepared one more thing, what could it be?

119
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:35,967
15-year-old wild ginseng from the Sobaek Mountains.

120
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:38,999
For your husband, he'll give you another child.

121
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:40,718
And one more.

122
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:43,942
The Fond d'Amore restaurant in the Fantastic City Hotel,

123
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:49,060
has invited Gold Momvelies for a tasting dinner course.

124
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:55,799
What? What's the good news? Congratulations!

125
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,942
What's the good news? What's the good news?

126
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:01,217
Speak of the devil...

127
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:03,417
Not the devil, a rat.

128
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,942
You guys seem happy.

129
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:10,317
I thought you'd be fighting each other to catch the spy.

130
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,899
What can I help you with?

131
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,642
I'll be here every day.

132
00:09:14,642 --> 00:09:16,842
I'm stuck to you like a leech.

133
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:18,718
Just in case all of you plan something terrible.

134
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:22,192
Code "Won't get backstabbed."

135
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:24,067
Our meeting has come to an end.

136
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:26,217
Please text for important matters.

137
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,792
Okay! Good job, everyone.

138
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:29,899
Goodbye.

139
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:32,799
Oh right, Diamond?

140
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,892
Can I work part-time?

141
00:09:34,892 --> 00:09:36,367
Why are you asking me?

142
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,799
I don't want you to get angry.

143
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:41,367
I need your blessing for everything now.

144
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:43,392
Can you take care of this?

145
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:47,942
Part-time? Go ahead. Let's see if you can.

146
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:52,067
Thank you so much! I'll buy dinner when I receive my first paycheck!

147
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:54,620
Bang, bang! Bang, bang!

148
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,692
If you're finished, please close the windows.

149
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:16,118
I'll make sure to wipe them clean!

150
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:20,942
Please be careful of the water! 1, 2, 3...

151
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:25,667
I reported him for watching me change, he got fired right away.

152
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,567
Nice.

153
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:30,118
- Hello? 
 - What?

154
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:34,692
Fried chicken delivery! 2, 3 chicken... And 3 beers…

155
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:36,899
A lot of beer... It's for the two of you?

156
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,718
Excuse me, we ordered 3 chickens, there are only 4 legs.

157
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:44,099
I think the delivery guy ate them!

158
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:45,592
I'll begin to wash your hair.

159
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:47,042
Let me know if it's too hot.

160
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:50,142
Oh, it's so hot!

161
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:51,067
I'm so sorry, my apologies.

162
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,342
You did that on purpose!

163
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:54,899
Do-Anything services! Did you need dinner?

164
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,199
What are you doing here? You're terrible at everything.

165
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,192
Excuse me?

166
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,192
I'm really good at cooking.

167
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,917
My in-laws are coming, you'll ruin everything!

168
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:06,342
I'm really good.

169
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:08,142
What?

170
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:12,317
I'm not satisfied.

171
00:11:12,317 --> 00:11:14,292
With this?

172
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:16,799
So why'd you do it?

173
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,842
What?

174
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:21,067
You sent me the recording.

175
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:24,692
I don't know what you're talking about.

176
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:26,692
How sweet of you!

177
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:30,192
Don't tell anyone! You got it?

178
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:32,567
All right, all right. Don't worry.

179
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,799
How long can you keep this up?

180
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,067
They'll always get you fired.

181
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:41,618
They can try. I'm just living my life.

182
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,217
Let's see who wins...

183
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:47,470
I'll be the last man standing.

184
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,690

185
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:50,899
 He's driving me crazy!

186
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:53,818
I went for a haircut, and there he is!

187
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:55,467
He's also the bus driver.

188
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:57,592
How do we get rid of him?

189
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:00,718
He's not a rat, he's a cockroach.

190
00:12:00,718 --> 00:12:04,542
Cockroach pest control! Cockroach pest control!

191
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:08,318
- What are you doing! 
 - Do it later!

192
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:13,967
Sorry, no can do. As a professional,

193
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,492
I just finished the other rooms, they'll all swarm over here.

194
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:18,699
I'll protect you.

195
00:12:19,492 --> 00:12:21,442
Not on us!

196
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,218
Oh, there's one!

197
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:25,342
Cockroach!

198
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,080
What the heck?

199
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,967
I thought it was a cockroach.

200
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,792
Sorry, my apologies.

201
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:37,092
You're going to get fired today.

202
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:39,192
Then I'll just find another job.

203
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,592
I'm leaving now, sorry.

204
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:43,442
Anyeong, goodbye, sayonara, zaijian! 
   (In Korean, English, Japanese, and Chinese)

205
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:47,042
Get him fired now!

206
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:50,217
That's why I told you to just leave him alone.

207
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:54,942
You can't get rid of cockroaches by stepping on them.

208
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:59,367
Just leave him, okay?

209
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:05,740
She's an alcoholic...

210
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,990

211
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:19,192
Hey, soft eyes.

212
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:22,067
Hello.

213
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,042
Why am I "soft eyes"?

214
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:28,699
You're always about to cry.

215
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:32,792
I'm Chaeyoung. Shin Chaeyoung.

216
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:37,167
Here, I washed it.

217
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:40,842
We have similar counseling times, so I waited for you.

218
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:43,999
It's really old.

219
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:47,299
But still, it's really important to me.

220
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:52,692
I'll let you borrow it. Give it back when you're okay.

221
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:55,067
Thank you.

222
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:59,392
But... what made you so sad?

223
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:04,399
My boyfriend left me.

224
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:11,142
I really loved him. We promised to get married.

225
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,142
And?

226
00:14:13,142 --> 00:14:16,467
He changed... when I got pregnant.

227
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:20,642
He blackmailed my mother, took her money and left.

228
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:25,067
What a piece of trash.

229
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:41,567
You look happy today.

230
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:45,999
I got a lot off my chest.

231
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:47,899
To the doctor?

232
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:49,292
Huh?

233
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:51,859
Yes.

234
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:56,718
- Hello! 
 - I like your braids.

235
00:14:56,718 --> 00:15:00,192
- Hello. 
 - Hello!

236
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,842
Oh, hello.

237
00:15:02,842 --> 00:15:04,592
Hello, Teacher.

238
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:06,899
You're security here?

239
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,718
You look really good in a uniform.

240
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:11,317
Thanks.

241
00:15:11,317 --> 00:15:13,442
Hello.

242
00:15:13,442 --> 00:15:16,999
Thank you for getting my job back.

243
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,192
- And the letter. 
 - Yeah.

244
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,267
Kids, be careful!

245
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:25,899
Come here, excuse us.

246
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:29,392
- Hello! 
 - Hello there.

247
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:34,899
- Hello. 
 - Yup.

248
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:49,792
Are you here for me?

249
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:53,042
I had something to tell you...

250
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:55,417
I was just about to go see you.

251
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:59,067
The kids are on a field trip, I'm free all day.

252
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:07,799
I actually prepared something to show my gratitude.

253
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,192
But I couldn't finish it, I've been so busy.

254
00:16:11,192 --> 00:16:14,417
But don't worry, I'll complete it this week.

255
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,209
It's okay.

256
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:20,167
Don't give me anything.

257
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:26,242
Is there something wrong?

258
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:30,999
We shouldn't talk anymore, it's best for you.

259
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:33,899
With all the parents and even the kids.

260
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,567
Everyone is paying us a lot of attention.

261
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:43,042
I even considered turning down this security job.

262
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:44,999
But I really need the money.

263
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:47,167
Got it, got it.

264
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:51,199
We're playing it cool! This will be fun!

265
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,292
All right, I'll leave first.

266
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:57,899
I'll just text you now for bluebird work.

267
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,167
Stop carrying around the keyring.

268
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:03,999
Okay, I'll take it out.

269
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,042
Can you stop it now?

270
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:08,592
I won't. I'll just leave it at home.

271
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:10,567
No, stop being my fan.

272
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,567
Can you please stop being my fan?

273
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:19,418
I don't deserve to have fans.

274
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:22,567
I'm nothing now.

275
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:26,317
Jihoo said everything was an excuse...

276
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:30,292
I want to stop blaming my luck and others.

277
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:36,342
I'm going back to the beginning, when I was focused.

278
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:38,942
That's why...

279
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,292
I'll be by your side and cheer for you.

280
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,442
I'm your one and only, biggest fan...

281
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,399
To yourself then.

282
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,918
Just keep it to yourself, Teacher.

283
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:56,342
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:57,167 --> 00:18:02,399
I don't deserve any of your support.

285
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,042
Sorry.

286
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:14,117
You're so cool. J. King is the best.

287
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:17,792
You won first place,

288
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:21,167
yet you're going back to your humble beginnings...

289
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,399
That's so cool.

290
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:31,167
All right then, I won't be your fan.

291
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:34,192
I don't want to get in your way.

292
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:40,499
I'll support you but keep it to myself.

293
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:46,167
Thank you for everything.

294
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:08,410
♫  I think it will take a long time  ♫

295
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:13,918
♫  To erase you from my memory  ♫

296
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:17,167
 I hope J. King gets back to his music.

297
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:20,792
 I'm sure others are waiting for it too.

298
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,292
 I'll be your fan and be by your side.

299
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:25,550
 Forever.

300
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,860
♫  Instead of talking with those sad eyes  ♫

301
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,940

302
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:37,210
♫  We laughed a lot  ♫

303
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,120
♫  While we were in love  ♫

304
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:48,010
♫  I will miss that smile  ♫

305
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:59,370
♫  In the distant future  ♫

306
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:07,650
♫  When time passes, someday we'll forget each other  ♫

307
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,640
♫  You must be happy  ♫

308
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,230
♫  Forget the ugly me  ♫

309
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,250
♫  Now it's time to say goodbye  ♫

310
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:34,942
Was that bad?

311
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:38,718
I like it.

312
00:20:38,718 --> 00:20:42,117
It's the most emotional song you've done.

313
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:48,692
Bravo!

314
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:51,242
Bravo, bravo!

315
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:56,292
Losing someone is the best inspiration!

316
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,792
You never even dated her...

317
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,999
It was deeper than dating.

318
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:05,417
You didn't write such a lovely song when we broke up.

319
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:08,167
Your relationship wasn't deep, baby.

320
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,267
Think however you want.

321
00:21:14,818 --> 00:21:17,417
Uncle, do you know SoriCloud?

322
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,042
The music-sharing website?

323
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:22,642
Yes. Can we upload it there?

324
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:46,467
This is amazing!

325
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:48,999
Is this what you've been learning at MIDI lessons?

326
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:51,899
We can record your songs, and upload them on SoriCloud.

327
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:54,999
Let's hand out USBs to labels, too.

328
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:58,042
They're always looking for new talent.

329
00:21:58,042 --> 00:21:59,718
Why haven't you done this for me earlier?

330
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,792
You didn't have any good songs.

331
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:04,999
You don't have any MRs, right? 
 (N/T: Material Records)

332
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:07,542
MR? Everything is analog for me.

333
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:10,292
Busking around, doing live gigs.

334
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:12,567
I've recorded a live set and sent it to labels before.

335
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:14,442
To just any label?

336
00:22:14,442 --> 00:22:17,842
All music labels have their own taste.

337
00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:21,142
How do you know all this?

338
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,167
How do you not know any of this?

339
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,967
What could you possibly teach me?

340
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:42,167
Right leg, right leg. One, two, three, four... Left leg, left leg.  One, two, three, four...

341
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:46,417
Left hand, right hand...

342
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:49,342
So many of you got it wrong.

343
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:52,999
Everyone must memorize it by next week.

344
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:54,292
Yes.

345
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:57,942
If you have a hard time, please come find me.

346
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,999
Why aren't you dancing?

347
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:04,499
I memorized it. I'm smart.

348
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:11,299
What do I do when the boy I like, likes someone else?

349
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:18,442
If they're happier with someone else...

350
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:20,899
There's not much to do...

351
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,967
- Just let... 
 - Kill her. 
 - Kill him.

352
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:30,692
Stop watching dramas.

353
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:33,692
Should I make you a voodoo doll?

354
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:35,317
You can stab it every night.

355
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:38,610
No thanks! I don't like murder...

356
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,642
Who do you like?

357
00:23:42,692 --> 00:23:45,567
It's boring now, I quit.

358
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:49,499
Kids these days are so cool.

359
00:23:52,217 --> 00:23:55,199
Now let's try dancing to a new song.

360
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,799
Let's all stand in a circle.

361
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,442
Yes.

362
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:38,718
Tell me everything!

363
00:24:38,718 --> 00:24:41,699
I'm going to watch a movie with Youngah.

364
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:47,999
How are you still so strong? Take it easy.

365
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:52,418
Were your hands itching, since Jihoo's mom left?

366
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:58,667
Mrs. Jang, stop stalling. It'll get worse for you.

367
00:25:02,142 --> 00:25:05,692
I'll find them in time.

368
00:25:05,692 --> 00:25:07,899
Just tell me where they are.

369
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:11,499
If you just tell me, I'll forgive you this once.

370
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:17,167
Shouldn't you still be here when Jihoo comes back?

371
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:22,117
It's tough for a young child to live, after losing his mother.

372
00:25:23,242 --> 00:25:28,392
I will make sure Jihoo's mother is found dead.

373
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:02,867
- It's healed now. 
 - That's good...

374
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:10,899
You want to have dinner today? With the kids?

375
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:12,642
Pardon?

376
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:19,499
I can't cook due to my injury.

377
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:25,918
You're fussy.

378
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,167
Look.

379
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:42,042
Do you have other allergies, besides peanuts and kiwis?

380
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:43,592
Tuna and peaches.

381
00:26:43,592 --> 00:26:48,167
Okay, what burger does your mother like?

382
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:51,542
I don't know.

383
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:53,167
All right.

384
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,292
What would she like?

385
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:03,192
I didn't know what you liked so...

386
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,167
Did I do something wrong?

387
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,818
Did a burger-loving ghost possess you or something?

388
00:27:10,818 --> 00:27:13,999
I think it's cool. Burger flexing.

389
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,317
Well, don't flex twice, we can't finish all this.

390
00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:19,542
- It's really a lot of food. 
 - We can take it home.

391
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:22,042
Exactly, we can just do take-out.

392
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:23,442
Okay.

393
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:26,417
- Let's eat. 
 - I want this one.

394
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:28,042
I want this.

395
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:31,999
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

396
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:36,467
Seriously, he basically told me he liked you.

397
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:38,467
Jihoo, what do you think?

398
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:41,667
Do you think Noeul's dad likes your mother?

399
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:56,042
Did you seriously wear that to a date?

400
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:58,042
It wasn't a date.

401
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:01,042
Can't you make an effort? Do you only have one shirt?

402
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:03,542
Do you only have one eye? I have a lot of clothes!

403
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:04,818
No, you don't.

404
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:08,442
You don't even have proper shoes or a bag.

405
00:28:08,442 --> 00:28:11,718
I thought you married rich, didn't you bring anything?

406
00:28:11,718 --> 00:28:13,692
I brought my son!

407
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,892
Anyways, just make an effort, when you meet him.

408
00:28:16,892 --> 00:28:18,842
You look terrible.

409
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,042
You think I won't beat you anymore?

410
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:25,217
Dress up when you take him to school, too.

411
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:30,767
I don't want all the other women to feel bad.

412
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:37,442
You guys are the same when you argue.

413
00:28:37,442 --> 00:28:39,167
 Hey.

414
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:40,899
 What?

415
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:42,918
Why are you offended?

416
00:28:42,918 --> 00:28:45,667
You should be thankful.

417
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:48,142
See, exactly the same.

418
00:29:03,418 --> 00:29:06,899
Can I sleep next to my son tonight?

419
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:13,467
Do you like Noeul's father?

420
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:20,218
I've been watching him, he's not bad.

421
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:25,617
By chance, if you need my permission,

422
00:29:25,617 --> 00:29:27,818
you have it.

423
00:29:27,818 --> 00:29:29,992
You have my blessing.

424
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:35,042
I know he really likes you.

425
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:37,399
100% green light.

426
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:41,117
Turn your lights off, and sleep, sir.

427
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:43,999
You like him, right?

428
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:46,099
No.

429
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:50,442
You do. I haven't seen you smile like that.

430
00:29:50,442 --> 00:29:54,192
How did I smile? Was it ugly?

431
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,092
Pretty.

432
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:02,067
It's okay, Mom.

433
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,592
You can smile and be happy.

434
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:08,867
Go to sleep.

435
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,650

436
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,999
I'm not following, just go with your mom.

437
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:43,417
Then, why are you dressed up?

438
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:45,042
I'm a natural fashion killer.

439
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:47,667
Just go, we need one more person.

440
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:49,918
What if we lose because of you.

441
00:30:49,918 --> 00:30:51,292
Even if I go, you'll lose.

442
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:53,542
You know how terrible I am at those things.

443
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:54,918
You just don't want to see Teacher, right?

444
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:56,999
You don't know what you're talking about.

445
00:30:56,999 --> 00:31:00,042
Quitting your security job? Not doing bluebird work?

446
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:02,999
It's out of sight, out of mind.

447
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:07,192
Being away won't change anything.

448
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,334
You have a point.

449
00:31:11,334 --> 00:31:12,992
Let's go.

450
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:17,818
Wait for us.

451
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,999

452
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:25,918
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

453
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,542
Put this on your chest.

454
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:28,918
Hi, Shiwon.

455
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:30,967
Hello, Father.

456
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:33,742
Greetings.

457
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,290
Ms. Diamond!

458
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:41,918
Hello.

459
00:31:41,918 --> 00:31:45,942
Diamond, the rumors aren't true. Right?

460
00:31:45,942 --> 00:31:50,417
Did the Momvelies forge consent forms?

461
00:31:50,417 --> 00:31:55,117
There's no way! It's just some strange rumors.

462
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:58,999
How about a glass of wine after this is over?

463
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:00,792
Our whole family?

464
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:02,417
Sounds great.

465
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:04,942
Call me.

466
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:10,042
So annoying, you have to deal with all these moms.

467
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:13,999
It must be stressful, having to invite all these people.

468
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:18,418
What can we do? It's better than losing face.

469
00:32:19,442 --> 00:32:21,692
There they come.

470
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:24,918
Are you inviting them, too?

471
00:32:24,918 --> 00:32:26,999
They're in the same class, how can I not?

472
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:29,742
Why are you always complaining?

473
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:30,542
What?

474
00:32:30,542 --> 00:32:32,867
What should we do?

475
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,417
Hello.

476
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:46,542
I've invited everyone for drinks tonight,

477
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:47,792
will you join us?

478
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:51,292
Are renters allowed? Why all of a sudden?

479
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:53,292
Let's just call it a kind gesture.

480
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:56,292
If I were the Diamond, we'd offer you nothing!

481
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:57,792
I don't need much.

482
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:59,999
Go have fun, let's go.

483
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:04,342
I want all Berry classroom parents to get along.

484
00:33:04,342 --> 00:33:09,299
Let's put our differences aside, for our kids?

485
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:13,999
Thank you for letting me work at Cook Mom.

486
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:15,918
Thank you for the invitation.

487
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:18,709
Oh, it must be difficult for you.

488
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:21,242
Since you can't drink.

489
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,667
Pardon?

490
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:27,792
Why not? I remember her chugging wine at Mingi's party.

491
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:32,667
She's being treated, she's an alcoholic.

492
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,042
Really?

493
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:36,792
No way! Are you an alcoholic?

494
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:39,918
Is that why you got divorced? How unfortunate!

495
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:40,999
Hey!

496
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:43,999
I hope the treatment is working for you.

497
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:45,667
You should stay away from drinks.

498
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:48,818
Don't drink because of stress like last time.

499
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,767
We're moms, aren't we?

500
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:02,417
I think there's a misunderstanding, what're you talking about?

501
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:05,042
Oh my, was it a secret?

502
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,792
Oh no, I'm so sorry.

503
00:34:06,792 --> 00:34:11,567
I was just worried, I guess I shouldn't have said anything.

504
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:15,292
- Why are... 
 - Hey, let's just go.

505
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:22,999
Noeul's Father, join us later.

506
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:25,899
Please, join us.

507
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:31,542
I guess you don't step on cockroaches, you burn them.

508
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:35,042
Did you see her face turn red as she ran away?

509
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:36,417
That felt great!

510
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:39,999
But, Sis, how'd you find out?

511
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:44,717
Someone told me.

512
00:35:08,918 --> 00:35:12,892
Did you meet anyone at the hospital?

513
00:35:13,517 --> 00:35:15,767
No...

514
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:18,399
I think she's looking into your past.

515
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:24,218
 Please give a round of applause for our Berry class!

516
00:35:24,218 --> 00:35:27,642
 Thanks to the parents too!

517
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:49,999
 Now, it's the mothers' turn!

518
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:53,292
So annoying. You're terrible at everything.

519
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:56,618
Take it easy, we're here for the kids.

520
00:35:56,618 --> 00:35:58,999
You know this is a kid's sporting event, right?

521
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:01,899
I had the most difficult position...

522
00:36:01,918 --> 00:36:03,999

523
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:28,899
- Let's go! 
 - Let's go!

524
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,318
Ready.

525
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:43,267
Why aren't you running?

526
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:46,642
...two, three...

527
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:24,567
How did she...

528
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:28,492
She's the athlete of the family.

529
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:30,792
Isn't my mom so cool?

530
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:31,792
She's the best, Jihoo.

531
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:34,192
Best! Best!

532
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:41,999
 Let's go!

533
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,750
 Let's go!

534
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,810
In position, please.

535
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:43,318
Hey!

536
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:58,618
Take photos!

537
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,699
 Blue team wins!

538
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:15,542
Uncle, have some.

539
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:18,899
- The desert is good! 
 - Is it?

540
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,842
Did you cook all this?

541
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:25,290
- It's the best! 
 - Eat some more.

542
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:30,242
Why does Noeul's father spend all his time with them?

543
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:33,999
I think he's friends with Jihoo's uncle.

544
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:38,042
Yeah, there's no way he's interested in Jihoo's mom.

545
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,918
You never know.

546
00:39:39,918 --> 00:39:44,592
What if she's doing her best to seduce him.

547
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:47,792
She can try her best.

548
00:39:47,792 --> 00:39:49,342
He won't be interested in her.

549
00:39:49,342 --> 00:39:51,417
How dare an alcoholic take a shot at him.

550
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:52,692
She's so unsophisticated.

551
00:39:52,692 --> 00:39:55,692
Do you think she used to be a street walker?

552
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:57,999
Did you see all the men look at her body?

553
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:00,599
Wasn't it just your husband?

554
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,542
At least we don't sleep in different rooms like you.

555
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:06,818
You don't need a separate room, he doesn't come home.

556
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:08,167
- Hey! 
 - What?

557
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:09,167
Stop it!

558
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:12,792
If Jihoo's mother and Noeul's father get married...

559
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:16,292
She won't be a renter, then she could join Gold Momvely?

560
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:18,417
Sounds like a nightmare.

561
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:21,417
That's the worst!

562
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:23,999
Hey, don't even mention it.

563
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:25,167
She better not!

564
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:28,417
I'll chase him around everywhere and stop him.

565
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:31,792
Hey, Sis, when is your husband coming back to Korea?

566
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:34,542
I heard his business is flourishing in Dubai.

567
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:36,999
I'm so jealous of you.

568
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:38,167
Me too.

569
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:41,792
Jealous? He just wants to be with the kids.

570
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:45,142
He pesters me to send pics and videos all the time.

571
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:49,999
Take me to Dubai, too.

572
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:57,267
Do you possibly know a cool place?

573
00:40:57,292 --> 00:40:59,642
For my first date with your mom.

574
00:41:03,818 --> 00:41:06,092
Can I go out with her?

575
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:26,518
The ocean!

576
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:30,042
She likes the ocean.

577
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:34,917
But she's never been.

578
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,399
Really?

579
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:45,017
Thank you. For liking my mom.

580
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:48,992
Thank you for accepting me.

581
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:52,017
I'll see you outside.

582
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,990

583
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:27,699
Excuse me... Do you hate me?

584
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:30,292
What?

585
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:36,292
You quit your job here and always evade me.

586
00:42:37,492 --> 00:42:41,718
It's because everyone's watching us.

587
00:42:41,718 --> 00:42:46,417
The Momvelies are looking for a reason to mess with us.

588
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:50,718
If they see us together, they'll come after you.

589
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:55,518
All right, all right. Just go your way.

590
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:58,842
Teacher... Teacher...

591
00:42:59,442 --> 00:43:02,218
Are you mad at me?

592
00:43:02,218 --> 00:43:05,067
I'm not mad.

593
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:09,292
I understand why you're doing this but...

594
00:43:09,292 --> 00:43:12,142
I'm just not used to this.

595
00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:18,742
It's like the Young Prince and the Fox.

596
00:43:18,792 --> 00:43:20,676
Teacher...

597
00:43:20,676 --> 00:43:23,167
You can't say things like that.

598
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:26,899
I'm not a prince. How am I a prince?

599
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:29,042
I understand that you're my fan, but I'm no prince.

600
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:30,899
And you aren't a fox.

601
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,692
Who called you a fox?

602
00:43:32,692 --> 00:43:34,999
No, I'm talking about the French...

603
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:39,709
You're just used to seeing me all the time.

604
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:42,542
And now that I'm gone, it's awkward for you.

605
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:44,799
That's what I've been saying...

606
00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:47,667
You just haven't seen me in a long time.

607
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,142
You'll be fine, once I'm gone again.

608
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:54,318
How do you know?

609
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:57,592
I'm not a prince.

610
00:43:57,592 --> 00:44:00,667
Take it easy! You'll get hurt!

611
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:03,142
Mingi and Jihoo are fighting!

612
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:11,459
- Stop! I said stop! 
 - Jihoo!

613
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:13,334
Stop!

614
00:44:14,876 --> 00:44:18,850
Jihoo! Jihoo! Hey, stop!

615
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,599
Mingi!

616
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:23,250
Mingi, are you okay?

617
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,542
What happened?

618
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:25,999
Open your mouth again!

619
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:28,442
See what happens next time!

620
00:44:28,442 --> 00:44:29,992
Hey!

621
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:32,042
Are you crazy!

622
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:33,942
What's wrong? That's enough!

623
00:44:33,942 --> 00:44:37,092
Sis, Mingi's bleeding.

624
00:44:38,918 --> 00:44:42,817
Hey! This isn't over! I'm coming for you!

625
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:45,767
- Is he okay? 
 - Take him to the hospital...

626
00:44:47,899 --> 00:44:50,099
- You're okay? 
 - Its okay, leave it.

627
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:53,042
Don't be so rough, what if his nose is broken!

628
00:44:53,042 --> 00:44:56,542
I don't think it's that bad, his hand's fine too.

629
00:44:56,542 --> 00:44:58,342
- Better now? 
 - Leave him.

630
00:44:58,342 --> 00:45:01,292
- We called an ambulance. 
 - You did? Good.

631
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:03,499
It's not that bad...

632
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:07,999
What happened? Why did you do that?

633
00:45:07,999 --> 00:45:10,542
What did I just see? He's actually good at fighting.

634
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:14,192
Bam! Bam! Those were good hits...

635
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:19,842
You can't let him get to you.

636
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,417
Let's go, go! You have to apologize.

637
00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:24,017
No.

638
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:27,992
Min Jihoo!

639
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:35,992
Did they seriously call an ambulance over a bloody nose?

640
00:45:39,718 --> 00:45:41,792
I knew this would happen.

641
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:45,542
We should've opened a bullying case when he hit my son.

642
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:46,792
We can now.

643
00:45:46,792 --> 00:45:47,667
Exactly!

644
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:50,542
Does this really constitute as a bullying case?

645
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:53,042
Your husband knows doctors here, right?

646
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,818
Let's get a strong diagnosis.

647
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,999
He does but...

648
00:45:56,999 --> 00:45:59,292
You don't want to?

649
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:01,167
Why wouldn't she want to help!

650
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:03,292
We have to stop them before others get hurt too.

651
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:04,442
Of course, Sis.

652
00:46:04,442 --> 00:46:06,542
It'll happen again if we leave it this way.

653
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:09,842
My husband's a plastic surgeon.

654
00:46:09,842 --> 00:46:11,167
I'll look into it.

655
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:14,392
No, don't bother.

656
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:18,999
Hello, Congressman.

657
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:22,792
We can get rid of the entire family, if we get Jihoo expelled.

658
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:26,567
We won't have to deal with his uncle and mother ever again.

659
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:28,799
It's a win-win.

660
00:46:31,292 --> 00:46:33,467
- 8 weeks? 
 - For a bloody nose?

661
00:46:33,467 --> 00:46:38,392
How can a bloody nose get an 8-week treatment diagnosis?

662
00:46:38,392 --> 00:46:41,218
He can't go to school until the bullying case ends?

663
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:45,917
Mingi's mother requested for Jihoo to be removed.

664
00:46:45,918 --> 00:46:49,667
 I'll mention the shoes and the peanut incident.

665
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:52,317
 But no matter what I say,

666
00:46:52,317 --> 00:46:57,217
if worse comes to worst, he might be asked to transfer.

667
00:46:57,217 --> 00:46:59,718
Forced transfer?

668
00:46:59,718 --> 00:47:01,667
Is there any other way?

669
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:05,992
Focus on apologizing and reaching a written agreement.

670
00:47:05,999 --> 00:47:08,317
Okay.

671
00:47:08,317 --> 00:47:11,017
He can't even go to school?

672
00:47:11,017 --> 00:47:15,942
Let's go! We have to apologize.

673
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,592
- No. 
 - No?

674
00:47:18,592 --> 00:47:22,492
Let's just deal with it.

675
00:47:23,292 --> 00:47:25,292
Why are you so stubborn?

676
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:27,999
What did Mingi say to you?

677
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:31,042
It doesn't matter what he said.

678
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:32,667
You hit him first.

679
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:34,767
Get up, let's go apologize.

680
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:38,217
No, I don't want to!

681
00:47:39,417 --> 00:47:43,918
Min Jihoo! Are you going to disappoint me?

682
00:47:43,918 --> 00:47:46,818
Don't get angry, let's just talk nicely.

683
00:47:46,818 --> 00:47:48,599
Get up now.

684
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:53,167
Will they dismiss the case?

685
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:55,417
Just apologize because you're sorry.

686
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:57,999
We still have to apologize and do our best.

687
00:47:57,999 --> 00:48:02,667
Don't beg. Uncle, don't beg! Mom, you too!

688
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:04,792
Don't beg on my behalf!

689
00:48:04,792 --> 00:48:08,417
Begging is also a way of standing strong.

690
00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:09,999
Did you forget our family plan?

691
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:12,718
Giving up is losing.

692
00:48:12,718 --> 00:48:15,999
What's wrong with losing? You can lose.

693
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:18,692
What's wrong with giving up?

694
00:48:18,692 --> 00:48:22,318
It's too much, I want to give up.

695
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:27,599
You want to move schools?

696
00:48:29,042 --> 00:48:30,842
Let's go.

697
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:34,967
Do you have money?

698
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:38,918
Mrs. Jang helped us get this apartment. I don't have money to move.

699
00:48:38,918 --> 00:48:41,192
Which school would you go to?

700
00:48:41,192 --> 00:48:44,042
We found you a school with a music program.

701
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:49,399
Your uncle did so much so you could stay here. You beat up people and you don't want to apologize, so you want to give up?

702
00:48:50,592 --> 00:48:53,499
You can give up over an apology?

703
00:48:53,499 --> 00:48:58,167
How can you hit someone because they said mean things?

704
00:48:58,167 --> 00:49:00,792
That makes you the same kind of person as your grandmother.

705
00:49:00,792 --> 00:49:03,017
Are you really my son?

706
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:09,167
I guess I'm my father's son.

707
00:49:10,999 --> 00:49:13,042
- What? 
 - Oh okay!

708
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:16,592
Don't say such things to a child!

709
00:49:16,592 --> 00:49:18,592
Go calm down.

710
00:49:18,592 --> 00:49:22,842
You too! Don't be rude to your mother.

711
00:49:22,842 --> 00:49:28,299
Everyone go look at the Happiness Rules.

712
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:31,292
How could you do this to me?

713
00:49:31,292 --> 00:49:35,318
You don't want me anymore? Should I go to dad?

714
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,042
What?

715
00:49:37,042 --> 00:49:40,542
Stop it! Go to your room!

716
00:49:40,542 --> 00:49:42,999
Do 5th graders go through puberty?

717
00:49:42,999 --> 00:49:44,999
Get in your room, you little brat.

718
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:49,542
Do you regret leaving with me?

719
00:49:49,542 --> 00:49:50,999
Just stop.

720
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:53,442
Yeah, I do.

721
00:49:53,442 --> 00:49:58,599
If I didn't exist, you would be happy.

722
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:01,342
Sure.

723
00:50:01,342 --> 00:50:03,918
If you didn't exist I would be, right?

724
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,792
Hey, stop...

725
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:08,999
If you want to leave, go back to your father!

726
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:12,242
Stop that! What're you saying!

727
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:22,767
- Excuse me. 
 - Oh my!

728
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:25,892
Are you crazy?

729
00:50:26,718 --> 00:50:28,792
I waited so long.

730
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,292
Me? Why?

731
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:31,692
We need a way to meet up.

732
00:50:31,692 --> 00:50:34,467
- What're you saying? 
 - Hey, hey.

733
00:50:34,467 --> 00:50:37,999
If you don't help me, I'll tell everyone the truth.

734
00:50:37,999 --> 00:50:40,042
The Momvelies will probably murder you.

735
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:42,692
So annoying. What do you want?

736
00:50:42,692 --> 00:50:45,142
How did he get an 8-week diagnosis?

737
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:47,599
Is Mingi actually hurt?

738
00:50:49,999 --> 00:50:53,117
No, just a nose bleed.

739
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:54,899
I knew it.

740
00:50:54,899 --> 00:50:57,667
Did a doctor help you?

741
00:50:57,667 --> 00:50:59,818
I'm not surprised at all.

742
00:50:59,818 --> 00:51:01,299
Exactly.

743
00:51:01,299 --> 00:51:03,918
You can never beat her.

744
00:51:03,918 --> 00:51:05,099
I have before.

745
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:09,792
She's won't let this go. No one can stop her.

746
00:51:09,792 --> 00:51:12,999
She always controls situations and lies.

747
00:51:12,999 --> 00:51:16,542
She's a professional at making things up and controlling.

748
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:19,234
She's extremely well connected.

749
00:51:19,234 --> 00:51:21,499
Just give up.

750
00:51:21,499 --> 00:51:24,142
I didn't call you over so that you can brag about her.

751
00:51:24,142 --> 00:51:27,499
Give me something to work with; you're my spy!

752
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:33,099
There's only one way.

753
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:34,292
The truth?

754
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:36,292
Are you stupid?

755
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:39,742
You can't beat her with that.

756
00:51:39,742 --> 00:51:41,092
Money?

757
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:44,459
Evidence.

758
00:51:44,459 --> 00:51:50,542
You can only win with hard proof evidence.

759
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:54,850
Is that why you're always recording things?

760
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:58,067
What evidence could there be for this bullying case?

761
00:51:58,067 --> 00:52:00,417
I don't know. Figure it out.

762
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:03,842
- It's Sechan's mom! 
 - Where, where!

763
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,510
Is it not?

764
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,167
Throw it out.

765
00:52:10,918 --> 00:52:13,267
- Thank you. 
 - Yeah.

766
00:52:16,918 --> 00:52:18,999
You still have to study.

767
00:52:18,999 --> 00:52:21,292
Your English teacher will be here at 11:00.

768
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:26,667
This is uncomfortable, I want to go home.

769
00:52:26,667 --> 00:52:28,417
You can tonight.

770
00:52:28,417 --> 00:52:30,999
I have to go home, then see your sister.

771
00:52:30,999 --> 00:52:35,192
Finish all your math homework by then, okay?

772
00:52:44,417 --> 00:52:45,717
 Huh?

773
00:52:47,442 --> 00:52:50,667
 Mingi, I can't contact your sister.

774
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,999
 Can you tell me her new number?

775
00:52:52,999 --> 00:52:54,999
 She doesn't have a phone.

776
00:52:54,999 --> 00:52:57,167
 How do you call her?

777
00:52:57,167 --> 00:52:59,542
 You must call her since she's studying abroad.

778
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:01,167
 Studying abroad?

779
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:03,399
 She didn't leave Kor...

780
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:10,742
 She didn't leave, huh?

781
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:15,567
 Mom told me not to tell anyone.

782
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:47,642
Hey, just tell your uncle. What did Mingi say?

783
00:53:50,042 --> 00:53:52,742
Is your mouth sewn shut?

784
00:53:52,742 --> 00:53:58,099
Yup, it is. This is so frustrating.

785
00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:02,699
Did anyone see the entire situation? This is so frustrating.

786
00:54:11,692 --> 00:54:14,642
Hey, what're you going to do?

787
00:54:14,642 --> 00:54:17,499
She's never been that mad with me before.

788
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:25,967
What happened to the loving mother and loving son?

789
00:54:28,517 --> 00:54:30,242
Stop.

790
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:37,792
Get him, Dad! Get him!

791
00:54:37,792 --> 00:54:39,167
Huh? Yeah.

792
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:41,375
You're at half health. Try harder!

793
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:42,417
I'm doing it.

794
00:54:42,417 --> 00:54:46,501
Die. Die. Why aren't they dying?

795
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:49,118
Did you see Jihoo and Mingi's fight?

796
00:54:49,118 --> 00:54:50,667
Yeah, yeah.

797
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:54,267
You died again, you're really bad.

798
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:56,999
What did Mingi say to Jihoo?

799
00:54:56,999 --> 00:54:59,042
I can't say.

800
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:00,042
Why?

801
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:02,342
Jihoo said so.

802
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:05,418
He said he'd beat anyone up.

803
00:55:05,418 --> 00:55:08,418
He won't find out if you tell me.

804
00:55:08,999 --> 00:55:10,692
But I'll know.

805
00:55:10,692 --> 00:55:13,499
I don't want that on my conscience.

806
00:55:14,342 --> 00:55:18,017
All right, I won't ask.

807
00:55:18,017 --> 00:55:20,917
I guess Jihoo will transfer schools now.

808
00:55:22,417 --> 00:55:24,542
But you know...

809
00:55:25,792 --> 00:55:30,318
He said don't say it, he never said anything about writing.

810
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,910
 The number you have dialed can not be conn—

811
00:56:22,999 --> 00:56:26,267
- Hyeok... 
 - Why are the lights off?

812
00:56:26,267 --> 00:56:28,892
Have you seen Jihoo?

813
00:56:28,892 --> 00:56:31,418
Why? Did he got somewhere?

814
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,717
What's wrong?

815
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:40,792
You think he ran away or something?

816
00:56:43,792 --> 00:56:47,692
- Hyeok, do you think... 
 - What?

817
00:56:47,692 --> 00:56:50,417
He went back to his father?

818
00:56:50,417 --> 00:56:51,942
Back to his grandmother!

819
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:54,318
There's no way he would.

820
00:56:55,267 --> 00:56:57,399
Would he?

821
00:56:58,442 --> 00:56:59,442
Call him!

822
00:56:59,442 --> 00:57:01,042
It's off. What do we do?

823
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:04,667
Why did you push him into a corner!

824
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:07,999
I went too far! What if he actually went back.

825
00:57:07,999 --> 00:57:12,067
Why would he! He wouldn't, right?

826
00:57:12,067 --> 00:57:15,492
Noeul's father might know something.

827
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:27,399
Excuse me, how do I get here?

828
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:30,418
Walk down the big...

829
00:57:32,792 --> 00:57:35,918
There's no way... How do I sneak in?

830
00:57:35,918 --> 00:57:38,892
How do I open this? Think, think...

831
00:57:38,892 --> 00:57:42,699
Open sesame?

832
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:49,730
I'll go in and take a peak.

833
00:57:50,542 --> 00:57:53,867
What? Another door?

834
00:57:57,042 --> 00:58:00,492
Hello? Who is this?

835
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:03,542
Who? Min Jihoo!

836
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:05,118
Where are you?

837
00:58:05,118 --> 00:58:07,792
Think whatever you want, Mom.

838
00:58:07,792 --> 00:58:08,999
Stay right there, I'll come and get you.

839
00:58:08,999 --> 00:58:12,375
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

840
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:14,492
I'm really smart.

841
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:22,742
What? Who's there?

842
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:31,342
Who could it be?

843
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:33,467
Wang Joonhyeok?

844
00:58:37,792 --> 00:58:39,499
It's you, right?

845
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:54,817
So stressful!

846
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:14,292
Let's get out together.

847
00:59:18,317 --> 00:59:19,709
Have you seen...

848
00:59:19,709 --> 00:59:22,642
Welcome. He's sleeping over there.

849
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:29,892
You found him? Where?

850
00:59:32,999 --> 00:59:35,867
Okay, hurry over.

851
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:46,792
Yes, Noeul's father.

852
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,199
No, I called you.

853
00:59:52,317 --> 00:59:55,842
Sorry, Jihoo was missing.

854
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,367
We found him.

855
00:59:57,367 --> 01:00:01,499
 Noeul has a video, you should probably see it.

856
01:00:02,718 --> 01:00:08,942
 Hey, your mom and Noeul's dad are dating?

857
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:13,592
 The moms would love to hear this, I'm going to tell them.

858
01:00:13,592 --> 01:00:16,867
 Don't, just don't.

859
01:00:16,918 --> 01:00:18,499
 Piss off.

860
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:21,542
 A pathetic alcoholic?

861
01:00:21,542 --> 01:00:25,499
 Trying to get married to a rich guy and move out of rentals?

862
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:30,092
 Your mom's a determined gold digger, huh?

863
01:00:32,167 --> 01:00:34,417
 Don't talk about my mother like that!

864
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:36,999
 Don't get in the way of my mother's happiness!

865
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:38,600
 What are you doing Mingi?

866
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:42,292
 - Stop! I said stop! 
 - Jihoo!

867
01:00:42,292 --> 01:00:44,334
 Stop!

868
01:00:45,918 --> 01:00:48,125
 Jihoo! What are you doing?

869
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:49,584
 Mingi, are you okay?

870
01:00:49,584 --> 01:00:50,999
 Open your mouth again!

871
01:00:50,999 --> 01:00:53,992
 See what happens next time!

872
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:16,217
I'm sorry, Mom. I messed up.

873
01:01:17,567 --> 01:01:20,842
You broke your piggy bank to buy an apple?

874
01:01:34,999 --> 01:01:40,399
Uncle made fun of you because you don't have a bag.

875
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:57,392
- Your change. 
 - Thank you.

876
01:02:05,792 --> 01:02:08,367
- Thank you. 
 - Goodbye.

877
01:02:08,367 --> 01:02:13,417
He ran out of money and couldn't get on a bus back.

878
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:18,567
His phone ran out of batteries, so he used the fruit shop's.

879
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:22,242
He didn't run away. Don't be mad.

880
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:28,242
She doesn't like it.

881
01:02:28,292 --> 01:02:30,334
No, she loves it.

882
01:02:33,999 --> 01:02:36,799
I looked it up on the internet.

883
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:42,817
It said a bag is the best way to make a woman feel better.

884
01:02:44,192 --> 01:02:47,017
Just forgive him already.

885
01:02:47,999 --> 01:02:49,899
I didn't ask for this.

886
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:52,418
Come on, stop!

887
01:02:52,999 --> 01:02:58,817
I don't need any of this, I just want you to behave.

888
01:03:00,417 --> 01:03:05,192
I don't have to go back to grandmother?

889
01:03:05,999 --> 01:03:07,917
You're not going anywhere!

890
01:03:08,999 --> 01:03:10,892
I don't want to go.

891
01:03:11,999 --> 01:03:15,892
You can't! I'll never let you go.

892
01:03:16,892 --> 01:03:19,726
Really? You promise?

893
01:03:19,726 --> 01:03:22,918
Never! I can't live without you!

894
01:03:22,918 --> 01:03:27,792
Really? That was a quick change of mood...

895
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:31,167
I'm cringing. Sort of annoyed.

896
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:34,292
Mom, I'm sorry.

897
01:03:34,292 --> 01:03:37,417
I'll go and apologize to Mingi.

898
01:03:37,417 --> 01:03:39,192
Don't apologize. You did nothing wrong.

899
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:42,067
I'm not going to let them do this to you!

900
01:03:42,067 --> 01:03:44,217
I'm sorry.

901
01:03:44,217 --> 01:03:46,499
You rode the bus alone?

902
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:49,792
I'm so proud.

903
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:53,342
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's okay.

904
01:03:53,342 --> 01:03:57,917
Dad lives close to the hospital, but he doesn't even visit.

905
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:02,392
Even if you divorced, he's still my dad...

906
01:04:03,999 --> 01:04:06,918
You're not really hurt.

907
01:04:06,918 --> 01:04:09,992
He even came to your birthday party.

908
01:04:11,918 --> 01:04:14,517
You have to speak well for the bullying case.

909
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:18,542
If they mention the peanuts or shoes, just say you don't know.

910
01:04:18,542 --> 01:04:23,799
They don't have CCTV evidence anymore, just lie about it.

911
01:04:23,799 --> 01:04:28,467
Aren't you curious as to why I did all that to Jihoo?

912
01:04:30,999 --> 01:04:33,217
Why did you?

913
01:04:33,217 --> 01:04:35,392
He annoys me.

914
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:37,967
He might get a new father.

915
01:04:39,999 --> 01:04:44,042
He already has an uncle that comes to his rescue.

916
01:04:44,042 --> 01:04:46,292
So annoying.

917
01:04:50,999 --> 01:04:53,767
You have the Momvelie aunties.

918
01:04:53,792 --> 01:04:58,467
Them? They're not on your side.

919
01:04:58,467 --> 01:05:01,876
That's why you keep secrets from them.

920
01:05:01,876 --> 01:05:04,817
Secrets about dad and my sister.

921
01:05:10,042 --> 01:05:13,518
Let me get you some food.

922
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,317
Have some treats.

923
01:05:27,317 --> 01:05:29,592
I'll be right back.

924
01:05:43,999 --> 01:05:47,992
Chaeyoung, it's me. Let's talk.

925
01:05:58,692 --> 01:06:00,192
Chaeyoung.

926
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:02,992
How'd you find me?

927
01:06:02,999 --> 01:06:04,792
Why are you here?

928
01:06:04,792 --> 01:06:08,042
Why'd you change your number? Why'd you quit school?

929
01:06:08,042 --> 01:06:10,042
I've been looking all over for you!

930
01:06:10,042 --> 01:06:12,342
How dare you look for me!

931
01:06:12,417 --> 01:06:15,742
You left because I got pregnant!

932
01:06:15,742 --> 01:06:16,542
What?

933
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:17,918
Why'd you come?

934
01:06:17,918 --> 01:06:21,042
You want to threaten me too? You piece of trash.

935
01:06:22,818 --> 01:06:25,317
What did you just say?

936
01:06:25,317 --> 01:06:27,699
Pregnant?

937
01:06:27,699 --> 01:06:29,299
What?

938
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:33,792
Acting like you don't know?

939
01:06:34,999 --> 01:06:36,842
How could I know?

940
01:06:36,842 --> 01:06:38,692
You never told me, how could I know?

941
01:06:38,692 --> 01:06:40,792
My mother told you.

942
01:06:40,792 --> 01:06:43,699
This is the first time of hearing of it.

943
01:06:47,999 --> 01:06:51,792
Our baby is in your belly right now?

944
01:06:51,792 --> 01:06:55,442
What? What're you saying?

945
01:06:55,442 --> 01:07:00,117
You wanted me to erase him!

946
01:07:03,292 --> 01:07:07,818
Feeling sick? Is she laying down?

947
01:07:07,818 --> 01:07:10,992
I'm really busy today.

948
01:07:11,042 --> 01:07:15,242
I'll go as soon as I can.

949
01:07:15,918 --> 01:07:20,417
Don't worry! You have me and your mother.

950
01:07:20,417 --> 01:07:23,999
We will be victorious today!

951
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:28,899
Why? We have Noeul's phone. Undeniable evidence!

952
01:07:28,899 --> 01:07:31,042
Don't worry about anything.

953
01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:33,067
You have it? Her phone?

954
01:07:37,292 --> 01:07:39,567
Why did you give it to uncle?

955
01:07:39,567 --> 01:07:40,999
Oh no.

956
01:07:40,999 --> 01:07:44,017
He said it was important, that he'd protect it.

957
01:07:44,667 --> 01:07:47,667
Wait, wait.

958
01:07:49,442 --> 01:07:51,159
We're late.

959
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,118
Why?

960
01:07:55,542 --> 01:07:59,718
I have to poop.
Just go ahead without me.

961
01:07:59,718 --> 01:08:02,318
I can't hold it. Just go.

962
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:06,718
Oh god, what do I do?

963
01:08:07,918 --> 01:08:12,217
Please turn on, please.

964
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:19,167
Excuse me.

965
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:21,999
Water got into it,
I need you to get the data out of it!

966
01:08:21,999 --> 01:08:23,542
You can't? Okay, sorry!

967
01:08:23,542 --> 01:08:27,292
Service center? Okay! Water, water got into it...

968
01:08:27,292 --> 01:08:32,918
Taxi! I have to get to a service center! Please!

969
01:08:32,918 --> 01:08:35,017
To the service center!

970
01:08:43,999 --> 01:08:47,518
Like mother like son.

971
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:49,692
Don't give them attention.

972
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:52,042
Weren't you just on your knees recently?

973
01:08:52,042 --> 01:08:54,692
I heard you didn't even apologize to Mingi.

974
01:08:54,692 --> 01:08:56,799
Prepared for a forced transfer?

975
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:00,018
Let me say farewell in advance. Goodbye.

976
01:09:00,018 --> 01:09:02,999
You should raise your child properly.

977
01:09:02,999 --> 01:09:05,667
The son of an alcoholic single mother and renter.

978
01:09:05,667 --> 01:09:09,192
That's who they'll blame if your son lives like that.

979
01:09:09,799 --> 01:09:13,318
Go over there with Noeul and her dad.

980
01:09:16,042 --> 01:09:20,650
What? How dare you? Do you have something to say?

981
01:09:22,542 --> 01:09:24,442
It's too late for apologies.

982
01:09:24,442 --> 01:09:27,142
I'm not going to apologize.

983
01:09:27,142 --> 01:09:30,818
Yeah, I'm divorced.

984
01:09:30,818 --> 01:09:35,192
I do live in a rental, and I was an alcoholic. Facts.

985
01:09:35,192 --> 01:09:38,992
Say whatever you want. I really don't care but...

986
01:09:38,999 --> 01:09:41,867
Don't mess with my kid.

987
01:09:41,867 --> 01:09:44,817
My son is growing up to be a fine young man.

988
01:09:44,817 --> 01:09:46,592
You should all be ashamed.

989
01:09:46,592 --> 01:09:50,717
You lie and steal, causing harm to others.

990
01:09:50,717 --> 01:09:53,692
Your children do exactly as you do. They learned from you.

991
01:09:53,692 --> 01:09:57,292
Now that you're forced to move, you have nothing to lose?

992
01:09:57,292 --> 01:09:59,417
How dare you speak to us like that!

993
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:01,967
Please, stop now.

994
01:10:01,967 --> 01:10:04,417
Why are you here?

995
01:10:04,417 --> 01:10:06,167
Noeul will stand as a witness.

996
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:07,942
What witness?

997
01:10:07,942 --> 01:10:10,567
Noeul do you have something to say?

998
01:10:10,567 --> 01:10:14,292
Mingi ordering Sechan to steal Ji-hoo's shoes.

999
01:10:14,292 --> 01:10:19,317
Spraying water on his pants and attempted murder with peanuts.

1000
01:10:19,317 --> 01:10:22,209
Mingi hit Ji-hoo first,

1001
01:10:22,209 --> 01:10:25,017
then constantly insulted his mother.

1002
01:10:27,567 --> 01:10:31,292
Noeul's father, I suggest you stop your daughter.

1003
01:10:31,999 --> 01:10:34,167
You know rumors are spreading in our neighborhood?

1004
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:38,192
Nothing good will come if you take a renter's side.

1005
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:40,942
What's there to lose?

1006
01:10:40,942 --> 01:10:44,199
I'm not taking a renter's side, I'm taking Jihoo's side.

1007
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:45,142
What?

1008
01:10:45,142 --> 01:10:48,399
I don't want him to move schools, or his family to move.

1009
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:50,899
I'm doing my best to look cool in front of Jihoo.

1010
01:10:50,899 --> 01:10:56,917
I am very attracted to Jihoo's mother.

1011
01:11:00,792 --> 01:11:02,999
What the hell did I just hear?

1012
01:11:02,999 --> 01:11:07,867
From now on, please watch your mouth when speaking to her.

1013
01:11:07,867 --> 01:11:11,042
It's really pissing me off.

1014
01:11:11,042 --> 01:11:13,092
No way!

1015
01:11:20,899 --> 01:11:23,292
Where can she even go?

1016
01:11:23,292 --> 01:11:26,192
Look around, I'll be right there!

1017
01:11:26,192 --> 01:11:28,667
You can't leave, I just fixed this.

1018
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:31,967
The case is about to begin, let's go inside.

1019
01:11:45,899 --> 01:11:47,442
Wait!

1020
01:11:47,442 --> 01:11:49,283
Isn't that the robber kid?

1021
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:54,092
Did you meet her? Did you meet my daughter!

1022
01:11:57,584 --> 01:12:00,292
He has a knife! Careful! Be careful!

1023
01:12:00,292 --> 01:12:03,842
What are you doing? Stop this, at once!

1024
01:12:03,842 --> 01:12:07,225
I'm going to cut your tongue out, so you can't lie anymore!

1025
01:12:07,225 --> 01:12:09,000
Hey, stop! This is dangerous!

1026
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,375
Stop that!

1027
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:12,876
How could you do that to your daughter? It's all your fault!

1028
01:12:12,876 --> 01:12:15,834
You ruined Chaeyoung's and my relationship!

1029
01:12:15,834 --> 01:12:18,751
Why is that my fault? It's all your fault!

1030
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:21,401
Stop talking!

1031
01:12:21,401 --> 01:12:24,525
You too! Put the knife down!

1032
01:12:24,525 --> 01:12:26,492
Are you okay?

1033
01:12:26,492 --> 01:12:28,799
You're the devil!

1034
01:12:53,751 --> 01:12:57,399
I have to get to school.

1035
01:13:01,275 --> 01:13:06,251
The kids are waiting for me...

1036
01:13:13,501 --> 01:13:15,251
What do I do...

1037
01:13:19,225 --> 01:13:20,750
Hey!

1038
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:24,001
Please call 911.

1039
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:45,630

1040
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:49,410

1041
01:14:49,417 --> 01:14:51,918
 Just a sad life of hardship and debt.

1042
01:14:51,918 --> 01:14:54,375
 Never having the chance to get married.

1043
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:56,751
 He tried to stab me but someone else got hurt.

1044
01:14:56,751 --> 01:14:57,759
 It's all lies!

1045
01:14:57,759 --> 01:15:01,600
 It turns out the culprit was the son of a security guard here.

1046
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,575
 The person who was stabbed was Jihoo's uncle.

1047
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:07,526
 So take some rest, and wake up tomorrow.

1048
01:15:07,526 --> 01:15:10,250
 Now that he's hospitalized, you won't even visit?

1049
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:11,334
 Are you trash?

1050
01:15:11,334 --> 01:15:14,401
 I want to go and it's driving me crazy!

1051
01:15:14,401 --> 01:15:16,317
 Why'd you avoid him?

1052
01:15:16,317 --> 01:15:19,099
 He might take Jihoo away.

1053
01:15:19,099 --> 01:15:22,892
 We're always terrified of getting caught.

1054
01:15:23,384 --> 01:15:26,950
 Find him before the police get him!

1055
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:29,792
 - Oh? 
 - Do you live here?

1056
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:32,899
 Destroy all the files.

1057
01:15:32,899 --> 01:15:35,192
 No one can find out about this.

1058
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:44,370

1059
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:49,890
