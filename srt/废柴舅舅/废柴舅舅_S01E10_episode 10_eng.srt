1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,530

2
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:11,501

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,709

4
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:22,100

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,567

6
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:33,584

7
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:37,992

8
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,080

9
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:49,959

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,930
 Jihoo!

11
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,160

12
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:20,959
Hey! Somebody help us!

13
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,534

He's unconscious! 
 Help us!

14
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:24,667
He's unconscious...

15
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,667
He has food allergies.

16
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:28,292
Kiwi and nut allergies...

17
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:30,292
I didn't see what he ate.

18
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:32,792
I don't know what he ate.

19
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:36,167
- Min Jihoo... 
 - Yes Jihoo...

20
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:38,334
What'll happen?

21
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,542
- Shock by alcohol! 
 - He had alcoholic chocolate.

22
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:42,292
To the treatment room!

23
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:45,442
- Will he be okay? 
 - Prepare epinephrine!

24
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:48,290
What? Really?

25
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,850
He's hospitalized?

26
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:54,999
Yes, Diamond.

27
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,918
I should be on my way.

28
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:02,417
Jihoo, what happened?

29
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:08,567
- Hyeok, what happened? 
 - Well, I... It's alcohol-induced anaphylaxis.

30
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:10,767
Alcohol?

31
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:14,642
He had alcoholic chocolates...

32
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:15,999
Oh my...

33
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:18,067
I'm so sorry. It's my fault.

34
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:19,918
Please calm down.

35
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:22,992
Will he really be okay? Is Jihoo going to be all right?

36
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:25,467
Lucky, it's not life-threatening anymore.

37
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:28,417
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much.

38
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,999
Thank his father for moving fast.

39
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:34,918
Your child is fine, we should take care of your foot.

40
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:36,918
I'm okay.

41
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:39,117
Thank you, Doctor.

42
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:47,042
I'm so sorry.

43
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,667
I'm sorry, I should have paid attention.

44
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:54,818
Since he's okay, I'll get back to work.

45
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:57,067
Let's go, Teacher.

46
00:02:57,692 --> 00:02:59,317
Thank you.

47
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:06,899
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry...

48
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:11,242
He'll be okay. Go get your foot checked out.

49
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:12,417
Am I crazy?

50
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:14,999
I promised to protect him, and I do this?

51
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:18,592
Don't think to much into it.

52
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:21,542
Jihoo?

53
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:22,999
Jihoo, you're awake?

54
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:25,942
- Jihoo, open your eyes. 
 - Jihoo?

55
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:31,792
If you give me 100 wishes.

56
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:38,350
I'll give you a thousand, no a million. Just wake up.

57
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:40,667
Jihoo, please.

58
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:41,792
Mom...

59
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:45,918
I told you not to eat anything.

60
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:51,117
I'm sorry, seriously.

61
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,692
How do you feel?

62
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,067
It's over.

63
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:59,292
Uncle.

64
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:05,067
Really?

65
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,599
What do I...

66
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,167
It was my fault.

67
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:17,392
I'm fine, grandmother.

68
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:22,342
Mom and Uncle did nothing wrong!

69
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:31,292
These things happen while raising a child.

70
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:35,642
Jihoo, did you leave your phone at the bar?

71
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:39,718
I found out through your friends who were texting you.

72
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:42,160
The Momvelies were gossiping,

73
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,960
they told me everything.

74
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:49,718
Don't look bad in the neighborhood.

75
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:53,117
Don't let anyone speak badly of you.

76
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:58,267
Since Jihoo is okay, I'll be leaving.

77
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:11,299
But...

78
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:15,518
Who gave you the chocolate?

79
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:21,099
I ruined your party.

80
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:24,067
That's not important. You are.

81
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:27,592
I want a piggyback.

82
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:29,318
Get on.

83
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,667
You've got 99 wishes left.

84
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:43,267
- You know I'm sorry, right? 
 - I know.

85
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:47,999
Get off!  Your foot is hurt.

86
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:50,117
- Jihoo. 
 - All right.

87
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:57,599
His grandmother paid for the bills.

88
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,067
Yeah?

89
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:04,918
She even spoke with the hospital chief.

90
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:07,899
I think she's changed.

91
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:12,267
People don't change. She's just acting in front of others.

92
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:14,999
She doesn't want negative press.

93
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,799
Thank God she got into politics.

94
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:23,442
If it wasn't for that, she would have ruined us.

95
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:24,992
Yeah...

96
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,567
Is he all right?

97
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:40,042
He's fine. It's happened before.

98
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:43,467
You got him treated fast.

99
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:47,617
I was terrified when his eyes rolled back.

100
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:50,892
I bet you were.

101
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:57,267
I tried so hard... to keep an eye on him.

102
00:06:57,942 --> 00:07:00,899
It's okay, Hyeok.

103
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:02,518
Hey...

104
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,767
Yeah?

105
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:10,299
Forget it. Get some rest.

106
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:12,099
Go sleep.

107
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:16,418
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:29,999
 He killed his wife for insurance money.

109
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:32,592
 - Insurance... 
 - Insurance is a popular gift.

110
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:36,867
 You're his next target. He approached you with bad intentions.

111
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,899

112
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:44,042
 When you signed up for our insurance,

113
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:47,042
 it states that your son is the only beneficiary.

114
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:50,818
 Unless you change these terms, even if you're married,

115
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:53,542
 your husband is not entitled to any of the money.

116
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,217
Right...

117
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:01,999
 But since your son is a minor, if something were to happen,

118
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:05,842
 as a legal guardian, he is entitled to take everything.

119
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:14,817
 After a year together, I can legally become Jihoo's father.

120
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:17,492
All right, thank you.

121
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,167
You came?

122
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:25,767
I heard about Jihoo in the morning.

123
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:31,017
Let's eat. It's your break time, right?

124
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,299
What should we eat? Tell me what you like.

125
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:40,842
- Anything. 
 - That's the hardest answer.

126
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:46,099
 He's suspicious. He's handsome, smart, and wealthy.

127
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:49,799
 Out of all the women, why you?

128
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,042
Let's go shop for necessities on the weekend.

129
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:58,042
I have a question.

130
00:08:58,042 --> 00:08:59,717
Sure.

131
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:07,842
How did Noeul's mother die?

132
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:16,467
- If you don't want to... 
 - A car accident.

133
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,870
It was my fault.

134
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,292
I caused the accident.

135
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:28,092
I...

136
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,942
I wasn't paying attention.

137
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:43,918
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's okay.

138
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,117
I wanted to tell you.

139
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:48,542
Anything else?

140
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,599
No.

141
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,799
You can eat all of this?

142
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,999
Now I'm scared to feed you.

143
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:13,417
- Ah... 
 - Should I chew it first?

144
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:15,400
Nope! Ah...

145
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,542
77... Chew it well.

146
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:22,367
Eat comfortably. I don't need the 100 wishes.

147
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:27,942
No, this is a promise I made to myself.

148
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:29,042
Oh, right.

149
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:33,542
Hey. Sechan's mother called. Acting like your friend.

150
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:38,392
Sechan is really nice to me these days, why?

151
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:40,899
Grandmother told her to.

152
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:42,042
To what?

153
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:46,799
If she fixes our relationship, her poll numbers will rise.

154
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,542
They always have an angle.

155
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,542
- Who told you that? 
 - Sodam's mom.

156
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,667
She isn't a Momvely anymore. How does she know?

157
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:57,999
- Hajoon's mother tells her everything. 
 - Who's that?

158
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:02,260
Soorin's mom. Hajoon and Soorin are siblings.

159
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:07,199
You sound like a neighborhood native now.

160
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:11,417
Once you move to Noeul's home, you can sign up to be a Momvely.

161
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:15,017
- Yeah! You should be the Diamond! 
 - Right!

162
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:19,999
- Hey, Hyeok? 
 - Yeah?

163
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:26,042
How much do you trust Noeul's father?

164
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:28,500
How much do I believe?

165
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,899
I trust him more than myself.

166
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,518
Why Mom?

167
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:39,999
What's wrong?

168
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,634
You have the marriage blues?

169
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:45,842
- Depression before marriage? 
 - It's not that.

170
00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:48,199
Ever since we moved here.

171
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:50,899
We couldn't have done anything without Big Brother.

172
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:53,542
He had our backs when everything looked down on us.

173
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:57,692
Whenever we needed help, he was the first one to come.

174
00:11:57,692 --> 00:12:00,092
Who even does that?

175
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:11,809
 No one believes me in here.

176
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:13,699
 I trust you.

177
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:22,076

178
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:24,867
Are you seriously okay?

179
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:28,899
Yes, sorry for the worry.

180
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:31,999
It's so strange.

181
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:35,183
Everyone at the party was on our side.

182
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:38,067
I can't believe the CCTV broke down that day.

183
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:43,217
Who would've given you that chocolate?

184
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:48,499
- I'm sure it was an accident. 
 - Right?

185
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:53,042
What are they doing?

186
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:54,792
Press conference simulation.

187
00:12:54,792 --> 00:13:00,517
It's been so long since we've seen you, how have you been?

188
00:13:00,517 --> 00:13:01,999
It feels too real.

189
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,042
You're making me nervous.

190
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,999
Focus.

191
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:08,667
How have you been?

192
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:14,999
A special person in my life supported me and gave me courage.

193
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:21,209
My loving nephew, I'm grateful for helping me come back.

194
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:23,342
Yay.

195
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:28,699
- Your nephew? 
 - Yes, that's all.

196
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,518
There's another person.

197
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:34,292
Someone who stayed by my side,

198
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:39,999
my #1 fan J. Queen. Thank you for everything.

199
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:42,292
My appreciation!

200
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:43,042
Tada!

201
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:45,092
- Oh my! 
 - Tada!

202
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:48,092
You might not like it.

203
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:52,792
There's a saying, "I just found it somewhere."

204
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:56,817
It's pretty, help me put it on.

205
00:13:56,817 --> 00:14:00,699
How beautifully disgusting they are.

206
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:02,317
Now...

207
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:10,042
Congressman Hwang is a strong opponent; violence, molesting...

208
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:13,167
Everything was exposed yet his numbers are still strong.

209
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:16,642
Our numbers are dwindling.

210
00:14:16,642 --> 00:14:19,567
Mrs. President asked you for a favor.

211
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,899
How's it going with Jihoo's mother?

212
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,667
Is it even possible? Did you see Jihoo's reaction?

213
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:28,417
He's deeply scarred and traumatized.

214
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:32,167
We said that we would do everything to help.

215
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:36,417
Shouldn't we at least act like we're trying to fix their relationship?

216
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:40,292
- I'm on it. 
 - What? What'd you do?

217
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:42,442
Asking Sechan to befriend Jihoo?

218
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:46,792
What do you want me to do? Get down on my knees?

219
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:51,567
When are you moving? Should I help with the interior?

220
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:55,467
It's nothing fancy like that, I'm just moving in.

221
00:14:55,467 --> 00:14:57,992
You must be so happy.

222
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:00,767
I'm jealous.

223
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:04,892
But how'd you find out?

224
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:07,417
We haven't told anyone about it yet.

225
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:10,667
Noeul bragged to Sodam.

226
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,042
She said she had a mom now.

227
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,092
I'm sorry I didn't tell you but...

228
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:23,192
- Can you keep it a secret? 
 - I don't have anyone to tell.

229
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:26,318
I'm good at this, huh? I could work here, too?

230
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,799
Welcome.

231
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,542
- Huh? 
 - What?

232
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:32,692
Why're you here?

233
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:34,918
None of your business, I'll do what I want.

234
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:37,251
- Who are you? 
 - Whatever.

235
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:41,542
How's Jihoo? I heard he was hospitalized.

236
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,792
Why'd you tell his grandmother about it?

237
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:49,367
I thought that she deserved to know.

238
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:54,999
The great Diamond is now like a human CCTV.

239
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:57,542
- Let's come back next time. 
 - Yeah.

240
00:15:57,542 --> 00:16:00,776
Let go. No.

241
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:05,200
Hey, Jihoo's mother! Let me be clear.

242
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,542
Mend your relationship with Mrs. President.

243
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:10,042
What's good is good.

244
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:13,417
Although you're divorced, who says you can't get along.

245
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:19,992
It'll help her poll numbers. What's good for her is good for your son.

246
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:24,999
It was just a couple of smacks. What's the big deal?

247
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:27,999
- What? 
 - You don't know anything.

248
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:32,092
- That was uncalled for. 
 - Let's just leave.

249
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:38,299
It's a bit ignorant for a mother to divorce over something so small.

250
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:40,299
Something small?

251
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,092
A couple of smacks?

252
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:47,242
- Jihoo's mom... 
 - You!

253
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:51,142
Remember committing perjury against me?

254
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,818
I forgave you for Sechan.

255
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:59,199
If you don't mind your own business, I'll make you regret it. Got it?

256
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,999
Let's go.

257
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:22,542
The poll numbers haven't changed much.

258
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,742
Mrs. President.

259
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:27,967
The changes in numbers don't show that quickly.

260
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:32,592
Hwang is basically committing political suicide. Why don't we wait?

261
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:36,642
- You call it political suicide? 
 - What?

262
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:43,392
You haven't helped with Jihoo's mother either.

263
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:46,250
Your member numbers are still low...

264
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:54,367
Right... I will do my very best to...

265
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:02,692
I'm busy preparing for the showcase, you're moving right after...

266
00:18:02,692 --> 00:18:05,867
We've only got today.

267
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,899
Let's finish the 73 wishes today.

268
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:10,492
I don't need them.

269
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:12,792
How could I do that to a future super star?

270
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,667
Which is exactly why...

271
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:17,918
It's now or never. You'll never get another chance.

272
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:19,142
Just say it.

273
00:18:19,142 --> 00:18:20,709
I'll do anything.

274
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:26,334
Detox juice.

275
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,300
- Remember what you said before? 
 - What?

276
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,250
Do you really want to do a duet with me when I'm older?

277
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,799
- You said you didn't want to. 
 - No, I didn't.

278
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:48,125
You want to do it now?

279
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,876
It sounds fun.

280
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:54,999
- Just grow up faster then. 
 - I want to be like you.

281
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:56,651
What're you saying?

282
00:18:56,651 --> 00:19:02,375
Watching you record and stuff. You kind of looked cool.

283
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,999
You've been away for 10 years, yet you still have fans.

284
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:08,350
Hey! Just wait.

285
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,651
In the future when you say J. King is your uncle?

286
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:14,375
Everyone will be so jealous, and your ego will be in the sky.

287
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,999
How do you like this stuff? You're a strange kid.

288
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:22,250
- It's not for me. 
 - Then?

289
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,401
For me?

290
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:28,899
Drink it on an empty stomach, it'll be good for your skin.

291
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:31,999
Why are you using your wishes on me?

292
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:34,292
What's yours is mine.

293
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:41,175
- Drink up. 
 - Yes, sir. I accept your orders.

294
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:50,501
It isn't a wish for me.

295
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:52,899
Prepare another one.

296
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:56,125
- I'll use all the wishes on it. 
 - Really?

297
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,475
No wait, once you're famous...

298
00:19:58,475 --> 00:20:03,725
Let me hold on to 5 wishes for when you're successful.

299
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:05,301
You got a deal!

300
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:06,999
Try it, it tastes healthy.

301
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:09,167
- Is it good? 
 - Of course.

302
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,134
Drink up!

303
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:17,999
Somethings missing. It's missing an ingredient.

304
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:45,400
Is this a surprise?

305
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:51,700
I have to show you something.

306
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:55,800
Why are you so serious?

307
00:21:01,918 --> 00:21:04,083

308
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,801

309
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:10,925
What's... Where'd you get this?

310
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:16,899
Someone gave it to me.

311
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:19,600
They said you were a murderer.

312
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:25,300
That you killed Noeul's mother.

313
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,476
For the insurance money.

314
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,976
And that...

315
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,576
I was your next target...

316
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:39,801
So I called the insurance company.

317
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,575
Joonhee...

318
00:21:42,575 --> 00:21:49,151
If we were married, you'd be eligible for the money.

319
00:21:52,626 --> 00:22:00,876
- It's a misunderstanding. 
 - I thought so, too.

320
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:02,499
And...

321
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:12,299
When you spoke of the accident, your eyes looked sad.

322
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,826
I regret doubting and being suspicious of you.

323
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:22,251
I never took you for a person capable of that.

324
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:25,751
I trusted you.

325
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:30,301
Then...

326
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,999
I received this...

327
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,501
At first, I thought it was a trap. I didn't want to believe it.

328
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:42,799
But...

329
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,501
I looked it up, and it's a real article.

330
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:54,751
"Accused of murdering his wife for a billion won,

331
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:57,875
cartoonist Mr. A, was sent to court.

332
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:04,501
The police...

333
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:09,751
stated that he had a motive for murder since she cheated.

334
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:13,000
He was charged with murder."

335
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,209
Why aren't you saying anything?

336
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:29,817
Why aren't you denying this?

337
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:35,875
Explain so I can understand.

338
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:40,299
It's all in the article.

339
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,775
You said it was an accident.

340
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:54,999
Was it not?

341
00:23:57,626 --> 00:23:59,176
That day...

342
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:03,775
The day Noeul's mother died...

343
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,050
I went to find her...

344
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,601
Noeul was with me.

345
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:17,675
 Excuse me.

346
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,375
 - Get in. 
 - Let go. Let go!

347
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,976
 I said get in!

348
00:24:24,976 --> 00:24:28,250
 Are you insane? Just stop this.

349
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,651
 Think of your daughter.

350
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:34,400
 She's going to school next year. She needs a mother.

351
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,209
 She has her life, I have mine.

352
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:41,151
 Before I was a mom, I am a woman!

353
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:43,450
 Lower your voice! She'll hear you!

354
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,292
 Why'd you bring her here?

355
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:47,001
 Let's talk somewhere else.

356
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,850
 Stop the car.

357
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,800
 Let's talk.

358
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,499
 I said stop the car!

359
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:02,751
 Let me out!

360
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,876
 What're you doing? Stop it.

361
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:06,751
 - Let me out! 
 - Stop!

362
00:25:06,751 --> 00:25:09,626
 - You want to die? 
 - Yeah, let's just die then!

363
00:25:09,626 --> 00:25:11,999
 If you don't let me go, let's just die together!

364
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:13,999
 Why should we? What did Noeul do wrong?

365
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:16,499
 If you want to die, die by yourself!

366
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:35,626
 - How shameless. 
 - He might hear you!

367
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:36,959
 Let him hear me.

368
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:39,976
 How could he be so shameless?

369
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,375
 Her dad killed her mom.

370
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,675
 - Really? 
 - Really?

371
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:46,542
 Don't play with her, she's scary.

372
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:49,501
From that day on.

373
00:25:49,501 --> 00:25:53,150
Noeul began obsessing over...

374
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,125
death and accidents.

375
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:59,299
She acts like it doesn't bother her.

376
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:05,176
As if running away, we secretly moved to this neighborhood.

377
00:26:05,851 --> 00:26:11,051
Like when you and Jihoo moved here.

378
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,999
We tried our best to hide everything.

379
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:17,926
It was to protect Noeul.

380
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:20,700
I couldn't tell anyone.

381
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:23,700
If they knew...

382
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,399
I know how they'd react.

383
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:35,470
You looked as hurt as me.

384
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,375
You had many secrets like me.

385
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:44,330
That's why I was attracted to you...

386
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:47,176
and wanted to protect you.

387
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:54,310
My feelings towards you...

388
00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:57,799
are all genuine.

389
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:06,800
Just tell me one thing.

390
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:12,299
Was it on purpose?

391
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:18,775
Did you turn your steering wheel?

392
00:27:19,676 --> 00:27:21,950
Did you intend to kill her?

393
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,040
Answer me. You said it was an accident.

394
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:38,325
Just say it was. I'll believe what ever you say.

395
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:41,151
I really want to but...

396
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,720
to be honest, I don't know.

397
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:51,726
If I admit to murder, Noeul would be alone.

398
00:27:51,726 --> 00:27:55,150
The thought of that got me through the trial.

399
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,976
I kept saying to myself that it was an accident.

400
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,301
It wasn't on purpose.

401
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:04,510
But... deep down.

402
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,640
...deep down, perhaps...

403
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,800
The thought of it being intentional..

404
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,300
doesn't disappear.

405
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:34,451
Joonhee...

406
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,000
I get what you're saying.

407
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,926
It was in the spur of the moment but...

408
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,099
my heart...

409
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,675
is telling me I can't move in here.

410
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,351
I need time.

411
00:29:06,876 --> 00:29:08,725
How much?

412
00:29:10,575 --> 00:29:12,751
I don't know...

413
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:42,209
Let's go. Hello, everyone!

414
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:43,999
- Can I get an autograph? 
 - Sure, just wait a moment.

415
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:45,459
Thank you! Thank you!

416
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:46,999
You came! Thank you.

417
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:49,283
Thank you for coming.

418
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,634
Thank you!

419
00:29:57,584 --> 00:29:59,634

Our opening performance by J. King!

430
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,799
Please, a round of applause!

431
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:23,459
- How long has it been? 
 - I haven't been on stage for 12 years.

432
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:26,159
- I'm really nervous. 
 - Wow.

433
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:31,684
We'll be answering all your questions today.

434
00:31:31,684 --> 00:31:36,009
How long have we waited for this?

435
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:40,583
Let's hear the second song, before getting into Q&amp;A.

436
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:43,709
More fans!

437
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:46,434
A bit late but please have a seat.

438
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:48,934
The next song by J. King!

439
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:52,899
"Bluebird"! Cheer!

440
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:02,584
- Wang Joonhyeok. 
 - Yes, how can I help you?

441
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,900
- You are under arrest for drug related crimes. 
 - Everyone, get up.

442
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:07,209
- Drugs? 
 - Please get up.

443
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:09,884
It's not me.

444
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:11,209
- I've done nothing wrong. 
 - Come with us.

445
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:13,083
- Yeonjoo! 
-  I would never do that!

446
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:16,834
I heard there was a drug party at Hot Bar.

447
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,709
No way. A drug party?

448
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:19,959
What're you talking about. It's not true.

449
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:20,834
Wait, wait...

450
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:22,859
- J. King! 
 - Uncle!

451
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:26,190
- Uncle! 
 - Go away, this is my comeback!

452
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,460
Please, come with us!

453
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:32,459
I've never done drugs!

454
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:34,834
I don't do drugs! Stop taking photos!

455
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,083
This is my stage!

456
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:36,959
Let go!

457
00:32:36,992 --> 00:32:37,951

458
00:32:37,951 --> 00:32:38,918

459
00:32:38,918 --> 00:32:40,799

460
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:45,959
You need to let me know where I'm being transported to.

461
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,999
- Uncle! 
 - Don't worry, Jihoo!

462
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,999
Yeonjoo, don't worry! I'm fine!

463
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:53,709
You need solid evidence to put cuffs on us.

464
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:01,709
Don't push me, I can walk myself.

465
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:04,559
Uncle!

466
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,109
How can this happen? Our neighborhood is shamed!

467
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:13,334
It shows how you should never get in the way of Mrs. President.

468
00:33:13,334 --> 00:33:18,009
Hey, but... He's the brother of her ex-daughter-in-law.

469
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:21,484
Can't she win sympathy votes for that?

470
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,959
You're a genius!

471
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:27,834
Think about it. They aren't even related.

472
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:29,709
Can't we work with this?

473
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:31,999
I feel bad for him.

474
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:34,834
It's his fault for getting into drugs.

475
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:38,999
I knew something was suspicious. When I went to that bar...

476
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:44,399
The employees and the owner looked high.

477
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:51,209
Our bar went bankrupt.

478
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:54,584
They said my father and everyone...

479
00:33:54,584 --> 00:33:58,099
are habitual users...

480
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:06,709
They said we did drug parties and sold drugs.

481
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:20,750

482
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:25,959
Are you an alcoholic?

483
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:30,059
We have hospital records for alcoholism.

484
00:34:30,709 --> 00:34:32,834
Uncle...

485
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:39,183
- He's on trial. 
 - Wasn't the uncle mainly responsible for raising the child?

486
00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:42,583
Giving a minor with allergies alcohol...

487
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:49,925
Even God can't win you this case.

488
00:34:49,925 --> 00:34:53,884
You should make a deal with them, you might get visitation.

489
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:59,309
I thought you weren't pursuing Jihoo.

490
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:03,509
Pursuing? Does this look like I'm "pursuing"?

491
00:35:03,509 --> 00:35:07,999
Who would stand by and watch their only heir get harmed?

492
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:11,209
You didn't create this situation?

493
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:17,509
You being an alcoholic and your brother a drug addict is my fault?

494
00:35:17,509 --> 00:35:18,959
Let's make deal.

495
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:22,809
Don't embarrass yourself while losing your kid.

496
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:28,834
I'll let your brother and the bar owner live.

497
00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:32,542
For Jihoo?

498
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:38,459
Jihoo will be mine no matter what.

499
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:43,499
It's a matter of losing one or two people for you.

500
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,283
Mrs. President is suing for custody?

501
00:35:46,283 --> 00:35:48,584
Of course, I applaud her.

502
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:50,834
It's what's best for Jihoo.

503
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:53,283
But he needs a mother.

504
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:56,999
She didn't raise him. Her drug addict uncle did.

505
00:35:56,999 --> 00:36:02,209
She was busy working and seducing a man.

506
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:04,459
What'll happen with Noeul's father?

507
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:07,834
Weren't there rumors about them moving in together?

508
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:10,999
He probably came to his senses and cut them off.

509
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:16,084
- Oh, they broke up? 
 - He should break up!

510
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:20,999
She can't raise her own. How could she raise someone else's?

511
00:36:20,999 --> 00:36:23,834
Losing custody, brother sent to jail, dumped by a man...

512
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:28,999
I'd be too embarrassed to live here.

513
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:31,209
- What're you doing? 
 - Seriously?

514
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:33,083
Oh my, I missed...

515
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:36,299
I was aiming for the trash bin, but I hit trash instead.

516
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:38,459
What?

517
00:36:38,459 --> 00:36:41,083
Let go of me! Get over here!

518
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:44,559
I'm going to kill you! I said let go!

519
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:02,459
You should come home.

520
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:04,909
That's not my home.

521
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:10,634
You said you didn't need anything from me.

522
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:18,009
Why are you taking me? You don't even love me.

523
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:20,159
Love?

524
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:30,209
In an adult's world, there are many more important things.

525
00:38:30,209 --> 00:38:36,059
No, even in your world, love is the most important.

526
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:40,634
I don't need you, I'm trying to protect you.

527
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:44,199
I saved you from your uncle who caused you harm.

528
00:38:44,209 --> 00:38:46,959
You're the one who hurt me.

529
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:50,534
You're the one who made me miserable.

530
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:54,634
He's the one that saved me.

531
00:38:54,634 --> 00:38:57,210
He saved my life.

532
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:03,699
You aren't afraid of me anymore?

533
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:13,820
I'll return to your home.

534
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:22,409
But I have a condition.

535
00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:28,109
How could you do that without telling me?

536
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:30,609
How could you do this to me?

537
00:39:34,899 --> 00:39:36,659
No, Jihoo.

538
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:41,699
Your uncle wouldn't allow it either.

539
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,109
It's better than living in prison.

540
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:53,499
He's my uncle. We're family.

541
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:57,984
I have to sacrifice for my family.

542
00:39:58,634 --> 00:40:01,383
Why does it have to be you?

543
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:05,542
Because I'm what she wants.

544
00:40:07,584 --> 00:40:11,083
Trust me.I won't lose you.

545
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:13,967
Don't worry and trust me, okay?

546
00:40:15,759 --> 00:40:17,700
What about uncle?

547
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:21,684
Can you save him?

548
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:26,459
Jihoo...

549
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,992
Grandmother can save him.

550
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:33,209
Let's just do as she says.

551
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:40,083
Mom, let's do it. Okay?

552
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:54,309
- Tada! 
 - Uncle!

553
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:55,309
Tofu! Tofu!

554
00:40:55,309 --> 00:41:01,699
The skies haven't forsaken me! I knew it'd be probation.

555
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:04,459
Our label?

556
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:07,609
They're ruined, they shut down.

557
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:12,509
- Yup. And my signing bonus? 
 - We returned it.

558
00:41:12,584 --> 00:41:14,584
You flexed hard for my tuition!

559
00:41:14,584 --> 00:41:17,909
Don't worry, I can make it back. I'll get it back to you.

560
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:21,199
As for the car, they wanted us to pay or take over the contract.

561
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:22,999
I signed up for installment payments under your name

562
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:24,534
That's cold...

563
00:41:24,534 --> 00:41:28,209
Uncle! You can start again! Right?

564
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:29,834
Right! I can do it again!

565
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:31,834
You're all I have. Let's go!

566
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:33,499
- Eat up. 
 - Yeah.

567
00:41:33,499 --> 00:41:35,217
Thank you.

568
00:41:37,459 --> 00:41:38,999
Hey.

569
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:43,959
Did you break up?

570
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:50,959
He visited me by himself.

571
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:53,584
Really?

572
00:41:54,183 --> 00:41:57,609
I heard you didn't even move in.

573
00:41:57,609 --> 00:41:59,534
Did you argue?

574
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:02,684
Over me?

575
00:42:02,684 --> 00:42:04,999
I have something to tell you.

576
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:08,709
Mom, I'll tell him.

577
00:42:12,918 --> 00:42:14,409
What?

578
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:17,109
What's going on?

579
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:21,334
Uncle, you know I have 5 wishes. Right?

580
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:22,999
Of course.

581
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:25,409
My 96th wish!

582
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,759
Okay number 96, what?

583
00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:30,183
- Do as I say. 
 - Okay.

584
00:42:30,183 --> 00:42:33,034
Just say it, I'll do it.

585
00:42:33,034 --> 00:42:37,659
What could Jihoo's 96th wish be?

586
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:43,399
Uncle, I'm going to live with Grandmother.

587
00:42:54,709 --> 00:42:56,834
This is happening.

588
00:42:59,999 --> 00:43:02,283
I don't understand.

589
00:43:02,283 --> 00:43:04,199
What's this kid saying?

590
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,359
Speak up and answer me.

591
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:21,399
Don't tell me...

592
00:43:22,459 --> 00:43:26,383
Did his grandmother get me out?

593
00:43:26,383 --> 00:43:27,859
Uncle.

594
00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:29,509
What're you doing?

595
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:31,999
Are you stupid? How can you call yourself his mother?

596
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:34,834
You're sending him? Why would you send him there?

597
00:43:34,834 --> 00:43:38,583
- Uncle, I chose this. 
 - You don't know anything!

598
00:43:38,584 --> 00:43:41,709
- I know everything. 
 - Be quiet, you answer me.

599
00:43:41,709 --> 00:43:43,975
What the hell did you do?

600
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:50,109
You're a drug addict and I'm an alcoholic.

601
00:43:51,292 --> 00:43:54,034
They said we aren't suitable.

602
00:43:57,709 --> 00:44:02,459
Suitable... If we aren't suitable to raise him,

603
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:05,459
his grandmother who beats this little kid is suitable?

604
00:44:05,459 --> 00:44:08,199
You're his mother, I'm his uncle.

605
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:11,699
Why aren't we suitable to raise him?

606
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:14,059
Uncle, just wait 8 years.

607
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:19,199
In 8 years, I'll become an adult.

608
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,259
Then we can do a duet.

609
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:25,034
You should just...

610
00:44:25,034 --> 00:44:30,583
You didn't see me for 12 years. What's 8 more?

611
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,034
Hey.

612
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:36,384
Do you know what the cruelest thing is?

613
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:38,483
Giving, then taking away.

614
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:42,050
Not knowing is better.

615
00:44:42,834 --> 00:44:45,983
But we've lived together, how can I wait 8 years?

616
00:44:48,409 --> 00:44:50,259
Can you do that?

617
00:45:06,434 --> 00:45:09,042
I have a restraining order.

618
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:12,409
Where's your mother?

619
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:15,609
Out for Jihoo's room interior design.

620
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:18,199
Why? You want to thank her?

621
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:19,209
What?

622
00:45:19,209 --> 00:45:23,734
If it wasn't for our lawyers, you'd be in prison for 10 years.

623
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:26,999
- Hey! 
 - What?

624
00:45:26,999 --> 00:45:28,934
Hey!

625
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,359
What?

626
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:36,383
Please don't do this.

627
00:45:39,734 --> 00:45:41,334
Get down.

628
00:45:42,459 --> 00:45:44,209
On your knees then talk.

629
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:01,259
I beg you.

630
00:46:02,899 --> 00:46:05,999
Don't take him away from my sister because of me.

631
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:08,584
Our Jihoo...

632
00:46:08,584 --> 00:46:12,209
is finally living a normal life.

633
00:46:12,209 --> 00:46:16,059
He's finally getting along with other kids.

634
00:46:17,999 --> 00:46:20,459
If you tell me to die, I will.

635
00:46:20,459 --> 00:46:23,984
I'll go back to prison if you want. It's all my fault.

636
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:29,334
I swear... I'll never show myself to Jihoo again.

637
00:46:29,334 --> 00:46:31,234
Please.

638
00:46:37,709 --> 00:46:39,999
Legally you can't go near him anyways.

639
00:46:39,999 --> 00:46:44,334
Enjoy your last few days with Jihoo.

640
00:46:45,334 --> 00:46:49,883
If you see him again, you'll go to jail. Understand?

641
00:46:55,709 --> 00:46:58,109
Oh and also.

642
00:46:58,109 --> 00:47:02,759
Remember that text your sister sent 12 years ago?

643
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:05,699
The 100 million won?

644
00:47:05,709 --> 00:47:08,259
I'll keep it.

645
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:11,259
Just think that you gave it to your nephew.

646
00:47:11,259 --> 00:47:13,499
I sent that text.

647
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:18,625
What?

648
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:22,999
 This season's winner is... J. King!

649
00:47:23,025 --> 00:47:26,167

650
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:29,399
 Sis! 100 million won was transferred to your account!

651
00:47:29,399 --> 00:47:33,459
 So don't worry, and get out of that house!

652
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:36,883
 Let's live happily, just the 3 of us.

653
00:47:42,209 --> 00:47:46,583
 Hyeok, I can't live with you.

654
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:51,309
 I can't raise my child in poverty and to be like you.

655
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,999
 I'll keep it.

656
00:47:57,999 --> 00:48:02,084
 Just think that you gave it to your nephew.

657
00:48:02,084 --> 00:48:07,234
 How dare you try to run away!

658
00:48:07,234 --> 00:48:10,834
 Give it to me! That's important to him!

659
00:48:10,834 --> 00:48:13,834
 Hyeok worked so hard for his dreams!

660
00:48:13,834 --> 00:48:15,583
 Give it back!

661
00:48:16,459 --> 00:48:19,584
 - Give it to me! 
 - Shut up.

662
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:23,834
 Mom, not so hard! You might hurt your grandson!

663
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,209
 You worthless orphan brat!

664
00:48:26,209 --> 00:48:29,083
 How dare you seduce my son,

665
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:32,959
 then try and run off with my grandson!

666
00:48:34,783 --> 00:48:39,999
 Please, just please. Then just lend that money to me.

667
00:48:39,999 --> 00:48:42,959
 I'll live here and pay you back.

668
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:44,999
 Please... Please...

669
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:50,499
 Have the child and leave, then you can have it back.

670
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:56,999
She was beaten for 10 years asking for that money back.

671
00:48:56,999 --> 00:48:59,883
You little...

672
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:04,109
Hey.

673
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:08,309
I didn't really think you'd cut ties with each other.

674
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:13,059
You piece of trash, it was just 100 million won.

675
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:15,483
Didn't she raise you?

676
00:49:16,334 --> 00:49:19,359
That's why you're a loser.

677
00:49:40,709 --> 00:49:42,799
Why didn't you tell me?

678
00:49:45,584 --> 00:49:50,009
What's the point, we can't get it back.

679
00:49:51,283 --> 00:49:53,600
If you found out,

680
00:49:54,609 --> 00:49:56,499
you could've been hurt.

681
00:49:57,584 --> 00:49:59,784
You might've done something.

682
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:05,883
If I knew, we wouldn't have cut ties.

683
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:13,134
I'm sorry.

684
00:50:14,734 --> 00:50:17,909
It's not about the money.

685
00:50:17,909 --> 00:50:20,640
When you cut me off...

686
00:50:21,209 --> 00:50:24,834
I knew it was best for you, but...

687
00:50:24,834 --> 00:50:28,499
It was so painful and I despised you...

688
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:32,959
I know...

689
00:50:32,959 --> 00:50:35,334
I can't believe I wasn't there,

690
00:50:35,334 --> 00:50:37,959
12 years of...

691
00:50:37,999 --> 00:50:41,009
you getting beat,

692
00:50:41,009 --> 00:50:43,959
of Jihoo growing up...

693
00:50:43,959 --> 00:50:46,134
You did well.

694
00:50:46,134 --> 00:50:49,234
You were the best uncle.

695
00:50:50,209 --> 00:50:51,709
Hey.

696
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:55,859
What should I do?

697
00:50:58,383 --> 00:51:00,959
What can I do now?

698
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:07,700
Listen to his last wish.

699
00:51:15,334 --> 00:51:18,000
♪ Happy birthday ♪

700
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,959
 My 97th wish is...

701
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:24,683
 having a birthday party for the first time.

702
00:51:28,459 --> 00:51:31,199
 And my 98th...

703
00:51:31,209 --> 00:51:33,999
 was taking a family picture.

704
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,640
Okay, let's see

705
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,290
I have to put this away...

706
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,690
pick up the wallet...

707
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,800
Let me check your hair.

708
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:00,110
It looks nice.

709
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:08,025
Done!

710
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:19,709
 On my last day, I walked out as if going to school,

711
00:52:19,709 --> 00:52:22,683
 as if nothing was going to change.

712
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:27,299
I'll be back.

713
00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:29,909
Go ahead!

714
00:52:51,183 --> 00:52:54,734
Don't open your eyes.

715
00:52:56,684 --> 00:53:02,284
 My 99th wish was eating uncle's cooking.

716
00:53:02,284 --> 00:53:04,599
 The first meal he cooked for me.

717
00:53:09,099 --> 00:53:11,959
- Is it good? 
 - Yes.

718
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,099
Wipe your mouth.

719
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:19,709
Mouth.

720
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:30,659
Come here.

721
00:53:38,584 --> 00:53:40,283
My treasure chest.

722
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:42,209
I have so much stuff.

723
00:53:42,209 --> 00:53:44,799
I didn't have anything when I left here.

724
00:53:44,799 --> 00:53:47,109
You bought me almost everything, right?

725
00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:48,099
How rude of you.

726
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:52,459
Almost everything? No, I got you everything.

727
00:53:52,459 --> 00:53:57,109
What's your 100th wish? You have one left.

728
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:59,609
It's at home.

729
00:53:59,609 --> 00:54:04,609
You have to keep your word, even if I'm not there.

730
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:07,084
Okay.

731
00:54:33,999 --> 00:54:38,409
 This ring will help you in hard times.

732
00:55:08,126 --> 00:55:11,080

733
00:55:12,234 --> 00:55:16,309
Jihoo! I've missed you!

734
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:20,334
I'll be your mother now.

735
00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:27,175
Jihoo, say, "Mom."

736
00:55:27,175 --> 00:55:29,610
Try it.

737
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:54,500

738
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:05,020

739
00:56:08,226 --> 00:56:12,090

740
00:56:22,334 --> 00:56:24,399
 Uncle, you said it.

741
00:56:24,399 --> 00:56:28,384
 I stole your dreams from you.

742
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:31,059
 Are you going to give up now?

743
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:34,209
 I didn't give up. You stole it from me.

744
00:56:34,209 --> 00:56:35,499
 What?

745
00:56:35,499 --> 00:56:39,309
 It's you. You're my stolen dream.

746
00:56:40,183 --> 00:56:44,699
 My dream was stolen when you were born, so now you're my dream.

747
00:56:46,534 --> 00:56:49,180
 Your stolen dream has been returned.

748
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:52,190
 So don't give up.

749
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:55,580
 Uncle, you have great big wings.

750
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,190
 Because you're the bluebird.

751
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:00,999
 Take a rest from protecting me.

752
00:57:00,999 --> 00:57:04,459
 Spread your wings and fly towards your dreams.

753
00:57:04,459 --> 00:57:07,150
 My 100th wish is...

754
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:11,410
 I want you to become an extraordinary musician.

755
00:57:34,967 --> 00:57:38,551

756
00:57:38,551 --> 00:57:40,899
Boss, I can do it.

757
00:57:40,899 --> 00:57:43,734
It's okay. Please check the inventory.

758
00:57:43,734 --> 00:57:45,334
Yes.

759
00:58:21,809 --> 00:58:24,099
We're in trouble! What's wrong with the poll!

760
00:58:24,099 --> 00:58:26,834
Increasing members did nothing! We're screwed!

761
00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:30,183
Hwang did a good job so far, people don't want change.

762
00:58:30,183 --> 00:58:31,859
People are stupid!

763
00:58:31,859 --> 00:58:34,899
What's with their belief in him? This is so annoying.

764
00:58:34,899 --> 00:58:39,099
Don't blame others, let's just do our best.

765
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,892
Hey!

766
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:41,684
What!

767
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,309
- What's wrong? 
 - You scared me!

768
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:46,699
What's the matter with you?

769
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:50,959
- She's back. 
 - Who?

770
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:55,099
Mingi's mother moved into the penthouse!

771
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:56,999
What?

772
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:26,590

773
00:59:28,951 --> 00:59:32,450

774
00:59:35,834 --> 00:59:38,334
 My mother would like to see you.

775
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:43,209
 Sorry, that it took so long.

776
00:59:43,209 --> 00:59:47,484
 I didn't expect you to see me, I'm honored.

777
00:59:47,484 --> 00:59:48,883
 Thank you, Mrs. President.

778
00:59:48,883 --> 00:59:53,209
 We got Jihoo thanks to you, this is nothing.

779
00:59:55,099 --> 01:00:00,309
 I didn't do anything. I just gave you a little advice.

780
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:04,709
 Who would have known we would be acquainted.

781
01:00:07,784 --> 01:00:08,559
 Mrs. Park!

782
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,783
 We'll find your grandson, please don't worry!

783
01:00:11,783 --> 01:00:13,001

784
01:00:13,001 --> 01:00:18,783
 How could I get Jihoo back without getting my hands dirty?

785
01:00:18,783 --> 01:00:25,359
 I also promise to make you into our next congress representative.

786
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:30,200
 I know all of Congressman Hwang's weaknesses.

787
01:00:32,709 --> 01:00:37,009
 Keep talking. Start with Jihoo.

788
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:40,283
 If you wish to take something,

789
01:00:40,283 --> 01:00:43,684
 you must let them put their guard down.

790
01:00:43,684 --> 01:00:46,999
 I don't want to forcefully take him.

791
01:00:46,999 --> 01:00:50,584
 So stop running away. Just continue with your life.

792
01:00:50,584 --> 01:00:53,209
 They won't be fooled at first.

793
01:00:53,209 --> 01:00:55,209
 You expect me to believe that?

794
01:00:55,209 --> 01:00:56,734
 Just be honest.

795
01:00:56,734 --> 01:01:01,209
  I'm planning on running for congress.

796
01:01:01,209 --> 01:01:04,334
 So watch your mouth.

797
01:01:04,334 --> 01:01:07,899
 If you dare to bad mouth me or get in my way,

798
01:01:07,899 --> 01:01:10,859
 I'll make sure you regret it.

799
01:01:10,859 --> 01:01:15,609
 Then, get rid of any obstacles.

800
01:01:15,609 --> 01:01:22,509
 Oh, who is this?  Could this be our CEO?

801
01:01:22,509 --> 01:01:25,534
 How have you been, Director Byun?

802
01:01:27,109 --> 01:01:29,609
 Wang Joonhyeok signed, sir.

803
01:01:29,609 --> 01:01:32,699
 Wow! We got him!

804
01:01:33,784 --> 01:01:35,109
 You have a phone call.

805
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:35,999
 Thank you.

806
01:01:35,999 --> 01:01:40,534
 People let their guard down in front of things they want.

807
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:47,309
 If you know their weaknesses, we are indestructible.

808
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:52,559
 In Seongjak district, the best place to earn votes is in schools.

809
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,734
 Give the school constant donations.

810
01:01:56,734 --> 01:02:01,883
 And lastly, you must acquire the Gold Momvelies.

811
01:02:01,883 --> 01:02:05,234
 I am an expert at controlling those women.

812
01:02:05,234 --> 01:02:08,484
 Would you like to be my new partners?

813
01:02:08,484 --> 01:02:14,184
 Those women will gladly become your dogs.

814
01:02:15,434 --> 01:02:19,809
 Unfortunately, one of your predictions missed.

815
01:02:21,209 --> 01:02:25,083
 My poll numbers aren't rising as expected.

816
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:30,459
 The Momvelies are useless without you.

817
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:36,759
 You've proven yourself already. How about working with me?

818
01:02:36,759 --> 01:02:41,100
 Tell me what you want. I'll grant you anything.

819
01:03:07,209 --> 01:03:08,984
Welcome...

820
01:03:12,899 --> 01:03:15,009
It's been so long.

821
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,499
Hello.

822
01:03:18,234 --> 01:03:22,499
You're the owner now?

823
01:03:23,999 --> 01:03:26,184
About Jihoo?

824
01:03:29,834 --> 01:03:32,559
I heard you lost him?

825
01:03:34,959 --> 01:03:38,934
How's it feel, losing a child?

826
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,209
You now know how I feel.

827
01:04:04,867 --> 01:04:07,983
They all look like Jihoo now.

828
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:15,160
 The door is open.

829
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,420
Okay.

830
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:42,209
 Clean up before you eat.

831
01:04:48,234 --> 01:04:50,459
All right, okay.

832
01:04:58,709 --> 01:05:01,184
Yes, sir!

833
01:05:02,859 --> 01:05:04,584
Now...

834
01:05:04,584 --> 01:05:06,759
 Uncle, the detox juice...

835
01:05:06,759 --> 01:05:07,983
Okay.

836
01:05:07,983 --> 01:05:10,700
Okay, okay, okay.

837
01:05:17,459 --> 01:05:19,484
Don't drink from the bottle!

838
01:05:19,484 --> 01:05:24,350
Okay, all right. Yes, sir.

839
01:05:26,999 --> 01:05:29,334
Finally.

840
01:05:29,334 --> 01:05:31,299
 Okay, good job.

841
01:05:31,299 --> 01:05:35,399

842
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:36,809

843
01:05:36,809 --> 01:05:38,392

844
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,242

845
01:05:40,242 --> 01:05:43,020

846
01:05:55,459 --> 01:05:57,599
 It's bad.

847
01:05:58,334 --> 01:06:00,559
I know.

848
01:06:01,784 --> 01:06:05,917
Chord A-minor to D-minor is natural, it sounds decent.

849
01:06:05,917 --> 01:06:09,984
 It's old fashioned, add a bridge.

850
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:15,659
Hallucination of Jihoo, that's enough for today.

851
01:06:15,659 --> 01:06:19,834
Stop lowering my self-esteem.

852
01:06:48,859 --> 01:06:51,759
- Argh! 
 - What!

853
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:53,875
I got you!

854
01:06:55,209 --> 01:06:56,759
Hey...

855
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:02,859
Are you real?

856
01:07:02,859 --> 01:07:06,459
Is this real?

857
01:07:06,459 --> 01:07:09,983
I'm real... Really!

858
01:07:11,584 --> 01:07:13,599
Really?

859
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:30,950

860
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:40,190
♫  It's okay if you don't   ♫

861
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:45,360
♫  Stick to the shady corner  ♫

862
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:51,140
♫  Because I'm already used to  ♫

863
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:54,080
♫  Holding my breath  ♫

864
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:58,820
♫  But this little heart  ♫

865
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:03,080
♫  Is beating fast  ♫

866
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:06,830
♫  You keep whispering to me to make my dream come true  ♫

867
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:09,899
 If his father finds out we're intentionally approaching them,

868
01:08:09,899 --> 01:08:11,042
 you know what'll happen. Right?

869
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:11,999
 Are you threatening me?

870
01:08:11,999 --> 01:08:15,067
 - Jihoo's disappeared. 
 - Disappeared? He must be with you!

871
01:08:15,067 --> 01:08:18,399
 Wang Joonhyeok, I know Jihoo is here.

872
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:20,983
 No matter how much you miss him,

873
01:08:20,983 --> 01:08:23,742
 you can never. Got it Hyeok?

874
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:29,459
 I just... want you to be happy.

875
01:08:29,459 --> 01:08:34,484
 Welcome Park Hyeryeong, she'll be in charge of marketing and PR for my campaign.

876
01:08:34,484 --> 01:08:38,751
 Domestic violence, child abuse... Don't do those terrible things.

877
01:08:38,751 --> 01:08:42,125
 I think Jihoo's been lying to me.

878
01:08:42,125 --> 01:08:45,800
 Why'd you come here?

879
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,200
 If they knew, Wang Joonhyeok would do something about it.

880
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,810
 Are you secretly meeting your uncle?

881
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:56,700
♫  When you get up and run again  ♫

882
01:08:56,740 --> 01:09:01,420

883
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:06,490
