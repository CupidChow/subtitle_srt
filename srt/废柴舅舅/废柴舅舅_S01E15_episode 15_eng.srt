1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,560

2
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:11,501

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:15,999

4
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:21,999

5
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:26,542

6
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:33,626

7
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:37,999

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,120

9
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:50,000

10
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,999
Excuse... Excuse me!

11
00:00:58,999 --> 00:00:59,999
It's you.

12
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:03,209
- You're Uncle King! 
 - Yes.

13
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:04,584
Can I have your autograph?

14
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:05,999
- Autograph? 
 - Yes. autograph.

15
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,334
All right.

16
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:11,459
It's been a while since I've done this.

17
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:12,676
Visit us frequently.

18
00:01:12,676 --> 00:01:16,209
I've already bragged that you're a regular here.

19
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,217
Excuse me, ma'am! Here! It's Uncle King!

20
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:21,784
- Where? 
 - Here! Here!

21
00:01:21,784 --> 00:01:24,359
Wow, a legend!

22
00:01:25,584 --> 00:01:26,751
Uncle King! Uncle King!

23
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:28,083
- Come join us. 
 - Can I?

24
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,899
One, two, three!

25
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:32,292
- One more! 
 - Me too!

26
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,834
 Uncle became famous in 72 hours.

27
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:38,334
 And it wasn't dying down.

28
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:43,709
- It's Uncle King! 
 - Really?

29
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,392
Hello.

30
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,709
Yes, yes. It's me, Uncle King.

31
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,375
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

32
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,999
I thought you were a pervert.

33
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:54,209
It happens.

34
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:55,999
Can I get a photo, please?

35
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:57,999
Of course. Come here.

36
00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:00,926
Okay... One, two, three!

37
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:06,799
Hey, you little monkeys. Are you studying hard?

38
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,950
- Uncle! 
 - Uncle!

39
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,699
What're you doing here?

40
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,301
I'm here to see my nephew after school.

41
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,618
I took a walk in the neighborhood to hand out autographs.

42
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:23,125
- Do you want one? 
 - No, we have Jihoo's autograph.

43
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,000
Huh?

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,217
Jihoo is more popular among kids.

45
00:02:27,217 --> 00:02:29,042
Really?

46
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:33,692
Don't change because you're famous.

47
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:36,792
People don't change.

48
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:39,792
Sechan, did you apologize to Noeul?

49
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,918
A man proves through actions.

50
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:46,692
He helped Jihoo escape so I forgave him.

51
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:50,699
Kids these days are smart and calculative.

52
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:53,899
- Do you kids want donuts? 
 - Yes, please!

53
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:56,290
- Uncle is buying! 
 - Uncle! Uncle!

54
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,618

55
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:02,999
Greetings, King's Family!

56
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:06,899
This is Uncle King's photoshoot site.

57
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:10,999

We'll be hosting a Q&amp;A afterwards,

58
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,542
so leave questions in the comments.

59
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:16,118
Like and subscribe like a king!

60
00:03:16,118 --> 00:03:18,642
Jihoo is really playing his part.

61
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:24,142
Indeed. Uncle's terrible with social media and communicating.

62
00:03:24,142 --> 00:03:27,167
He's terrible in many other ways.

63
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:28,899
Yes, relax.

64
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:31,792
There you go. Nice.

65
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,692
Nice, but relax your eyes.

66
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:38,692
You got this. Look at the camera.

67
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:40,651
Let's try cute.

68
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:43,199
More. More!

69
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,109
More, more, more!

70
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:50,899
What should I do? It's too old-fashioned.

71
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:53,792
Sorry, let's take a break. Sorry, guys, I need a break.

72
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:55,942
Why am I so nervous? I'm shaking.

73
00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:59,367
- I can't even breathe. 
 - Try to relax.

74
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:01,509
This isn't like you.

75
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:04,290
You're right... I'm having a hard time as it is.

76
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,990
Stop, you're making it worse!

77
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:10,618
Uncle! Fan service is extremely important.

78
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:13,217
A singer should sing.

79
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:16,799
A musician makes albums and performs on stage.

80
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,676
What's the point of this photoshoot?

81
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:22,384
Your profile pictures are way too old.

82
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:24,799
Is reality TV even possible?

83
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:27,718
Two radio show appearances,

84
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:30,042
and "I Live Alone" are scheduled next week.

85
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:32,417
Really? Sounds fun.

86
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:35,042
Busy squeezing every last bit out of me?

87
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,292
We can be busier!

88
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:39,667
You never know when your fame comes to an end.

89
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:42,699
Let's pull in everything while he's popular.

90
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,417
- Pull! 
 - Pull! Pull!

91
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:49,292
But, Director, I don't think his fame is a bubble.

92
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:52,818
He's a prepared musician. Not a one-hit wonder.

93
00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:55,542
Oh, my beanie girl! Let him know!

94
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:58,417
The best supporter, Uncle Queen!

95
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:01,818
Yes, Ma'am. I understand, my queen.

96
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:03,818
Let's begin. We're low on time.

97
00:05:03,818 --> 00:05:06,626
- Can you smile for me? 
 - Yes.

98
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:09,317
Look. It's like his face is convulsing.

99
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:11,292
Why is it doing that?

100
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:14,592
Should we try it together with Jihoo?

101
00:05:14,592 --> 00:05:19,942
Why not? His fans are also Jihoo's fans.

102
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:22,842
I'm really shy, too.

103
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:27,125
Then don't pose, relax and have a conversation.

104
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,342
- Was that bad? 
 - Sounds better and modern.

105
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:33,067
- Should we do the Q&amp;A? 
 - Yeah, let's try.

106
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:38,792
Do you have plans for "The Masked Singer?"

107
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,392
If they invite me, sure.

108
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:46,492
I'm sure I can be the show's champion for 6 or even 8 weeks.

109
00:05:46,492 --> 00:05:49,199
Show producers, did you hear that?

110
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,542
Why did you become a singer?

111
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:57,442
Making music was easy.

112
00:05:58,342 --> 00:06:00,217
To be honest...

113
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:06,667
I'm terrible at most things, but making music came naturally.

114
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,799
At first...

115
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:14,592
I thought I was doing it for my deceased father.

116
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:19,718
Then I realized I was hungry for love and attention.

117
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:23,117
I've always struggled to communicate my stories.

118
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:30,192
No one listened. So I decided to write lyrics, make music, and sing.

119
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:32,442
- That's really dark. 
 - Huh?

120
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:35,267
- Let's change the atmosphere. 
 - Okay, okay.

121
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:37,599
Do you dip or pour your sauce? 
  (Play on "bu-meog" (dip) and "jjik-meog" (pour))

122
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:42,142
I can't eat what I don't have. 
  ("mot-meog" (can't eat))

123
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:02,417
Oh my!

124
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:05,667
Why'd he put this here instead of his room?

125
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:09,042
Is he serious? What even is that?

126
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:28,592
You can let yourself in.

127
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:32,667
Me? I can't move.

128
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:37,218
You know the password. It's the same.

129
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,899
Why didn't you change the password?

130
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:49,092
What if I come and steal something?

131
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:50,992
Take it all.

132
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:53,567
Does it still hurt?

133
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:58,999
Maybe you shouldn't take it off next week.

134
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:03,259
Perhaps... Can you help me up?

135
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:05,592
I don't think I can.

136
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:08,242
It hurts when I sleep, too.

137
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:12,318
I can't walk without crutches.

138
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,401
That's strange.

139
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:20,476
Noeul told me you've been walking around just fine.

140
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:25,925
Why aren't you talking? Nothing to say?

141
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:30,250
That... Noeul, must be...

142
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,476
lying to keep you from worrying. I'm really hurt.

143
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:38,876
What's this? Here? Was it here?

144
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:40,501
That tickles!

145
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,526
Did you just run?

146
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:47,275
You're terrible.

147
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:51,176
- It just healed. 
 - You actually ran.

148
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:01,876
Why'd you ask me to come with Jihoo?

149
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:08,799
I have an idea. It isn't mine but...

150
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,499
many fans requested it.

151
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,551
How about a mini-concert for the album release?

152
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:18,425
With the album release?

153
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,699
The album release is at the end of this month.

154
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:25,526
We're tight on time. Which is why it'd be a mini-concert.

155
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:30,999
We don't have a budget but we can share revenue.

156
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:35,375
Will we be doomed if no one comes?

157
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:39,176
I don't think we'll be doomed.

158
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,999
Can you do the concert with Jihoo?

159
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:46,999
Sorry?

160
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:50,501
Your most viewed video is the duet.

161
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:55,125
And most of your fans are interested in Jihoo.

162
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:59,050
Jihoo played a huge role.

163
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:01,499
Then...

164
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,776
Then Jihoo can be on stage?

165
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:07,225
Great.

166
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:10,250
I think it's a great idea!

167
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,876
- What do you think, Jihoo? 
 - Of course, he can.

168
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:16,751
Director, he was born for the stage.

169
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:20,000
We planned on doing a duet when he grew up, too!

170
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,800
Right.

171
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,799
Thank goodness.

172
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:25,099
I worried you'd be against it since he's young.

173
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:27,876
Can you get his guardian's approval?

174
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:30,250
I'm his guardian. I accept.

175
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,125
You didn't birth him.

176
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:34,751
No, I didn't.

177
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:37,375
We need his mother's written consent.

178
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,799
All right.

179
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,876
Your mom wanted to see you on stage, right?

180
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:46,375
My sister worked really hard to help him pursue music.

181
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:50,326
She'll be so excited when she hears this!

182
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,399
No.

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,999
No?

184
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:02,899
Why not? Why?

185
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:06,301
Jihoo's in 6th grade.

186
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:07,651
Hey!

187
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:09,900
So many artists begin performing at a young age.

188
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,125
It's stage experience. What are you talking about?

189
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,626
Mom, I really want to. I'm popular right now.

190
00:11:15,626 --> 00:11:17,751
I don't understand you.

191
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:20,501
You disagree with him doing music?

192
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:24,100
Mom, I want to do this. Why are you against it?

193
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,176
What makes you different from his grandmother?

194
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,375
Does it look like I'm getting in your way?

195
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,500
That's exactly what it looks like.

196
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:47,626
I don't disagree with him doing music.

197
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:50,526
I want him to follow his dreams no matter what.

198
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:55,876
But what you're suggesting is a paid job. It's business.

199
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:57,999
He's barely in 6th grade.

200
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:00,999
He doesn't have a perspective on money or society.

201
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:03,899
What if he makes a mistake and is traumatized?

202
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,751
How will you cope with it?

203
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:09,626
How can you be so naive and take your management's word?

204
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:12,651
You should have said no to him, to begin with.

205
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:15,125
He'll never get on stage if you think like that.

206
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:19,626
When you think you're ready, there won't be opportunity.

207
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:22,825
This isn't an offer that comes easily.

208
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:28,200
You know I believe in you. You know I support you.

209
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,999
But, Jihoo, let's wait until you're hardened.

210
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:36,501
Eat more, grow bigger, and get stronger. Okay?

211
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:38,250
When? When? When?

212
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,375
He's so cute right now, everyone loves him.

213
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,375
Exactly.

214
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,999
Why are you doing business by using my kid?

215
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,626
How is this business?

216
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:50,876
They're our fans. People who love our music.

217
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:54,375
We're presenting them with a show. Why are you so cynical?

218
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,651
I really didn't want to say this.

219
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,626
- I read all of your YouTube comments. 
 - And?

220
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:03,999
- You know what they say about Jihoo? 
 - What?

221
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:07,999
They're judging his appearance. He's cute, he's chubby.

222
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:11,250
How do people judge a child and say things?

223
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,100
It's concerning.

224
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,999
That's a part of any musician or entertainer's life.

225
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,300
Like needle and thread.

226
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,999
I've had it a million times worse.

227
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,626
You're an adult.

228
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:26,999
How long has he been back?

229
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:29,876
He still might be traumatized. He can fall sick anytime.

230
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,375
Mom, I'm all right now.

231
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,125
He said he's fine.

232
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,000
Even negativity is attention.

233
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,900
I'll take care of him, don't worry.

234
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,626
No, no.

235
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:44,600
I strongly disagree with this.

236
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:48,299
Hey!

237
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:55,434
I think we were too up front.

238
00:13:57,699 --> 00:13:59,442
Cheers!

239
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:04,792
Miss... Your breakfast is ready.

240
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:24,017
I'll take your order. Would you like your egg yolk runny?

241
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:35,551
Mom, it's so stiff.

242
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:37,217
I said no.

243
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:39,567
Your makeup looks so pretty.

244
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,242
I didn't use any makeup.

245
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:43,999
You're pretty without it!

246
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:47,492
She's so pretty, she doesn't need makeup.

247
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:52,776
Big Bro must be so happy to date you. I'm jealous.

248
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:54,301
I said no.

249
00:14:54,301 --> 00:15:00,042
Oh! Uncle did all the recycling and cleaned the leftovers.

250
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:04,342
Well, he was supposed to do all that.

251
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,599
Fine. Here!

252
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,042
An allowance.

253
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,817
Treat Big Bro to a date or something.

254
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:17,025
You use it.

255
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:18,799
Buy Hwaeum something nice for once!

256
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,099
I'm good to her. Why are you attacking me?

257
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:40,342
What does that mean?

258
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:49,367
Can't you tell what I'm saying? I said this wouldn't work.

259
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,842
Oh my god, what should we do? We're in trouble.

260
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:57,267
Jihoo's starving himself. He didn't eat anything!

261
00:15:57,267 --> 00:15:58,342
Why?

262
00:15:58,342 --> 00:16:02,967
He's on a hunger strike to enforce his opinion.

263
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:05,342
Well, I have no choice.

264
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,242
Let him starve.

265
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:22,717
Stop eating. How many have you had?

266
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:28,142
- What happened? 
 - Didn't work.

267
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:31,867
What's our next plan?

268
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:36,299
Let's just do it without her finding out.

269
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:43,999
Wow!

270
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:46,240
We can just use it?

271
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,160
Yeah.

272
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:50,967
He said he isn't opening anytime soon anyways.

273
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:55,217
Our company is poor. I feel bad to ask for a rental studio.

274
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:56,967
But most importantly.

275
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:58,718
This is close to home.

276
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:02,567
It's perfect to practice behind your mom's back.

277
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:07,192
If she finds out, we're in big trouble.

278
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,270
- I'm missing after-school stuff. 
 - Hey.

279
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,090
You have an excuse. I spoke with your school.

280
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,618
Also.

281
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:17,780
Everyone knows that I'm your guardian. Who can deny me?

282
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:22,420
It's messy here.

283
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,680
Yeah?

284
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:26,999
Then clean.

285
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:30,467
It's not messy to me.

286
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:34,067
If you think it's messy, you should clean.

287
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:38,442
Stack the tables to one side and the instruments to the other.

288
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:39,667
All right.

289
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:43,399
Good luck.

290
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:45,899
Okay, okay. I'll help you.

291
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,467
You're starting to become a bit of a bummer.

292
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:07,992
You surprised me.

293
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:10,799
Oh, you got me.

294
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,792
I should get you a bell or something

295
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,592
I thought you were his mom. Oh my god.

296
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:17,551
My heart dropped.

297
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:21,218
I'm sorry. I thought you heard me.

298
00:18:21,218 --> 00:18:25,492
My heart is racing really fast.

299
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:28,899
- Isn't this place cool? 
 - It is.

300
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,576
Get up. Have some snacks.

301
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,818
Looks great.

302
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:35,192
You've been talking about your heart frequently.

303
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:36,751
Have I?

304
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:38,999
You should go to the hospital.

305
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:41,100
A lot of surprising things happened.

306
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,909
It's good, try it.

307
00:18:43,784 --> 00:18:46,567
- Is it good? 
 - Yes!

308
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:50,075
- Do you like it, too? 
 - Yeah, it's good.

309
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:57,501

310
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:02,292

311
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:11,242
 Yes, Reporter Seo.

312
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:15,999
 I can't describe the pain of losing but

313
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:20,217
 as an independent first-timer losing by 71 votes?

314
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:22,292
 It's encouraging.

315
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:27,042
 Give up? I'll be back in 4 years.

316
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:28,859
 Yes.

317
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:31,442
 All right. Okay, goodbye.

318
00:19:34,818 --> 00:19:36,492
 71 votes.

319
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:40,642
 71 votes...

320
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:43,167
 Just 71 votes.

321
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:47,542
 If the Momvelies didn't ruin my campaign party,

322
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:52,667
 I wouldn't have lost by a measly 71 votes.

323
00:19:55,142 --> 00:20:00,967
 Get rid of the placards outside get new ones and begin.

324
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:04,699
 There's no point.

325
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:10,167
 You've become weak. You'll lose again.

326
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,999
 What?

327
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:16,967
 I think I'll end my position at this point.

328
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:21,299
 Where did this insolence come from?

329
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:24,834
 Then pack up and leave.

330
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:27,609
 It's over once you give me what you promised.

331
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:28,999
 What?

332
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:33,000
 I did my part.

333
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,667
 You should take responsibility for yours.

334
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,818
 What did you do?

335
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,899
 Am I in congress? Is Jihoo with me?

336
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:45,492
 Wherever you dare, without hesitation, arrogantly speaking of promises and raising prices!

337
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:49,292
 If you took better care of the Momvelies, we would have won.

338
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:54,242
 If you didn't seek revenge on all the other moms!

339
00:20:54,242 --> 00:20:55,817
 Revenge?

340
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:01,542
 Do you think I care about that?

341
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:08,918
 The only reason I did what I did was for you.

342
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:14,667
 I believed you would win so I did all your dirty work.

343
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:19,501
 I took the blame for things I didn't do and took all the insults.

344
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:20,918
 Why?

345
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:25,918
 To get my son, my position, and everything that I lost!

346
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,517
 But your son, he ruined everything!

347
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:31,999
 What?

348
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,792
 Did we run for president? It was just for our district.

349
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:39,567
 Who cares if you're popular or if people like you?

350
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:44,067
 You made a stupid choice when you walked out that day.

351
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:49,042
 If you had just listened to me,

352
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:52,459
 we would own Seongjak district!

353
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:03,417
 Stop joking. Leave quietly.

354
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:05,434
 I'll allow you to live.

355
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:09,418
 Did you think I didn't prepare for the worst?

356
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:15,292
 You're still under investigation for attempted murder.

357
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:20,418
 I have all the evidence through Director Byun.

358
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:25,067
 You lost the campaign and Jihoo's uncle is famous.

359
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:28,542
 People will give this a lot of attention.

360
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,526
 The police and prosecutors in your pocket?

361
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:35,292
 I have evidence of your lobbying.

362
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:37,899
 I kept it for myself. Thanks for trusting me.

363
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:45,900
 Shall we watch with joy to see where and how long you can avoid the net of the law?

364
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:53,459
Yongah, Yongah! Just wait.

365
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,499
Are you serious?

366
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,517
Let's talk it out.

367
00:22:59,517 --> 00:23:01,999
I married you so I could raise Jihoo.

368
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:04,567
If he isn't here anymore, why should I be?

369
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:07,392
I told you. I want to be a mom.

370
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:08,818
We can adopt.

371
00:23:08,818 --> 00:23:12,067
Let's adopt a beautiful daughter, yeah?

372
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:13,792
Funny.

373
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,292
Do you think your mother would accept an adopted child?

374
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:21,867
She doesn't matter. We can just...

375
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:25,692
You can raise her.

376
00:23:25,692 --> 00:23:28,109
Don't kid yourself.

377
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:32,099
I can't raise the best child without your mother.

378
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:36,667
You don't even have a single building under your name.

379
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:39,692
My mom's really old.

380
00:23:39,692 --> 00:23:41,818
She doesn't have much time.

381
00:23:41,818 --> 00:23:43,542
It's all mine anyways!

382
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:46,392
What are you saying! She's healthier than me.

383
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:50,167
30 years... No, I think she's got more than 40 years left!

384
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:54,899
Also, don't forget this.

385
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:58,792
Your mom will always miss Jihoo.

386
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:02,267
To her, you're the symbol of failure and incompetence.

387
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:05,699
What inheritance will she leave for you?

388
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:14,876
So? What should I do? You really want a divorce?

389
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:16,426
Yeah.

390
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:19,918
I left divorce papers and Jihoo's belongings in his room.

391
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:21,899
Take care of it.

392
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:26,867
Divorcing me won't make you a mother.

393
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:29,192
Why not?

394
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:32,792
I'm young, healthy, and pretty.

395
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:34,542
I can have a child if I want.

396
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:37,551
You didn't want to ruin your figure.

397
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:41,192
Jihoo changed my mind.

398
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:44,600
After seeing him with his mother,

399
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:49,917
birthing my own child looked meaningful.

400
00:24:53,899 --> 00:24:58,042
You're going to divorce me and date someone else?

401
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,142
Yup.

402
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:01,999
It was fun while it lasted.

403
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,742
Bye.

404
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:13,042
Mom, what now?

405
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:14,792
What now?

406
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:17,518
Yongah left and is divorcing me!

407
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:19,042
What?

408
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:20,899
Hurry, get her back!

409
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:22,999
You disregarded me and gave me nothing.

410
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,999
That's why she has no respect for me!

411
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:27,467
Go get her now!

412
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:34,042
Where're you going?

413
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:38,417
I'm talking to you. Why are you ignoring me?

414
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:41,999
I need her!

415
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,667
She's the most fun.

416
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,818
Life isn't fun without her!

417
00:25:45,818 --> 00:25:49,542
When will you stop seeking pleasure? When?

418
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:54,799
How did I raise you for you to turn out like this?

419
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:03,099
How?

420
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:06,800
You treated me like dog shit. Did you forget?

421
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:12,417
If you just lived decently, I would've never been humiliated.

422
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:17,599
If I lived decently, you would be a forgotten old lady.

423
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:22,292
You did whatever you wanted thanks to me.

424
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:25,067
Blaming everything wrong on me.

425
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:30,492
I'm doing my best and playing the fool,

426
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:32,399
yet you lost?

427
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:36,999
You lost to Hyeryeong, Joonhyeok, and even Joonhee.

428
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:39,299
Even to Jihoo!

429
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,799
You lost to everyone.

430
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,767
Shut up!

431
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:50,699
You stupid bastard! Incompetent fool!

432
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:54,542
Oh...

433
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:59,042
It doesn't even hurt.

434
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,318
That's better.

435
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:22,667
Stop looking at me like I'm an insect.

436
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:27,642
I'm still your son.

437
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:32,717
You want to lose to your son?

438
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:39,018
What can you do?

439
00:27:40,142 --> 00:27:42,418
You useless fool.

440
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:56,842
Well, this isn't going to be fun.

441
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:27,692
Simply killing her... is too easy.

442
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:32,617
I want to torture her.

443
00:28:33,818 --> 00:28:37,390
I want her to lose sleep at night.

444
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:41,417
I want her to remind her

445
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:44,299
that I haven't forgotten.

446
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:08,042
 Yeah, Mingi.

447
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:11,918
Mom's lawyer will tell you what to say.

448
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:14,592
Make sure to memorize it.

449
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:16,499
All right?

450
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:18,392
Okay.

451
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:23,642
A custody trial will be easy.

452
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:25,799
You have the financial edge.

453
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:29,799
You're also a lot closer to him than his father.

454
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:36,600
I was worried for you when she lost the campaign.

455
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:41,642
I already spread rumors that you own this home.

456
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:44,942
How are the Momvelies?

457
00:29:44,942 --> 00:29:49,167
It all ended at the campaign party.

458
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:56,267
Sechan's mom quit being the Diamond. She left me as the leader.

459
00:29:56,267 --> 00:30:00,067
But all our Gold members quit.

460
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:05,667
Hajoon's mom won't even return calls.

461
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:11,517
Only our online marketplace and board are operational.

462
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:15,692
We can't let this happen. I've done so much for the Momvelies.

463
00:30:15,692 --> 00:30:19,099
When Mingi is back, I'll fix everything.

464
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:21,184
Really, sis?

465
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,392
Should I recruit people?

466
00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:25,192
That'd be appreciated.

467
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:32,067
Oh right, sis.

468
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:36,242
Do you have something with Sodam's father?

469
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:43,999
We had dinner once to talk about real estate matters.

470
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:45,667
I thought so.

471
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:51,017
I knew Sodam's mom was misinformed.

472
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:54,067
They have a bad relationship.

473
00:30:54,067 --> 00:30:57,567
It's common for the wife to find someone to blame.

474
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:58,667
Right?

475
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:01,818
I think she was enraged with jealously

476
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,942
and decided to come after you.

477
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:12,099
Even after pulling her hair out, I'm still pissed!

478
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:14,292
She really is a survivor though.

479
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:17,292
I was desperate because I couldn't get twenty million won for the deposit.

480
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,818
And she suddenly has a penthouse?

481
00:31:19,818 --> 00:31:21,899
Even when they lost the campaign?

482
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:25,567
If she really settles down here with Mingi...

483
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:28,799
- Should I move? 
 - No, why should you?

484
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,567
I heard he didn't cheat.

485
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:34,999
He should've, so I could take his money.

486
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:36,718
He said she was just a friend.

487
00:31:36,718 --> 00:31:39,167
They had dinner once is all.

488
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:42,992
He shits himself and says it doesn't smell.

489
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:46,542
What will you do?

490
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:47,992
Me?

491
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:51,140
I'm getting a divorce.

492
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:53,967
Really?

493
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:47,899
Yes, councilor?

494
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,542
You can't reach Mingi?

495
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:01,517
Hey, superstar!

496
00:33:01,517 --> 00:33:03,167
Uncle King!

497
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:05,542
What did you want to talk about?

498
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,492
You rude bastard. I'm your big bro.

499
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:17,167
Yongah wanted your sister to have this.

500
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:19,767
Jihoo's baby clothes and umbilical cord.

501
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:26,642
I got divorced again.

502
00:33:28,918 --> 00:33:31,542
Did you hit her?

503
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,542
Did you take her money and torture her?

504
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:36,567
No.

505
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:38,042
Anyways... Goodbye.

506
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:40,001
You know?

507
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,867
I'm going to live a simple life.

508
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:47,942
When was life complicated for you?

509
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:50,499
I'm going to have fun.

510
00:33:51,192 --> 00:33:54,742
When have you not had fun?

511
00:33:57,042 --> 00:33:59,299
Give Jihoo a lot of love.

512
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:02,892
So he doesn't turn out like me.

513
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,218
Hey.

514
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:13,567
Do you think you turned out like that because she didn't love you?

515
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:18,099
Are you in middle school? You're too old for that excuse.

516
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:20,034
You just...

517
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:24,767
enjoy being a piece of shit.

518
00:34:33,342 --> 00:34:35,742
You're always right.

519
00:34:36,692 --> 00:34:41,417
Don't be surprised because of me.

520
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:43,042
I'll be more famous than you.

521
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:45,667
With what? You're going to sing?

522
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,542
Hey.

523
00:34:47,542 --> 00:34:50,167
I'm the son of Gangto Money.

524
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,992
A singer?

525
00:34:51,992 --> 00:34:54,276
What are you saying?

526
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:59,542
I warned you not to be startled!

527
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:34,092
Oh my goodness...

528
00:35:34,918 --> 00:35:36,934
Does it look better here?

529
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:42,167
Hey! Another one?

530
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:44,699
Yeah, I have to hang it.

531
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:47,042
Put it up in your room.

532
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:51,142
Aren't you moving in a week? It's none of your business.

533
00:35:51,142 --> 00:35:55,917
 Gangto Money is facing a crisis due to allegations of corruption.

534
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:59,792
 Financial Crimes Unit says CEO Min Kyungsoo

535
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:02,142
 created various overseas paper companies.

536
00:36:02,142 --> 00:36:07,999
 Illegally borrowed billions of won from Gangto Money.

537
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,167
 Interpol is on the hunt for Min Kyungsoo.

538
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,792
He's famous now all right...

539
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:12,292
 A red investigation has been issued.

540
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:14,299
He really messed up.

541
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:16,175
I'm leaving.

542
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:19,209
Okay, bye.

543
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:24,999
Where are you?

544
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:27,367
I said, where are you?

545
00:36:28,918 --> 00:36:31,192
Why do you want to know?

546
00:36:31,192 --> 00:36:33,242
You want to get me?

547
00:36:34,918 --> 00:36:39,967
How could... How could you do this? Huh?

548
00:36:40,718 --> 00:36:43,492
A search and seizure came in.

549
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:51,799
Come back and fix this.

550
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:54,942
Bring me back my money!

551
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:56,992
Wow...

552
00:36:56,992 --> 00:37:01,276
Quiet down. Think of your blood pressure.

553
00:37:01,276 --> 00:37:03,417
 It's all my money anyways.

554
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:06,967
I'm just changing the timeline.

555
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:11,201
Oh, and your lobbying allegations? I reported that.

556
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,999
 You should stock up on vitamins.

557
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,867
The rest of your life will be difficult.

558
00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:25,099
How could you do this? To your own mother?

559
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:27,792
That's what I want to ask you!

560
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:30,499
I told you to stop ignoring me!

561
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:33,099
 You said I couldn't do anything!

562
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:34,792
How's this?

563
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:38,692
Your insect son just destroyed your empire!

564
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:43,467
 I don't care how you feel.

565
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:45,599
 I'm having a blast.

566
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:49,092
This is incredibly fun!

567
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:26,117
- That's a lot... 
 - But I...

568
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:29,092
Mo...

569
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:30,792
Who are you?

570
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:33,199
I'm Mingi's mother.

571
00:38:33,651 --> 00:38:36,392
No, you're not.

572
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,717
I'll call you later.

573
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:47,567
What's this?

574
00:38:47,567 --> 00:38:50,567
It's not a visitation day. Why are you here?

575
00:38:51,899 --> 00:38:56,117
What did you tell my lawyer?

576
00:38:56,117 --> 00:38:58,918
You don't want to talk to me?

577
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:01,542
How did that house become yours?

578
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:05,292
What do you mean? I worked very hard for it.

579
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:06,792
What work?

580
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:11,042
How can you work and get such a home so fast?

581
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:13,042
It's impossible.

582
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:15,184
You know that too.

583
00:39:15,718 --> 00:39:17,292
Mingi.

584
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:18,999
I...

585
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:21,792
would do anything for you.

586
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,818
Don't say it's for me.

587
00:39:23,818 --> 00:39:26,499
I like my home right now.

588
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:28,867
What...

589
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,526
What are you saying?

590
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:33,417
The lawyer told me.

591
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:36,299
I don't have to live with you if I don't want to.

592
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:43,292
You don't want to live with me? You don't like me?

593
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:46,517
I don't want to live with you! I really don't!

594
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,318
You just...

595
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:52,667
want to turn me into a trophy!

596
00:39:58,818 --> 00:40:00,617
Mom,

597
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:04,242
just live an honest life.

598
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:08,767
What are you saying? What did I do wrong?

599
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:13,967
If you didn't, why is a strange man following me?

600
00:40:15,818 --> 00:40:18,118
Even to you?

601
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:27,392
Mingi, let's go abroad.

602
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,999
Let's go to your sister.

603
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:31,318
Let's live together.

604
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:37,299
Do you think she'll see you again?

605
00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:39,818
She hates you.

606
00:40:39,818 --> 00:40:42,017
She'll never meet you!

607
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,017
Why?

608
00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:48,292
What did I do that was so wrong?

609
00:40:48,292 --> 00:40:51,542
I just wanted to make you two the best!

610
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:53,767
Please just stop.

611
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:57,067
Just...

612
00:40:58,042 --> 00:41:00,967
can't you be like the other moms?

613
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:04,918
What?

614
00:41:04,918 --> 00:41:08,076
You don't have to be fancy or successful.

615
00:41:09,242 --> 00:41:13,917
Is there no way for you to just be a mom?

616
00:41:21,918 --> 00:41:24,142
Stop being weak.

617
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:26,767
You can't achieve anything!

618
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:33,599
Don't ever contact me.

619
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:35,892
Min-Mingi.

620
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:37,292
Mingi!

621
00:41:37,292 --> 00:41:38,942
Mingi!

622
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:07,592
Jihoo, try it.

623
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,392
Thank you.

624
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:13,842
Why is uncle late?

625
00:42:13,842 --> 00:42:16,799
He's recording for his album.

626
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:18,342
He'll be here after.

627
00:42:18,342 --> 00:42:20,817
How's practice?

628
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:25,117
What practice?

629
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:32,767
It's...

630
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:37,292
An after-school jump rope competition.

631
00:42:37,292 --> 00:42:39,418
Jump rope competition?

632
00:42:39,418 --> 00:42:41,942
Why didn't you tell me?

633
00:42:44,501 --> 00:42:46,999
He told me.

634
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:51,392
I was watching the two of them do jump ropes.

635
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:53,542
I see.

636
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:55,699
Please, enjoy.

637
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,859
- Let's eat. 
 - Let's eat.

638
00:42:57,859 --> 00:42:59,767
It's delicious.

639
00:43:01,392 --> 00:43:07,292
Should I come when you meet Noeul's grandmother?

640
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:09,942
Why would you go with them?

641
00:43:09,942 --> 00:43:13,599
Why? So I can PR for my mom.

642
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,099
Don't worry, Jihoo.

643
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:18,917
I can do a better job than you.

644
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:23,042
It's a shame.

645
00:43:23,042 --> 00:43:25,099
You only registered your marriage.

646
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:28,870
Mom, you've never had a wedding dress.

647
00:43:29,799 --> 00:43:33,099
Every woman wants a wedding dress.

648
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:36,651
I really don't. It's embarrassing.

649
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:38,418
Let's eat.

650
00:43:44,918 --> 00:43:49,499
 The number you have dialed is unavailable...

651
00:44:03,492 --> 00:44:05,692
 Do you know why I stand by Mrs. President?

652
00:44:05,692 --> 00:44:07,759
 She's powerful.

653
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:11,167
 I want to win and take what's mine!

654
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:13,392
 Which is why...

655
00:44:14,092 --> 00:44:17,318
 You'll never have anything.

656
00:44:18,092 --> 00:44:22,399
 I don't want to live with you! I really don't!

657
00:44:23,442 --> 00:44:25,699
 I jumped because of you.

658
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:29,392
 I'd rather die than live as your daughter!

659
00:44:56,217 --> 00:44:59,392
What the hell are you doing?

660
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:04,942
Let go! Get off of me!

661
00:45:04,942 --> 00:45:07,518
Come to your senses!

662
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:12,067
I left you out to die. I didn't care.

663
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:15,367
So, I want you to just leave me alone.

664
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:16,342
Let go of me!

665
00:45:16,342 --> 00:45:17,999
What about your kids?

666
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:20,442
Think of your children!

667
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:27,192
Do you want them to live like my sister and me?

668
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:30,567
If you go like this, who'll take care of them?

669
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:32,083
Think about your kids!

670
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:35,699
They don't need me! I'm not even their mother!

671
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:39,217
I just...

672
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:45,717
did my best... That's all.

673
00:45:48,692 --> 00:45:51,892
What's so wrong?

674
00:46:11,999 --> 00:46:14,167
 I'm sincerely worried about you.

675
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:17,699
 Not for you but for your children.

676
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:22,442
 Your children need a mother no matter what kind. So...

677
00:46:53,799 --> 00:46:55,899
 Eating without sharing?

678
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:57,799
 You'll gain weight if you eat right now.

679
00:46:57,799 --> 00:47:00,592
 I'm still growing taller!

680
00:47:00,592 --> 00:47:03,499
 - Hurry, let's eat together. 
 - Okay.

681
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:08,999
 - Doesn't it look good? 
 - It does.

682
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:10,818
 You get one slice, the rest are mine.

683
00:47:10,818 --> 00:47:13,042
 - Why? 
 - I need to eat a lot to grow.

684
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:15,067
 - I'm growing too! 
 - You're right.

685
00:47:15,067 --> 00:47:16,592
 Then you can have two.

686
00:47:16,592 --> 00:47:18,317
 - You're so greedy. 
 - Fine.

687
00:47:18,317 --> 00:47:20,899
 Fine, let's have a half each. Which one do you want?

688
00:47:20,899 --> 00:47:22,142
 I'll have this part to...

689
00:47:22,142 --> 00:47:26,330
 Mom come, let's eat. Hurry.

690
00:47:38,467 --> 00:47:41,292
 You don't have to be fancy or successful.

691
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:45,710
 Can't you just be a mom?

692
00:47:56,742 --> 00:48:01,292
You really aren't having a wedding?

693
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:03,842
What do you mean "wedding?"

694
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:06,418
I really don't want one.

695
00:48:16,867 --> 00:48:19,167
Yes, Mr. Kim.

696
00:48:50,242 --> 00:48:52,942
What are you doing?

697
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:56,599
Go to your room and study.

698
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:03,017
Listen to me, Kyungsoo.

699
00:49:05,992 --> 00:49:10,167
If you want respect you must succeed.

700
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:14,400
Study hard to become the best, okay?

701
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:24,492
Shouldn't she go to the hospital?

702
00:49:24,492 --> 00:49:28,784
She becomes enraged when she comes to her senses.

703
00:49:28,784 --> 00:49:34,599
Nobody has been able to deal with her.

704
00:49:36,418 --> 00:49:40,042
I had no choice but to contact her.

705
00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:42,376
She agreed to come.

706
00:49:42,376 --> 00:49:44,299
Who?

707
00:50:15,899 --> 00:50:17,434
 Give it to me!

708
00:50:17,434 --> 00:50:19,767
 Shut up!

709
00:50:21,699 --> 00:50:25,467
 You lied and changed his cram lessons?

710
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:28,342
 Is it my fault for being an orphan? Is it my brother's fault?

711
00:50:28,342 --> 00:50:32,918
 How can you hate someone for such reasons?

712
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:36,092
Let it go.

713
00:50:36,092 --> 00:50:39,017
Just forget it, okay?

714
00:50:40,175 --> 00:50:43,967
- Will you be okay? 
 - What can I do?

715
00:50:43,967 --> 00:50:47,684
She refuses nursing homes and everyone else.

716
00:50:48,367 --> 00:50:50,792
It'll be difficult.

717
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:54,276
But I have worked for her since I was young.

718
00:50:54,276 --> 00:51:00,699
I'm the only one who can understand why she's the way she is.

719
00:51:03,117 --> 00:51:05,718
Never come back here.

720
00:51:05,718 --> 00:51:11,292
Don't look back. Live a long and happy life.

721
00:51:11,292 --> 00:51:13,418
Understand?

722
00:51:41,542 --> 00:51:42,999
Hello.

723
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,984
Is there something you're looking for?

724
00:51:44,984 --> 00:51:46,899
I'm looking for a gift.

725
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:50,192
Something that'll be really romantic.

726
00:51:50,192 --> 00:51:53,167
This is a popular choice for a gift.

727
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:56,284
Just apply it under your eyes...

728
00:51:56,284 --> 00:52:00,999
Around your mouth, and neck. It's very convenient.

729
00:52:00,999 --> 00:52:03,492
- Want to try? 
 - Oh, thank you.

730
00:52:04,759 --> 00:52:07,399
- It's a best seller? 
 - Yes.

731
00:52:11,392 --> 00:52:14,042
You were going to say "I found it on the floor"?

732
00:52:14,042 --> 00:52:17,199
You always read my mind, Beanie girl.

733
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:21,242
No, you read my mind. I really wanted to buy this.

734
00:52:21,242 --> 00:52:22,899
Really? Really?

735
00:52:22,899 --> 00:52:25,042
I bought the best ones.

736
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:27,592
Thank you.

737
00:52:27,592 --> 00:52:30,267
I heard you do it like this...

738
00:52:30,267 --> 00:52:32,899
Like this, and this.

739
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:36,492
The employee taught me too. Here...

740
00:52:36,492 --> 00:52:38,517
How's it?

741
00:52:39,192 --> 00:52:41,899
It's refreshing. Thank you.

742
00:52:41,899 --> 00:52:43,999
If you're thankful...

743
00:52:46,899 --> 00:52:48,867
Suddenly shy?

744
00:52:48,867 --> 00:52:51,799
You aren't J. King anymore. Uncle King is famous.

745
00:52:51,799 --> 00:52:53,999
You can't afford to lose fans.

746
00:52:53,999 --> 00:52:55,799
It's not a big deal.

747
00:52:55,799 --> 00:52:58,699
Everyone knows you're Uncle Queen.

748
00:52:58,699 --> 00:53:03,792
Don't you know our King's Family wants me to get married?

749
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:09,792
So, your sister is moving into Noeul's place, next week?

750
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:11,167
Yeah.

751
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:15,151
Then can I move into your empty room?

752
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:16,367
Huh?

753
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:18,799
Jihoo's room or your sister's room is fine.

754
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:22,442
Jihoo's room will be my office. I plan on using my sisters.

755
00:53:22,442 --> 00:53:25,718
- Then what about your room? 
 - It's my dressing room.

756
00:53:25,718 --> 00:53:27,799
You're seriously blocking me out?

757
00:53:27,799 --> 00:53:33,092
Fine. I'll just sleep in the streets.

758
00:53:33,092 --> 00:53:35,399
When does your lease end?

759
00:53:35,399 --> 00:53:38,083
Next year, fall.

760
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:39,942
That's far away.

761
00:53:39,942 --> 00:53:42,767
I want to see you every day.

762
00:53:42,767 --> 00:53:44,992
Still, I don't think it's a good idea.

763
00:53:44,992 --> 00:53:47,117
No.

764
00:53:47,718 --> 00:53:49,567
No?

765
00:53:54,918 --> 00:53:58,392
Fine, fine, fine. I was joking.

766
00:53:58,392 --> 00:54:02,799
Let's figure out a way before your lease ends.

767
00:54:02,799 --> 00:54:06,317
But casually living together is still a bad idea.

768
00:54:06,317 --> 00:54:10,799
I'll prepare something special. Just wait.

769
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:12,217
It doesn't have to be special.

770
00:54:12,217 --> 00:54:14,042
No. I want it to be.

771
00:54:16,217 --> 00:54:20,442
- Well, cheers! 
 - Cheers!

772
00:54:20,442 --> 00:54:23,367
- Cheers, right? 
 - Yeah.

773
00:54:26,342 --> 00:54:29,367
- Looking for work? 
 - Yes, boss.

774
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:32,699
I hurried over as soon as I heard you were hiring.

775
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:36,842
If you give me an opportunity, I'll do my very best.

776
00:54:36,842 --> 00:54:40,300
But you're the Momvely Diamond.

777
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:44,299
Diamond? What is that? Is it a pyramid scheme?

778
00:54:44,299 --> 00:54:48,067
Mingi's mom moved and Jihong's mom left.

779
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:51,492
There's no Diamond or Gold anymore.

780
00:54:51,492 --> 00:54:57,117
Boss, I just need to make money to raise my child.

781
00:54:57,117 --> 00:55:01,042
She's well connected in this neighborhood.

782
00:55:01,042 --> 00:55:05,692
Of course! I'm really confident in sales!

783
00:55:05,692 --> 00:55:12,217
Boss, I know we haven't always seen eye to eye.

784
00:55:12,217 --> 00:55:18,809
But if you can put away your hate and give me a chance...

785
00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:20,367
Hate?

786
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:21,799
I have none.

787
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:25,517
You even helped us with Jihoo.

788
00:55:25,517 --> 00:55:29,417
Well then, let's call it even.

789
00:55:29,417 --> 00:55:34,392
A fresh start as employee and boss. Okay?

790
00:55:34,392 --> 00:55:36,042
Welcome, dear customer.

791
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:39,517
We have pretzels, hot dogs, and donuts.

792
00:55:39,517 --> 00:55:40,692
Also, a sweet rice drink.

793
00:55:40,692 --> 00:55:42,042
Oh, and did you know?

794
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:44,092
This shop is our neighborhood's pride.

795
00:55:44,092 --> 00:55:48,842
It's Uncle King's sister's donut shop!

796
00:55:48,842 --> 00:55:49,792
Hello.

797
00:55:49,792 --> 00:55:52,970
- I'll have a look. 
 - Everything is delicious.

798
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:05,110

799
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:09,184
Don't mess with my face!

800
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:15,234
The concept is a family-style concert open to all ages.

801
00:56:15,234 --> 00:56:19,299
We'll set everything up to feel cozy and comfortable.

802
00:56:19,299 --> 00:56:20,799
- Good, good! 
 - Okay.

803
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,009
- Director? 
 - Yes?

804
00:56:22,009 --> 00:56:26,675
Should we film a sketch video of us practicing?

805
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:29,059
We really needed a video.

806
00:56:29,059 --> 00:56:34,059
Jihoo, you are a genius!

807
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:37,859
After this concert, I want you to sign with us!

808
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:41,384
No, he'll have so many offers!

809
00:56:41,384 --> 00:56:44,534
Let's practice with our band next week.

810
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:48,459
Hwaeum, can you take care of styling them?

811
00:56:48,459 --> 00:56:52,534
I've already prepared some concepts. Want to see?

812
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,483
Already?

813
00:56:54,483 --> 00:56:56,399
I'll bring them.

814
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:59,459
- Umm, hey... 
 - Yes?

815
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:01,599
- Between here... 
 - Yes.

816
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,599
Can I add a section for my proposal?

817
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,683
Really?

818
00:57:07,683 --> 00:57:10,559
Making a family at a family concert!

819
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,209
- It's perf... 
 - Shush!

820
00:57:12,209 --> 00:57:14,834
- What's perfect? 
 - Shush!

821
00:57:14,834 --> 00:57:16,459
- Shush! 
 - Shush!

822
00:57:16,459 --> 00:57:17,999
- Shush! 
 - Shush!

823
00:57:17,999 --> 00:57:20,209
Shush!

824
00:57:20,209 --> 00:57:22,159
Shush!

825
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:24,234
Shush!

826
00:57:25,584 --> 00:57:27,783
My dear friend.

827
00:57:28,409 --> 00:57:31,184
Here's another.

828
00:57:31,184 --> 00:57:33,609
You just wear this?

829
00:57:33,609 --> 00:57:35,883
It's a honeymoon. This is the basics.

830
00:57:35,883 --> 00:57:38,109
Try it on. Come on, try it on.

831
00:57:38,109 --> 00:57:40,899
It's practically see-through!

832
00:57:41,799 --> 00:57:43,434
Welcome home.

833
00:57:43,434 --> 00:57:46,134
How are you coming home together?

834
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:49,859
Is this a coincidence?

835
00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:51,417
Yeah.

836
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:55,167
Yup. We just met.

837
00:57:56,409 --> 00:57:57,799
Try this on, too.

838
00:57:57,799 --> 00:57:59,526
Ta-tata! Da-da-da!

839
00:57:59,526 --> 00:58:01,809
So many leopard prints...

840
00:58:01,809 --> 00:58:05,009
Huh? What's all this? What are you both doing?

841
00:58:05,009 --> 00:58:09,000
She had nothing to wear on her honeymoon.

842
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,701
I told her to buy clothes but she wants to save money.

843
00:58:13,701 --> 00:58:15,800
Just buy some clothes.

844
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,225
I'll get paid a lot after my concert.

845
00:58:18,225 --> 00:58:19,626
It's fine.

846
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:22,226
Save that for your marriage.

847
00:58:22,226 --> 00:58:24,626
I'm actually about to propose.

848
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,899
Oh! Oh my, no way!

849
00:58:26,899 --> 00:58:30,676
It's like this house is dripping in honey.

850
00:58:30,676 --> 00:58:32,000
Shush! It's a secret!

851
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,759
Shush!

852
00:58:35,576 --> 00:58:38,851
This really isn't my style.

853
00:58:38,851 --> 00:58:41,575
♪ My uncle ♪

854
00:58:41,575 --> 00:58:47,550
♪ Don't try to protect me ♪

855
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:54,999
♪ I don't want a Superman ♪

856
00:58:54,999 --> 00:59:00,967
♪ I just want you beside me ♪

857
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:10,342
♪ Just be on my side ♪

858
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:15,399
♪ You're my best friend ♪

859
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,350
It's so touching.

860
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:25,826
- I'm tearing up. 
 - Indeed.

861
00:59:25,826 --> 00:59:28,225
We're late! We have to home! Hurry, hurry!

862
00:59:28,225 --> 00:59:32,125
Say goodbye. Thank you!  See you tomorrow!

863
00:59:32,125 --> 00:59:34,276
- Good work, Jihoo. 
 - We're so late...

864
00:59:34,276 --> 00:59:37,099
Ticket sales open tomorrow...

865
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:40,125
...is what I wanted to say but they just left.

866
00:59:43,025 --> 00:59:48,651
Boss, Uncle King's tickets sold out immediately.

867
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:51,676
- Really? 
 - Yes.

868
00:59:51,676 --> 00:59:55,899
Sechan really wants to go. Can you get us two?

869
00:59:55,899 --> 00:59:57,301
Of course.

870
00:59:57,301 --> 00:59:59,799
I have leftover tickets for our family.

871
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:02,700
Nice, thank you.

872
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,576
You must be so happy.

873
01:00:04,576 --> 01:00:06,376
Only happiness is to come.

874
01:00:06,376 --> 01:00:11,226
You're getting married. Your brother and son are stars.

875
01:00:11,226 --> 01:00:12,899
Why is Jihoo a star?

876
01:00:12,899 --> 01:00:18,026
After the duet concert, he'll be more famous than his uncle.

877
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:23,999
Jihoo... is doing a duet?

878
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:25,599
Yup.

879
01:00:34,899 --> 01:00:39,975
Everyone got together to deceive me?

880
01:00:39,975 --> 01:00:42,601
Don't take it so personally.

881
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:45,375
I thought it was a terrible idea.

882
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:49,899
You all said you hate lies and deceit.

883
01:00:49,899 --> 01:00:51,375
You're changing sides just like that?

884
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:53,575
Min Jihoo.

885
01:00:53,575 --> 01:00:57,175
Sis, let me explain.

886
01:00:57,175 --> 01:01:00,642
I respect and support Jihoo's decision.

887
01:01:00,642 --> 01:01:02,876
As parents, we aren't forcing him to do anything.

888
01:01:02,876 --> 01:01:05,950
He's doing what he wants and...

889
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,800
Noeul, your father is in pain.

890
01:01:14,401 --> 01:01:17,775
The concert is sold out. It's a huge hit!

891
01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:22,100
Can't you be happy for us and support us?

892
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:25,975
You words are a bit too harsh...

893
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,125
You're making it seem like I'm a bad mother.

894
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:33,401
Sis, I understand that you're worried.

895
01:01:33,401 --> 01:01:37,099
But Jihoo's job compatibility test results

896
01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:40,976
proved he's suited to be a musician.

897
01:01:40,976 --> 01:01:44,225
I'm not disagreeing for no reason.

898
01:01:46,501 --> 01:01:51,751
I know he's talented and I'm proud of him.

899
01:01:51,751 --> 01:01:57,434
To me, he's perfectly lovable but to others, he might not be.

900
01:01:57,434 --> 01:02:00,099
I don't want him to get hurt.

901
01:02:00,099 --> 01:02:03,826
I worry about him more than anyone.

902
01:02:03,826 --> 01:02:07,275
I sincerely want to perform with him.

903
01:02:07,275 --> 01:02:10,950
I'm not using him for my own gains.

904
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:12,550
He's really talented.

905
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:15,000
I'm almost jealous of him.

906
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,325
This is a rare opportunity.

907
01:02:17,325 --> 01:02:20,325
There's a heart throbbing emotional feeling on stage.

908
01:02:20,325 --> 01:02:22,625
I want him to feel it, too.

909
01:02:40,918 --> 01:02:43,067
Follow her.

910
01:02:43,067 --> 01:02:45,426
Hurry, hurry.

911
01:02:48,709 --> 01:02:50,967
My knees are so sore.

912
01:02:55,025 --> 01:02:59,600
Mom, I really messed up.

913
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,901
I'm sorry I lied.

914
01:03:04,876 --> 01:03:06,700
Jihoo.

915
01:03:07,626 --> 01:03:09,451
Sit down.

916
01:03:11,899 --> 01:03:15,900
I support you no matter what,

917
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,426
with whatever makes you happy every day.

918
01:03:19,426 --> 01:03:21,099
But I think...

919
01:03:21,099 --> 01:03:24,725
You're still too young to be doing this.

920
01:03:24,725 --> 01:03:26,359
I know.

921
01:03:26,359 --> 01:03:31,076
I know why you're worried. Yeah?

922
01:03:31,076 --> 01:03:33,375
Do you really want this?

923
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:37,776
Uncle's losing followers and subscribers.

924
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:40,676
He's finally famous.

925
01:03:40,676 --> 01:03:44,299
This is his last chance to make it.

926
01:03:44,299 --> 01:03:47,850
He can't do the concert without me.

927
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:51,050
I really want to help my uncle.

928
01:03:52,899 --> 01:03:58,399
He's always protected and done everything for me.

929
01:03:58,399 --> 01:04:03,017
This is why I really want to do this.

930
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:09,501
All right. I understand.

931
01:04:09,501 --> 01:04:13,676
I might make a mistake and get hurt,

932
01:04:13,676 --> 01:04:15,925
but I'll be okay.

933
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:24,600
I have you and Uncle and everyone else. I have people that love me.  I know this.

934
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:29,450
So whatever happens, I'll get through it.

935
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,976
What do I do with you?

936
01:04:45,626 --> 01:04:49,300
I think she's really mad at us.

937
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:52,050
We sold out the tickets...

938
01:04:52,751 --> 01:04:55,075
I'll try talking to her.

939
01:04:55,676 --> 01:04:57,776
Dad, stay out of this.

940
01:04:57,776 --> 01:05:00,699
Do you want to be alone?

941
01:05:00,699 --> 01:05:02,751
Come to your senses!

942
01:05:02,751 --> 01:05:06,225
Yeah, Big Bro. Stay out of this.

943
01:05:06,225 --> 01:05:08,651
She might dump you.

944
01:05:08,651 --> 01:05:10,450
- Really? 
 - Yes.

945
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:14,426
You must take her side. She might dump you.

946
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:35,250
We'll discuss becoming a trainee later.

947
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:40,299
I understand the situation.

948
01:05:40,299 --> 01:05:41,751
I'll be supportive.

949
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:43,526
- Wow! 
 - But!

950
01:05:43,526 --> 01:05:45,000
But...

951
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
it's just this once.

952
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,576
We have your blessing?

953
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:53,375
Good decision! I'm glad you came around.

954
01:05:56,167 --> 01:05:58,742
- I want a hug, too. 
 - Me too!

955
01:05:58,742 --> 01:06:01,800
Me too!

956
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,000
- I'm so happy for you! 
 - We did it!

957
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,999
- Do well, Jihoo! 
 - Yes!

958
01:06:05,999 --> 01:06:07,890
- I'll kill it! 
 - You better do well!

959
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:10,090
Yeah, you better do well!

960
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:11,000
Come here!

961
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Do well!

962
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:20,525
This is our first time walking in as a married couple.

963
01:06:20,525 --> 01:06:22,350
It doesn't feel real.

964
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:24,650
Maybe it will when we're in Bali.

965
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:27,350
Joonhyeok said he prepared food. Let's eat and go.

966
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:30,426
Yeah, I don't want to keep your mother waiting.

967
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,125
Hey!

968
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:36,480
- Surprise! 
 - Surprise!

969
01:06:41,876 --> 01:06:44,925
What's all this?

970
01:06:45,676 --> 01:06:47,375
Did you know?

971
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:51,799
What's all this? I really didn't know.

972
01:06:53,651 --> 01:06:54,626
Sis.

973
01:06:54,626 --> 01:06:57,050
I prepared something. Please follow me.

974
01:06:57,050 --> 01:07:01,100
What did you prepare?

975
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,242
- You overdid it! 
 - Please come in.

976
01:07:03,242 --> 01:07:04,601
- Follow me. 
 - See you in a bit.

977
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:07,626
- Try this on. 
 - Okay, thank you.

978
01:07:07,626 --> 01:07:08,851
Well?

979
01:07:08,851 --> 01:07:10,501
- You look awesome. 
 - You think?

980
01:07:10,501 --> 01:07:13,090
Yeah, the best!

981
01:07:28,851 --> 01:07:32,400
My sister's so pretty.

982
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,650
Don't say anything. I don't want to cry.

983
01:07:44,325 --> 01:07:46,150
Big Brother,

984
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:48,951
please take good care of my sister.

985
01:07:48,951 --> 01:07:54,325
She's had to take care of others her entire life.

986
01:07:54,325 --> 01:07:58,150
She never had time to be loved.

987
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:00,399
Take good care of her.

988
01:08:30,225 --> 01:08:32,899
Okay, now! We'll begin the vows.

989
01:08:32,899 --> 01:08:35,350
Son and daughter!

990
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:38,099
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

991
01:08:44,225 --> 01:08:48,576
I, Kyungil, take you, Joonhee, to be my lawfully wedded wife.

992
01:08:48,576 --> 01:08:53,376
I solemnly vow to love and cherish you forever.

993
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:59,301
I, Joonhee, take you, Kyungil, to be my lawfully wedded husband.

994
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,699
We can't hear you!

995
01:09:04,999 --> 01:09:10,401
I solemnly vow to love and cherish you forever.

996
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,651
- Kiss! 
 - Kiss!

997
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:17,501
- Kiss! 
 - Kiss!

998
01:09:17,501 --> 01:09:21,430
- Kiss! 
 - Kiss!

999
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:37,100
And now...

1000
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:41,751
two people, very difficult to meet have come all this way

1001
01:09:41,751 --> 01:09:44,350
in order to celebrate the newlyweds.

1002
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:47,876
They're waiting in the other room. Shall we meet them?

1003
01:09:47,876 --> 01:09:49,125
- The office? 
 - Yes, the home office.

1004
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:50,775
- Come out. 
 - Please come out.

1005
01:09:50,775 --> 01:09:56,990

 It must've been difficult, Joonhee.

1021
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,942
 I'll make sure you're loved.

1022
01:10:56,942 --> 01:10:58,399
Everyone, smile!

1023
01:10:58,399 --> 01:10:59,426
- Let's do this! 
 - Hurry over.

1024
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:00,475
Hurry! Hurry!

1025
01:11:00,475 --> 01:11:02,751
1, 2, 3!

1026
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:08,999
Have fun!

1027
01:11:08,999 --> 01:11:11,701
- Mom! Dad! 
 - Mom, be safe!

1028
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:13,626
- Have fun! 
 - Goodbye!

1029
01:11:13,626 --> 01:11:17,799
Get out of here. Hurry.

1030
01:11:17,799 --> 01:11:20,970
- Bye, Dad! 
 - Bye, Mom!

1031
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,276
Hey, focus!

1032
01:11:30,276 --> 01:11:31,599
Shoot better, come on!

1033
01:11:31,599 --> 01:11:32,950
What're you doing?

1034
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:35,999
Children? Why aren't you in bed?

1035
01:11:35,999 --> 01:11:37,626
Let's go brush our teeth, please.

1036
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:39,199
Hurry up.

1037
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,476
The both of you, up.

1038
01:11:41,476 --> 01:11:43,626
We should brush our teeth.

1039
01:11:43,626 --> 01:11:47,826
Will you stay with us until our parents come?

1040
01:11:47,826 --> 01:11:50,651
Yes. I'm really happy.

1041
01:11:50,651 --> 01:11:53,999
Teacher, you're like a bulldozer.

1042
01:11:53,999 --> 01:11:57,801
But where's Uncle?

1043
01:11:57,801 --> 01:12:01,999
He disappeared back at my house.

1044
01:12:01,999 --> 01:12:06,325
Wasn't he going out to get a beer? Where is he?

1045
01:12:06,325 --> 01:12:09,626
Then can we order delivery food?

1046
01:12:09,626 --> 01:12:11,601
- Jellyfish salad. 
 - No, fried chicken...

1047
01:12:11,601 --> 01:12:13,151
No!

1048
01:12:13,151 --> 01:12:17,501
If you don't digest everything, you'll lose quality sleep.

1049
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:19,300
Then you won't grow tall.

1050
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:22,450
Go brush your teeth.

1051
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:25,999
I'm at home but why do I feel like I'm at school?

1052
01:12:25,999 --> 01:12:28,599
Let's brush our teeth.

1053
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:38,799
Hello? Where are you? What's taking so long?

1054
01:12:38,799 --> 01:12:40,300
 Sorry.

1055
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:43,201
 Director Son urgently needed to see me.

1056
01:12:43,201 --> 01:12:47,326
Really? So you're at the office?

1057
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:51,450
All right. Don't worry about the children.

1058
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,999
 Okay, thank you.

1059
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:03,499
How do you feel, Uncle King?

1060
01:13:03,499 --> 01:13:06,000
Wasn't an intern-doctor my fan?

1061
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,426
Oh, you're here.

1062
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:11,751
He's our cardiologist. Thankfully he's on-call today.

1063
01:13:11,751 --> 01:13:14,676
Oh... But why...

1064
01:13:14,676 --> 01:13:17,375
What's wrong? Is it serious?

1065
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:22,099
Your heart is enlarged, so we did an ultrasound.

1066
01:13:22,099 --> 01:13:28,051
Your heart is dilated and dysfunctional.

1067
01:13:28,051 --> 01:13:30,375
What'll happen?

1068
01:13:30,375 --> 01:13:32,626
Do I need to take pills?

1069
01:13:32,626 --> 01:13:35,999
I have a concert in 2 weeks.

1070
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:39,899
Cancel it, you must be admitted.

1071
01:13:39,899 --> 01:13:41,899
What?

1072
01:13:41,899 --> 01:13:45,142
You have dilated cardiomyopathy.

1073
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:49,326
Huh?

1074
01:13:50,751 --> 01:13:53,351
What are you even saying?

1075
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:16,000

1076
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:46,640

1077
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,734
 That doesn't make sense.

1078
01:14:47,734 --> 01:14:50,801
 My heart can't take two weeks?

1079
01:14:50,801 --> 01:14:53,175
 If you focus on the emotion, people won't even notice your mistakes.

1080
01:14:53,175 --> 01:14:54,799
 Should we do a dance?

1081
01:14:54,799 --> 01:14:59,392
 Jihoo will be disappointed if we cancel the concert.

1082
01:15:00,759 --> 01:15:02,309
 The hospital?

1083
01:15:02,309 --> 01:15:03,699
 Is the concert important?

1084
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:06,234
 What do you mean it isn't serious? Let's go back now!

1085
01:15:06,234 --> 01:15:08,359
 You know how hard Jihoo prepared.

1086
01:15:08,359 --> 01:15:09,167
 Hwaeum...

1087
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:12,342
 Even if you leave me, I'll be all right.

1088
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:16,742
 Just let me know that you're safe.

1089
01:15:16,742 --> 01:15:19,899
 How could... Why did this suddenly happen?

1090
01:15:19,899 --> 01:15:22,551
 We can do it when I'm healthy.

1091
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,359
 Nothing bad will happen to him.

1092
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:26,626
 Your only option is a heart transplant.

1093
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,500
 Uncle! Uncle!

1094
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:33,700
 Sorry for being sick.

1095
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:39,430
