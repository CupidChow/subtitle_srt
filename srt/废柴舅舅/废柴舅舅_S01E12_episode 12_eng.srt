1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,380

2
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:11,401

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,809

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,999

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,467

6
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:33,484

7
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:37,792

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,980

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,059

10
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:53,217
Or can we ask where we can buy them?

11
00:00:53,217 --> 00:00:56,899
I want to post them all over my ceiling.

12
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:00,618
The left side of your face looks so much better.

13
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:04,892
This place is better than I thought.

14
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:06,692
This sucks, right?

15
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,799
Don't say that. It's really cool.

16
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,899
I looked into this company. Their staff is famous for being professionals.

17
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:17,899
Who else would give me a contract during my probation?

18
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:21,342
Exactly. Which is why we should be happy!

19
00:01:21,992 --> 00:01:27,399
Teacher, I think I've misunderstood this world we live in.

20
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:33,317
I thought you would just leave me as soon as things went bad.

21
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:36,792
Me? You don't know me then.

22
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:42,899
A pretty, kind, perfect person like you, I never understood why you liked me.

23
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,499
But since such an incredible person likes me,

24
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:51,499
it makes me feel like I'm not so bad.

25
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:53,967
Are you thankful?

26
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:57,399
- I'm thankful.  
 - If you are...

27
00:01:58,492 --> 00:02:01,542
We can't do that here.

28
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:06,699
- Why not? 
 - Come on, Teacher.

29
00:02:08,092 --> 00:02:10,467
I made some money!

30
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:12,999
Hurry over. To the club!

31
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,642
Huh?

32
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,892
- Director Byun? 
 - Oh my! Director Byun!

33
00:02:22,092 --> 00:02:26,217
How did you know to find me here?

34
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:28,742
- What? 
 - How did we know?

35
00:02:28,742 --> 00:02:31,567
I don't know anything!

36
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:34,192
Don't follow me!

37
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:39,317
Get him.

38
00:02:39,317 --> 00:02:40,967
Suddenly?

39
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:44,317
You know how to rabbit herd?

40
00:02:44,317 --> 00:02:47,118
I'll run the other way. Hurry!

41
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:50,499
Why is she so fast?

42
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,599
Move! Move, move!

43
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,117
Don't follow me!

44
00:02:56,117 --> 00:02:57,842
Seriously!

45
00:02:57,842 --> 00:03:00,792
- I said stop! 
 - Why?

46
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,917
What's going on?

47
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:08,192
It's been so long...

48
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:09,917
What's all this?

49
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:17,692
Nice. Nice!

50
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,542
Jeez! How are you so fast?

51
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:30,967
- Stop chasing me! 
 - Why? Why?

52
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:32,818
You surprised me!

53
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:34,267
I've got you!

54
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:36,067
Let go!

55
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,842
I don't know anything!

56
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,492
What're you talking about? Why are you running?

57
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:42,192
Why do we have to chase you?

58
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:44,899
What don't you know about?

59
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:48,918
You chased me because we screwed you, no?

60
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:52,592
What are you saying?

61
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,060

62
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:00,517
Hello?

63
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,320

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,940

65
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,067

66
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:12,392
I kept thinking about him, I don't even know how I did that show.

67
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:13,799
You're a professional.

68
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,942
It was great. You looked amazing.

69
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:20,718
But how did we get screwed?

70
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,692
I'm curious too.

71
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:25,999
He was in charge of the contract, fan meeting, and the showcase.

72
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,999
Which one could be the scam?

73
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:32,792
Exactly. Didn't their company go under because of me?

74
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:40,942
- Thank you for today. 
 - It's nothing.

75
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:45,967
What was bothering you earlier? What did you mean?

76
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:47,817
Oh...

77
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:51,092
 Why were you late? It's your first show.

78
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:54,518
 I got this eerie feeling that something strange was going on.

79
00:04:54,518 --> 00:04:58,342
I decided to follow Jihoo's father.

80
00:04:58,342 --> 00:04:59,517
J. King!

81
00:04:59,517 --> 00:05:02,799
I don't have a restraining order against that bastard.

82
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:06,999
No, it applies to Jihoo's family. And also where he lives!

83
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:10,717
All right, okay. But I didn't get caught.

84
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:17,792
But anyways, I heard them talking.

85
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:19,217
About?

86
00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:22,992
 Did he hear us talking? Did he tell them about it?

87
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:25,967
 No way, we were careful of what we said in front of him.

88
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:30,667
 Yeah, if Joonhyeok knew. He would do something crazy.

89
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:33,567
It's strange, right?

90
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,217
- Did Jihoo tell you anything? 
 - No.

91
00:05:38,217 --> 00:05:42,499
What secret of theirs could drive me crazy?

92
00:05:56,518 --> 00:05:58,599
When did you get home?

93
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:03,942
- Did you perform well? 
 - Yeah, I ate.

94
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,467
Why aren't you sleeping?

95
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:13,942
Something's bothering me.

96
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:15,992
What?

97
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:19,667
Hey, the word "screwed"...

98
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,592
If I was screwed...

99
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:27,367
I would be have lost something. But I'm not missing anything.

100
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:32,542
It's not always about taking. You could have been used or deceived.

101
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:34,992
Deceived or used.

102
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:39,042
In context, Director Byun deceived or used me.

103
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:42,967
Byun? The guy who gave you a record deal?

104
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:47,217
Yeah, I bumped into him at my show in Woongsan. He ran away.

105
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:48,718
- Why? 
 - I don't know.

106
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:53,092
When I asked he said he thought I knew he screwed him.

107
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:56,992
- What could it be? 
 - Exactly.

108
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:00,201
Hot Bar?

109
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:03,792
The fan sign event at Hot bar?

110
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:09,967
Drugs were found in my stuff, Hot Bar's toilet, and under my chair.

111
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:11,618
That's what they said.

112
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:15,209
But it was concluded that one of the fans did it.

113
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:17,017
What if it was Byun?

114
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:22,192
What if Director Byun planted all the drugs

115
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:26,192
reported it to the police then blamed everything on me?

116
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:30,299
What would it mean?

117
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,318
I don't know. Hmm, wait...

118
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,267
Sis, what if...

119
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:44,892
He approached me in the first place to screw me over?

120
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:46,618
Not because of my music,

121
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:49,142
But to screw me over since I'm a nobody?

122
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:52,699
The signing bonus and the car...

123
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:56,118
What if it was all a lie to gain my trust?

124
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:07,392
I did lose something.

125
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:12,542
We lost Jihoo because of this.

126
00:08:18,217 --> 00:08:20,467
"My friends call me Bob!"

127
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,899
You have to circle Bob.

128
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:25,492
Wake up!

129
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:27,367
You have to keep going.

130
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:30,799
"His father made him what it is."

131
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:33,067
So this is the most important part.

132
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:37,142

"And the rumor made me angry."

133
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:04,592
This is my contract with Byun.

134
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:07,799
This one's a contract for the car.

135
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,518
If you look here you can see his account number.

136
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:16,499
I'm sorry, Big Brother.

137
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:20,367
I shouldn't be coming to you but I have no one else.

138
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:24,217
- Do you mind if I hold on to these? 
 - Of course, sure.

139
00:09:24,217 --> 00:09:27,642
- I want to look into it. 
 - Thank you.

140
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,192
But... if...

141
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:34,467
we prove that he scammed me,

142
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:37,925
could I become innocent?

143
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,217
I'll look into that too.

144
00:09:39,217 --> 00:09:41,342
Then, if I'm proven to be inncoent

145
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:45,617
can they cancel my restraining order against Jihoo?

146
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,399
- I think it's possible. 
 - Really?

147
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:58,899
If it wasn't for your drug record, they don't have

148
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,899
a legitimate reason to stop you from seeing him.

149
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,676
The court won't have a reason to extend the retraining order.

150
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:05,442
I'll look into everything.

151
00:10:05,442 --> 00:10:07,642
Thank you.

152
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,717
Jeez.

153
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:20,242
What the Hell?

154
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:24,392
Greetings, sir.

155
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:29,467
Hey!

156
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:32,499
Didn't I tell you to stay hidden?

157
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,418
You did.

158
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:37,017
Then why are you near my house? Do you want to die?

159
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:39,799
- I had no other choice. 
 - Why?

160
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:42,599
You didn't answer your phone.

161
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:46,192
You little shit.

162
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:50,642
I call you. Not the other way around.

163
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:56,167
You never said Joonhyeok would come for me.

164
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:59,592
What? Where was he?

165
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,992
He found me, where I live.

166
00:11:01,992 --> 00:11:07,334
He beat me and threatened me to tell him everything.

167
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,992
Do you think I'll fall for that?

168
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:22,342
Don't try to pull one on me.

169
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:26,142
If he wanted to know everything

170
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:29,667
that means he doesn't know anything.

171
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,167
You got me.

172
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:40,099
But what if I told him everything?

173
00:11:41,392 --> 00:11:43,118
Why you...

174
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:45,734
What do you think you're doing?

175
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:48,267
Are you blackmailing me?

176
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:52,242
Well, no... I just ran out of money.

177
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,642
Don't cross me.

178
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,242
You could end up dead.

179
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:15,417
I took him in because he was smart and quirky.

180
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:18,642
He got too comfortable.

181
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:23,699
I don't think Jihoo's uncle knows anything.

182
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,284
- Are you sure? 
 - Yeah.

183
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:27,301
We last saw him at the market place.

184
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:29,967
He ran into Byun two days ago.

185
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:34,167
Why'd you make such a big deal out of this in the first place?

186
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:36,599
You simply had to put him in jail.

187
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,699
It was fun.

188
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:40,799
Wang Joonhyeok...

189
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,618
He must have been so happy thinking he would be famous.

190
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:49,209
Right then! I chained him and threw him to the ground.

191
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:52,780
The way he cried and begged on his knees...

192
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:56,292
My... It was too much fun.

193
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:09,092
Should I dispose of Byun? Let him live?

194
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:12,442
Elections are soon. Play nice.

195
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:18,092
When is it over? I'm bored out of my mind.

196
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:21,699
Don't mess up. Understand?

197
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:24,292
- Understand? 
 - Yes.

198
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:32,725
Hello.

199
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:34,992
Hello.

200
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:39,442
J. King.

201
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:40,551
Oh, yes.

202
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:41,799
Good timing.

203
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:45,242
You have a recording session with our company rookies.

204
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,667
- Make sure to come. 
 - Yes, all right.

205
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:51,101
Excuse me, Director. Um...

206
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,867
Do you know of a Byun Seongcheol? He works in this field.

207
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:59,192
Byun Seongcheol?

208
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:01,967
Byun Seongcheol?

209
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:05,442
I'm a veteran here but I've never heard that name.

210
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:07,242
- Why? 
 - Oh...

211
00:14:07,242 --> 00:14:11,799
I really have to find him.

212
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:16,417
Do you mind asking your acquaintances in the field?

213
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,699
Hello. Park Woori, right?

214
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:24,417
Yes, I'm J. Queen. J. King's fan club manager.

215
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:26,999
I called because I wanted to ask you something.

216
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:31,717
Do you remember who the MC was during the fan sign event?

217
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:37,800
Yes, yes, Director Byun. You remembered.

218
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:43,342
Yeah, it's me.

219
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:46,467
You're screaming too loud, Woori.

220
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:52,299
Anyways, did he seem suspicious to you?

221
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:56,780
Really? Well, let me know if you think of anything.

222
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:00,067
I'm upset, too.

223
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,467
I'm so sorry to you all.

224
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:06,842
You didn't have to see that. Nor go through investigations.

225
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:12,567
Yeah, just wait for me. I promise that I'll make it again.

226
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:16,167
Yeah, thank you. Okay.

227
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,799
Jeong Hyeojoo just went into the delivery room.

228
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,218
Her husband picked up.

229
00:15:23,218 --> 00:15:25,042
I hope she's okay.

230
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:27,217
She'll call back after recovering.

231
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,999
Unreachable people are...

232
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:32,999
phones off, phones off... Didn't answer...

233
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,967
In labor... A total of 4.

234
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:39,199
We left texts. Wouldn't they answer?

235
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:44,709
But, Teacher... what if we're wrong?

236
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:51,592
What if we're connecting dots that don't exist for Jihoo?

237
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:54,175
He said he screwed you with his own mouth.

238
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:56,067
Right, right.

239
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:58,967
Jihoo inspired you to write a new song.

240
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:02,842
It got you a new contract and a show where you met Byun.

241
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:05,592
That's all true.

242
00:16:05,592 --> 00:16:09,842
I believe the heavens helped so the two of you could meet.

243
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:16,934
Yes, Big Brother!

244
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:20,742
Byun Seongcheol has priors for fraud.

245
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:23,042
- Also, for drugs. 
 - Really?

246
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:27,742
I think he deliberately approached you to use you.

247
00:16:27,742 --> 00:16:30,799
I tipped off the drug investigation team. They'll look into it.

248
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,718
Then what happens to me when they catch him?

249
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:37,618
We file for retrial and get your acquittal.

250
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:41,042
My restraining order will be lifted?

251
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:45,117
I don't have to wait 7 years and 4 months to see Jihoo?

252
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:47,442
I have even better news.

253
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:48,792
Pardon?

254
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,167
What could be better?

255
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:56,551
The decisive reason they took away custody was

256
00:16:56,551 --> 00:17:00,799
the uncle's drug charges and your alcoholic history.

257
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,301
You've completed treatment so if he's found innocent

258
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:09,092
due to your new economic stability and family environment,

259
00:17:09,092 --> 00:17:13,067
I can help you get back custody of Jihoo.

260
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:17,242
Is that... possible?

261
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:19,699
They have domestic violence charges prior to the divorce.

262
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:25,000
Combined with Jihoo's great relationship with his mother.

263
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,792
We have a fair shot.

264
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:31,792
But, wait.

265
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:41,492
- Take this and share them with your co-workers. 
 - It's too much.

266
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:44,267
It's made with rice and wheat.

267
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:46,842
Fried in clean oil.

268
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:50,792
I...

269
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:53,942
I don't have anything else to offer.

270
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:56,500
Looks delicious, thank you.

271
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,340
Would you like some drinks?

272
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:01,799
I'm fine.

273
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,942
Thank you so much. Thank you.

274
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:29,083
Shouldn't we tell Jihoo? He'd be so happy.

275
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,509
No. Let's figure it out first.

276
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:34,499
If it goes wrong. He'll be too disappointed.

277
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,284
Yeah, okay. I agree with you.

278
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:42,959
Shouldn't you at least call him and thank him?

279
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:44,734
I should.

280
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:47,918
He was thankful you asked for his health.

281
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:50,883
Thankful?

282
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:53,599
He was sick after the break up.

283
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:14,442

284
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:28,792

285
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:41,209
How did our approval ratings rise?

286
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:46,099
The number of Momvely members are still low.

287
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:48,734
The Momvelies weren't cooperating.

288
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:53,234
I made contact with a club with more members.

289
00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:58,434
Not a mom club but a club with members in our entire district.

290
00:19:58,434 --> 00:20:01,999
Are you done with the Momvelies?

291
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:05,534
Not yet. We can still use them for other things.

292
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:09,884
When I'm done, I'll destroy them.

293
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,334
You are fascinating.

294
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,399
Mother!

295
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:20,834
Hey, Jihoo, it's been a while. You've grown.

296
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:23,783
Pay your respects to an elder.

297
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:29,234
Mother, Jihoo was promoted to the top class today.

298
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:31,600
His mid-term evaluation?

299
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,509
98.2 percent.

300
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:36,534
What about Gyeongsang Group's grandchild?

301
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,459
He always gets 100%.

302
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:42,609
Mother, isn't Jihoo's score incredible?

303
00:20:43,584 --> 00:20:46,740
His mother ruined his education.

304
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,999
He's so far from the top.

305
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,999
Don't be satisfied with that.

306
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:57,659
- Get inside. 
 - Yes.

307
00:20:57,659 --> 00:20:59,499
Let's go, Jihoo.

308
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,100
Have you met your son?

309
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:12,234
No.

310
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:14,584
I'm working on visiting rights.

311
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:16,910
That's nothing difficult.

312
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,350
Why didn't you just ask me?

313
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:23,484
Thank you, Mrs. President.

314
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:29,959
When elections are over, I'll help you get custody back.

315
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:32,459
I will do my best.

316
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,459
So annoying.

317
00:21:46,459 --> 00:21:50,483
Your grades improved so much. It's incredible!

318
00:21:54,334 --> 00:21:58,509
Jihoo, we can't sit around. Let's join the mathematic's contest.

319
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:02,484
Let's beat that Gyeongsang Group kid.

320
00:22:02,484 --> 00:22:06,899
Isn't that the highest level contest?

321
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:11,999
Jihoo you can do it too. If you take the pills.

322
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,334
Why? You used to take them.

323
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,259
You won't get tired and will be able to focus for hours.

324
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:19,299
Why wouldn't you take them?

325
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:22,909
They make me sick...

326
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:28,309
Jihoo, you have to study until you're sick anyways.

327
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:33,959
Why can't you look out for your mother?

328
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:39,499
Fine, I understand. Forget it.

329
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:53,584
Her husband is ridiculous.

330
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:55,999
Cheating is bad enough but now coins?

331
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,818
I know it's a big favor but can you lower the deposit?

332
00:22:59,818 --> 00:23:02,918
I can't. You know my husband. He's a strict public servant.

333
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:04,999
I can't either. We just bought a small building.

334
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:07,209
Nice, I'm so jealous!

335
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:10,584
Your in-laws are rich. Can't we work something out?

336
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:16,234
Hey... I'll pay you interest. I'll double what the bank offers.

337
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,383
Sechan is an upper-class student.

338
00:23:19,383 --> 00:23:23,209
He won't be able to adjust if he moves. Help me out.

339
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:26,083
Why don't you just go and ask Mingi's mom for help?

340
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,584
- What? 
 - Yeah!

341
00:23:27,584 --> 00:23:31,659
If she's inviting us to her home maybe she wants to get along.

342
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:33,199
Let's go.

343
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,709
Forget it then. I won't shame myself.

344
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,999
- Welcome. 
 - Sis!

345
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:44,959
Oh, sis! Thank you for inviting me!

346
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,559
Good to see you.

347
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,667
- Sis, here's a cheese cake. 
 - Your favorite champagne.

348
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:52,834
You shouldn't have.

349
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:56,709
I'm the only one empty-handed!

350
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:03,134
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

351
00:24:08,209 --> 00:24:11,709
Sitting with you like this reminds me of the old days.

352
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:13,876
Yeah, isn't this great?

353
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:15,167
Sorry for the late invite.

354
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:19,283
No, no. Sis, you're always busy doing something incredible.

355
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:23,501
Was I? Anyways, I prepared a gift for you girls.

356
00:24:23,501 --> 00:24:26,059
- Wait. 
 - Sure.

357
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:33,999
My face hurts from forcing a smile.

358
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:37,099
Good, let go of your pride. You're doing great.

359
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:41,083
Diamond doesn't mean anything unless you're successful.

360
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,083
It only had power because she was the Diamond.

361
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,934
You can't even afford your deposit anymore.

362
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:51,999
Let's just go back to following her lead and getting free stuff.

363
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:55,599
Yeah, being told what to do is easier.

364
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,999
This is only for you.

365
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:04,584
Oh, Sis, what is it?

366
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:08,334
Free coupons for a Gangto Money affiliated resort.

367
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:12,184
Oh my... It's a suite room.

368
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:16,083
Oh no... I missed the old days.

369
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:19,709
Sis, do you know how much we missed you?

370
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:23,109
It was terrible without you.

371
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:30,284
- Goodbye. 
 - This was great, Sis.

372
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:41,159
Why'd you ask me to stay behind?

373
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:44,009
We were especially close.

374
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,159
We sure were.

375
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,984
Umm... I'm really... sorry.

376
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,799
About what?

377
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:58,799
Looking into my past, rallying the members to push me out?

378
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,999
Pardon?

379
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:06,009
Or giving Congressman Hwang my secret books and tax records?

380
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:10,984
Umm... Sis?

381
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:18,209
Your husband...

382
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:22,059
has a criminal record?

383
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:24,334
I was shocked...

384
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:29,384
I just thought he gambled and cheated but it was so much worse.

385
00:26:29,384 --> 00:26:31,259
How's Sechan?

386
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:35,959
Does Sechan know? About his father's past?

387
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:41,209
If you don't want the neighborhood and Sechan to find out,

388
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:43,483
just do as you're told.

389
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:49,584
Oh, why are you so scared?

390
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:52,984
It's what you've always done.

391
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:54,759
Want another drink?

392
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:07,209
You're known for being a charismatic business woman.

393
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:10,609
Did you know, a current BaceBook post on your account

394
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:15,584
pertaining to your grandson writing you a letter

395
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:19,299
has boosted your popularity among housewives?

396
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:21,034
Did it?

397
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:27,299
It was so sweet that I just wanted to share.

398
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:31,034
Our readers have been raging for a follow-up.

399
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:35,399
- Where's Jihoo? 
 - He's here.

400
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:39,699
He's so cute.

401
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:44,499
Hi, you must be Jihoo.

402
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:49,709
From what I know, he's your only grandson?

403
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:54,309
Yes, our family was blessed with him.

404
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:56,959
He's greedy just like me.

405
00:27:56,959 --> 00:28:01,083
He recently took a test for the academically gifted.

406
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:06,434
His mathematics scores were off the charts.

407
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,375
I've never seen you so happy.

408
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:13,199
You're such a gentle and homely woman.

409
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:15,667
Am I?

410
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:19,999
Why don't I invite the two of you to our podcast?

411
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,709
That's a good idea.

412
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:27,683
Jihoo, can you tell us about your grandmother?

413
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,626
Jihoo.

414
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:46,299
She loves me the most... in the entire world.

415
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:53,009
I'm so proud to have... a grandmother like her.

416
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:54,484
Oh my...

417
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:59,834
This little rascal said he wanted to live with me forever.

418
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:01,909
My baby.

419
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:07,134
Shall we take some photos? This way, please.

420
00:29:08,734 --> 00:29:10,934
Be natural.

421
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,699
Don't screw me over.

422
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:18,159
How about a heart? Here.

423
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,209
Give me a kiss.

424
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:35,000
Please call me if you find anything.

425
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,670
Okay.

426
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:44,859
 She loves me the most... in the entire world.

427
00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:52,184
 I'm so proud to have... a grandmother like her.

428
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,999
 This little rascal said he wanted to live with me forever.

429
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:01,109
 My baby.

430
00:30:05,234 --> 00:30:08,083
Why'd you want to eat at home?

431
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:12,934
I would've gotten groceries if I knew.

432
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:34,309
Mom...

433
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:37,959
You didn't sleep again?

434
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:41,959
Why is time moving so slow?

435
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:45,483
When will 7 years and 4 months pass?

436
00:30:45,483 --> 00:30:48,034
I want to be an adult.

437
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:54,609
You wanted to hear my struggles.

438
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:57,183
Are they hard to hear?

439
00:30:57,183 --> 00:30:58,709
Sorry.

440
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:02,009
Tell me everything.

441
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,399
Living here... was the happiest moment.

442
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:19,459
Playing games and messing around with Uncle.

443
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:23,799
Arguing... eating delicious food.

444
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,934
That's all I remember.

445
00:31:28,699 --> 00:31:32,109
- Mom. 
 - Yeah?

446
00:31:32,109 --> 00:31:34,299
Don't tell Uncle.

447
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:38,359
If he knew my pain, he'd have a hard time.

448
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:44,959
Jihoo.

449
00:31:45,734 --> 00:31:46,959
Yeah.

450
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:50,609
Don't tell anyone this.

451
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:51,959
What?

452
00:31:54,584 --> 00:31:59,483
Uncle might be found innocent.

453
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,709
What...

454
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,399
What are you saying?

455
00:32:06,609 --> 00:32:08,709
You heard me.

456
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:11,209
What will happen?

457
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:14,084
I can move back here?

458
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:19,883
We're doing our best to figure it out. Many people are helping.

459
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:23,699
Is there anything I can do?

460
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:29,009
Just trust your uncle and hang in there, okay?

461
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:30,709
Okay.

462
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:33,699
- Can you do it? 
 - Yes, I can.

463
00:32:56,134 --> 00:32:57,309
Yes, Teacher.

464
00:32:57,334 --> 00:32:59,359
Two more fans contacted us.

465
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,334
Did they say anything? Did they see something?

466
00:33:01,334 --> 00:33:03,959
They don't remember anything suspicious.

467
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:07,434
We've contacted everyone besides Jeong Hyeojoo.

468
00:33:07,434 --> 00:33:10,734
- Where are you? 
 - I'm in Woongsan.

469
00:33:10,734 --> 00:33:11,959
Why?

470
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:14,459
I'm looking for Byun.

471
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:17,334
The police are investigating. Don't put yourself in danger.

472
00:33:17,334 --> 00:33:20,584
I'm the desperate one. I can't just wait around.

473
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:24,609
You already went around asking every label out there.

474
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:27,934
I just want to bring him back as fast as possible.

475
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:31,299
I saw his interview. He looked miserable.

476
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:37,383
His grandmother is now using him as a political tool.

477
00:33:38,426 --> 00:33:42,234
Would Byun still be in Woongsan?

478
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:45,459
He ran into us there. He must've gone somewhere else.

479
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:48,759
The police said the same thing. But I disagree.

480
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:51,999
He'll think that we think that.

481
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:54,083
Which is why I think he's here.

482
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:57,999
Or he thought that too and ran away far away.

483
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:00,234
Or he even thought that far

484
00:34:00,234 --> 00:34:02,909
and decided to stay here.

485
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:07,518
Yeah, Big Bro.

486
00:34:07,518 --> 00:34:09,499
I'm out of work.

487
00:34:09,499 --> 00:34:11,409
You got anything?

488
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:12,934
Really?

489
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:16,809
Teacher, let me call you right back.

490
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:19,825
Thank you.

491
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:22,509
Hey, why are you following me? Do you have a death wish?

492
00:35:22,509 --> 00:35:25,009
Hey! You scammed me.

493
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:29,299
You approached me intentionally then framed me!

494
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:32,099
Hey! I'm right, huh?

495
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,909
Exactly!

496
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:35,083
Get out.

497
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:38,799
Get out! I need you to come with me somewhere.

498
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:39,759
Where?

499
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:42,709
The police station. Turn yourself in.

500
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,309
Hey.

501
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:48,484
Please, just do me this favor?

502
00:35:48,484 --> 00:35:53,999
Tell them you framed me. That I'm innocent, please?

503
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:56,834
Sorry. I can't do that.

504
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:58,459
Hey!

505
00:35:58,459 --> 00:36:02,509
You remember Jihoo? He's having a terrible time.

506
00:36:02,509 --> 00:36:05,709
Don't mess with a kid. Do this for me, please.

507
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:07,999
How can you still be so oblivious?

508
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,999
Do you think locking me up will change anything?

509
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:15,209
- What're you saying? 
 - I was just following orders.

510
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:18,584
- Who's? 
 - The boss of Other Music.

511
00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:21,109
Who is that?

512
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,734
I can't tell you that.

513
00:36:23,734 --> 00:36:28,034
In my world, if you snitch, you end up in a ditch.

514
00:36:30,584 --> 00:36:34,234
Why did you have to target me?

515
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:37,684
Why did you come after me? Because I'm powerless?

516
00:36:37,684 --> 00:36:40,209
You're really stupid.

517
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:44,334
I wanted something from you. Why else would I?

518
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:45,459
What?

519
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:49,299
Think about what you've lost.

520
00:36:49,299 --> 00:36:51,599
Who would want what you've lost?

521
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,884
Look for that guy, you idiot.

522
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,134
Let's go.

523
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:15,559
Are you doing a good job?

524
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:17,334
I...

525
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:21,299
I want to try the mathematic's contest.

526
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:25,083
Really?

527
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:28,799
I'll do everything you say. I'll even take the pills.

528
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:32,634
Oh, my lovely son. Thank you, Jihoo.

529
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:38,599
In exchange, can I ask for a favor?

530
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:45,309
Isn't that the most competitive? Can he do it?

531
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:48,199
Don't even try if you can't win.

532
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:52,759
His capabilities will be exposed to other families for nothing.

533
00:37:52,759 --> 00:37:56,383
I'll replace his horseback riding classes with cram sessions.

534
00:37:56,383 --> 00:37:58,459
Mother, try to be excited.

535
00:37:58,459 --> 00:38:03,099
Jihoo will beat the Gyeongsang Group's grandchild.

536
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:04,659
All right.

537
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:09,984
Let's see if he's worth anything.

538
00:38:09,984 --> 00:38:14,509
Book smarts are genetic. Don't count on it.

539
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:18,999
Then, why didn't you bring home a smarter woman?

540
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:22,159
How dare you bring trash like her.

541
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:27,359
He's smart because at least he has half of her genes.

542
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,083
Are you visiting the infertility clinic regularly?

543
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:34,559
If you don't like the doctor change hospitals.

544
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:37,609
Mother, don't expect anything.

545
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,883
The hospital isn't the problem. He is.

546
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:44,692
Why do you always bring this up?

547
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:46,659
Do you have dementia?

548
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:51,199
Eat up!

549
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:56,309
Why are you sitting like that? Sit up like a man!

550
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:04,199
Ouch...

551
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:06,399
Does it hurt?

552
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:09,709
You should've just called the police.

553
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:12,999
I can't understand anything he said.

554
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:15,083
I feel so stupid.

555
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:17,609
Think positively. Stay positive.

556
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:20,134
We know something is going on. We have a chance now.

557
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:22,759
Who's the boss of Other Music? I've never seen him.

558
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:24,759
I just thought he was an investor.

559
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:27,083
This is frustrating.

560
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:31,799
I only asked people about Byun not about Other Music...

561
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:35,559
I think I should ask about the company itself.

562
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:39,209
I'm meeting the police tomorrow. Do you want to come?

563
00:40:39,209 --> 00:40:40,584
Yeah, sure.

564
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:47,918
Oh my god!

565
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:51,709
Why are you drinking so late? You aren't in your 20's.

566
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:56,399
Sorry. Damn Byeonggil just kept pouring...

567
00:40:57,634 --> 00:41:01,034
Are you cheating on me?

568
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:05,599
Me? After handling your ovulation?

569
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,699
That's true.

570
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:10,999
How could I cheat when I have such a beautiful wife?

571
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:13,217
Oh my, oh my.

572
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:16,634
You didn't even flinch when Sechan's father complimented me.

573
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:18,899
Be careful of that guy.

574
00:41:18,899 --> 00:41:22,359
He'll go for anything with a skirt on.

575
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:25,759
I heard he's into crypto currency.

576
00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:30,134
Really? With what money? He's uncontrollable.

577
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:33,584
Don't worry about him! Just think about me!

578
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:39,059
- Here. 
 - Oh my! Sodam's father...

579
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:42,334
Honey... Babe! Honey!

580
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,584
What's this for?

581
00:41:44,584 --> 00:41:46,599
I felt bad for you.

582
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:50,409
You used to have many friends. Now you're alone.

583
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:53,609
I'm not alone. I have a friend.

584
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:55,334
Let's see.

585
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:57,584
- It's pretty. 
 - Thank you.

586
00:41:57,601 --> 00:41:59,642

587
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:06,083
Ta da!

588
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:07,999
It's pretty.

589
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,899
- Try it on. 
 - No thanks, I'm working.

590
00:42:10,899 --> 00:42:13,983
Oh no, I forgot. It's preheating.

591
00:42:13,983 --> 00:42:17,099
Why are you so forgetfu these days?

592
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:20,334
- Something's on my mind. 
 - What?

593
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:24,875
- It's about Jihoo. 
 - What about him?

594
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,483
It's nothing, I'll tell you later.

595
00:42:28,009 --> 00:42:30,834
I could tell you how many times I go to the bathroom.

596
00:42:30,834 --> 00:42:32,999
- You count? 
 - You don't?

597
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:34,534
Oh...

598
00:42:34,534 --> 00:42:38,209
I've never had friends. I don't know that stuff.

599
00:42:38,209 --> 00:42:42,234
Not one? Even when you were young?

600
00:42:42,234 --> 00:42:44,959
Yeah, my parent's passed early.

601
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:49,959
- Both? 
 - Yeah.

602
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:51,959
I became busy.

603
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:56,509
I had three jobs to go to right after school.

604
00:42:56,509 --> 00:42:58,759
And I had to take care of Hyeok.

605
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:02,083
You had no one to count on. That's why you're like that.

606
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:05,234
- What? 
 - Honestly, if I were you...

607
00:43:05,234 --> 00:43:06,999
What I'm trying to say is...

608
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:10,083
If my husband cheated while my in-law beat me...

609
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:12,899
Then having my son taken away after a divorce?

610
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:14,584
Can you get to your point?

611
00:43:14,584 --> 00:43:16,999
I would cry every day.

612
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:20,999
I'd be bitter and mean. I'd blame others and complain.

613
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:24,134
I would've gone crazy from struggling every day.

614
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:28,384
How do you remain so calm and cool-headed?

615
00:43:28,384 --> 00:43:32,559
I always thought you were really mature.

616
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,067
But it's because you don't know anything else.

617
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:41,499
Maybe.

618
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:38,184
Put a few in here.

619
00:44:38,184 --> 00:44:41,134
And if your stomach hurts take a pill.

620
00:44:41,134 --> 00:44:44,634
But not on an empty stomach. Eat beforehand.

621
00:44:44,634 --> 00:44:46,759
Thank you.

622
00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:51,709
More things will be hard to tell your father.

623
00:44:51,709 --> 00:44:55,980
I want you to call me whenever you need to talk.

624
00:44:58,634 --> 00:45:02,509
Is it too late to be with him?

625
00:45:02,509 --> 00:45:08,559
I understand it's difficult to talk about this right now.

626
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,134
I'm sorry to you.

627
00:45:11,134 --> 00:45:16,159
I heard you bragged to Sodam that you had a mom now.

628
00:45:17,117 --> 00:45:20,699
Girls can't keep secrets.

629
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:31,599
I honestly can't remember my mom. I don't know what it's like to have one.

630
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:38,259
Everyone else has one. I thought I'd finally have one, too.

631
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,499
You know about my mother?

632
00:45:44,499 --> 00:45:49,334
As a woman, I can agree with your decision.

633
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:52,909
He hid something big from you and got caught.

634
00:45:52,909 --> 00:45:56,134
I would have hated it, too.

635
00:45:56,134 --> 00:46:04,384
But my father didn't say anything because of me.

636
00:46:04,384 --> 00:46:08,234
I told him to keep it a secret and to his grave.

637
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:11,809
As you know, people enjoy other's misfortune.

638
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:17,230
It's a perfect story to tell provocatively.

639
00:46:21,799 --> 00:46:26,959
When I was seven, my mother died in an accident, too.

640
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:32,809
My father died right before.

641
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:38,899
They teased me because I was an orphan.

642
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:41,399
People are mean.

643
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:45,409
What's there to tease? You didn't do anything.

644
00:46:46,899 --> 00:46:51,999
Just like you, I never cried and was never sad.

645
00:46:51,999 --> 00:46:55,659
I had to take care of my little brother.

646
00:46:55,659 --> 00:46:58,867
Recently, my friend told me something.

647
00:46:58,867 --> 00:47:03,109
I never complain in hardship

648
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:06,899
because that's all I know.

649
00:47:06,899 --> 00:47:10,960
I hurt alone... and endure.

650
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,559
Just saying.

651
00:47:18,234 --> 00:47:21,983
I've never shared this with anyone.

652
00:47:21,983 --> 00:47:25,009
But I wanted to share with you.

653
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,960
So you should, too.

654
00:47:35,209 --> 00:47:37,599
How do I...

655
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:41,199
Jihoo!

656
00:47:43,509 --> 00:47:45,034
How'd it go?

657
00:47:45,034 --> 00:47:47,259
Silver medal.

658
00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:49,634
- And Sim Taeyang? 
 - Bronze medal.

659
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:52,109
We did it!

660
00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:55,834
You did great! Well done, my son!

661
00:47:57,434 --> 00:48:02,799
Be happy! His misfortune is our fortune!

662
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:06,800
Let's go, Jihoo.

663
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:19,580
Mother, Jihoo won the silver medal.

664
00:48:21,134 --> 00:48:24,109
Gyeongsang's grandchild, got bronze.

665
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:32,359
Anztec Construction's child wins Olympiads, not just math.

666
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:35,599
That medal isn't even an accomplishment.

667
00:48:36,592 --> 00:48:38,509
Don't worry, Mother.

668
00:48:38,509 --> 00:48:40,484
Jihoo will go to a school for the gifted, too.

669
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:43,599
The principal is writing a recommendation.

670
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:46,999
Let's go, Jihoo.

671
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:53,534
Finally, a woman who's fit to be here. Things are working out.

672
00:48:55,134 --> 00:48:56,759
Thank you, Mother.

673
00:48:56,759 --> 00:49:01,699
I'll raise him to be the perfect successor to Gangto Money.

674
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:04,126
Let's go.

675
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:12,342
Change and come downstairs. I'll give you snacks.

676
00:49:12,342 --> 00:49:14,699
Excuse me.

677
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:16,799
What?

678
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:23,609
You said if I won, you'd let me video call uncle on his birthday.

679
00:49:24,967 --> 00:49:28,630
Did I? I don't remember.

680
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:46,959
Hello.

681
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,599
- Who is this? 
 - Jihoo's mother!

682
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:56,734
What's wrong with your voice, Sis? Is this a new number?

683
00:49:58,899 --> 00:50:04,026
Oh, stepmother? Why are you...

684
00:50:05,409 --> 00:50:09,910
Is... something wrong with Jihoo?

685
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:16,199
All right then. But this studio is hard to book.

686
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:19,709
Do you know Other Music?

687
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:22,734
I don't.

688
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:28,859
Why is he always asking me weird questions?

689
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,992
How can someone postpone a studio session for a nephew?

690
00:50:32,992 --> 00:50:36,484
I guess many uncles are crazy for their nephews.

691
00:50:36,484 --> 00:50:40,409
I once had a guy in here who loved his nephew so much.

692
00:50:41,384 --> 00:50:43,334
Let's take a break.

693
00:50:43,334 --> 00:50:45,599
Other Music?

694
00:50:46,384 --> 00:50:49,283
Have you heard of Oth...

695
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:52,759
Other whatever...

696
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:56,292
What the hell happened now?

697
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:58,034
Jihoo.

698
00:50:58,034 --> 00:50:59,650
Min Jihoo.

699
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:01,699
Are you home?

700
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:03,750
Jihoo.

701
00:51:13,501 --> 00:51:14,301
Jihoo.

702
00:51:14,301 --> 00:51:19,651
 Tada! Happy birthday, Uncle! Have a long life!

703
00:51:19,651 --> 00:51:23,401
 Happy birthday! Congratulations, Uncle!

704
00:51:23,401 --> 00:51:25,451
 Do it.

705
00:51:25,451 --> 00:51:26,275
Is it my birthday today?

706
00:51:26,275 --> 00:51:30,175
 Joonhyeok, have a wonderful day. Happy brithday.

707
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:33,051
 Happy birthday!

708
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:36,225
 Jihoo's uncle! Happy birthday!

709
00:51:36,225 --> 00:51:38,699
 Happy birthday!

710
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,876
 J. King, happy birthday!

711
00:51:42,876 --> 00:51:45,800
 May our love grow deeper!

712
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,275
 I love you!

713
00:51:48,275 --> 00:51:50,551
Yes, thank you.

714
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:53,799
 Is this working?

715
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:55,499
 Can you see me?

716
00:51:56,451 --> 00:51:59,876
 Hyeok, are you surprised?

717
00:51:59,876 --> 00:52:02,401
 Jihoo asked us to do this.

718
00:52:02,401 --> 00:52:04,899
 You haven't seen him in a while.

719
00:52:04,899 --> 00:52:07,651
 Have a good time.

720
00:52:07,651 --> 00:52:09,500
 This is awkward.

721
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,175
 My brother! Happy birthday!

722
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:15,825
 Done?

723
00:52:15,825 --> 00:52:18,251
 You do it now.

724
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:21,576
Why'd it turn off?

725
00:52:21,576 --> 00:52:22,800
Why? What happened?

726
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,899
What?

727
00:52:24,899 --> 00:52:29,175
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

728
00:52:29,175 --> 00:52:32,960
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

729
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,301
Hey.

730
00:52:35,301 --> 00:52:40,400
♪ Happy birthday, dear Uncle! ♪

731
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,151
What's happening. How'd you come?

732
00:52:44,925 --> 00:52:47,350
Tirelessly.

733
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:50,800
It was really hard.

734
00:52:52,551 --> 00:52:56,025
I'm sorry, Uncle.

735
00:52:56,025 --> 00:52:57,975
For last time...

736
00:52:58,999 --> 00:53:01,125
What?

737
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:07,100
I was really mean to you last time.

738
00:53:09,476 --> 00:53:14,025
You were acting happy on purpose.

739
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:17,900
- You knew? 
 - Your uncle knows everything.

740
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,375
Are you okay? Does anything hurt?

741
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:23,501
Uncle, I'm sleeping over today.

742
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:26,051
Really? How?

743
00:53:26,051 --> 00:53:28,850
I won 2nd place in a contest.

744
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:32,251
Let's play. We don't have time.

745
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:34,899
- It's like a camping place. 
 - It's great.

746
00:53:34,899 --> 00:53:37,200
What's that? You're the present?

747
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,125
- Yes. 
 - It doesn't look good on you.

748
00:53:43,376 --> 00:53:46,776
So many stars tonight, huh?

749
00:53:46,776 --> 00:53:49,899
The big dipper... Oh, a shooting star.

750
00:53:51,925 --> 00:53:55,150
Close your eyes, make a wish.

751
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,359
- You done? 
 - Yeah.

752
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:58,150
Do you know what a shooting star is?

753
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:02,825
- Shoo. Ting. Star. 
 - Don't shoot.

754
00:54:02,825 --> 00:54:05,426
You got a new ring. A super heavy ring.

755
00:54:05,426 --> 00:54:07,075
No, I didn't!

756
00:54:07,075 --> 00:54:09,920
Camping is great, isn't it?

757
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Yes, Chief. Thank you for notifying me.

758
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:20,826
Joo Kyeongil?

759
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,651
Oh... Jihoo's mother's boyfriend.

760
00:54:26,651 --> 00:54:28,275
What about him?

761
00:54:28,275 --> 00:54:30,899
Did he get back with Jihoo's mother?

762
00:54:30,899 --> 00:54:36,551
He's asking the police and prosecutors about Other Music.

763
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:42,625
Mrs. President, I warned you to get rid of him first.

764
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:45,275
He's wealthy and well-connected.

765
00:54:45,275 --> 00:54:48,475
He would've been your biggest obstacle when taking Jihoo.

766
00:54:48,475 --> 00:54:51,799
I'm surprised he still lives in that neighborhood.

767
00:54:51,799 --> 00:54:54,125
My son never does anything properly.

768
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,876
He always leaves a mess behind.

769
00:54:56,876 --> 00:55:01,125
I told him to cut the wings off. Not break them.

770
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:05,199
He should've kept Jihoo's uncle in prison.

771
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:09,201
He's out now and becoming a nuisance.

772
00:55:09,899 --> 00:55:15,999
Can I trust you to handle this?

773
00:55:15,999 --> 00:55:18,750
Of course, Mrs. President.

774
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,976
The elections are near.

775
00:55:20,976 --> 00:55:25,099
I don't want to deal with problems about how we took Jihoo.

776
00:55:25,099 --> 00:55:29,130
Allow me. I'll put an end to it.

777
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,401
The moment of truth...

778
00:55:53,676 --> 00:55:57,476
 Caller ID: Royal Momvely Diamond

779
00:55:57,476 --> 00:56:01,120

780
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:05,275
What?

781
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:06,426
Noeul's father?

782
00:56:06,426 --> 00:56:11,260
Noeul's father... He did what?

783
00:56:21,299 --> 00:56:23,734

784
00:56:23,734 --> 00:56:25,675
Hey, Noeul.

785
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,376
Hello?

786
00:56:29,376 --> 00:56:31,326
Dad...

787
00:56:31,326 --> 00:56:33,499
What do I do?

788
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:37,376
What do I do?

789
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:44,000
Dad, what do I do? I don't know what to do.

790
00:56:44,899 --> 00:56:47,399
Dad, what do I do?

791
00:56:50,526 --> 00:56:52,399
Noeul.

792
00:56:53,659 --> 00:56:55,701
Noeul.

793
00:56:58,899 --> 00:57:02,026
What are all the kids saying?

794
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:07,401
Is it true? Your mom?

795
00:57:07,401 --> 00:57:10,000
Get away.

796
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,950
Noeul, are you crying?

797
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:16,599
That's not like you.

798
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,234
Get away! Get away from me!

799
00:57:20,234 --> 00:57:23,440
Leave! Leave!

800
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,426
 How terrible.

801
00:57:28,426 --> 00:57:30,201
 - He killed his child's mother? 
 - For insurance money?

802
00:57:30,201 --> 00:57:32,676
 - He did it because she was cheating... 
 - It was on the news.

803
00:57:32,676 --> 00:57:35,125
 That's why he moved into our neighborhood.

804
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:37,251
 Why here!

805
00:57:37,251 --> 00:57:41,799
I always thought Noeul was weird. Is she a sociopath or something?

806
00:57:41,799 --> 00:57:47,100
Children of murders have no empathy. They become psychopaths!

807
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:51,000
No wonder a perfect guy like him dated Jihoo's mother.

808
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,026
Exactly. He was too good to be true.

809
00:57:56,026 --> 00:57:59,901
Oh! He might've killed Jihoo's mother...

810
00:57:59,901 --> 00:58:01,799
That's what I'm saying.

811
00:58:01,799 --> 00:58:05,199
Approached her, for insurance money...

812
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:06,799
Insurance money, right.

813
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,625
I hope Noeul and her father move out.

814
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:13,290
I'm scared. I can't live in the same neighborhood...

815
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,625
Your dad killed your mom?

816
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:30,125
Daughter of a killer?

817
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:34,799
Don't do that.

818
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:38,100
You don't treat your friends like that. Okay?

819
00:58:40,401 --> 00:58:42,401
What're you doing? Get your hands off him!

820
00:58:42,401 --> 00:58:43,651
Sechan, come here.

821
00:58:43,651 --> 00:58:46,699
Jihoo's mom, wake up! Jihoo's mom! He's a...

822
00:58:47,576 --> 00:58:49,699
Murderer.

823
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:53,440
Yeah! Get away from him!

824
00:59:00,099 --> 00:59:03,301
Now I see that you two are a great fit.

825
00:59:03,301 --> 00:59:08,530
A murderer, an alcoholic, oh! And a drug addict.

826
00:59:16,025 --> 00:59:17,875
Having fun?

827
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,301
What do you get out of spreading false rumors?

828
00:59:21,301 --> 00:59:23,551
They aren't false! He...

829
00:59:23,551 --> 00:59:27,576
He was acquitted. He's innocent.

830
00:59:27,576 --> 00:59:30,799
He stood trial for murder!

831
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,425
It was an accident.

832
00:59:32,425 --> 00:59:35,600
Can't you see the child who lost her mother in an accident?

833
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:39,701
Have you ever thought about how she would feel?

834
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,526
You call yourself a mother?

835
00:59:42,526 --> 00:59:47,399
He still took the insurance money after she died.

836
00:59:48,699 --> 00:59:52,350
You should stop. Your kid is watching.

837
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,776
Hey! You think you're better than me?

838
01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:09,475
I'm a mom! I'm doing this because I'm a mom!

839
01:00:09,475 --> 01:00:12,860
Are you happy? I'm going to get you!

840
01:00:18,551 --> 01:00:23,725
Mom, this house... How did you...

841
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,451
I took care of it.

842
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:35,976
Just wait, Mingi. You'll live with me here soon.

843
01:00:35,976 --> 01:00:38,451
Come visit me once every two weeks, okay?

844
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:41,650
I'll send a car to pick you up from school.

845
01:00:57,699 --> 01:01:02,001
Mingi, as your mother,

846
01:01:03,899 --> 01:01:06,525
I would do anything for you.

847
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:23,670
The laundry goes in the laundry bin!

848
01:01:34,999 --> 01:01:36,575
Huh?

849
01:01:36,575 --> 01:01:39,510
A second phone?

850
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:50,717
 Where are you? I'm on my way with snacks.

851
01:01:50,717 --> 01:01:53,310
 Why aren't you at the hospital?

852
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,200

853
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,700

854
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:06,430

855
01:02:08,899 --> 01:02:12,426
 I guess you'll be busy with Mingi today.

856
01:02:12,426 --> 01:02:17,176
 I'm jealous, but I congratulate you with all my heart, Hyeryeong.

857
01:02:17,176 --> 01:02:23,367
 Thank you. I miss you too. I'll call you later.

858
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:25,799
 I heard Jihoo is meeting his uncle today.

859
01:02:25,799 --> 01:02:27,426
 Oh really?

860
01:02:27,426 --> 01:02:30,250
 Jihoo's uncle. What's he been up to?

861
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,999
 Why are you so curious today?

862
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,325
 My husband...

863
01:02:34,325 --> 01:02:37,125
 He calls me often, he asks about things,

864
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:38,601
 he even gossips with me.

865
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:42,350
 Your husband still avoids you when you ovulate?

866
01:02:50,109 --> 01:02:52,350
Yes, Teacher! I met Jihoo!

867
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:54,899
I can't believe you secretly prepared everything.

868
01:02:54,899 --> 01:02:58,099
We're about to roast marshmallows.

869
01:02:58,099 --> 01:03:00,701
He wanted a camping experience.

870
01:03:00,701 --> 01:03:02,592
Don't react, just listen.

871
01:03:02,592 --> 01:03:04,150
 Why, what?

872
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:07,099
I finally got in contact with Hyeojoo.

873
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:08,501
Really? What'd she say?

874
01:03:08,501 --> 01:03:12,450
She was pregnant and had to go home early that day.

875
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,559
But she said something strange.

876
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:16,526
What'd she say?

877
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:20,150
She didn't see him do anything in particular, but...

878
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:23,751
she saw him take chocolate out of his pocket.

879
01:03:23,751 --> 01:03:26,101
Wait, wait. Then...

880
01:03:26,101 --> 01:03:27,983
The chocolate Jihoo ate...

881
01:03:27,983 --> 01:03:30,426
Yes. Director Byun brought it.

882
01:03:30,426 --> 01:03:34,425
He must've planted the drugs while we were distracted with Jihoo.

883
01:03:34,425 --> 01:03:37,200
Jihoo! Jihoo!

884
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:42,134
All right, okay.

885
01:03:43,799 --> 01:03:46,999
Why? What happened?

886
01:03:46,999 --> 01:03:49,701
What's wrong, Uncle?

887
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:51,426
It's nothing. Give it to me.

888
01:03:51,426 --> 01:03:53,375
Make sure it doesn't contain dairy.

889
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:55,051
It doesn't.

890
01:03:55,051 --> 01:03:58,501
Lactose-free. It's in writing.

891
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,526
Are you always careful?

892
01:04:00,526 --> 01:04:04,776
Of course, everyone knows my allergies anyways.

893
01:04:04,776 --> 01:04:06,526
Right.

894
01:04:09,999 --> 01:04:12,426
How did Director Byun know?

895
01:04:13,799 --> 01:04:19,575
How could he have known what you're allergic to?

896
01:04:20,501 --> 01:04:22,501
He's not family.

897
01:04:27,551 --> 01:04:29,175
Yes, Director.

898
01:04:29,175 --> 01:04:31,799
I'm really sorry. I won't miss the next session.

899
01:04:31,799 --> 01:04:35,551
 You asked me about Other Music. Director Byun.

900
01:04:35,551 --> 01:04:37,275
Yes! You looked into it?

901
01:04:37,275 --> 01:04:39,000
 I heard from the engineer.

902
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,250
 Apparently Byun said something while drunk.

903
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,275
What?

904
01:04:44,275 --> 01:04:47,651
 He said his investor was Gangto Money.

905
01:04:47,651 --> 01:04:48,676
 You know Gangto Money, right?

906
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:49,918
Please, wait...

907
01:04:49,918 --> 01:04:50,975
 They're famous.

908
01:04:50,975 --> 01:04:54,417
Gangto... Wait, Gangto?

909
01:04:54,417 --> 01:04:58,710
Why would... he mention them?

910
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:06,751
 This is Other Music's office.

911
01:05:06,751 --> 01:05:09,875
 Think about what you've lost.

912
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:15,590
 Who would want, what you've lost? Find that person, stupid.

913
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:42,318
Wang Joonhyeok!

914
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:45,192
I've got you! Come here. On your knees!

915
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:48,676
Hide, Uncle! You'll go to jail!

916
01:05:48,676 --> 01:05:51,651
I won't report you. Just come here.

917
01:05:51,651 --> 01:05:53,526
Come here, you prick!

918
01:05:53,526 --> 01:05:57,042
Go inside for a moment. Please, Jihoo?

919
01:05:57,899 --> 01:06:00,150
He knew because he's family.

920
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:03,318
Because he's family. Because he's the father.

921
01:06:03,318 --> 01:06:04,442
What're you saying?

922
01:06:04,442 --> 01:06:09,200
Jihoo almost died. He almost died!

923
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:25,980

924
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:03,030

925
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:03,842
 Get inside.

926
01:07:03,842 --> 01:07:05,401
 Grandmother, please let this go.

927
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:08,518
 Park Hyeryeong planned everything, to begin with.

928
01:07:08,518 --> 01:07:12,092
 If his grandmother or family is behind this...

929
01:07:12,092 --> 01:07:14,699
 It'll be easy to get back custody.

930
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:17,342
 Hey, was this really revenge?

931
01:07:17,342 --> 01:07:21,142
 If I didn't pursue my useless dreams of becoming a musician,

932
01:07:21,142 --> 01:07:23,050
 Jihoo would still be with us.

933
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:26,067
 What are they always doing out there?

934
01:07:26,067 --> 01:07:29,676
 They look like they're planning something.

935
01:07:29,676 --> 01:07:31,576
 They're speaking with a lawyer.

936
01:07:31,576 --> 01:07:34,699
 They met with a lawyer and have been busy.

937
01:07:34,699 --> 01:07:37,367
 Jihoo's uncle is being sued.

938
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:40,309
 What brings you here at this hour?

939
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:42,551
 What are you doing? Why are you doing this?

940
01:07:42,551 --> 01:07:44,367
 You better prepare for this.

941
01:07:44,367 --> 01:07:46,526
 Jihoo's rescue team.

942
01:07:46,526 --> 01:07:49,130
 Commence "Plan A." Over.

943
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,770

944
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:02,670
