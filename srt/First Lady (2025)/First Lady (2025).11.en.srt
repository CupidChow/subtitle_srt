1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,917
ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,003
CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

3
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,506
The person who killed Eom Sun-jeong…

4
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,801
is me.

5
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,927
What?

6
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,263
-What's she saying?
-Hey, go to her! Hurry!

7
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,020
Neither President-elect nor Ms. Cha

8
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,398
are involved in the case.

9
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,900
Do you have evidence?

10
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,151
To support your claim?

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,280
I handed over the dashcam footage
showing the accident

12
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,991
to the police.

13
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,083
We don't have time.

14
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,710
I'm not talking about your time.

15
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,380
I'm talking about the time I have left.

16
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,257
This should be my job.

17
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,177
Let me handle it one last time.

18
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,683
Excuse me.

19
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,858
Let's go.

20
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,488
Wait a minute.

21
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,198
Is there any other evidence?

22
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,033
Are you covering for Mr. Hyun?

23
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,619
Did he instigate you
to murder Eom Sun-jeong?

24
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,454
Was it a planned murder?

25
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,789
Did you really kill her?

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,460
Say something!

27
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,941
Mom, why didn't you wake me up?

28
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,127
TO GANG-MYEONG

29
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,689
QUESTION: DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE ACCIDENT SCENE

30
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,448
It was February,
with the election around the corner.

31
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,492
President-elect…

32
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,747
No, he was still a candidate then.

33
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,251
Candidate Hyun

34
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,672
was looking for Eom Sun-jeong,
and I found out about it.

35
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,467
Eom Sun-jeong.

36
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,344
She was born in 1982.

37
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,555
I worked with her
in Haseong Petrochemical.

38
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,265
Get her contact information.

39
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,393
Keep it from Secretary Shin and the rest.

40
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,854
I must check something with her.

41
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,024
I thought I should be in the know

42
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,194
about everything
that concerned Candidate Hyun.

43
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,947
Even the smallest mistake

44
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,408
could ruin the election.

45
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,245
So,

46
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:10,250
I decided to use the method Ms. Cha used.

47
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,961
Tell me in detail.

48
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,971
You're saying you bugged him?

49
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,807
With this device your lawyer submitted.

50
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:30,812
Yes.

51
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,231
That's right.

52
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,943
I bugged him using this device.

53
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,781
Why did you bug him just because
he was looking for Eom Sun-jeong?

54
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,536
Because I knew they used to be lovers.

55
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,205
You knew they were once lovers,

56
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,249
so you went so far as to bug him.

57
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,002
In case it could cause a problem.

58
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,300
To prove my concern right, on February 26,

59
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,263
Candidate Hyun suddenly disappeared.

60
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,184
FEBRUARY 26, 2027

61
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,070
HASEONG COASTAL ROAD

62
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,699
It was a very foggy day.

63
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,335
I was chasing after Candidate Hyun,

64
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,171
but I ended up driving past him.

65
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,357
MS. CHA

66
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,050
This is your call history from that day.

67
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,680
At the exact time of the accident,
Cha Su-yeon called you.

68
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,182
But you didn't pick it up.

69
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,683
Five minutes later,

70
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,352
she called you again,
and you answered it then.

71
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,104
What did you talk about?

72
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,815
Did you conspire with her

73
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,983
to kill Ms. Eom?

74
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,360
Did you guys discuss the murder?

75
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,030
No.

76
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,949
Ms. Cha has nothing to do with this.

77
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,876
What happened to my husband? Where is he?

78
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,044
I apologize.

79
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,046
I still can't find him.

80
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,548
You can't find him? How is that possible?

81
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,093
I'll call you back when I do.

82
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,249
Why did you leave the scene
without reporting it?

83
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,379
If it wasn't a planned murder,

84
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,589
why didn't you report it?

85
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,677
If you didn't conspire it with Ms. Cha,
why did you run away?

86
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,357
Ms. Shin Hae-rin, answer.

87
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,859
You fled from the scene. Why?

88
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,777
Hold on.

89
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,824
If it's too much, shall we take a break?

90
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,049
I was afraid.

91
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,552
Afraid you'd be punished for it?

92
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,556
If your statement is true,

93
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,267
that it was an accident,
it's just simple negligence.

94
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,478
You didn't need to flee from the scene.

95
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,027
I was afraid of ruining the election.

96
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,660
It was just a week before the election.

97
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:27,501
It's already bad news
that his aide caused a car accident.

98
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,631
What would people say

99
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,968
if they found out
the victim happened to be his ex-lover?

100
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,434
I was afraid
Mr. Hyun would lose the election…

101
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,396
because of me.

102
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,980
Have it when it's warm.

103
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,488
I wasn't sure what you'd like.

104
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,638
I realized I don't know much about you

105
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,141
when you know

106
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,436
everything about me.

107
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,746
It's warm.

108
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,342
Thank you for doing me a favor.

109
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,553
Don't say that. It wasn't a favor.

110
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,680
I just stepped out to smoke, that's all.

111
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,266
Time flies.

112
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,936
We first met here,
if I remember correctly.

113
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,063
The high schooler who said

114
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,524
he did no wrong
when he was caught after a fight

115
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,568
has now become a bodyguard.

116
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,072
Had I not met you back then,

117
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,741
I wouldn't have even become

118
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,701
a functioning adult,
let alone a bodyguard.

119
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,663
You're buttering me up with empty words.

120
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,707
They're not empty words. I mean it.

121
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,750
Forget it.

122
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,711
Five minutes. I'll come back in five.

123
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,718
QUESTIONING ROOM
RESTRICTED AREA

124
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,012
You should've told me.

125
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,767
Instead of burying it deep in your heart…

126
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,606
and shouldering the burden alone.

127
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,486
Had you told me…

128
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm sorry.

129
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,703
I should apologize to you.

130
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,415
You've become like that because of me.

131
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,835
How can I shamelessly blame you?

132
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,260
We worked together for 20 years,

133
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,181
and I never offered any kind words to you.

134
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,308
No.

135
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,355
We never spoke comfortably.

136
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,316
As an assemblyman and his aide,

137
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,652
and as a candidate and his secretary,

138
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,905
I was always on the receiving end
of your help.

139
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,369
That must've been why.

140
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,706
You were worried about me.

141
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,501
You did it for me.

142
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,632
This has nothing to do with you.

143
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,097
It wasn't for you.

144
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,519
It was for myself.

145
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,525
So go back.

146
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,903
You shouldn't

147
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,323
be in this place.

148
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,770
A person had died,

149
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,106
but my first thought was,

150
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,817
"What if I ruin the election?"

151
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,695
Maybe that

152
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,783
is a bigger crime than the hit-and-run.

153
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,868
But

154
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,454
I covered my sin with another sin.

155
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:00,459
I couldn't turn myself in
even after the election was over.

156
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,045
Because I still

157
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,422
had things left to do.

158
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,799
Hyun Min-cheol!

159
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,259
Will your wife accept it?

160
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,345
She'll have a hard time doing so.

161
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,056
She only fights
when she's sure she'll win.

162
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,060
If she finds out
I'm starting a fight that I can't lose,

163
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,521
she'll try to stop me, all the more so

164
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,022
if it's about her.

165
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,900
-Hyun Min-cheol!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

166
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,069
-Hyun Min-cheol!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

167
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:31,824
When President-elect decided to get
divorced to get the special act passed,

168
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,576
I decided too.

169
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,288
That I'd hold off turning myself in

170
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,666
until the special act was passed.

171
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,001
Lawyer Song.

172
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,963
About turning myself in to the police,

173
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,298
I'll put it off for a few days.

174
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,138
I still have something left to do.

175
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,497
I was afraid

176
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,752
I would ruin the election.

177
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,259
LATE EOM SUN-JEONG

178
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,222
I had to

179
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,267
keep the promise I made with your dad.

180
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,629
Our Gang-myeong.

181
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,467
Our son.

182
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,638
Please make sure

183
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,767
he'll live in the world

184
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,979
that's different from mine.

185
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,272
The promise

186
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:32,361
that I'd make sure you live in the world
that's different from his.

187
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,698
Making Hyun Min-cheol president

188
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,077
and passing the special act,

189
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,665
I did it all to keep the promise
I made with your dad.

190
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:48,585
I understand.
Don't strain yourself to speak.

191
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,212
You…

192
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,966
can do it.

193
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,847
I believe…

194
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,475
in you.

195
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,948
Honey.

196
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,908
Honey.

197
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,249
Honey.

198
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,965
Honey.

199
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,478
Just like you still remember everything

200
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,980
your dad said

201
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,318
and how he played with you
when you were only seven,

202
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,779
remember me too, okay?

203
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,828
Remember me too, okay?

204
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,664
What are you talking about?

205
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,211
I'm just jealous.

206
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,797
I'll be jealous if you don't remember me
like you remember your dad.

207
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,719
This won't do. You should have some beer.

208
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,598
-Can I?
-Alcohol is the best cure for jealousy.

209
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,560
My boy is so smart.

210
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,603
Give me one second.

211
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,373
I wanted to see you in a summer uniform.

212
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,251
I thought that was the only day
I could see you in it.

213
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,045
Good night, my dear son.

214
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,172
From the day

215
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,425
I first met you until now,

216
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,386
I remember every moment.

217
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,857
In that every moment,

218
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,360
you were a gift

219
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,112
and a blessing to me.

220
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,076
I love you, son.

221
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,069
Ms. Sung…

222
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,114
will be fine.

223
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,366
Don't worry.

224
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,494
She'll come out soon.

225
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,842
We removed the hematomas
caused by cerebral hemorrhage.

226
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,096
To minimize the damage
caused by the accident and surgery,

227
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,724
we put her in an induced coma.

228
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,267
Induced coma?

229
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,144
Did something go wrong?

230
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,687
Honey.

231
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,481
As I said,

232
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,400
it's to prevent potential damage.

233
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,611
The surgery went well,

234
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:46,323
but we can't be sure when she'll wake up
or if she'll suffer any disability

235
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,034
or aftermath.

236
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,370
Let's give it some time and wait.

237
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,415
How long must I wait?

238
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,709
Until when must I wait?

239
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,971
It could take several days.

240
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,225
-Honey.
-Mom.

241
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,753
Will you be okay?

242
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,756
You can tell the school and rest today.

243
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,760
I don't want to go to school either,
but Ms. Sung said

244
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,973
you must go to school
even if you don't want to.

245
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,933
Will you really be okay alone?

246
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,352
I'm not a child.

247
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,939
Take good care of Mom.

248
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,732
It must be hard for her.

249
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,112
Don't worry.

250
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,085
I'm sorry.

251
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,297
I doubted you.

252
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,509
I thought it was just an accident.

253
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,348
But the moment I saw the dashcam footage,

254
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,728
my mind turned into hell.

255
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,151
Not just because I doubted you.

256
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,529
Whether it was
politically in or against my favor…

257
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,284
I found myself weighing it.

258
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,370
Whether something happened to you or not,

259
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,751
I only thought about
its political pros and cons. It was hell.

260
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,886
When I met Lawyer Kwon,
he said a sword doesn't

261
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,932
discriminate who it hurts.

262
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,935
That you could become
the subject of the investigation.

263
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,896
Do you know what I thought

264
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,232
when I heard that?

265
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,946
Nobody pushed me into this hell.

266
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,244
I've become hell myself.

267
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,760
That's the course of nature.

268
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,096
Weighing the political pros and cons

269
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,807
and making the most favorable choice.

270
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,521
That's what

271
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,356
a president should do.

272
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,988
Su-yeon.

273
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,201
Tell me if you're involved
with Chairman Yang in any way.

274
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,080
This is the last chance.

275
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,375
Must you do this

276
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,294
even now?

277
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,588
Don't you see Ms. Sung bedridden?

278
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:36,136
How can you bring up Chairman Yang
and the special act now?

279
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,429
Is that so important?

280
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,856
She's in that state because of…

281
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:48,815
Because of whom?

282
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,068
Because of Chairman Yang?

283
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,237
No.

284
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,449
Because of me.

285
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,869
It's my fault.

286
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:01,995
It's my fault!

287
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,289
It's all my fault!

288
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,167
She's hurt because of me!
It's all my fault!

289
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,460
Don't shoulder it on your own!

290
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,089
We're married.

291
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,469
Whatever wrongdoings you've done,

292
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,304
it's not too late now.

293
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,098
So tell me what happened

294
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,392
between you and Chairman Yang.

295
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:26,978
What did you do?

296
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,774
Leave.

297
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,983
Honey.

298
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,902
I've nothing to say to you.

299
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,621
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

300
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,539
-Step down!
-Step down!

301
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,500
Hyun Min-cheol, explain!

302
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,377
-Explain!
-Explain!

303
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,420
An illegitimate child is ridiculous!

304
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,214
-It's ridiculous!
-It's ridiculous!

305
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,132
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

306
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,009
-Step down!
-Step down!

307
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,969
Hyun Min-cheol, explain!

308
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,180
-Explain!
-Explain!

309
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,099
An illegitimate child is ridiculous!

310
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,975
-It's ridiculous!
-It's ridiculous!

311
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,977
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

312
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,480
-Step down!
-Step down!

313
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:17,320
HYUN MIN-CHEOL OUT!

314
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,905
I apologize.

315
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,410
I sincerely apologize

316
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,620
with my head down.

317
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,581
Frequent apologies.

318
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,084
Apologies that are all words.

319
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,128
You might've become

320
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,048
tired of listening to my apologies now.

321
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,554
I'll answer your questions first.

322
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,974
My closest coworker

323
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,727
who's worked with me for 20 years

324
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,814
turned herself in last night
for the hit-and run incident.

325
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,358
It's true.

326
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,029
But the allegation
that I am involved in the case

327
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,865
is false.

328
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,242
Some are using the allegations

329
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,953
to try and stop
the Do Tae-hun special act.

330
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:11,624
Special Committee was launched
to fulfill the people's wish.

331
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,212
It will get to the bottom of the fire.

332
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,298
If anyone had broken the law,

333
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,425
there will be no exception.

334
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,885
Be it Chairman Yang,

335
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,596
President Yu,

336
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,264
or my wife,

337
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,102
anyone can become
the subject of the investigation.

338
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,397
That goes for me

339
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,232
as well.

340
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,151
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

341
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,903
-Step down!
-Step down!

342
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,821
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

343
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,615
-Step down!
-Step down!

344
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,325
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

345
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,242
Step down!

346
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,002
Have a good sleep.

347
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,463
I'll be back soon.

348
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,075
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

349
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,868
-Step down!
-Step down!

350
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,745
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

351
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,580
-Step down!
-Step down!

352
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,582
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

353
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,334
-Step down!
-Step down!

354
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,253
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

355
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,380
-Step down!
-Step down!

356
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,645
If the investigation

357
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,400
reveals that I or my wife
was involved in the fire,

358
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,695
I will step down…

359
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,073
from my president-elect position

360
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,908
immediately.

361
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,080
-Step down!
-Step down!

362
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:17,792
President-elect announced
he would step down from his position

363
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,588
if the suspicion of him being involved
in the fire turn out to be true.

364
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,424
After the press conference,
he met the party leaders

365
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,885
and brought about an agreement to replace

366
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,262
the chair of the Special Committee.

367
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,725
Destroy them all.

368
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:37,228
Get rid of everything
that could become evidence.

369
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:38,771
No.

370
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,816
They didn't exist to begin with, got it?

371
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,783
Damn it.

372
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,327
You can't go in.

373
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,424
It's fine.

374
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,342
You may leave.

375
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,689
Sis, what brings you here
without a heads-up?

376
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,404
It's a bit messy, isn't it?

377
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,989
I was redesigning the room.

378
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,366
Nowadays,

379
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,076
being minimalistic

380
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,535
is the trend.

381
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,496
I'm going to throw everything away

382
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,373
and empty the room.

383
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,707
Was it you?

384
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,126
What do you mean?

385
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,087
Ms. Sung's car accident.

386
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,047
You did it, right?

387
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,594
An accident is just an accident.
Why accuse me of it?

388
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,222
What you're really afraid of
isn't the special act.

389
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,057
Or the Special Committee.

390
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,601
It's me.

391
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,651
Isn't that why you did it?

392
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,777
Darn it.

393
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,738
I don't get what you're trying to say.

394
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:15,284
You thought I'd get released
if Ms. Sung got to the police station.

395
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:19,372
You want me to be the culprit
more than anyone else does.

396
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,416
You must've planned to bury the act

397
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,043
with the news
that I was the hit-and-run offender.

398
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,170
Isn't that why you did

399
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,049
such a horrible thing to Ms. Sung?

400
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:35,638
Gosh, my sister is so quick to catch on.

401
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,473
So why did you do it?

402
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,600
What?

403
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:46,315
A paternity test or whatever, I told you
not to do anything, but you ignored it.

404
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,860
Why didn't you do as I said
and make things worse?

405
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,282
If you keep acting out of place,
what will happen next?

406
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,992
The news reports

407
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,369
different accidents every day.

408
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,121
But you know what?

409
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,291
There's no such thing
as an accident that happens by chance.

410
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,461
If they knew
why they got into the accidents,

411
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,130
they wouldn't feel wronged at least,
you know?

412
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,631
You're threatening me again?

413
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,841
I'm giving you

414
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,552
a heads-up so that you won't feel wronged.

415
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,138
You won't feel wronged too, then.

416
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,765
What?

417
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,349
What you can do,

418
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,518
I can do as well.

419
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,026
It's not difficult.

420
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,737
You just need to open the door.

421
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,658
Then Senior Inspector Jung
will go in and drag everyone out.

422
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,035
So,

423
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:42,872
make sure you go with Min-cheol
when he goes inside to negotiate.

424
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,999
So you can open the door.

425
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,168
You know the Trojan Horse, right?

426
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,169
MARCH 2012

427
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,672
It isn't anything difficult,
but your role is very important.

428
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,800
You must be very pressed.

429
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,303
You, who chairs the sponsorship
for Jeong-yeon,

430
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,097
are asking for my help.

431
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,892
I am pressed.

432
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,478
It's been more than three months

433
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,189
since they locked up the factory
and started protesting.

434
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,191
Father is rushing me to resolve it.

435
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,400
And my younger brother

436
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,364
is brown-nosing my father
and saying I'm not competent enough.

437
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,241
I'm in a serious bind.

438
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:20,910
You'll help me, right?

439
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,162
Why would I?

440
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,542
The election is around the corner,

441
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,378
but you're losing to Cha Jeong-yeon.

442
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,547
Will you lose the election?

443
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,006
I'll help you win.

444
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,258
You will?

445
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,219
How?

446
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,808
Cha Jeong-yeon…

447
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,103
has an illegal election committee.

448
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:52,150
And Senior Inspector Jung here
runs the election committee.

449
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,944
He's a jack of all trades, you see.

450
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:58,614
Just get the reporters ready.
I'll help them catch them in the act.

451
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,617
Then Cha Jeong-yeon's approval rating
will plummet.

452
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,871
Who'd vote for the one who'd be taken down

453
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,540
for violating the election act
even if he won?

454
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,294
Their vote is the only thing
the people have,

455
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,589
and they can't stand
their votes going to waste.

456
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:22,054
Did you chair his sponsorship committee
and provide him with manpower

457
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,681
for a moment like this?

458
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,309
To stab Cha Jeong-yeon in the back?

459
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,102
It never hurts

460
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,937
to play it safe with both sides.

461
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,898
And I've realized

462
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,942
your husband is
the better assemblyperson material.

463
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,576
Just dismiss them, and nothing else.

464
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,120
Don't hurt anyone.

465
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,914
Don't worry.

466
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,167
Min-cheol will come out without a scratch.

467
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,506
-Sis.
-Don't do anything.

468
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,135
Don't even breathe.
Stay still as if you're dead.

469
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,678
If you mess around again,

470
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,265
then I'll reveal this.

471
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,726
Sis.

472
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,102
Come on, don't do this.

473
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,147
If that gets out,
you won't be safe either.

474
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,274
You just need to keep your mouth shut.

475
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,945
Just like what you've done until now.
Nothing else.

476
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,113
Fine, sis. That recording!

477
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,325
I'll buy it.

478
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,743
How much do you want?

479
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,162
What do you want? What should I do?

480
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,747
Pray.

481
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,833
If Ms. Sung doesn't wake up,

482
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,586
you're done for.

483
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,381
Sis.

484
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,882
Sis!

485
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:06,659
Yes, Ms. Cha.

486
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:09,620
Chairman Yang just entered
the connecting room.

487
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,790
I checked the occupants of the next room.

488
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,752
They're Mr. Noh Cheol-jae,
Ms. Han Kyung-ae, and Mr. Jo Hyun-seok.

489
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,588
Please make good use of it in your work.

490
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,633
It's under your drivers' names.

491
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,970
I took pictures of the wine bottles
Chairman Yang had prepared.

492
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,438
We'll perform a search and seizure.

493
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:38,274
The search and seizure starts at 13:19.

494
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,159
What I said earlier,

495
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:51,579
did you relay it to Mr. Jo and Ms. Han?

496
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,788
Of course.

497
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,082
They'll stop interfering
with the Committee.

498
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,877
The same goes for you, Mr. Noh.

499
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,754
Don't worry.

500
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,968
The Special Committee performed
a search and seizure on H Group.

501
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:10,264
It took place only an hour
after the new chair was appointed.

502
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,851
Former lawyer Kwon Hak-seon,
the new chair of the Special Committee,

503
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,187
was the whistleblower of H Chemical.

504
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,398
The special act investigation
is expected to speed up.

505
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,776
This is all we have for today.

506
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,902
Thank you.

507
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,617
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

508
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,499
Read questions for Hwa-jin?

509
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,876
Didn't you see the news?

510
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,546
You don't even watch your own news?

511
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,883
The special act and Mr. Hyun's position
are at risk.

512
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,427
Lee Hwa-jin? Illegitimate child?

513
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,930
Nobody cares now.

514
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,264
What's with you?

515
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,935
I was going to overlook it,
but I guess I shouldn't.

516
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:00,272
You knew beforehand
Shin Hae-rin was going to turn herself in.

517
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,652
But you put an embargo on it
and let other reporters cover it?

518
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,238
It was my source's request.

519
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,448
Whatever.

520
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,118
Prepare Hwa-jin's interview.

521
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,662
It's a follow-up,
so let's make it provocative.

522
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,456
Hwa-jin seemed to be very bold.

523
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,958
Nudge her in the right place,

524
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,460
and she could overshadow
President-elect and Ms. Cha.

525
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,711
Cheon U-hyeok!

526
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,090
What? What?!

527
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,551
You're trying to change the flow

528
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,178
of the news that's moved on
to the special act

529
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,430
back to Hwa-jin. Why?

530
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,056
Check the viewers' comments.

531
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,350
They're all about Lee Hwa-jin.

532
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,686
The special act? The search and seizure?

533
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,564
Nobody cares about those headaches.

534
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:45,109
In the end, viewers want
to see something provocative.

535
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,986
What they're interested in--

536
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,070
Eom Min-jeong.

537
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,242
What?

538
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,829
Why did you tell him
to keep it a secret that

539
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,290
Lee Hwa-jin was Eom Min-jeong?

540
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,042
Keep it, but don't tell Reporter Son.

541
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,588
No, do not tell anyone else that

542
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,465
Hwa-jin is actually Eom Min-jeong.

543
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,347
Let's just focus on the news.

544
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,850
Let's just focus on being reporters.

545
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,685
Don't even think of

546
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,105
dipping your toe in politics

547
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,608
when you're not cut out for it.

548
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,333
PARK CHAN-DO

549
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,255
Hello?

550
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,049
I got a call from Secretary Bang.

551
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,194
So you want to buy Secretary Bang's diary?

552
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,494
I warned you that you couldn't protect
both Su-yeon and the special act.

553
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,329
But you forgot.

554
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,997
The diary is just the start.

555
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,458
I'm sure

556
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,378
someone knows what happened on that day.

557
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,006
No matter how hard they try,

558
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,759
the truth will be revealed.

559
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,432
You replaced the chair of the Committee.

560
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:45,813
You even risked your presidential position
and said you'd step down if you were found

561
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,857
to be involved in the fire.

562
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,569
I'll use every power I have

563
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,447
to uncover the truth.

564
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,873
All right, then.

565
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,924
It's already been 15 years.

566
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,011
It was two days

567
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,179
after the fire.

568
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,351
APRIL 4, 2012
D-7 TO THE ASSEMBLYPERSON ELECTION

569
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,275
People aren't taking

570
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,694
the H Chemical fire lightly.

571
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:38,240
If we leave it like this,
no one can say where the sparks will fly.

572
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,743
I will handle the police investigation.

573
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,245
And you,

574
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,747
please handle the media.

575
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,043
If the media and police work together,

576
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,836
it'll be an easy job

577
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:54,298
to make it look like Do Tae-hun
was the arsonist and Hyun Min-cheol

578
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:56,967
was behind it.

579
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,808
But will the police do as you say?

580
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,478
They don't have a choice.

581
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:11,857
If word gets out that the police was
at fault, someone will have to step down.

582
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,568
Nobody will want to step down.

583
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,695
That's common sense.

584
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,741
But sometimes, people with no common sense
can cause trouble.

585
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,452
And when that happens,
things get out of control.

586
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,245
Don't worry.

587
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:29,917
The prosecutor in charge is Noh Cheol-jae,
and he's easily persuaded.

588
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,127
I told him that he could join our party

589
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,297
in the next general election
if he helped us with this.

590
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,548
What about the evidence?

591
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,052
It's still an investigation,
so it should look like one.

592
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,596
We can just

593
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,264
make evidence.

594
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,726
H Chemical

595
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,395
is a chemical plant.

596
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:53,065
It's clear as day that
flammable chemicals would've

597
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,483
made the fire bigger.

598
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,529
Swap the chemicals
that should be in the plant

599
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:01,240
with paint thinner
that should never be found there,

600
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,325
and everything becomes simple.

601
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,994
The direct cause of the fire was

602
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,539
the paint thinner stacked up
in front of the plant.

603
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:12,209
And Hyun Min-cheol ordered them
to barricade the entrance with it.

604
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:16,755
Hyun Min-cheol elicited a labor-management
conflict to win the election,

605
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,507
and the fire was

606
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,884
staged by him.

607
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,346
It sounds plausible.

608
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,474
My son's election committee
can spread the word,

609
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,726
and the media can jump on it.

610
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,983
So, the public opinion was manipulated by

611
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,610
the police, prosecution, and media.

612
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,824
Next day, Su-yeon came to see him.

613
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,164
Father.

614
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,791
Please save him.

615
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,252
I heard he survived the fire.

616
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,338
If he ends up being framed for arson,

617
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,340
his political life will be over.

618
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,634
Please save him.

619
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,721
Watch your mouth.

620
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,639
People might get it wrong.

621
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,184
I don't have the power to save anyone.

622
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,563
I may be an illegitimate child,

623
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:17,608
but I'm still your child.

624
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,152
If my husband becomes the arsonist,

625
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:23,614
it will definitely affect
your presidential election negatively.

626
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:28,410
You don't want this issue
to escalate as well.

627
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:31,163
We won't deny that Do Tae-hun is

628
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,372
the arsonist.

629
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,751
I'll also help
to keep things under control.

630
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:36,919
Just exclude

631
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,421
my husband from the investigation.

632
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:44,843
Please stop the media from branding him
as the arsonist, Father.

633
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,887
Are you saying my wife helped to frame…

634
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,182
Do Tae-hun for arson?

635
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,602
That was just the start.

636
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,648
When the investigation and media
got out of your way,

637
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,275
Su-yeon came back.

638
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,819
She suggested a new deal.

639
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,404
A new deal?

640
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,458
At the presidential primary,

641
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,212
I'll make the floor leader win.

642
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:23,131
Putting the "how" aside,
how can I trust you?

643
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,386
We have the same enemy.

644
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,931
My father.

645
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,352
Your father is your enemy?

646
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,062
My father taught me that

647
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,689
an election is like a war.

648
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,107
What is it you want?

649
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,316
Cha Jeong-yeon.

650
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,236
I'll bring him down.

651
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,072
And I want the floor leader
to turn a blind eye.

652
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,825
When Cha Jeong-yeon falls,

653
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,243
my father falls.

654
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,203
Then the presidency

655
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,706
will be the floor leader's.

656
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,466
And you have a way to bring him down?

657
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,577
We'll expose Cha Jeong-yeon's
illegal election campaigning.

658
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,664
He won't have time to defend himself
or change the public sentiment.

659
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,503
H Chemical will take responsibility for it
and leave Haseong.

660
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,547
And Chairman Yang Yun-seung

661
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,549
will step down from management.

662
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:11,490
You'll settle the succession issue and
secure the reason to relocate to New Town?

663
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:15,535
If the younger assemblymen of the party
pressure him after the election,

664
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,788
my father won't be able to hold out.

665
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,457
He'll take responsibility for Jeong-yeon

666
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:23,001
losing the election and step down.

667
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,462
The hereditary nomination was a big issue,

668
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:29,883
so if he loses the election in Haseong,
he won't avoid the responsibility.

669
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,593
What do you think?

670
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:34,471
If you agree,
we'll set it in motion immediately.

671
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,436
Give it a go.

672
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,524
You should do what you want.

673
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,776
Thank you.

674
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:48,944
I'm forever indebted.

675
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:52,447
Did you two plan the labor-management
conflict from the start?

676
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,074
To win the election?

677
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:57,035
You even staged the fire?

678
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,414
And due to an unexpected variable,
Candidate Hyun got injured badly?

679
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:06,336
Illegal campaign can't be improvised
a few days before the election.

680
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,879
How long did you plan it?

681
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,716
Did you really stage the fire,

682
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,467
risking Candidate Hyun's life,

683
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,428
to bring down your father?

684
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,930
To take revenge on him?

685
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,604
That's not important now.

686
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,982
What's important is,
we're in the same boat.

687
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,108
I heard

688
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,903
Candidate Hyun
couldn't stand or walk ever again.

689
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,115
Did you risk even that

690
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,242
to win the election?

691
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,540
He…

692
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,128
will stand back up.

693
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,088
And…

694
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,885
he'll climb up to the position

695
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,721
my father could never reach.

696
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,141
I will

697
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,102
make that happen.

698
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,870
She wouldn't have done that.

699
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:26,124
Why did you want
to buy Secretary Bang's diary?

700
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,837
Wasn't it to discover the truth
about five years ago?

701
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:35,467
Weren't you trying to find out
what deal we made with Su-yeon?

702
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,012
When you and my husband were competing

703
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,056
at the presidential election
five years ago,

704
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,226
the secret Su-yeon traded with us
using the recording

705
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:48,104
was that she and Yang Hoon
elicited the labor-management conflict

706
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,815
and staged the fire.

707
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,109
That can't be.

708
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:55,612
No way.

709
00:51:56,238 --> 00:52:00,367
Why do you think she bugged you
and made sure you didn't meet us?

710
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:05,330
Why do you think she was
so desperate to stop the special act?

711
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,171
Are you saying

712
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,925
she was really involved in the fire?

713
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,971
That she's the one

714
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,890
who caused the terrible fire?

715
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:29,104
The person standing on the receiving end
of your special act isn't Yang Hoon.

716
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,857
It's Su-yeon.

717
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,780
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

718
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,283
APRIL 2, 2012
D-9 TO THE ASSEMBLYPERSON ELECTION

719
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,910
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

720
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,246
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

721
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,750
What you're doing is clearly illegal!

722
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,545
Come out now!

723
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,299
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

724
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,009
H CHEMICAL SIT-IN PROTEST

725
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,810
WE REFUSE THE PLANT RELOCATION

726
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,795
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

727
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,173
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

728
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:41,051
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

729
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,219
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

730
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,139
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

731
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:48,642
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

732
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,936
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

733
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,521
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

734
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:56,274
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

735
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,860
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

736
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,363
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

737
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:02,697
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

738
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,375
I'm not asking you
to dissolve the protest just because.

739
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,043
It will be under conditions.

740
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,629
And you think those conditions make sense?

741
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,424
We can't be reinstated,
the plant will be relocated,

742
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:06,094
and the management, including
the succession, is not up for discussion.

743
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:10,306
I mean, where are the conditions for us?

744
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,229
If you stop the sit-in protest,

745
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:19,983
Vice Chair Yang Hoon will talk with you.
He promised.

746
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,943
We won't acknowledge Yang Hoon.

747
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:26,156
He's the one who fired us.
What's there to talk about with him?

748
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,325
We want to talk
to Chairman Yang Yun-seung.

749
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,536
We'll never meet Yang Hoon.

750
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,496
Let's take it one by one.

751
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,750
Meet with Yang Hoon first,
and if it still doesn't work,

752
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,002
I'll make sure to get Chairman Yang.

753
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,003
Goodness.

754
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,841
It's so easy since your wife is a Yang.

755
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,762
You can make him
come and go as you please?

756
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,223
What's important now
is the public sentiment.

757
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,225
To gain their support, you must talk--

758
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,644
What about the compensation
he's demanding of us?

759
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,189
They already cut off our bread and butter,

760
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,774
and they're now choking us

761
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,068
with the ridiculous demand
for compensation.

762
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:06,613
Can that be solved by talking it out too?

763
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,491
We need that solved first

764
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,160
so that we can talk

765
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,204
or negotiate or whatever.

766
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,708
Lawyer Kwon and I are communicating

767
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,544
with the company
so they will withdraw the lawsuit.

768
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,379
So if you stop the protest first--

769
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,547
Hyun Min-cheol!

770
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,509
How are we to trust the company?

771
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,388
Both the relocation and the lay-off

772
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,518
were all discussed and settled
during the protest five years ago.

773
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:40,355
But as soon as we stopped
the sit-in protest,

774
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,816
the company nullified the negotiation.

775
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,984
So how can we trust the company?

776
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,281
If they go back on their word again,

777
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,991
-I'll be responsible--
-What?

778
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,452
Who are you to take responsibility?

779
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:58,373
Become an assemblyman first
to say that, at least.

780
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,834
Do you think I can't see through you?

781
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,921
If you're putting on a show
because the election is near,

782
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,089
just leave.

783
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,841
Hold on.

784
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,138
Everyone, calm down.

785
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,348
He came to hear us out.

786
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:16,850
Don't be so hard on him.

787
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,148
After all,

788
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,985
we used to work together as a family
and fight together as comrades.

789
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,112
Tae-hun!

790
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,240
I get it.

791
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:35,368
I get it, so stop
being so worked up. Okay?

792
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,874
Can we have a word for a moment?

793
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,173
Wait here.

794
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,759
This is insane.

795
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,388
I'll be back.

796
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:22,790
Hello?

797
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,293
Now's the time.

798
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,309
Where are you going?

799
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:43,269
Something urgent came up.

800
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,021
I'll go out first.

801
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,231
You're going out now?

802
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,412
Nothing, right?

803
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,039
Yes, it's quiet.

804
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,708
Then let her leave.

805
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,377
Sure. Give me the key.

806
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,392
You have a photo, right?

807
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:24,936
What photo?

808
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:27,855
Of your baby. No?

809
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,403
Show me her picture.

810
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,098
What?

811
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,224
Who are you guys?

812
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,685
Go further inside!

813
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,356
Set everything on fire.

814
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,112
Drag them all out!

815
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,655
Let me go!

816
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:18,781
In-kyu!

817
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,744
Let me go!

818
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:23,911
You planned this, right?

819
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,914
Does Min-cheol know? Let me go!

820
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:30,835
Come on.

821
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:41,012
-Honey, run!
-Let go of me!

822
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,145
Honey! Get lost, bastard!

823
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,480
Honey!

824
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,107
You bastard!

825
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,903
-Fire!
-Fire!

826
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,043
There are people here!

827
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:13,670
Please!

828
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:14,754
Honey.

829
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,465
Honey!

830
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:19,842
Honey!

831
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:23,429
-Honey!
-It's dangerous. You must leave!

832
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,348
-Honey!
-No. It's dangerous.

833
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,100
Honey! Let go!

834
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,186
Honey!

835
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:38,653
-You must go.
-You must go. It's dangerous!

836
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:41,280
-No, honey!
-Be careful.

837
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,241
Honey! Let me go!

838
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:45,410
Honey!

839
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,370
Honey!

840
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,372
Honey!

841
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,588
The person who'll bleed
from the special act

842
01:01:58,339 --> 01:01:59,841
is you, President-elect.

843
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,094
Since you promised
to step down from your position,

844
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:05,555
you won't be able to protect Su-yeon

845
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:08,516
or even yourself.

846
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,020
-Get out!
-Tae-hun!

847
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,314
Do Tae-hun!

848
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:16,816
Tae-hun!

849
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:10,244
On the day of the fire 15 years ago,

850
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,872
who killed my parents?

851
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,665
I didn't love you.

852
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,377
I just needed someone to make president.

853
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,505
What should I do now?

854
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,965
Ji-yu is with me.

855
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,342
You're the evidence, sis.

856
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:25,635
Just let Ji-yu go.

857
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,553
I should've realized

858
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,722
why you did that.

859
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:34,185
If there's a victim,
there should be a perpetrator.

860
