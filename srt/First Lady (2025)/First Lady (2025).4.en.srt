1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,917
ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,961
CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

3
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,174
She's a deposed queen now.

4
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,552
Say that again.

5
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,636
What?

6
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,138
Say it clearly.

7
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,560
Oh, you mean, Deposed Queen Cha?

8
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,772
It's true though.

9
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,316
She's divorced and kicked out.
That's a deposed queen.

10
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,110
Are you okay, though?

11
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,321
What if you get kicked out too?

12
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,658
You better side with your dad.

13
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,202
If you side with your mom,

14
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,163
you'll go down with her.

15
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,003
What? What do you want?

16
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,715
Follow me.

17
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,716
Let go.

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,384
I said, follow me.

19
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,803
Are you crazy?

20
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,771
Stop!

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,447
Stop!

22
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,865
Stop it!

23
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,285
Stop!

24
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,205
Let me go.

25
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,832
Let me go!

26
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,303
What are you guys doing?

27
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,276
He's bleeding a lot.

28
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:35,446
You must be prepared to let the world
know about all your private life.

29
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:41,411
Everything about you
and your daughter will be exposed.

30
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,011
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,350
Do you think just an apology will cut it?

32
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,814
Is that all you have to say
after doing this to my child's face?

33
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,609
You all saw it was a one-sided beating.

34
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,611
This is school violence.

35
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,697
I'll report it to the school board
as well as the police.

36
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,365
Ma'am, please calm down.

37
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,702
How can I,
after what happened to my child?

38
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,622
I see.

39
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,460
Apparently, she thought she could do this
because her dad became president.

40
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,088
I'll put her behind bars.
I'll make her pay for this at all costs.

41
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,757
I mean, in this day and age?

42
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,594
If you could trust us
and let us handle it, ma'am…

43
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:43,014
This violence happened in the classroom
in broad daylight.

44
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,141
How can I trust the school?

45
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,227
We'll form a disciplinary committee
right away.

46
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,436
That's the procedure--

47
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,689
We have the video as proof.
What procedure do we need?

48
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,733
We don't need a disciplinary committee.

49
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,401
I want her expelled right away.

50
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,363
Or I'll post this video online.

51
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,579
Director.

52
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,132
Are you Seo-a's mother?

53
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,092
Yes.

54
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,843
Can we have a talk?

55
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,111
LETTER OF APPRECIATION
CHA JEONG-YEON, CHA JIN-TAEK

56
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,530
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT
HASEONG CITY

57
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,386
It's my personal life!

58
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,096
It's my personal life!

59
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,988
GOODBYE, FIRST LADY

60
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,826
What are you doing? Have a seat.

61
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,287
Is Longjing tea okay?

62
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,136
That's a lot of books in stock.

63
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,558
Would you like to buy one?
I can sign the book too.

64
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,561
I'm getting a little tired of it.

65
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:57,065
I deserve that much
after losing my seat in the Assembly.

66
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,528
I know.

67
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,655
But I'm tired of it.

68
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,994
I didn't just lose it.
It was taken away because of you.

69
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,497
And because of that, my father…

70
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,254
Right, I killed him.

71
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,023
Seo-a's mother will stop complaining.

72
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,532
I promised her a position
on the parent committee.

73
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,537
Why would you do that?

74
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,372
I'm her uncle.

75
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,458
I should look after my only niece.

76
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,168
After all, we're family.

77
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,382
I'm curious, though.

78
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,093
I always try my best,

79
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,055
but it just won't taste
as good as when you make it.

80
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,309
Thanks.

81
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,521
Seo-a's mother can't push you around
too much anyway.

82
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,357
Who would make an enemy of the President?

83
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,401
She can only raise her voice at you

84
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,445
because your husband
no longer has your back.

85
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,786
I've been curious too.

86
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,583
All the press started tearing me apart,

87
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,129
so I thought you'd show up
on all sorts of shows as a panelist.

88
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,256
But you were too quiet.

89
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,012
I actually got quite a few calls
from Reporter Son.

90
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,638
But I didn't want to.

91
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,433
I don't mind attacking you myself,

92
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,728
but seeing others attack you
made me feel bad.

93
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,356
The power of blood, I guess.

94
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,154
SECRETARY LEE BEOM-SEOK

95
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,996
It's him, right?

96
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,581
What?

97
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,625
The phone call just now.

98
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,834
Wasn't it him?

99
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,252
Geez.

100
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,090
You have good eyesight.
Even I didn't see it.

101
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,515
What did you agree to get

102
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,642
in return for covering this up?

103
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,645
I'm not getting anything.

104
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:44,023
Just like the position
you promised to Seo-a's mother.

105
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,485
What did he promise to give you in return?

106
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,778
Does that matter?

107
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,031
What matters is that
I'm on your side right now.

108
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,327
So all you need to do is to settle it.

109
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,245
What?

110
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,081
I'm talking about the divorce.
Just settle it.

111
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,335
If it ends up in court,
Seo-a's mother might bring this up again.

112
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,427
Is this what he wants?

113
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:20,059
Did he ask you to use Ji-yu as a hostage
and make me surrender quietly?

114
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,478
Are you threatening me?

115
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,022
What? Do you have to put it that way?

116
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,941
What is this, then?

117
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,568
What's wrong with keeping the peace?

118
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,237
Your only daughter's future
is on the line.

119
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,782
School violence is
a serious issue these days.

120
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,325
People who graduated a decade ago

121
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,744
come back with bribes
to change their records.

122
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,913
A school violence record

123
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,498
can ruin one's life.

124
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,590
I hear Ji-yu's going abroad?

125
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,971
You didn't know?

126
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,849
She consulted with her homeroom teacher
as soon as school started.

127
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:05,354
Goodness. She's a smart kid,
just like her mom.

128
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,107
Just like you when we adopted you
after your mom's death.

129
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,359
My mom was shocked,

130
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,279
saying that you weren't
like a child. Remember?

131
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,745
Her study abroad hasn't been decided.

132
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,039
Hey, just divorce him and let her.

133
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,958
If you go with her to support her,
it'll look good too.

134
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,461
You can just forget
about the election and politics.

135
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,590
It looks like
you got something big in return.

136
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,800
Watch your mouth.

137
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,886
And what's wrong with getting something?

138
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,765
Let's be honest.

139
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,017
Who do you think made Min-cheol president?

140
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,979
It all started with me getting him
that seat as an assemblyman for Haseong.

141
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,105
"Min-cheol?"

142
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,023
Am I wrong?

143
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,608
Maybe not as much as you,

144
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,778
but I had quite a share
in him becoming president, too.

145
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,490
Look.

146
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:01,285
I can't keep sucking up
to these parents forever, you know.

147
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,748
I'm so done with these fools
who fuss over their kids.

148
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,800
Are you leaving already?

149
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,219
We haven't had tea time like this
in a while. Stay longer.

150
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,890
I won't see you out.

151
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,433
Say hi to Min-cheol for me.

152
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:34,443
Parents are always worried sick
about their children.

153
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,701
Hello?

154
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,328
Please wait a second.

155
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,789
I'll put the president-elect on the phone.

156
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,127
How did it go?

157
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,628
How do you think?

158
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,463
I told you I got this.

159
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,967
I'm sorry for asking for this favor.

160
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,468
Don't say that.

161
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,847
I'm the one bothering you
when you're busy with state matters.

162
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,807
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,355
I was just worried that
Ji-yu's mom might get her in trouble,

164
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,232
for trying to pull a few strings.

165
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,901
I asked for your help

166
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,154
to settle it amicably.

167
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,782
I handled it quietly, so don't worry.

168
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,284
By the way,

169
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,287
how's the divorce going?

170
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,164
Oh, sorry.

171
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,542
It's a bit rude
to ask if it's going well, isn't it?

172
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,337
If the talk with Su-yeon doesn't go well,
I can step in.

173
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,923
Do you want my help?

174
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,676
No.

175
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,803
You don't need to worry.

176
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,349
Please just take good care
of Ji-yu's matter.

177
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,018
Ask me anytime.

178
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,478
That's what family is for.

179
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,229
We help each other out.

180
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,230
I've got to go.

181
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,531
You sure have bossed people around.

182
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,951
When you were desperate,
you kept calling and calling,

183
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,913
but now that you're done,
you cut me off just like that.

184
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,917
Is it because you're president now?

185
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,961
The title really changed the man.

186
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,601
Come in.

187
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,737
Have a seat.

188
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,462
A-ram.

189
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,756
You should be a film director.

190
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,304
That video you filmed with your phone,

191
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,974
it was incredible.

192
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,141
It's like an action movie.

193
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,936
Thank you.

194
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,772
Did you get your phone back?

195
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,482
Yes.

196
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,234
Did you delete the video?

197
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,403
Yes, while my teacher was watching.

198
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,029
Was it backed up to the cloud?

199
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,199
That too…

200
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,785
Be honest with me.

201
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,832
Ji-yu.

202
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,125
Hyun Ji-yu!

203
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,336
Look at me.

204
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,338
Are you okay?

205
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,756
Let's go see a doctor.

206
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,508
I'm good.

207
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,218
Stop worrying about me.

208
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,220
I can't.

209
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,930
I can't when you're like this.

210
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,391
You didn't tell me
why you did that to Dad, either.

211
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,478
I'll stay out of your business,
so stay out of mine.

212
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,939
It'll be all over once I move abroad.

213
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,983
I'll quit this school anyway.

214
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,241
Fine.

215
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,743
You can go study abroad.

216
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,328
If you leave this week,

217
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,496
you'll be there in time
for the new semester.

218
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,334
You might as well go as soon as possible
and start adjusting.

219
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,543
Why?

220
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,838
So you can get rid of me
as soon as possible?

221
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,340
You go with the butler and--

222
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,051
Why am I the one to run
when you're the one who did wrong?

223
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,386
You're the one
who brought up studying abroad.

224
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,389
And you said
you'd do whatever you want after election.

225
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,642
You even told the school about it.

226
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,025
I'm just keeping my promise.

227
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,110
And in return,

228
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,488
I want you to promise me one thing.

229
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,449
You can make mistakes.

230
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,662
But don't make the same mistake.

231
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,540
Just promise me that.

232
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,917
It wasn't a mistake.

233
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,086
If it happens again, I'll fight her again.

234
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,338
What?

235
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,589
I said I'll fight her.

236
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:27,277
I wanted to take you out for dinner,
and all you wanted was tteokbokki?

237
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,238
Didn't you know?

238
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,407
This place gets a huge line
as soon as school's out.

239
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,283
Look at you,

240
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,495
so happy with tteokbokki
after getting a nosebleed.

241
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,248
I hope Ji-yu is all right.

242
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,421
This isn't fair.

243
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,092
When did you get so big?

244
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,011
I told you not to grow up so fast.

245
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,888
I told you to grow slowly.
This isn't fair.

246
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,811
If you grow up so fast, I'll be sad.

247
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,896
What are you saying?

248
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,113
Soon, you'll be as tall as your dad.

249
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,327
He'll be sad to see that.

250
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,333
Should we take away the leftovers?

251
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,169
Let's do that.

252
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,923
Today, I want to have
a cozy time with my son.

253
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,094
Actually, should we go to the movies?

254
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,555
Let's have tteokbokki in the theater.

255
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,765
It'll be perfect.

256
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,142
What should we do after the movie?

257
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,187
An Gang-myeong,
we're going to have a blast today.

258
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,481
-Don't you have to go back?
-No.

259
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,232
Because you made trouble.

260
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,235
I didn't make trouble.

261
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,945
I was trying to stop them.

262
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,364
Fine.

263
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,826
Now, see if there are any movies
to watch these days.

264
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:03,874
Could we have the leftover tteokbokki
and seaweed rolls packed to go?

265
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,042
Sure.

266
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,712
Are you full?

267
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,173
Do you want some too?

268
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,550
One second.

269
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,226
Hello?

270
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,105
Did Assemblywoman Bae accept
the luncheon tomorrow?

271
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,233
It's work.

272
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,402
Sorry.

273
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,698
I'll be right there.

274
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,701
You know the common pledges
pulled from the campaign booklets.

275
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,162
I'll talk to Assemblywoman Bae myself

276
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,914
so we can avoid miscommunication.

277
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,587
You should go.

278
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,384
Go. It's work.

279
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,012
Let's watch the movie another time.

280
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,521
I promise.

281
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,848
BAE YEONG-SEON, HYUN MIN-CHEOL

282
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,482
President-elect Hyun Min-cheol

283
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:56,486
met with Representative Bae Yeong-seon
over a luncheon with lunch boxes.

284
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,655
With public interest focused on

285
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,034
whether he can use this occasion
to recover the trust lost

286
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,744
in the wake of his divorce case…

287
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,788
Please look over here too.

288
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,090
You surprised me.

289
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,469
You exposed the wiretapping.
You scored an own goal.

290
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,724
Anyway, you're the one who exposed it,

291
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,477
so our gentlemen's agreement
still holds, right?

292
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,811
Of course.

293
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,774
The drinking incident
Assemblywoman Bae had back in the US,

294
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:38,612
which we traded for the wiretapping case,
will never come to light.

295
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,283
We agreed to not mess
with personal matters.

296
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,160
Watch your mouth.

297
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,497
Don't you see all the reporters here?

298
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,916
So both parties coexist for the people's…

299
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,334
Don't you worry.

300
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,711
By the way,

301
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,797
does Assemblywoman Bae know

302
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,051
that her closest ally has
something on her?

303
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,889
Oh, for goodness' sake.
What's with you today?

304
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,601
Are you saying,
"If you don't like this, beat me"?

305
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,021
Oh, come on. The election is over now.

306
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,066
By the way,

307
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,527
who was the source?

308
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,613
I'm talking about the wiretapping.

309
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,993
Park Chan-do.

310
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,037
Who's that?

311
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,164
The man who Chairman Cha kept
by Cha Su-yeon's side

312
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,458
for over a decade as a watcher,
after adopting her.

313
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,128
As soon as the election began,

314
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,172
Park Chan-do wanted to meet me,
saying he knew something.

315
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,844
He said he wiretapped Hyun Min-cheol
on Cha Su-yeon's orders.

316
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,389
They say hatred makes you alike.

317
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:52,102
She had Park Chan-do,
the man who watched her,

318
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,187
watch her husband.

319
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,605
Geez.

320
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,693
Cha Su-yeon is just like her father.

321
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,114
Does Assemblywoman Bae know?

322
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,366
Both you and I are shadows.

323
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,160
Shadows have no mouths.

324
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,787
So does she know or not?

325
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,833
It means you don't need to know.

326
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,379
Reporters, thank you
for all your hard work day and night.

327
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,590
Now, we'll move into a closed session

328
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:25,635
so the two of them can continue
their conversation comfortably over lunch.

329
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,227
Oh, and one more thing.

330
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,230
I'm hearing about you joining the cabinet,
but it's not over yet.

331
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,401
I like that you're proactive,
but don't be cannon fodder.

332
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,670
I assume you aren't here
just for some photo ops.

333
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,176
Let me hear
about the urgent public welfare issue.

334
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,387
Although what seems really urgent

335
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,807
is you.

336
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,351
You're right.

337
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,979
I'm not the only one seeing it.
The entire country is.

338
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,231
They're watching it live.

339
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,693
Would you be willing to help me

340
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,279
as the prime minister?

341
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,787
Why don't we put an end
to this five-year tug-of-war

342
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,996
that only hurts us both,

343
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,083
and become governing partners
beyond party lines?

344
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,379
Is this a proposal?

345
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,381
I'm liking this.

346
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,885
Overcoming the turmoil
caused by your divorce

347
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,346
with a political marriage?

348
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,851
If you're thinking of using me as a pawn
to turn the tide and then discarding me,

349
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:56,893
I'm not interested.

350
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,646
However,

351
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,191
if you can guarantee sincerity,

352
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:04,985
I'll think about it.

353
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,246
LIST OF PUBLIC INSTITUTION HEADS

354
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,747
This is…

355
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,419
I'm not going to make you
a puppet prime minister.

356
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,547
I want us to fill in the blanks together.

357
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,674
Will that be enough of a guarantee?

358
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,636
Are you suggesting
a national unity government?

359
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,721
That sounds good.

360
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,222
So does grand coalition.

361
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,474
But let's not get hung up on the labels.

362
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,227
I want us to be political partners

363
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,353
beyond that.

364
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,402
Give me some time.

365
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,697
I'll discuss with the party.

366
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,533
I'm not asking
Party for Peace and Freedom.

367
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,618
I'm asking you.

368
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,621
You're pretty rushed.

369
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,373
I'm saying
there's no need to take a detour.

370
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,131
Then my answer is…

371
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,801
no.

372
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,304
May I ask why?

373
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,514
I'm a member of my party.

374
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,519
I can't let the people
who want to be on the list

375
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,271
and who are already on the list

376
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,106
shake up the party.

377
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,609
If your intention is

378
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,112
to rattle us
and divert criticism away from yourself,

379
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,615
I'm disappointed.

380
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:38,161
That's not the politics I learned.

381
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,963
Then how about this?

382
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,551
This is your campaign booklet.

383
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,056
Would you like to find a policy you want

384
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,934
that we can work on together?

385
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,105
If there's any,
please help me as the prime minister.

386
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,190
Only you can help me.

387
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,201
Do you mean this?

388
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,452
Did you forget?

389
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,038
Sincerity was my slogan.

390
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,375
What do you

391
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,671
want in return for all these benefits?

392
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,548
Is it really

393
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,717
just me being the prime minister?

394
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,387
I want you to pass the special act.

395
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,225
If you back it
as your party's official stance,

396
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,728
we can pass the bill
as early as this week.

397
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,482
So it wasn't just a media spin.

398
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,151
I told you.

399
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,360
I'm sincere.

400
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,698
There are so many politicians
tied to Chairman Yang.

401
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:01,411
He's been spreading money everywhere
for the past 20 years.

402
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,580
Which is why we need the special act.

403
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:09,002
As always, you're going at it head-on.

404
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,089
At the TV debate during the campaign,

405
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:17,469
I went after you
with the allegations against your wife,

406
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,055
and you said
you couldn't abandon your wife.

407
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,559
You were trying to protect your wife then,

408
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:27,437
and now that you're elected
as the next president,

409
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,898
you want to divorce her.

410
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,193
Because of the Do Tae-hun Special Act.

411
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,570
I entered politics

412
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:36,988
because of Tae-hun.

413
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,909
If he hadn't hurt his hand at work,

414
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,746
and if his workplace injury hadn't been
unjustly turned into personal fault,

415
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,166
I would never have become president.

416
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,385
Now I see
why you were such tough competition.

417
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,637
Now I see that.

418
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,267
The way to win an election
is actually simple.

419
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,854
You either convince people
why you should win,

420
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,274
or why your opponent shouldn't.

421
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,568
As you know,

422
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,321
everyone insists that they should win,

423
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,407
so that doesn't really work well.

424
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:25,745
But convincing people
why your opponent shouldn't

425
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,205
works pretty well still.

426
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:33,128
Because only two-faced people
go into politics.

427
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:40,343
Throw out a hint that
something's off about someone,

428
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,053
and it's either true

429
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,724
or it's impossible to prove it's not.

430
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,476
But

431
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,105
with someone as transparent as you,

432
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,398
things play out differently.

433
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,608
Competing against someone like that,

434
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:01,197
you start thinking that
it might not be that bad

435
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,033
if he gets elected.

436
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:09,247
In a warlike election
where it's kill or be killed,

437
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:14,294
that's the last kind of mindset you want.

438
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,505
I was the same.

439
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,923
However,

440
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,425
I changed my mind.

441
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,678
Is it

442
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,807
because I wouldn't let go
of the suspicions about Cha Su-yeon?

443
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,560
Since you said I was transparent,
I can't lie.

444
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,439
I won't make excuses, either.

445
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,567
I thought that was the last card

446
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,570
I could play to turn the tide.

447
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,738
It's all in the past.

448
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,573
Now, shall we?

449
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,588
Next time, I'll visit your office.

450
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,341
About why you chose me
as the prime minister…

451
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,344
Did the fact that I'm divorced

452
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,304
play a positive or negative role?

453
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,097
I wonder too

454
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,309
if the divorce
of the presidential candidate

455
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,353
played a positive or negative role.

456
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:15,897
After you.

457
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,324
Today, I received a proposal
from the president-elect

458
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:30,745
to jointly draw up the roadmap
for the next administration.

459
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,498
I answered that
I would consider it positively.

460
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:38,336
Though the specifics and procedures
will need working-level consultations,

461
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,754
we've reached

462
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:43,174
a formal agreement to pass the special act

463
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,469
for investigating
the H Chemical fire incident,

464
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,055
better known as the Do Tae-hun Act.

465
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,767
They reached an agreement?

466
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,688
In order to ensure swift passage
of the bill in this session,

467
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,566
both parties will form
a special task force

468
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,151
and do our utmost together.

469
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:07,240
I will now take questions from the press.

470
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,243
All right. What do you think?

471
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:14,038
Lausanne in Switzerland has a similar
climate to ours this time of the year.

472
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,291
You just take
some winter and spring clothes.

473
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:20,879
Then I can visit you around May
and pick some summer clothes for you.

474
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,714
Will you do that?

475
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,468
Did you forget anything?

476
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,389
Look at that.

477
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,558
I can't possibly forget anything.

478
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,102
You're making such a big deal out of this.

479
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,479
I'm going to study abroad, not emigrate.

480
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,315
I packed the minimum.

481
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,859
It's like I'm emigrating.

482
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,029
Right.

483
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,906
I picked out some accessories too.

484
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,075
You might need these for formal occasions.

485
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,535
Right.

486
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,080
I didn't see the necklace that I gave you.

487
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,332
Did you pack it?

488
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,541
No.

489
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,128
Here.

490
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,632
Now, open your eyes.

491
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,258
Here you go.

492
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,844
Congrats on your admission, Ji-yu.

493
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,722
I told you to keep it for my graduation.

494
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,850
I couldn't find it anywhere.

495
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,147
You scared me.

496
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,149
Maybe Lee Hwa-jin stole it?

497
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,862
She was ransacking this place
without turning the lights on.

498
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,865
Call her in immediately.

499
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:32,825
Well…

500
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:33,743
Ji-yu.

501
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,415
What? She's suspicious.

502
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,085
Tell her to come over.

503
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,670
Well…

504
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,964
I'm sorry.

505
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,716
She asked for a day off out of nowhere,

506
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,051
so I told her no.

507
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,595
And she just quit.

508
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,974
She's causing me so much trouble too.

509
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,477
Ji-yu, I'll call her and ask

510
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,689
if she's seen the necklace. Okay?

511
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,526
I'm sorry, Ms. Cha.

512
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,361
I mean, First Lady.

513
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,998
It's Son Min-ju. Have you seen the video?

514
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,874
Is it your daughter in the video?

515
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,378
We got a video tip-off
saying Hyun Ji-yu is a school bully.

516
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,505
Ms. Cha, please make a statement.

517
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,678
SHOCKING! PRESIDENT-ELECT'S DAUGHTER
BEATING HER CLASSMATE!

518
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,019
What?

519
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,104
What is it?

520
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,236
Grenade!

521
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,241
What are you doing? I died because of you!

522
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,873
Stop!

523
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,792
What is this? Is this real?

524
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,335
Can't you tell?

525
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,807
This is nuts.

526
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:24,729
I lost all my subscribers
because of the divorce and bugging,

527
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,981
and the view count's plummeting.

528
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,900
They're trying to end me for good.

529
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,359
How will I pay the rent?

530
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,236
This is driving me insane.

531
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,534
Gosh, Cha Su-yeon's stalker is
foaming at her mouth again.

532
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,998
Hey, I told you to stop calling me that.

533
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,501
Don't insult my pure
and genuine affection for her.

534
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,919
But then,

535
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,879
the word "pure" doesn't suit you.

536
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,423
-What?
-Just do an eating show.

537
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,634
Are you kidding me?

538
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,053
By the way, where's Hwa-jin?

539
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,596
She hasn't been around.

540
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,348
She took on a short-term job.

541
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,682
A short-term job?

542
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,600
What is it?

543
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,102
She won't tell me.

544
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,353
She doesn't come home.

545
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,605
That's suspicious.

546
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,398
Yes, it's very suspicious.

547
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,442
Hey.

548
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,611
Aren't you worried about her?

549
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,697
MR. BUYER

550
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,449
It's here.

551
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,827
Just you wait.

552
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,162
I'll pay your rent for you this month.

553
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,832
Are you getting involved
in some trouble again?

554
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,046
Hello, sir.

555
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,173
I was waiting for you to call.

556
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,300
Of course.

557
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,886
The thing is pretty big this month,

558
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,014
and you're the only one who can handle it.

559
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,599
So I reached out to you.

560
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,601
Did you

561
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,187
get an estimate?

562
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,237
-How could she do this?
-My gosh.

563
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,698
The view count has gone over a million.

564
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,494
President-elect should step down.

565
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,495
Punish her.

566
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,830
She's like her parents.

567
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,873
Who voted for Hyun?

568
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,291
Cha tried to cover it up.

569
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,334
Everything about that family was fake.

570
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,712
THE 23RD PRESIDENTIAL
TRANSITION COMMITTEE

571
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,882
-If you'll wait…
-I'll check as fast as we can…

572
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,594
I'll call back once I find out
what happened.

573
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,971
Please be patient. And don't worry.

574
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,641
Yes.

575
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,188
It's punishable by
the Act on Special Cases

576
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,647
Concerning Sexual Crimes.

577
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,858
They even spread illegally-filmed video.

578
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,611
We have clear basis
to charge them with Network Act.

579
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,446
I'll call you back soon.

580
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,615
Secretary Shin. Have you met her?

581
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:43,910
It wasn't me.

582
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,954
I just spoke to Ko A-ram,
the student who took the video.

583
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:51,000
The problem is,
she didn't upload the video.

584
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:56,255
She claims that someone hacked
into her cloud and spread the video.

585
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,133
Check if she suspects anyone.
I'll call back.

586
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,428
You don't believe me, teacher!

587
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,346
I do.

588
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,890
I've been saying the same thing.
You won't listen.

589
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:10,144
-You took it, so you must've uploaded it.
-No, I think I was hacked.

590
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,230
The hacker must've spread it.

591
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,981
I understand what you're saying--

592
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,776
-No, you don't.
-I do.

593
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,737
I've been explaining myself,
but you're doubting me.

594
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,113
It really wasn't me.

595
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,575
We're trying to reach the video uploader,

596
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,952
but there's no response.

597
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,621
This video is the only one
uploaded on the channel.

598
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,540
They must've created the channel
to spread the video.

599
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,833
Even if we take it down,

600
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,920
the video has spread
and is being shared everywhere.

601
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,590
Ask Lawyer Hwang
to find a way to take it down.

602
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,884
The media is demanding an explanation.

603
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,178
If the attacker in the video
really is Ji-yu.

604
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,555
Do what you can to stall for time.

605
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,272
Keeping silent is
the same as acknowledging it to be true.

606
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,399
There's already a rumor that you used

607
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,277
your influence to dismiss
the school violence committee.

608
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,114
Ji-yu isn't the problem.

609
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,033
The real backlash this video will bring

610
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,370
is whether you or your wife
pulled strings to cover it up.

611
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,997
A simple case of school violence

612
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,499
could turn into an abuse of power issue.

613
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,628
Let's respond preemptively.

614
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,675
Make a national apology.

615
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,593
Make an apology,

616
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,514
but explain that it was a fight
between friends, not a bullying case,

617
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,350
and back out
saying you did not pull any strings.

618
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:35,563
That's the only way
to lessen the damage on our side.

619
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,608
Set up a press conference. I'll attend.

620
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,609
I understand.

621
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,987
I'll write the apology
and choose the time.

622
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,988
We must hurry.

623
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,198
It concerns Ji-yu.

624
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,742
We're racing against time.

625
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,285
Now could be the golden hour.

626
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,245
I decide when to hold the conference.

627
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,955
You may leave now.

628
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,976
Hello?

629
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,687
Secretary Shin.

630
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,733
You must answer my questions honestly.

631
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,697
Are you involved in
the leakage of Ji-yu's video?

632
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,326
It's different from tipping off
the divorce to the media.

633
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,995
If you were involved in any way,

634
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,122
you'll be held responsible.

635
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,209
My daughter's future is at stake.

636
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,297
It wasn't me.

637
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,967
I'll ask one last time.

638
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,512
Are you sure?

639
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,598
I didn't do it.

640
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,935
What about Cha Jeong-yeon?

641
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,312
He keeps repeating himself.

642
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,650
In return for covering it up, he demands
the Minister of Education position.

643
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,736
That's nonsense.

644
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,030
I'd expect no less from him.

645
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,366
I'll meet him. Tell him to wait.

646
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,659
You can't.

647
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:16,372
Things might get worse
if you meet Cha Jeong-yeon now.

648
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:21,168
If a rumor spreads
that you pulled strings yourself--

649
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,503
Then I'll call him.

650
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,091
I'll find a way.

651
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,759
Give me some time.

652
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,095
Do that, but just act as a messenger.

653
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,055
I'll make the final decision.

654
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,725
You can't decide and act on your own
like you have been anymore. Got it?

655
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:40,855
I understand.

656
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,441
Hurry up. We're short on time.

657
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,256
I heard there's a problem
with Ji-yu studying abroad.

658
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,676
The school canceled
the letter of recommendation

659
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:14,388
and the transfer,
saying they're reviewing her punishment.

660
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,473
You're right.

661
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,851
Goodness.
Things got out of hand so quickly.

662
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,145
It was you, wasn't it?

663
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,438
I told you,

664
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,940
school bullying is a serious matter.

665
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,320
Let's talk in person.

666
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,780
Did you see that? The view count is crazy.

667
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,074
Class 1-2 is in a complete mess.

668
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,534
Ji-yu is the one in a mess.

669
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,912
It's so funny.
I mean, she must've gone crazy.

670
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,997
It is shocking. Why did she do that?

671
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,916
-What will happen?
-What else?

672
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,460
Ji-yu and her parents
will be dragged down.

673
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,504
-By the way, who uploaded this?
-Ko A-ram?

674
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,340
It can't be her.
Her face was blurred so thoroughly.

675
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,009
Right, A-ram isn't the type
to be so meticulous.

676
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,761
-It's Cha Su-yeon.
-It really is.

677
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,762
I'll livestream it.

678
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,763
Yes.

679
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:00,518
No way. This is crazy.

680
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,895
This is

681
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,647
the Judgement of Solomon.

682
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,568
Here's a letter of recommendation
from the foundation's chair.

683
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,159
If you want to send Ji-yu overseas,
get a divorce.

684
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,580
If you sign the divorce papers,

685
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,291
I'll send Ji-yu abroad with this letter.

686
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,293
What are you playing at?

687
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,590
It's just too frustrating to watch.

688
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,134
The politics need to stabilize

689
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,637
so the education and country
can stabilize.

690
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,597
It benefits everyone.

691
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:42,226
So I decided to step up.

692
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,521
Did my husband agree to this?

693
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,441
Did he want my signature
on the divorce papers

694
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,528
so badly that he pushed
his own daughter off the cliff?

695
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,072
He has nothing to do with this.

696
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,740
You expect me to believe that?

697
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,540
Cha Jeong-yeon, you answer.

698
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:05,541
Hey.

699
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,835
You should be the one answering.

700
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,504
Do you want to save or kill Ji-yu?

701
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,050
I told you.

702
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,635
It's the Judgement of Solomon.

703
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,471
You sign the papers,

704
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,350
and you keep the promise you made.

705
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,395
Hold on.

706
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,564
Is it not the Judgement of Solomon?

707
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:31,692
Is it more like
"Do you like Mom or Dad more" question?

708
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,652
Well, whatever.

709
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,655
What, you don't want to?

710
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,924
Hello?

711
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,761
It's been a while, Reporter Son.

712
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,138
Cha Jeong-yeon!

713
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,226
I enjoy watching News Magazine.

714
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,188
I saw how you backed Su-yeon
into a corner last time.

715
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:13,233
Speaking of which,
I have some information.

716
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,027
You know,

717
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,696
everyone's talking about
what happened in my school.

718
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,158
Reporters are bombarding me with calls.

719
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:27,790
As the chairman,
I should clean up the mess.

720
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,416
Exactly.

721
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,627
The public deserves to know the truth.

722
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,339
Go on your show?

723
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:46,600
If you'd have me on your show,
that would be great.

724
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,649
Let me see.

725
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,944
This week's schedule…

726
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,115
Fine.

727
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,659
I'll do it.

728
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,834
I'll divorce him.

729
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,131
The president-elect couple

730
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:20,509
will be having a consented divorce
without a lawsuit.

731
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:24,012
According to an anonymous source,
Cha accepted the conciliation…

732
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,892
MUTUAL CONSENT DIVORCE

733
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,742
Here's the custody
and parental rights agreement.

734
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,411
You just need to sign it.

735
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,582
We'll take care of the rest.

736
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,436
I'm sorry.

737
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,272
I made you make a hard decision.

738
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:19,902
Ji-yu's going to study abroad?

739
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,864
Can we

740
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,450
talk in private for a moment

741
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,618
one last time?

742
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:50,933
Do as she wishes.

743
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,703
Do you want some coffee?

744
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,998
I need to get some.

745
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,085
I've stayed up all night,
and I'm not exactly awake.

746
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,642
I said I'd vote for you.

747
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,315
Don't you remember?

748
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,321
The day we first met.

749
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,706
ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE FOR HASEONG CITY,
CHA JEONG-YEON

750
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:59,418
YEAR 2008
ELECTION SUPPORT TEAM LAUNCH CEREMONY

751
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:42,961
I heard you got an earful for whining.

752
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,681
I'll rely on you for this election.

753
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,267
Help me out like you did Father.

754
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:02,564
But you chose the wrong outfit today.

755
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,149
It makes you look like the star.

756
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,278
Wear something plain
that doesn't stand out from now on.

757
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:09,863
Got it?

758
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,367
And smile a bit.

759
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,827
Do what you're good at.

760
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,080
Put up a front.

761
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,166
Why must it be you?

762
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,460
Well, isn't it obvious?

763
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,629
Who did you think it would be?

764
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,466
Don't tell me…

765
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,302
What's with that face?

766
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,929
Did you think it'd be you?

767
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,100
I can't because I'm a woman?

768
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,645
I let you take the position
of the foundation's chair.

769
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,563
It's not because you're a woman.

770
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,525
It's because you're you.

771
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,196
Nothing in our family belongs to you.

772
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,284
Everything you wear,

773
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,037
down to your underwear.

774
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,831
Nothing belongs to you.

775
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,587
From drunk-driving to overseas gambling.

776
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,550
Father lost the primary voting
because of you.

777
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,385
What if you step up?

778
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,972
Can you stop people
from calling you an illegitimate child?

779
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:20,267
You're the risk to him, not me.

780
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,978
Your existence itself is a risk.

781
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,898
Do you think he coddled you
because he liked you so much?

782
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,318
No, it's because you're a time bomb
that could blow up anytime.

783
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,237
You're the worst bomb

784
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,406
that would blow us all up.

785
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,576
Know your place and stop acting up.

786
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,496
Who cleaned up your mess
when you got into trouble?

787
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,123
Who managed the district?

788
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,960
Who made kimchi until her back ached

789
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:50,714
and delivered it to nursing homes,
orphanages, and slums?

790
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,466
People even gossiped

791
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:56,178
that I hoarded and speculated
on napa cabbage.

792
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:59,598
Who made it so that commoners
view Father to be on their side?

793
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,392
Politics…

794
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,395
isn't about choosing.

795
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,856
It's about being chosen.

796
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:09,775
Father said this.

797
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,860
It's fine to dream about politics,

798
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,363
but don't mistake it
for something like a dream.

799
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,282
What?

800
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,035
It's a dream?

801
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,582
Are you saying what I've done
all this while wasn't politics?

802
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,797
Lower your voice.

803
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,174
Hey, how is that politics?

804
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,843
Handing out towels and kimchi,
God damn it…

805
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,470
You were just a servant.

806
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,933
CANDIDATE 3, HYUN MIN-CHEOL

807
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,689
Forget about it

808
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,400
and just live as a woman, okay?

809
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,736
Politics isn't for everyone.

810
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,703
God… Hyun Min-cheol has come
to make a scene again.

811
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,125
Testing the mic.

812
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,630
-What is he doing?
-What?

813
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,799
-What's happening?
-Can People's Party come in?

814
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,718
What is it?

815
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,332
Please vote

816
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,419
for a young worker Cha Jin-taek.

817
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:57,215
I'll make a healthy Haseong City
with everyone.

818
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:00,218
-Why is People's Party here?
-Why is he here?

819
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,721
-He's from another party.
-He's wearing green.

820
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,264
Twenty years ago!

821
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,601
This was what Cha said
as he ran for the National Assembly.

822
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,312
It has been 20 years!

823
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,857
He isn't a broken record,

824
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:17,944
and he isn't bone broth
that needs to be boiled over and over.

825
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,238
For every election,

826
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,699
Assemblyman Cha Jin-taek
says the same thing.

827
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,912
-Why is People's Party here?
-Why…

828
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,956
The young worker Cha
that you believed in and voted for.

829
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,751
What has he actually done
in those 20 years?

830
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:37,547
"I'll make a healthy Haseong City
with everyone."

831
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:39,966
Everyone.

832
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,386
How healthy has Haseong City become?

833
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,181
What is he doing up there?

834
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,769
Are we just going to let him talk?

835
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,230
Haseong High-tech Industrial Complex.

836
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:58,234
Building it in Haseong City
is Cha's biggest achievement,

837
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,364
or so this book brags for 500 pages.

838
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:05,200
Do you know what's truly amazing
about the Complex?

839
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:08,536
Multiple factories run day and night
for more than a decade,

840
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,373
but there has been no industrial accident.

841
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,458
-What is he doing?
-What is he saying?

842
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,168
That's right, a healthy Haseong City.

843
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,921
Even God couldn't perform such a miracle.

844
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:22,050
Countless factory workers' injuries are
declared as personal negligence

845
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:25,512
instead of industrial accident
under Cha's blessings.

846
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,180
It's already unfair,

847
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:31,101
but the moment you bring up the phrase,
you're fired from the factory!

848
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,312
Are you going to let him go on?

849
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,648
You're leaving already?

850
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:39,651
Since he's here, I should go home.

851
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,112
It's just a meaningless event.

852
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,279
I know.

853
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,323
But I hate this kind of event.

854
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:47,575
Sure.

855
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,494
See you at the next sponsorship, then.

856
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,121
Do your best.

857
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,790
I bet on you for this election.

858
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,251
I got it.

859
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,378
Oh, there he is.

860
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:02,507
Haseong Petrochemical's
Vice Chairman Yang Hoon!

861
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,217
After sponging off Haseong,

862
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,345
he wants to move to New Town
because the union is causing a scene.

863
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,306
A second-generation successor
with no shame or face.

864
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,935
He's thinking hard of ways
to take over his father's company

865
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,478
with no inheritance tax.

866
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,693
God damn it, you little…

867
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,824
The money that filled
the executives' pockets

868
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,994
is used to reelect Cha Jin-taek
as a National Assembly member!

869
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,829
Will you just watch it happen?

870
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,583
How much longer will you

871
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,711
let the brothers-in-law ruin Haseong City?

872
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,921
It's time to change. We have to change!

873
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,339
This is insane.

874
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:52,515
So he finally made
the big decision to change.

875
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,933
And it's his son, Cha Jeong-yeon!

876
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,853
Drunk-driving, assaulting a cop,

877
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,354
and gambling overseas.

878
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,606
He gets into trouble

879
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,067
and cries and says
he'll turn over a new leaf.

880
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,693
New politics?

881
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,694
Before doing that,

882
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,655
he should become a decent
human being first, shouldn't he?

883
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,365
What are you doing? Get him!

884
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,331
Candidate Three, Hyun Min-cheol!

885
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:19,292
Believe in me and vote for me!

886
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:22,170
I will change Haseong City
no matter what it takes!

887
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,214
Is there anyone who will vote

888
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,841
for Hyun Min-cheol, your true worker?

889
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,551
Is there?

890
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,261
This won't do. Drag him out.

891
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:34,349
If you don't change,
Haseong City won't change!

892
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,267
The world won't ever change!

893
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,560
Let me go!

894
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,770
Let me go!

895
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,272
Let go!

896
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,368
I'll vote for you.

897
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:58,873
You will become
an assemblyman for Haseong.

898
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,376
What is she doing?

899
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,881
Isn't that a betrayal?

900
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,387
Twenty years ago,

901
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,681
when I said I'd vote for you

902
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,977
and make you assemblyman,
nobody believed me.

903
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,229
Not even you.

904
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,155
It's what I'm good at.

905
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,740
Making the impossible possible.

906
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,494
You know that better than anyone.

907
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,790
But

908
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:44,127
you forgot one thing.

909
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:49,424
That there's something
I'm even better at than that.

910
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,718
It's

911
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,053
ruining something.

912
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,808
It's much easier to ruin something

913
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,395
than make something work.

914
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,860
Just like how I ruined Cha Jeong-yeon

915
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,697
and how I ruined my father…

916
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,037
This time,

917
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,915
it will be you.

918
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,313
Don't get Ji-yu involved.

919
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,274
She's going overseas to study.

920
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,568
Isn't that what she wanted?

921
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,321
You have no right to speak her name.

922
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,990
You dare to use her to make me

923
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,534
sign the papers?

924
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,662
How could you do that as her dad?

925
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,290
I didn't. You're mistaken.

926
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,209
I don't care if I'm mistaken.

927
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:10,421
It doesn't change that
you schemed with Cha Jeong-yeon.

928
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,427
You know how much I detest him.

929
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,304
You know how much I hate him.

930
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,723
You dare make a deal with him
using my daughter?

931
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:27,522
I was worried you might be suspected
for pulling strings.

932
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:29,148
In case it would harm Ji-yu.

933
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,525
I'll protect Ji-yu.

934
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,986
Do you think Jeong-yeon will sit back?

935
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,445
For Ji-yu--

936
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,531
I said I'd protect her!

937
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,117
I said it'd blow up.

938
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,243
See the view count?

939
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,203
This is a content worth watching.

940
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,706
Screw you. It was filmed well, that's why.

941
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,583
It might hit 100 million views.

942
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,919
You're laughing so happily
when you have a black eye.

943
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,421
It hurts, bitch.

944
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,506
Sorry.

945
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:55,925
I'm joking.

946
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,052
Don't be so serious, bitch.

947
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:05,351
-What's with him?
-Are you crazy?

948
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,732
What are you doing, mister?

949
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,985
You're even eating our fries.

950
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,570
You're really nuts.

951
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:16,613
Mister?

952
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:20,283
Who are you?

953
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,327
I'm a lawyer.

954
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:25,788
"Seon" in my name here

955
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:27,749
doesn't mean "kind."

956
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:29,751
It means "vicious."

957
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:31,836
What's he saying?

958
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,840
There are victims that want you

959
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,884
to be punished viciously.

960
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,682
Shall we watch this first and talk?

961
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,519
Are you filming it well?

962
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,604
Here.

963
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,440
What? How dare you.

964
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,400
Hey.

965
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:57,904
Hey.

966
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,823
Let's make it R-rated.

967
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:01,949
Shall we?

968
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:03,534
Hey.

969
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,370
-Don't.
-Take it off.

970
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,121
Stop it.

971
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,710
Stay still, okay?

972
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,921
How did you…

973
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,131
Take it off!

974
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,675
How long did you think

975
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:22,595
you could pretend to be victims
when you were assailants?

976
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,474
I will protect Ji-yu.

977
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:29,394
I will protect her even if my limbs break

978
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:31,521
and I bleed to death.

979
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,065
Just you watch.

980
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,244
Thank you.

981
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,706
I won't need it ever again.

982
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,673
I clearly warned you.

983
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,134
Don't touch…

984
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,678
my daughter.

985
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:17,710
Cha Su-yeon!

986
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,463
People are always angry.

987
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,799
They always look for someone
to take it out on.

988
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,426
What will happen

989
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,721
if the angry sentiment is
pointed at the President?

990
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,848
By wrongdoing, do you mean an affair?

991
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:33,267
Do you mean his affair
is the reason behind the divorce?

992
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:36,979
It's going to be mud-slinging anyway,
so fight as dirty as you can.

993
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,817
The target of the reporters

994
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,027
will change from me to him.

995
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,572
