1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,917
ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,295
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

3
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,156
Miss!

4
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,613
APRIL 2, 2012
9 DAYS UNTIL NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTION

5
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,433
Your tie is crooked. Let me see.

6
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,646
I guess I'm not a tie person.

7
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,732
I do it as you taught me,
but this happens every time.

8
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,569
It's always either too long or too short.

9
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,864
Getting the perfect length is hard.

10
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,910
Are you worried about something?

11
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,246
No.

12
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,540
Why do you ask?

13
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,001
It's just strange that
you don't try to stop me.

14
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,795
Is that so?

15
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,630
Well,

16
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,216
you're supposed to stop
a mere candidate with no rights

17
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,801
from conducting a negotiation.

18
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,887
Let me see.

19
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,225
Labor negotiations are

20
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,730
much harder than getting a tie
to the perfect length.

21
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,859
Finding a balance between the two is

22
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,403
basically walking on the sharp blade.

23
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:21,200
One side will criticize you
as a hardline unionist,

24
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,162
and the other will call you a traitor,

25
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:29,042
saying you just side
with your wife's family's company.

26
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,087
That's why this is strange to me.

27
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,090
You insisted on coming with me
instead of stopping me.

28
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,721
I know I can't stop you.

29
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,893
If you're going anyway,
I'm coming with you.

30
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,814
There.

31
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,327
Promise me one thing.

32
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,749
If something happens,

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,585
think of Ji-yu.

34
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,006
Nothing will happen.

35
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,634
Promise me.

36
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,428
Think of Ji-yu, okay?

37
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,100
Okay.

38
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,524
Only do what you're able to.

39
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,943
Don't overdo it.

40
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,614
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

41
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,326
Still, be careful.

42
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,789
I said, don't worry.

43
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,708
Everything will be fine.

44
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,470
<i>The sit-in by H Chemical workers</i>

45
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:09,892
<i>protesting mass layoffs</i>
<i>has stretched past three months.</i>

46
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,771
<i>After occupying the plant,</i>
<i>the workers are demanding reinstatement.</i>

47
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,803
During talks with the union
occupying the plant,

48
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,932
led by Hyun Min-Cheol, the candidate
of the Participation People's Party,

49
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,517
a fire broke out.

50
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,603
Six workers were killed,

51
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,897
and a dozen others were
seriously hurt and hospitalized,

52
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,316
Authorities warn
the death toll could rise.

53
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,245
Tragically, candidate Hyun
was left in critical condition

54
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,956
after attempting
to rescue trapped workers.

55
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,372
Ma'am, you need to stay in bed.

56
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,957
You need to rest.

57
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,959
No.

58
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,546
Honey!

59
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,631
Honey.

60
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,300
Hang in there.

61
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,387
- Nurse Kim, stop the bleeding.
- Help!

62
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,471
Honey!

63
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,557
- Sir.
- Honey!

64
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,641
Honey!

65
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,064
Honey.

66
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,277
Honey!

67
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,821
Honey, wake up.

68
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,989
Honey.

69
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,198
Honey.

70
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,164
I'm here, so hang in there, okay?

71
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,499
Excuse me.

72
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,168
Is anyone here?

73
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,086
Please save this man.

74
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,588
Doctor!

75
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,214
Is there a doctor here?

76
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,091
Please save this man!

77
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,843
Doctor! Please!

78
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,388
Hang in there, honey…

79
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,873
RESTRICTED AREA

80
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,089
The operation was successful.

81
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,758
Excuse me.

82
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,428
Thank you.

83
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,680
Thank you.

84
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,145
This is such a relief, ma'am.

85
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,023
Thank you so much.

86
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,905
Thank you so much.

87
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,573
Ji-yu, it's you.

88
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,269
<i>After two days of surgery,</i>
<i>candidate Hyun Min-Cheol</i>

89
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,022
<i>has survived in a dramatic turn of events.</i>

90
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,733
<i>However, he sustained</i>
<i>permanent damage to his leg,</i>

91
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,778
<i>raising serious doubts</i>
<i>about his campaign with election day</i>

92
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,154
<i>now just a week away…</i>

93
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,449
My husband said

94
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:02,995
he had to change first
to change the world.

95
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,667
To be honest, I didn't believe that.

96
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,212
Because I've only lived in the world

97
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,506
where I would only be criticized

98
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,425
for changing alone.

99
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,764
But my husband truly believed it.

100
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:28,437
"One person's change
can change the world."

101
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:34,068
"Saving one person is saving the world."

102
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,656
My husband's action
spoke louder than words.

103
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,410
If you really want to change Haseong,

104
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,872
please cast your valuable vote
for Hyun Min-Cheol.

105
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,667
He will certainly change Haseong.

106
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,962
Please send Hyun Min-Cheol
to the National Assembly!

107
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,465
He will change this country!

108
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,635
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Hyun Min-Cheol!

109
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:25,494
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- Five, four, three, two, one.

110
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:30,708
<i>And now, the results of the exit poll</i>
<i>for the 23rd presidential election.</i>

111
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,461
<i>Candidate Hyun Min-Cheol, 48.4%.</i>

112
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,589
<i>Candidate Bae Yeong-seon, 47.6%.</i>

113
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:40,551
<i>The two candidates are locked in</i>
<i>a tight race within the margin of error.</i>

114
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,762
<i>Let's go live now to our crew</i>
<i>on the ground to hear from the candidates.</i>

115
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:47,516
<i>Let's bring in Hyun Min-Cheol,</i>
<i>Participation People's Party candidate.</i>

116
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,060
PARTICIPATION PEOPLE'S PARTY
HYUN MIN-CHEOL

117
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,897
SINCERITY WINS. LET'S CHANGE KOREA!

118
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,528
<i>Candidate Hyun? Is he not ready yet?</i>

119
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,530
Hurry and call him.

120
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,450
<i>Looks like we're having some trouble</i>
<i>with the connection.</i>

121
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,328
<i>We'll reconnect as soon as it's ready.</i>

122
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,956
Where's Mr. Hyun?

123
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,416
What happened?

124
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,460
I'm sorry. He wouldn't answer his phone.

125
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,214
See if he's anywhere in the office.

126
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,132
And see if anyone saw him leave.

127
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,592
Yes, ma'am.

128
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:36,148
<i>Then let's bring in Bae Yeong-seon now,</i>
<i>Peace and Freedom Party candidate.</i>

129
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,110
<i>They say elections are</i>
<i>the flower of democracy.</i>

130
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:45,324
Today, that flower is in full bloom.
It's a day of celebration.

131
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,993
Depending on the results,

132
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,413
I may be elected or defeated,

133
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,915
<i>but for the people,</i>

134
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,710
<i>regardless of the outcome,</i>
<i>everyone is a winner.</i>

135
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,421
As one team called Korea,

136
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,007
we're coming together once again.

137
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,261
This very moment is
a celebration of our unity.

138
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:28,117
1 HOUR 15 MINUTES AGO

139
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,453
ADMITTED ON FEBRUARY 26, 2027
EOM SUN-JEONG, FEMALE

140
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,972
Sir, where have you been?

141
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,184
Candidate Hyun, what happened?

142
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,103
Can we have a brief interview?

143
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,813
What do you think of the exit poll?

144
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,023
- Sir, are you okay?
- Why was the speech order changed?

145
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,149
Do you accept the results?

146
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,975
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Hyun Min-Cheol!

147
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,542
"I have to change first
to change the world."

148
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:28,672
"One person's change
can change the world."

149
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,886
"Saving one person is saving the world."

150
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,224
The moment I decided to enter politics,

151
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,018
I have always proclaimed these.

152
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,062
So now,

153
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,731
you might be a little sick of them.

154
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,775
Or perhaps,

155
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,070
they sound too cheesy.

156
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,864
So today,

157
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,533
I'm going to talk about something else.

158
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,993
Something

159
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,747
a bit more personal.

160
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,669
I was born and raised in Haseong,

161
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,297
a city famous for its mist.

162
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,717
People even say

163
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,886
mist is Haseong's specialty.

164
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:22,017
Mist hides the path ahead,
but never the one behind.

165
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,770
The road we've already traveled

166
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,648
is always clear,
no matter how thick the mist.

167
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,942
But the road ahead,

168
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:34,613
no matter how near,
remains hidden from view.

169
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,783
<i>Though I've seen mist</i>
<i>countless times since childhood,</i>

170
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,327
<i>it has always filled me with fear.</i>

171
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,205
<i>Because when walking through the fog,</i>

172
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:48,043
<i>the faces that were just beside me</i>
<i>suddenly disappear.</i>

173
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,380
The faces of the people

174
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,299
who were walking by my side,

175
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,218
holding my hands.

176
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,313
<i>Before I could even come of age,</i>
<i>I lost my parents.</i>

177
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,941
<i>Then after coming of age,</i>

178
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,654
<i>I had to part ways with my friends</i>
<i>I grew up with at the orphanage.</i>

179
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:20,993
<i>The person I dated for seven years</i>
<i>since I was 20,</i>

180
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,956
<i>vanished into the fog without a word.</i>

181
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,042
That's how

182
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,171
everybody left me.

183
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,843
Except for one person.

184
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,679
Only one person

185
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,849
didn't leave me.

186
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,854
She's always by my side,

187
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,190
saying that she's here for me.

188
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,775
That person

189
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,905
gave me the home I have never had,

190
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,991
and the precious family

191
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,870
that I could only dream of.

192
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,998
<i>So I'm always sorry.</i>

193
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,753
<i>She says it's not sorry but thankful,</i>

194
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,714
<i>that I confuse the two.</i>

195
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,384
<i>But still, I'm sorry.</i>

196
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,804
She has quietly endured the hardships

197
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:27,059
she would never have faced,
had I not entered politics.

198
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,436
And if I were to say this aloud,

199
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,939
I know she would say it again

200
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:37,486
that it's not sorry but grateful.

201
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,823
I'm sincerely grateful.

202
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,952
Thanks to you,

203
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,288
I am where I am today.

204
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,667
CANDIDATE HYUN
CREDITS HIS WIFE FOR SUPPORT

205
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,591
<i>Here today,</i>

206
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:03,136
<i>I make a formal proposal</i>
<i>to Candidate Bae Yeong-seon.</i>

207
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,682
Please join me
in passing the Do Tae-hoon Act,

208
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,352
a special bill
on the H Chemical fire and public safety,

209
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:15,399
which has been discarded dozens of times

210
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:19,069
and pending in the Assembly for 15 years.

211
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,950
<i>Regardless of the election results,</i>
<i>if we join forces,</i>

212
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,077
<i>we can pass this bill.</i>

213
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,538
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
<i>- Candidate Bae.</i>

214
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,707
<i>On the day</i>
<i>the flower of democracy is in full bloom,</i>

215
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,959
<i>please join me in passing the special act</i>

216
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,712
so that our people can live

217
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,340
happy, and most importantly, secure lives.

218
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,176
Some might ask

219
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,804
why today, of all days.

220
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,222
That's because

221
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,434
I lost another person

222
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,395
in the fog.

223
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,315
And seeing that person,

224
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,526
I realized why I entered politics

225
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:04,364
and why I wanted to become
a president in the first place.

226
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,907
Some might ask

227
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,786
why I'm still hung up
on what happened 15 years ago.

228
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,371
That's because

229
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,249
people who shouldn't have died, died.

230
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,794
Because there are victims
who were framed as perpetrators.

231
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,047
Too many people have died,

232
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,009
and there are too many unjust stories.

233
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,389
Because each and every one
of those deaths becomes a nail

234
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,311
that pierces the wound every spring,

235
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,814
turning April into a season

236
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,943
too painful to endure.

237
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,657
"I have to change first

238
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,202
to change the world."

239
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,662
"One person's change

240
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,332
can change the world."

241
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,418
"Saving one person

242
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,712
is saving the world."

243
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,590
Because

244
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,593
each and every one of them

245
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,305
is the world.

246
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:35,872
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Hyun Min-Cheol!

247
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,669
- Cha Su-yeon!
- Cha Su-yeon!

248
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,973
<i>Live election coverage?</i>
<i>No need to watch it.</i>

249
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,517
<i>It's already been decided.</i>

250
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,979
<i>Who wins?</i>
<i>Of course, Hyun Min-Cheol, the Iron Man.</i>

251
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,443
I kept saying HWA, remember?

252
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,697
HWA means "Hyun Wins Anyway."

253
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,908
Elections are scientific.

254
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:17,164
What I'm saying now is scientific.

255
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,041
I'm not wondering
whether Hyun Min-Cheol wins or not.

256
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,419
He's already won!

257
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,421
You'll see.

258
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,012
Right now, I'm more interested in

259
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,055
the Iron Lady, Ms. Cha.

260
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,433
I wonder what our lovely Ms. Cha's

261
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,810
outfit is going to be like today.

262
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,898
I want to know
how her OOTD will catch our eyes.

263
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,983
All right.

264
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,985
Let's see.

265
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,448
Remember this time?

266
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,200
You saw this, right?

267
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,785
I already knew it,
but I really look just like her.

268
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,120
<i>See?</i>

269
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,290
Look at all these clothes,
jewelry, and bags.

270
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,709
Everything Ms. Cha wore is sold out.

271
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:06,046
Some people say
this is the old money style, but…

272
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,759
You're right. It's silver spoon style.

273
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,219
Diamond spoon style.

274
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,679
Today will be the highlight.

275
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,307
It's the finale.

276
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,685
This is what I'm dying to know now.

277
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,271
SILK_CHOI
300,000 WON, I SUPPORT YOU!

278
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,691
Oh, my! Thank you, "SILK_Choi!"

279
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,611
I wish you a silky day today.

280
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,196
Thank you.

281
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,990
<i>Oh, boy. You didn't have to donate.</i>

282
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,033
<i>But thank you.</i>

283
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,618
Yes!

284
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,329
Yes, we're going to have an order rush.

285
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:42,874
We'll place the order in 30 minutes,
so hang tight.

286
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,461
Come on. This is not the time
to complain about being overworked.

287
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:49,214
We've got to make hay
while the sun shines.

288
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,635
Fine. Just make sure
we hit a new sales record.

289
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,470
Then I'll give you a bonus,

290
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,931
and an oversea vacation on top of that!

291
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,849
Where do you want to go? Guam? Maldives?

292
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,601
How about Hawaii…

293
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,897
Sorry.

294
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,692
Today is an important day.

295
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:09,943
Focus.

296
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,195
Geez.

297
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,905
Sure. Anything you want.

298
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,106
What are you doing? Come on.

299
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,442
Gosh.

300
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:55,071
Oh, my!
You just get prettier and prettier, Ji-yu.

301
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:59,075
You look just like Ms. Cha.

302
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,998
The navy jacket over there.

303
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:08,043
It's a gift to celebrate starting school.

304
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,171
It's the jacket that went viral
after Jenny wore it at the airport.

305
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,466
I thought it'd suit you perfectly,

306
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,510
so I brought it all the way from Paris.

307
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,970
It's a limited edition.

308
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,055
Do you want to try it on?

309
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,015
Later.

310
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,184
Sure.

311
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,188
Ms. Cha is waiting. Hurry up.

312
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,934
Excellent choice.

313
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,438
White is the best color
for a fresh start for sure.

314
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,408
Oh, my.

315
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,995
You look gorgeous in white.

316
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:54,083
It fits you perfectly.

317
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,879
The shoes are over there.

318
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,472
I picked out the pairs
that would go well with this outfit.

319
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:11,309
And all of them are new collections
that haven't been released in Korea yet.

320
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,442
How about these?

321
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,946
They were very well received
at this year's haute couture shows.

322
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,356
Aren't they a little old-fashioned?

323
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,901
Nothing beats the classics!

324
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,238
Real luxury isn't about following trends,

325
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,823
but about setting them.

326
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:10,410
You have such a great eye.

327
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,747
It's perfect for a special day like today.

328
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,750
My gosh. That's just perfect.

329
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,257
<i>All right. Hyun Min-Cheol</i>
<i>of the Participation People's Party</i>

330
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,803
<i>has been confirmed as the 23rd president</i>
<i>of the Republic of Korea.</i>

331
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,935
<i>Beginning as a poor factory worker,</i>

332
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,105
<i>Hyun Min-Cheol has overcome</i>
<i>disability and prejudice.</i>

333
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,816
<i>And now, he has risen</i>
<i>to become the president of South Korea!</i>

334
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,364
- We won!
- We won!

335
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,576
Sincerity wins!

336
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,162
- Let's change Korea!
- Let's change Korea!

337
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,581
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Hyun Min-Cheol!

338
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,375
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Sir.

339
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,744
My goodness. Congratulations, madam!

340
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,413
No, I shouldn't call you that anymore.

341
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,541
First Lady, congratulations.

342
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,234
Red suits you.

343
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,361
Pardon?

344
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,196
Your lipstick.

345
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,868
What are you doing? Give it to her now.

346
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,161
Okay.

347
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,127
Let me know if you like the color.
I'll get it ready for you.

348
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,641
It doesn't suit me.

349
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,397
I guess it looks good on people
with soft and innocent faces like you.

350
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,357
I'm sorry.

351
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:49,986
You should keep your hands

352
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,031
off someone else's stuff.

353
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,425
My goodness.

354
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,316
Whether it's an object

355
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,319
or a person.

356
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,658
- Cha Su-yeon!
- Cha Su-yeon!

357
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:47,251
How do you feel about
becoming the First Lady?

358
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,711
Ms. Cha Su-yeon!

359
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,339
How do you feel about
becoming the First Lady?

360
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,218
Cha Su-yeon is the best!

361
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,524
Follow the front car, please.

362
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,863
Hello.

363
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,449
Did I guess our dearest Madam Cha,

364
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,034
no,

365
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:24,038
the First Lady's outfit correctly
yet again today?

366
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,124
I guessed right!

367
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,211
The key points of Madam Cha's outfit today

368
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,923
are her nude-toned lipstick
and natural hairstyle.

369
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,344
She dressed formally without overdoing it.

370
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,596
It's perfect for the occasion!

371
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,475
<i>A white suit looks a bit formal,</i>

372
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,853
but it's a very stylish look,

373
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,397
so it makes you glow.

374
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,946
Thank you!

375
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,950
<i>I'm a hot issue from head to toe</i>

376
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,953
<i>Everything about me becomes a hot issue</i>

377
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,038
<i>Everyone, take control</i>

378
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,674
What did I tell you?

379
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,759
I said we'd break our sales record.

380
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,762
Make sure that no size is sold out.

381
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,431
Accept every order.

382
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,726
I'll do whatever it takes to stock up.

383
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:27,643
Okay.

384
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,563
What is it?

385
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,731
I'm sorry.

386
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:32,982
Sorry about what?

387
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,818
I left my phone at home.

388
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,028
Gosh, you…

389
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,696
I'm hanging up.

390
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,700
Why on earth are you so distracted?

391
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,328
We need every second
to earn as much as we can!

392
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,497
Go ahead first. I'll catch up soon.

393
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,167
Oh, speaking of which.

394
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,961
What was that with Madam just now?

395
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,630
You glared daggers at her!

396
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,882
How dare you act up in front of her?

397
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,884
You better not do that again.

398
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,093
I'm sorry.

399
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,511
Why are you still here?

400
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,180
I said we needed every second.

401
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:06,682
Seriously.

402
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,042
<i>The wife of the president-elect,</i>

403
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,879
<i>Cha Su-yeon, is heading to Haseong Yard.</i>

404
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:43,344
<i>Madam Cha led a powerful fanbase</i>
<i>centered around her fan club, Iron Lady,</i>

405
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:47,556
<i>which has a million fans, and contributed</i>
<i>to the victory of the election.</i>

406
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,933
Cha Su-yeon!

407
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,143
<i>President-elect Hyun and Madam Cha Su-yeon</i>

408
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,146
<i>will give a victory speech in Haseong,</i>

409
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,566
<i>where their political base started from.</i>

410
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,611
<i>Haseong Yard already has</i>
<i>Cha's numerous fans</i>

411
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:04,699
<i>and the president-elect's supporters</i>
<i>waiting for the two.</i>

412
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,577
<i>The Yard is filled with excitement</i>
<i>and heat which resembles that</i>

413
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,413
<i>of a concert.</i>

414
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,895
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR
HASEONG HIGH SCHOOL ADMISSION IN 2027

415
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:46,157
<i>Just like new sprouts that grow fresh</i>
<i>on a mountain after it rains, I hope</i>

416
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,408
<i>my fellow students</i>

417
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,661
<i>will overcome any hardships and obstacles.</i>

418
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,497
<i>I sincerely wish</i>
<i>for your tremendous success</i>

419
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,874
<i>when you step into society.</i>

420
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,251
You must be happy

421
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,462
to have such a brilliant son.

422
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:02,006
He's good at both studies and sports.

423
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,591
That's not it.

424
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,634
He's handsome and tall.

425
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,970
He could outshine most idol singers.

426
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,432
Would he be satisfied with being an idol?

427
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,310
He could easily become a doctor
or study law.

428
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,814
It must be fun to support Gang Myeong.

429
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,108
Stop it.

430
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,943
I'm jealous, that's all.

431
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,573
It's Cha Su-yeon.

432
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,076
The winner is Hyun.

433
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,702
The winner is Hyun.

434
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,455
- The winner is Hyun.
- The winner is Hyun.

435
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,249
- The winner is Hyun.
- Enough, be quiet.

436
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,295
Why did you come? You must be busy.

437
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,507
My family voted in advance yesterday.

438
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,175
Thank you.

439
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,719
You've become prettier in the meantime.

440
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,597
Look at your skin. It's so firm.

441
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,517
Take good care of my child.

442
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,228
Come on, Ji-yu is a freshman too.

443
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:01,315
Seriously though, why did you come?
The election is tomorrow.

444
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,193
You're here.

445
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,697
You should've told us beforehand.

446
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,241
I didn't know either.

447
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,119
Can we take a photo?

448
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,995
I'm a huge fan of yours.

449
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,043
Let us take a photo together, too.

450
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,921
- Shall we all take one together?
- Really?

451
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,297
Shall we?

452
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,175
If I'd known beforehand,
I would've done my hair.

453
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,510
Secretary Shin, join us.

454
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,262
No, I'll take a photo of you.

455
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,264
Okay.

456
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,194
Didn't you say you couldn't make time?

457
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,196
Yes.

458
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,198
See you later.

459
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,660
<i>The freshmen representatives</i>
<i>will swear an oath.</i>

460
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:58,998
Class 2 of Year 1,
Hyun Ji Yu and An Gang Myeong.

461
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,291
Come here.

462
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,798
<i>- We swear.</i>
<i>- We swear.</i>

463
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:11,552
<i>We freshmen will respect</i>
<i>our friends and teachers.</i>

464
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,721
<i>- With genuine…</i>
- Who would you pick?

465
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:17,099
A mom who neglects
her daughter's entrance ceremony

466
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,143
because tomorrow is the election day?

467
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,270
Or a mom who attends the ceremony

468
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,230
despite the election being tomorrow?

469
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,358
You should've told me in advance.

470
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,985
I could've fetched you.

471
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,403
I thought you'd be busy.

472
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:36,202
I forgot how devoted you are to your son.

473
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,787
Where's my husband?

474
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,998
An interview with a broadcaster.

475
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,292
Secretary Lee is assisting him.

476
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,836
Last Friday.

477
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:50,925
He suddenly called off a schedule,
and I asked you to find out why.

478
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,844
Everything was fine until the morning.

479
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,350
You've yet to find out? Or you refuse to?

480
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,647
I apologize.

481
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,107
That means you refuse to.

482
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:11,153
<i>We'll do our very best</i>
<i>to secure the environment</i>

483
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,322
<i>where students can focus on their studies.</i>

484
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,740
<i>Thank you.</i>

485
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,753
Your timing was off just now.

486
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,713
I was right. It was two seconds.

487
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,048
Mine was two seconds.

488
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,510
You said you were nervous. I guess not.

489
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,387
Whatever.

490
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,556
- It's cold. Let's go in.
- Yes.

491
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,951
Congratulations.

492
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,543
Ji-yu.

493
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,462
It's my entrance ceremony.

494
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,842
Not where you run your campaign.

495
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,260
Just for today.

496
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,596
Congratulations.

497
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,558
Must you go this far?

498
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,767
You look pretty.

499
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,269
Smile.

500
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,446
I want to go study overseas.

501
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,159
Study overseas out of the blue?

502
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,870
I passed a ballet school audition.

503
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,748
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

504
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,416
You never brought it up.

505
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,084
Weren't you going to stop me anyway?

506
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,213
You stop me every time saying
it disrupts the election.

507
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,550
No competitions, no arts high school.

508
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,468
That's not--

509
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,219
Even now, look.

510
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,765
Instead of congratulating me
or asking which school it is,

511
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:06,268
you scold me
for not telling you in advance first.

512
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,399
Tomorrow is the election.

513
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,942
We can talk after that.

514
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,111
Election, election, election!

515
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:18,656
Can you stop?

516
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,282
I have no choice.

517
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,577
Everything will change after tomorrow.

518
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,913
Everything changes for you.

519
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,332
The election result doesn't concern me.

520
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,625
Ji-yu.

521
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,590
I'll go after the election.

522
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,133
Are you happy?

523
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,302
- That's not it.
- What now?

524
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,349
Nothing matters after the election.

525
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,809
Whether I go overseas or not.

526
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,728
I can live however I want, right?

527
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,522
I don't have to see Dad anymore, right?

528
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,609
"Don't have to see Dad anymore?"

529
00:44:57,277 --> 00:45:00,030
Aren't you going overseas to study?

530
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,825
Aren't you going overseas to do ballet?

531
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:07,746
Why would you go so far as to
study overseas just to avoid your dad?

532
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,874
Why?

533
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,334
It's none of your business.

534
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,420
Just leave me alone.

535
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,090
Look at me and talk.

536
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,926
I said, look at me!

537
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,600
It's all bullshit.

538
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:31,895
What?

539
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,162
What did you just say?

540
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:51,039
Hyun Ji-yu.

541
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,333
Look me in the eyes and say that again!

542
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,380
It's all bullshit.

543
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,717
Sincerity and whatnot,
those words are all bullshit.

544
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,428
Both you and Dad.

545
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,013
It's all bullshit!

546
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,442
Dad…

547
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,945
is seeing a woman.

548
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,825
I saw it.

549
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,011
Besides you,

550
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,804
has anyone seen it?

551
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,560
- What?
- Who else did you tell?

552
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,146
Friends? Teachers?

553
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,653
This is important. Answer me.

554
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,197
Did anyone else see it?

555
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,407
Who else did you tell?

556
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,661
Don't tell me…

557
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:14,957
You knew?

558
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,500
Answer me.

559
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,626
No one else saw it?

560
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,086
Am I the only one you told?

561
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,672
We're the only ones who know, right?

562
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,341
You knew.

563
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,636
You knew, didn't you?

564
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:28,762
Since when?

565
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:29,846
That's important?

566
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,099
Dad is seeing a woman.

567
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,226
Dad is cheating on you.

568
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,769
How is this not important?

569
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,606
That's his right to privacy.

570
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,317
Privacy?

571
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,153
Aren't you two married?

572
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,154
Even if we are--

573
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,282
You knew, but you still live with him?

574
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,033
Why?

575
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:52,786
Just why?

576
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,747
For what? For whom?

577
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,249
You and I.

578
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,294
We're the only ones
who know about this, right?

579
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,090
Then keep this between us.

580
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,093
The word cannot leak out.

581
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,262
What you've said has never happened.

582
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,555
Promise me.

583
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,056
Mom.

584
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,976
Once this leaks out,
it won't end with his private life.

585
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,478
It won't end just as our family matter.

586
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,690
It'll come back to us
with consequences we can never bear.

587
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,359
So promise me.

588
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,777
Promise?

589
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,489
Isn't a promise between a couple
a promise too?

590
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,158
What about a promise between family?

591
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,076
Hyun Ji-yu, promise me.

592
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,203
Dad is the one
who broke the promise first!

593
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,509
I'm begging you.

594
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,304
Just forget it.

595
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,515
What you saw and heard that day.

596
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,434
Forget all about it.

597
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,480
You're amazing!

598
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,274
Why are you going this far?

599
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:07,194
President? First Lady?

600
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,696
Are those so important?

601
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,578
Think however you like.

602
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,998
I've erased it from my memory already.

603
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,416
Mom!

604
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,007
I'll start driving.

605
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,369
It's Cha Su-yeon!

606
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,756
- Cha Su-yeon!
- Cha Su-yeon!

607
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,279
The First Lady,

608
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,489
Cha Su-yeon, is making her entrance.

609
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,840
- Cha Su-yeon!
- Cha Su-yeon!

610
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:07,689
Thank you.

611
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,900
Thank you.

612
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,027
Thank you.

613
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:14,488
Thank you.

614
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,158
Thank you.

615
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:19,993
Thank you.

616
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,956
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Hyun Min-Cheol!

617
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:58,156
President-elect Hyun Min-Cheol
is making his entrance.

618
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:03,328
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Hyun Min-Cheol!

619
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,386
<i>The result is out.</i>
<i>My house's in an uproar.</i>

620
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,387
<i>It was insane.</i>

621
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,598
<i>Should we call Ji-yu a princess now?</i>

622
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,850
<i>It's Young Lady, not Princess.</i>

623
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,852
<i>Why is the heroine so quiet?</i>

624
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:11,479
<i>She doesn't want</i>
<i>to text us lower class people now.</i>

625
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,231
<i>She won't sit with us anymore.</i>

626
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,025
<i>Should we test her food first?</i>

627
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,693
<i>She already has a food taster.</i>

628
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,862
<i>- Who?</i>
<i>- An Gang-myeong's mom.</i>

629
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:21,948
<i>Right, she can come to school</i>
<i>to work starting tomorrow.</i>

630
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,485
Please look at the display board.

631
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:46,700
- Hyun Min-Cheol!
- Hyun Min-Cheol!

632
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,430
Here.

633
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,110
Don't try too hard.

634
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,945
You'll get tired easily.

635
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,532
Do you know what's funny?

636
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,576
If you say, "Let's stop here today,"

637
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,161
you can continue again.

638
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,470
You can do it.

639
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,931
<i>I believe in you.</i>

640
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:55,185
<i>I believe you can stand</i>

641
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,853
<i>and walk again.</i>

642
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,608
<i>Others might not, but I believe in you.</i>

643
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,028
<i>So you should believe it too.</i>

644
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,076
That's it.

645
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,536
Honey, straighten your shoulders.

646
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,497
Yes. Don't look down.

647
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,165
Look at me and walk. Yes.

648
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:18,917
You're almost there.

649
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,715
I told you that you could do it.

650
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,676
Walk to where I am.

651
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,720
One more step. Yes.

652
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,847
One more step.

653
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,225
Just one more step.

654
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,769
Honey!

655
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,233
You did well. You did well.

656
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,696
You did well.

657
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,119
Honey, you're almost there.

658
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,454
You're almost there. Good job.

659
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,125
<i>Do you want a break?</i>

660
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,502
<i>Five minutes.</i>

661
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,629
<i>No, just one minute.</i>

662
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,439
I told you that you could do it.

663
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,110
You're here. You're really here.

664
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,612
We did it.

665
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,506
Traitor!

666
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:57,932
Let me go!

667
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,604
Sincerity? What nonsense.

668
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,939
Everything was a lie!

669
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,232
You murderer!

670
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,446
You guys killed him.

671
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,573
Tae-hoon.

672
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,034
You two killed him!

673
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,414
Are you okay?

674
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,333
What about my husband?

675
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,377
He's safe.

676
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,490
Are you happy?

677
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,158
Are you?

678
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,536
You killed Tae-hoon,

679
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:04,415
and now you've become a president.
Are you over the moon?

680
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,460
Do Tae-hoon Law?

681
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:11,965
Must you make use of his death too?

682
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,469
You guys make me sick.

683
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,680
It's disgusting.

684
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,602
Just you watch.

685
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,229
I won't let your sacrifice

686
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,856
go to waste.

687
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:31,734
Sacrifice?

688
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,489
It's sacrifice
only if one chooses for oneself.

689
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,199
He didn't sacrifice himself.

690
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,785
You killed him.

691
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,495
You killed him!

692
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,083
What are you doing? Drag him out!

693
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:50,253
I'll make you pay for Tae-hoon's death!

694
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,630
I'll risk my life to make you pay!

695
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,048
And you two!

696
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,551
I'll make sure to drag you down!

697
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,804
I'll drag you down no matter what!

698
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:23,828
Thank you.

699
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,915
Eun Bo-ra.

700
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,546
Cha Su-yeon!

701
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,883
- Cha Su-yeon!
- Cha Su-yeon!

702
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:03,076
- Hyun Min-cheol!
- Hyun Min-cheol!

703
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:06,788
- Cha Su-yeon! Hyun Min-cheol!
- Cha Su-yeon! Hyun Min-cheol!

704
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:01,592
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

705
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,277
Let's get divorced.

706
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,491
What?

707
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:08,618
Let's divorce.

708
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,793
<i>There was a car accident on February 26.</i>

709
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,837
<i>It was a hit and run.</i>

710
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,964
<i>Find out if there's a witness.</i>

711
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,676
<i>What will change if the truth</i>
<i>about the fire comes out?</i>

712
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,427
There's nothing you can change.

713
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,762
<i>I saw it.</i>

714
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,765
<i>I saw you two together that day.</i>

715
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:16,102
<i>It's divorce. Use that exact word.</i>

716
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,062
<i>I'll end it.</i>

717
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:23,359
<i>I made the choice,</i>
<i>so I should do it my way.</i>
