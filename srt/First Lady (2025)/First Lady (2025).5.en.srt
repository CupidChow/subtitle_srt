1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,917
ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,961
CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

3
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,133
It's what I'm good at.

4
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,969
It's

5
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,763
ruining something.

6
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,059
This time,

7
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,519
it will be you.

8
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,165
Nonsense.

9
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,253
It's total nonsense.

10
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,298
WINTER OF 2008

11
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,676
If I change first, I can change the world?

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,554
The truth is,
the world blames me for changing alone.

13
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:41,267
The very world that
they've been blaming for not changing.

14
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:50,860
Do you know
why my father crushed you completely?

15
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,697
Because you were sincere.

16
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,408
The real deal.

17
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,421
He was afraid that people would see that.

18
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,006
That's why.

19
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,636
The activists who wander
from protest to protest

20
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,014
and politicians who prowl
around the election scene don't have that.

21
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,018
You actually came from the working class,

22
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,063
and you were fighting for your colleagues
who were wrongfully injured.

23
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,900
It was only a matter of time
before people realized

24
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,443
that you were the real deal.

25
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,698
Like you said, it's been 20 years.

26
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,993
Do you know
why Haseong still supports my father?

27
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,328
Even if it was only a towel,

28
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,957
he'd visit those
living beyond the reach of cars,

29
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,252
offering them one by one
and asking how they are doing.

30
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,505
That sincerity touches people's hearts
and makes him win.

31
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,886
You may buy votes with your slogan,
but not their hearts.

32
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,763
To win their hearts,

33
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,891
you have to be sincere.

34
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,896
And you

35
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,773
already have the sincerity.

36
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,235
Only you don't know

37
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,907
how powerful it is.

38
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,664
Gosh, it's freezing.

39
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,124
Oh, you were here.

40
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,419
Why are you two together?

41
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,569
If you were going to drink,
you should've called me.

42
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,322
You know I crave alcohol
after I work overtime…

43
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,677
H CHEMICAL'S ILLEGAL SUCCESSION OUT

44
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,472
H CHEMICAL
HASEONG FACTORY

45
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,901
NO ENTRY
FACTORY CLOSED DUE TO FIRE INCIDENT

46
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,426
1,488 DAYS WITHOUT AN ACCIDENT

47
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,513
KEEP OUT
RISK OF COLLAPSE

48
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,014
…COMES BEFORE CORPORATE PROFIT

49
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,016
DANGER
KEEP OUT

50
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,023
Wow.

51
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,608
Where did you get these?

52
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,984
From the sauna locker room?

53
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,779
What? Is it a trade secret?

54
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,829
All right. One, two, three…

55
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,289
Here. 30,000 won.

56
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,755
Are you done being a fangirl now?

57
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,882
Good thinking.

58
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:31,511
My life's so messed up,
everyone around me is Cha Su-yeon's fan.

59
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,596
And they're all living miserable lives.

60
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,807
Enough with the nonsense
and give me 20,000 won more.

61
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,643
So you're not mute.

62
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,312
Here. 50,000 won.

63
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,869
It's a full set. You're good.

64
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,125
MR. BUYER

65
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,879
Hello, sir.

66
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,548
Now?

67
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,966
Sure, no problem.

68
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,051
Just send me where you want to meet.

69
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,512
I'll bring the stuff over right away.

70
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,412
I didn't see the necklace that I gave you.

71
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,414
Maybe Lee Hwa-jin stole it?

72
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,375
She was ransacking this place
without turning the lights on.

73
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,105
-Hello.
-Hello. Open it.

74
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,486
Take it.

75
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,904
Thank you.

76
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,031
There's one more.

77
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:42,933
This way.

78
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,104
-This way, please.
-Thanks.

79
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,189
Wait.

80
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,984
Could you tell me a little bit
about this person who wanted to see me?

81
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,737
Did the chairman not mention anything?

82
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,532
I was just told it's a woman in her 20s.

83
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,161
Come this way.

84
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,412
Okay.

85
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,351
Hello, nice to meet you.
I'm Choi Myeong-ju.

86
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,023
I heard you wanted some special outfits,
so I brought a few.

87
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,486
You can try them on before you decide…

88
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,287
Let's divorce.

89
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,416
Keep your eyes closed.

90
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,417
Okay.

91
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,425
One second.

92
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,426
Okay.

93
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,969
Now, open your eyes.

94
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,638
Ta-da.

95
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,976
Congrats on your admission, Ji-yu.
You're going to high school now.

96
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,145
Do you like it?

97
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,104
Mom.

98
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,107
Are you sure I can wear this?

99
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,236
It's the only thing you wanted
from what I have.

100
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,113
Are you sure?

101
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,365
Of course.

102
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,576
But school starts in one month.

103
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,953
One month will fly by.

104
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,165
Mom, but I--

105
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,792
Why? Keep it on.

106
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,835
So Dad can see it when he's home.

107
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,004
I want this as a gift for graduation,

108
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,297
not for starting school.

109
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,549
What?

110
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,842
I love this.

111
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,637
I really love it,

112
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,764
but I'll love it

113
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,017
even more if I get it when I turn 20.

114
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,103
When you turn 20?

115
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,688
Yes.

116
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,692
No, that's insane.

117
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,277
You turning 20?

118
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,821
Come on. Three years will fly by.

119
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,824
So please keep it safe until then.

120
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,581
Maybe Lee Hwa-jin stole it?

121
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,584
She was ransacking this place
without turning the lights on.

122
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,236
Please enter the passcode.

123
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,784
Safe unlocked.

124
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,077
Safe door open.

125
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,354
YU JIN-MYEONG
APRIL 4, 2012

126
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,495
Ms. Cha.

127
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:58,457
I went to Chairman Yang's vacation home
to see his special guest today.

128
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,334
And guess who I met there.

129
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,586
Hwa-jin. Lee Hwa-jin!

130
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,052
HASEONG HIGH SCHOOL

131
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,347
HASEONG HIGH SCHOOL RAISES TALENT
THROUGH A HEALTHY MIND AND BODY

132
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,396
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RESULTS
OF THE SCHOOL VIOLENCE CASE

133
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,315
Allegations that President-elect's wife,
Cha, exerted pressure

134
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,485
to block the convening
of the school violence committee

135
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,903
have been proven false.

136
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,447
Stating that Ko and Park,
who filmed and shared the video,

137
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,533
habitually committed acts of violence

138
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,369
and used the footage to threaten them,

139
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,831
their victims have filed
a criminal complaint.

140
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,918
That's the question.
Doesn't this remind you of a formula?

141
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,003
It's…

142
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,879
Hi, Ji-yu.

143
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,131
Go and sit.

144
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,509
Let's continue. Focus.

145
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,929
This question should remind you
of the formula.

146
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,640
We talked about this
in the last class, guys.

147
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,100
Focus.

148
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,935
Focus, okay?

149
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,353
This comes up a lot on exams.

150
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,149
Now, plus three…

151
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,444
What do you mean?
You don't want to go study abroad?

152
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,696
I'm not going.

153
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,282
I'm not going to run away.

154
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,869
Ji-yu, this can be hard for you.

155
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,245
I told you.

156
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,373
Even if the same thing happens,
I'll fight her again.

157
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,545
The fact that Dad's president now
changed your world,

158
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,963
not mine.

159
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,924
I want to stay in my world.

160
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,510
I'll fight in my world.

161
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:38,390
So don't use me as an excuse.
You just do what you want.

162
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,060
If you want to divorce him, divorce him.

163
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,728
If you want to fight, fight.

164
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,983
Just apply the modified formula.

165
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,819
Now, what is X plus Y?

166
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,905
It's three.

167
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,948
X plus Y equals three.

168
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,284
And X multiplied by Y equals minus two.

169
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,577
Minus two.

170
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,287
Then X squared plus Y cubed…

171
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,330
Explain this.

172
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,665
You said I could count on you.

173
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,168
Are you okay, sir?

174
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,712
I'm sorry.

175
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,175
I only asked you
to keep Ji-yu out of trouble

176
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,427
in case Su-yeon tried to pull strings.

177
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,097
So I was going to handle it quietly.

178
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,226
Then she flipped out, saying I was
threatening her. What could I do?

179
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,896
Saying Ji-yu can't study abroad
unless she divorces me

180
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,147
is definitely a threat.

181
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,109
I thought Secretary Shin made it clear.

182
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,820
I offered to help you with the divorce,

183
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,447
and I was supposed
to get the minister position in return.

184
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,199
What did you say?

185
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,909
Wait.

186
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,537
Was it all Secretary Shin's decision?

187
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,665
Is that true?

188
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,833
As always,

189
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,293
you have such good people around you.

190
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,256
They do all the dirty work for you
without even being asked.

191
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,468
Before, it was Su-yeon,
and now, it's Secretary Shin?

192
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,973
Are you saying
Secretary Shin knew about this all along?

193
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,560
This whole plan to get Ji-yu in trouble?

194
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,981
Was it also Secretary Shin
who released the video?

195
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,026
I don't know.

196
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,405
All I did was
to ask the girl who filmed it

197
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,449
if the video was backed up to the cloud.

198
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,703
I can't figure out
who took the video and spread it.

199
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,996
And I don't need to know.

200
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,831
Answer my question.

201
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,000
Is it true that
Secretary Shin is involved?

202
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,085
I kept my promise, so you keep yours.

203
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,462
Tell me. Is it true?

204
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,757
This has greatly affected
my school as well.

205
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,552
Why do you think I took such a big risk?

206
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,929
I made my move
after Secretary Shin's confirmation

207
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,890
that she'd been delegated full authority.

208
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,433
I didn't know about it.

209
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,729
What kind of father would risk
his daughter's future like that?

210
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,148
It makes sense.

211
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,609
This felt way too risky.

212
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,987
See to it that Su-yeon
is handled delicately

213
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,532
You know what she can do
when she sets her mind to it.

214
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,452
She can be ruthless even to her family,

215
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,746
as you must've witnessed
rising to that position.

216
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,915
Do you want me to talk to her?

217
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,750
Stop meddling in our business.

218
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,212
And whatever Secretary Shin promised,

219
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,339
forget about it.

220
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,487
I hear Longjing tea tastes best
on the third brew.

221
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:44,076
YEAR 2012

222
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,620
It's nice.

223
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,330
Both the scent and color.

224
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,332
Have some.

225
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,642
It doesn't taste as good
as your sister's brew, though.

226
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,185
This is unfair.

227
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,022
The illegal election was Su-yeon's idea.

228
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,234
She plotted with Chairman Yang,
stabbed us in the back,

229
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,777
and even spread the rumours.

230
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,992
Just keep holding out.

231
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,453
We've still got time
until the presidential election.

232
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,373
If we can reveal that it was Su-yeon,

233
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,584
we can turn the tables.

234
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,966
Even if we reveal it,
I'll be the one to bear the risk.

235
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,845
Whether it's your fault or Su-yeon's,

236
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,180
the responsibility falls on me.

237
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,349
Because I'm your father.

238
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,316
I'll make my position clear at daybreak.

239
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,942
I'll walk away from all this.

240
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:03,405
You, too, should get out of politics
and focus on the foundation.

241
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,324
You can't decide this that easily.

242
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,533
Easily?

243
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,329
I've come this far
aspiring to become president.

244
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:14,291
So many of those who accused me
now hold seats in the National Assembly.

245
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,834
You think I decided this easily?

246
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,919
And what do you think I've been through?

247
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,092
To you, I'm not your child.
I'm either a setback or an opportunity!

248
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,093
You little…

249
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,304
Do you know what I really want to know?

250
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,558
Was her suicide really just a coincidence?

251
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,811
-What?
-I'm talking about Su-yeon's dead mother.

252
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,397
Stop.

253
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,816
Maybe someone did it to win the election!

254
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,984
I said, stop!

255
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,323
It wasn't suicide, was it?

256
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,062
You were right, Father.

257
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,981
Those people see my potential

258
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,317
as no bigger than a teacup.

259
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,737
They see me as someone

260
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,366
who would grovel and do whatever he's told

261
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,785
once handed a minister's post.

262
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,790
Someone easy to manipulate.

263
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:40,168
But that's not what I want.

264
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,341
I want to see these two scumbags

265
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,009
fall together.

266
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,889
That's always been
the only thing that I wanted.

267
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,977
So I should make them keep fighting.

268
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,728
Until the end.

269
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,695
Father.

270
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,281
You'll see.

271
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,176
This way, sir.

272
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,056
PARTY FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM

273
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,475
NEW VISION WITH THE SAME RESPONSIBILITY

274
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,269
BAE YEONG-SEON

275
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,023
PARTY FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM LEADER
BAE YEONG-SEON

276
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,277
You need time?

277
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,030
I thought you already agreed
to pass the special act.

278
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,909
Like I said,

279
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,203
I'm a member of my party.

280
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,289
I'm obliged to listen to the voices

281
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,041
within my party.

282
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,710
Please give me some time.

283
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,047
It sounds like time is on your side.

284
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,717
I heard that
the divorce agreement fell through.

285
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,639
There really are no secrets in this area.

286
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,890
Catch a whiff of blood,

287
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,144
then you pounce.
That's the unspoken rule in Yeouido.

288
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,029
I hear hell is empty.

289
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:35,283
Because all the evils are in Yeouido.

290
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:42,082
I thought once the election was over,
I could finally put an end to this.

291
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,964
Who do you think

292
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,425
shattered the party's unified position

293
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,094
in an instant?

294
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,144
At first,

295
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,107
I thought it was President Yu,
but I was wrong.

296
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,485
It was

297
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,779
your wife.

298
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,872
That can't be true.

299
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,126
The late Chairman Cha was

300
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,129
the treasurer of my party
for quite a while.

301
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,007
Many in my party

302
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,635
are entangled with him from back then,
like it or not.

303
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,138
And it seems that

304
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,725
your wife inherited the knot to them.

305
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,229
My wife really overturned
the party's stance overnight?

306
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,276
As someone
who's already been through a divorce,

307
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,112
let me give you some advice.

308
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,911
The real evils

309
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,331
are not in Yeouido.

310
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,416
They're in divorce court.

311
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,086
Sort out your divorce first.

312
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,672
The special act

313
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,758
comes next.

314
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,556
Can I still count on you to be on my side?

315
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:27,854
As your standing weakens,
Cha Su-yeon's influence will get stronger.

316
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,901
And I don't want that either.

317
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,903
My party's stance

318
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,030
being dictated by some private citizen

319
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,699
who isn't even a politician
or a party member,

320
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,786
that can never happen.

321
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,833
Does this answer your question?

322
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,591
Hello.

323
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,593
Let me talk to him briefly.

324
00:27:58,676 --> 00:27:59,677
No, you may not.

325
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,513
I just have something to tell him.

326
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,556
You can't. It's our security regulations.

327
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,183
I know. Just for five minutes.

328
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,518
No, just two minutes.

329
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,769
Let him.

330
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,740
I have a suggestion.

331
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,243
Go ahead. I'm listening.

332
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:27,497
Your wife is now trying to connect
with people in my party.

333
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,999
She must be desperate.

334
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,002
What about you, sir?

335
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,921
Get to your point.

336
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,591
Just take the divorce to court.

337
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:43,805
I'll make sure
my party pushes the bill through.

338
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,690
I thought
you were Assemblywoman Bae's person.

339
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,650
Was I mistaken?

340
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,487
Before that, I was Chairman Cha's person.

341
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,870
And are you trying to be my person now?

342
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:11,958
How can I trust that?

343
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,756
It looks like
you're not as desperate as your wife.

344
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,633
I'm as suspicious as her.

345
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,928
What if I have your wife's hands tied?

346
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,556
Would you trust me then?

347
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:42,197
How can you reverse the party's stance
that was overturned overnight?

348
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,241
While Cha Su-yeon has
Chairman Cha, a dead man,

349
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,369
I have you, the president-elect
with a five-year term ahead.

350
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,998
I'll have at least twice as many
supporters in the party as she does.

351
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:56,878
Just show that
your divorce is real, not a performance.

352
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,131
Then reversing the party's stance
will be a piece of cake.

353
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,967
Why would people support you,
not Assemblywoman Bae?

354
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,016
So you're the one who connected my wife

355
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,851
to Party for Peace and Freedom.

356
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,857
She overturned the party's stance
through you.

357
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:23,446
And because you're like her hands in this,
it's up to you

358
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,864
to tie her hands or not.

359
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,660
You see, the first time is tough,
but the second time is easy.

360
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,038
Just take it to court.

361
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,916
Then I'll make sure
to reverse the party's stance.

362
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,001
On one condition, though.

363
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,421
I want you to take back the offer
you made to Assemblywoman Bae

364
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,548
for prime minister.

365
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,218
Assemblywoman Bae is all washed up.

366
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:50,223
I'll find someone new
who suits you better.

367
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,351
Are you using this
to grab power in the party?

368
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,563
The National Assembly election is
in less than a year.

369
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,773
Power in the party is power to nominate

370
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,234
and the first step
toward the presidential race.

371
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,654
You know how time flies in Yeouido.

372
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,991
The late Chairman Cha was

373
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:11,244
the treasurer of my party
for quite a while.

374
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,455
Many in my party

375
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,834
are entangled with him from back then,
like it or not.

376
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,420
And it seems that

377
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:23,923
your wife inherited the knot to them.

378
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,223
The inheritance my wife got
from the late Chairman Cha,

379
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,601
are you a part of it too?

380
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,439
You stayed with Party for Peace
and Freedom and became Bae's aide.

381
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,941
Was it also my wife's plan?

382
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,990
Well, I won't deny it.

383
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,535
But that ends here.

384
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,872
Your partnership with my wife.

385
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,584
I should walk a new path
with a new person.

386
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,212
Then give it some thought.

387
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,626
So it was really your doing?

388
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,422
I decided that was the only way

389
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,133
to get her to agree to the divorce.

390
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,551
You decided?

391
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,887
I clearly said I'd do the deciding.

392
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,639
You also said we didn't have time.

393
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,933
So you held Ji-yu against her?

394
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:02,438
And risked stigmatizing her forever?

395
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,483
You should attack
what would hurt her as much as hurt you.

396
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,986
A fight is supposed to be
dangerous and painful.

397
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,781
Do you even hear yourself?

398
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,783
You must shed blood to fight.

399
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,869
You can't fight without taking any blows.

400
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,287
You're going to keep fighting?

401
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:24,544
Once the special act is passed,
we can reveal the truth.

402
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,962
While Ji-yu gets hurt?

403
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,132
We can punish those responsible
and console unjust deaths.

404
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,717
While Su-yeon bleeds?

405
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,511
We can clear the names
of the victims-turned-wrongdoers.

406
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,804
You--

407
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:35,930
Wasn't that

408
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,017
why you got into politics?

409
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,770
Wasn't that why you became president?

410
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,484
You said this on the first day we met.

411
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,654
No victim should be called a wrongdoer.

412
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:03,833
YEAR 2008

413
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,587
Please read this.

414
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,307
I'll take over. You can go.

415
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,772
You couldn't go to the toilet
because of this, right?

416
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,689
What?

417
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,527
Yes. If I leave just for a second,
they keep clearing it away.

418
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,488
So I'll stay here.

419
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,655
You can take your time.

420
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,699
Still…

421
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,534
Hello!

422
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,162
Hello.

423
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,040
Hey!

424
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,541
This is against the law!

425
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,628
Did you register?

426
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,005
Is this rally registered?

427
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,299
Well…

428
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,927
A one-man protest
doesn't require a registration.

429
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,847
You know the law well.

430
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,057
But

431
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,266
you're bad at math.

432
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,727
There are two of you.

433
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,437
It's not a one-man protest.

434
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,523
Hey, call the police right now.

435
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,399
Tell them to take them away.

436
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,860
Do you see this picket?

437
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,488
It's fine
as long as it's one person holding it.

438
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,450
Check if he's right.

439
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,368
Yes, sir.

440
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,287
Since you're good at math,
you must know how to read too.

441
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,748
Then read this.

442
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,752
A laborer who worked extremely hard
to build this hotel

443
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,754
lost his legs from an industrial accident.

444
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,589
And he's in the wrong?

445
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,883
He was injured by professional negligence?

446
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,719
You can't turn a victim into a wrongdoer!

447
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,638
Such things must never happen!

448
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,431
He did not breach any law.

449
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,353
Seriously…

450
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,564
Hey.

451
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,816
There's two of them.

452
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,361
How is this a one-man protest?

453
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,654
I have to say

454
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,073
Korean law is full of holes.

455
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,200
It's completely messed up.

456
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,493
Read it!

457
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,453
You turned a victim into a wrongdoer!

458
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,580
He's being wronged!

459
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,791
You of all people should know!

460
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,251
Read it!

461
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,005
He was neglected for two hours!
He is permanently disabled now!

462
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,507
You said you'd go as far as to

463
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,343
divorce your wife
to get the special law passed.

464
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,429
The divorce was for Su-yeon.

465
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,682
I don't care
if it's for her or the special law.

466
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,267
That day, I decided

467
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,769
to make that divorce happen
no matter what.

468
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,521
You…

469
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,607
I decided I'd do everything that would

470
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,067
make trouble for you as a president.

471
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,237
I decided that I'd dirty my own hands

472
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,740
and get criticized in your place.

473
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,409
Why are you going this far?

474
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,662
Ten years ago,

475
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,041
when my husband died, he said

476
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,544
he wished the world

477
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:57,048
Gang-myeong inherited
would be different from his.

478
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,136
That since I was doing an important job,

479
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,805
I could make the world a better place.

480
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,267
If both you and your wife couldn't do it,

481
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,145
I decided to take it into my own hands.

482
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,064
Going this far?

483
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,942
I can do anything.

484
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,527
I can do even worse than this.

485
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:24,867
Leave.

486
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,537
Don't show up in front of me again.

487
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,143
Sorry to intrude.

488
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,395
You have to see this.

489
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,146
Your wife…

490
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:01,112
The president-elect couple's
consented divorce fell through.

491
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:05,283
Contrary to the view that the couple
would divorce by consent without a suit,

492
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,243
President-elect's wife Cha

493
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,704
officially announced
a breakdown of the consent.

494
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:14,333
Ms. Cha's lawyer
has just started a press conference.

495
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,628
Now, let's hear what he has to say.

496
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,714
What's the reason it fell through?

497
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,550
Even now, Ms. Cha is doing her best

498
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,635
to prevent the worst situation.

499
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,262
If you'll give us some time--

500
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,264
Is it the alimony or custody?

501
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:31,225
Are you saying President-elect
is at fault for the breakdown?

502
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:36,314
I heard she'd countersuit
for the president-elect's wrongdoing.

503
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,275
By wrongdoing, do you mean an affair?

504
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,904
Do you mean his affair
is the reason behind the divorce?

505
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,617
Is that true?

506
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,370
As of now,

507
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,372
I cannot disclose that.

508
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,792
You cannot disclose it, but it's true?

509
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,794
Then will you disclose it one day?

510
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,340
It would be inappropriate
to reveal it here

511
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,176
before the lawsuit starts.

512
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:08,721
What wrong
did the president-elect do specifically?

513
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,890
Are you going to reveal it strategically?

514
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,808
Who is he having an affair with?

515
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:13,726
What's the proof?

516
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,227
That'll be all for today.

517
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,940
Tell us more.

518
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,025
Is there proof?

519
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,985
Can you reveal who he is
having an affair with?

520
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,904
Will the lawsuit happen soon?

521
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:25,863
The next suit…

522
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,451
Ma'am.

523
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,120
Are you watching the news?

524
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,333
I laid the groundwork for you.

525
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,378
INCOMING CALL
SHIN HAE-RIN

526
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,590
When will you give me
the conclusive information?

527
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,968
You promised.

528
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,845
It has to be

529
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,722
an exclusive tip-off just to me.

530
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,269
What happened? I told you to make sure
she couldn't hire a lawyer.

531
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,562
How does she have a lawyer?

532
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,272
Well…

533
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,190
I apologize.

534
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,693
Find out who he is
and dig up anything you can find

535
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,320
to use against him.

536
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,530
Secretary Shin!

537
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,534
What do you think you're doing?

538
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,995
I told you not to show yourself.

539
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,916
Put your decision to fire me
on hold for now, please.

540
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,253
Until the situation is dealt with,

541
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,671
let me help until then.

542
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,089
My decision is final.

543
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,550
You're no longer my secretary.

544
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,431
Then from now on,

545
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,599
I'll do whatever I want.

546
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,727
What?

547
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:39,854
Secretary Shin?

548
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,899
From this point onward, whatever I do
has nothing to do with you.

549
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,069
I'm just doing it for my own sake.

550
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,196
Secretary Lee will be the witness.

551
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,741
You heard that?

552
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,578
I'm no longer related to this place
or the president-elect.

553
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,873
So you must not follow any of my orders.

554
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,919
Say something, sir.

555
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,338
Say she's wrong, please.

556
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,259
She's right.

557
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,887
She has nothing to do with us now.

558
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,975
Secretary Shin.

559
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,083
PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION TEAM
SHIN HAE-RIN

560
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,095
No, that's not true at all.

561
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,140
It's fake news
that he cheated on his wife.

562
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,391
Spouse at fault? No.

563
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,102
It's not true that
the lawsuit concerns him

564
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,729
as the spouse at fault.

565
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,914
Ms. Cha is waiting.

566
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,585
Thank you.

567
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,694
This way.

568
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,369
VICTIM: CHA SU-YEON
ASSAILANT: YOON KI-JU

569
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,081
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

570
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,843
You dealt with the reporters well,
considering it was your first time.

571
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,970
Not too much, not too little.

572
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,515
Most of all, you looked reliable.

573
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,350
That's most important

574
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,519
in representing me legally from now on.

575
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,937
But do you really

576
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,025
want me to take on your divorce lawsuit?

577
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,235
Didn't you already agree to it?

578
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,739
That you'd take on my divorce suit
if I settled Ki-ju's case.

579
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,410
You took care of

580
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,288
Ji-yu's case as well
by digging into those girls' past.

581
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:47,166
The press conference went well too.
What's the matter?

582
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,127
Well, still…

583
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,672
No matter how I think about it,

584
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,008
divorce case isn't my specialty.

585
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,843
"Seon" in your name Kang Seon-ho.

586
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,345
You said it meant "vicious."

587
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,266
I need a lawyer who will fight viciously.

588
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,060
It's against the President.

589
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,479
And it is me who made him president.

590
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,820
I'll stir up the public opinion first.

591
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,490
That is politicians' weakest spot.

592
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,534
The public opinion
which changes multiple times a day.

593
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,871
Even more so now that he's the President.

594
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:32,044
The target of the reporters

595
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,213
will change from me to him.

596
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,926
They'd feel a bigger sense of achievement
if they attacked

597
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:43,889
the President who was having an affair
than his wife who bugged him for it.

598
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,809
He's the one
who provided the cause for it,

599
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:50,229
so they can say they're serving justice.

600
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,315
They'll attack him as much as they did me,

601
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,442
so they'll think it's fair to do so.

602
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:02,491
The election was only a month ago.
Will the public sway?

603
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:07,496
There's one thing I learned
about the public sentiment.

604
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,665
The public

605
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,834
isn't just a number.

606
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,839
They're live people.

607
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,095
Cha Su-yeon!

608
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,221
-Out!
-Out!

609
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,139
Cha Su-yeon!

610
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,306
-Out!
-Out!

611
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,224
Cha Su-yeon!

612
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,517
-Out!
-Out!

613
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,435
Cha Su-yeon!

614
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,477
-Out!
-Out!

615
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,395
Cha Su-yeon!

616
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,396
-Out!
-Out!

617
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,355
Cha Su-yeon!

618
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,648
-Out!
-Out!

619
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:35,607
Cha Su-yeon!

620
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:36,900
-Out!
-Out!

621
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,738
Look at her, she's so thick-skinned.

622
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,824
She's shameless.

623
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,992
You should be ashamed.

624
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,953
Look at her standing tall
with her head held high.

625
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,121
Exactly.

626
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,539
Unbelievable.

627
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,216
She's coming out.

628
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,010
-Cha Su-yeon!
-Cha Su-yeon!

629
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,429
Who are you to stop us?

630
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,763
You don't understand us.

631
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,600
-What did we do wrong?
-Get out of my way!

632
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,018
Let me go!

633
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,227
Let them go.

634
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,979
It's okay, leave them be.

635
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,147
Let them go.

636
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,191
These people

637
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,319
are my family.

638
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,113
For over a decade, they've supported me

639
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,450
and given me more love
than I ever deserve. They're my family.

640
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,579
As a mom, and as a daughter,

641
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,749
I have something to say to my family.

642
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,418
Please give me some time.

643
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,300
Please set up a tent
to shelter them from the rain.

644
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:44,843
Yes, ma'am.

645
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:53,769
My goodness.

646
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,191
I'm sorry.

647
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,529
I did something terrible.

648
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,866
I disappointed you all.

649
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,055
The public isn't just a number.

650
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,432
They're live people.

651
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,939
I'm not here

652
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,276
as the wife of the president-elect

653
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,988
or the First Lady.

654
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,157
I'm here as a bad mom

655
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,285
and an immature daughter

656
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,663
who broke her family's hearts.

657
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:00,043
The betrayal and anger that you,
my family, must've felt from my actions…

658
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,755
I can't dare to fathom.

659
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,385
But I'll accept whatever punishment I get.

660
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:13,724
Don't worry
about me entering the Blue House

661
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,602
and acting like the First Lady

662
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,187
when I don't deserve it.

663
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:23,984
You can scold me for my faults
as much as you like.

664
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,110
But please.

665
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,281
Although it's spring, it's still chilly.

666
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,868
If you want to scold me,

667
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:37,497
please do so under the tent
where you can avoid the rain.

668
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,007
I'm sorry.

669
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,260
I'm very sorry.

670
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:55,098
It was terrible of me.

671
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,350
I'm sorry.

672
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,336
You're wrong.

673
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:27,798
As you said, we're family.
Families don't do that to each other.

674
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:28,715
She's right.

675
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,676
You're my family,

676
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,261
and so is she.

677
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,764
This student is my family too.

678
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,642
I'm sorry.

679
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,811
I'm so sorry.

680
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,106
Thank you, Bo-ra.

681
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,029
I wanted to return this to you.

682
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,710
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

683
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,129
And thank you.

684
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,589
I'm so sorry.

685
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,509
I'm so sorry.

686
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:13,719
I'm sorry.

687
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,970
I'm so sorry.

688
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,263
And thank you.

689
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:20,183
People are always angry.

690
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,978
They always look for someone
to take it out on.

691
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,356
What will happen

692
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,443
if the angry sentiment is
pointed at the President?

693
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:34,030
When the balloon is
this close to bursting,

694
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:39,411
we just have to prick it gently
with a needle called affair.

695
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,705
Isn't that the same for them, though?

696
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,668
If they make the same move,
people will criticize you badly.

697
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,172
I've been criticized more than enough.

698
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:52,090
But

699
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,801
they won't be able to handle it.

700
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:59,055
Because they've never fought so brutally
against the public.

701
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:03,143
Up until now,
I was the one who dealt with it.

702
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,357
Still, he's your husband.
He's your family.

703
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,817
Yes, he is my family.

704
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,070
A family…

705
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,365
is always a nuisance.

706
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,077
You wouldn't know.

707
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,750
I have one too.

708
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,418
My family.

709
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,341
HASEONG DETENTION CENTER

710
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,984
-You came.
-It must've been hard for you.

711
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,618
What happened?

712
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,663
Let's go. I'll explain on the way.

713
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,941
It breaks and goes bad easily.

714
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,985
Not to mention the stench when it does.

715
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:39,489
Come to think of it, a family
is very much like tofu.

716
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,074
Enough with your nonsense.

717
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,619
You'll take on the divorce lawsuit?
Why?

718
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,664
She got you out of jail,
and she pays me handsomely.

719
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,333
Everyone is watching it.
Why would I say no?

720
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,710
You sound very excited.

721
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,886
See that?

722
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,513
My friends
and even my old girlfriends from college

723
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,974
are texting me now that I'm famous.

724
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,225
She got her nose done.

725
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,143
It looks good.

726
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:11,897
Exactly, why would the other lawyers
have turned down such a good offer?

727
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,064
It's obvious.

728
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,900
What lawyer wouldn't want

729
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,611
to get in Hyun Min-cheol's good books?

730
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,280
And you don't want to?

731
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,701
What if Min-cheol wants you on his side?

732
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,584
Uncle. You must've forgotten,

733
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,294
but I'm a lawyer.

734
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,254
What if he promises you a position

735
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,256
for betraying Cha Su-yeon?

736
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:43,470
I already signed the attorney contract.

737
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,139
I'll lose my lawyer license if I do that.

738
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:48,224
What if in return for losing it,

739
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,852
he'll hand you a better position?

740
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,653
Then why did you do that?

741
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,154
Do what?

742
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:03,490
I heard that after Uncle Tae-hun died,

743
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,283
she visited you several times.

744
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,496
Why did you turn her down
when she asked for your help?

745
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,708
I turned down Cha Su-yeon's offer.

746
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,295
She said if I stopped
making an issue of the late Tae-hun,

747
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,257
she'd do everything for me,
and I rejected her dirty hands.

748
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,761
But you want to be her lawyer.

749
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,013
You'll hold her dirty hands. Am I wrong?

750
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,017
Being her lawyer doesn't mean

751
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:34,020
I'll become one of her people.

752
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,566
After I beat Hyun Min-cheol
in the lawsuit,

753
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,568
who would be next?

754
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,612
My final goal…

755
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,282
is Cha Su-yeon.

756
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,118
Can you even beat Min-cheol?

757
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,369
Can you even win?

758
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,913
Lawyers wouldn't be the only ones.

759
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:55,500
Everyone in their right mind in Korea

760
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,420
would have joined hands with Min-cheol.

761
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,797
Can you really defeat him?

762
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,467
It's Cha Su-yeon
who will go in the ring to fight.

763
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,640
HASEONG MEMORIAL PARK

764
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,891
Why are we here?

765
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:18,523
It's the anniversary
of Uncle Tae-hun's death today.

766
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:21,526
Grandma told me
to bring you straight here.

767
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:25,739
Here.

768
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,047
Who picked this suit?

769
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,798
Why? You don't like it?

770
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,759
I don't like the color.

771
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:50,013
You can't say that. You wear
the factory jacket all year round.

772
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,681
Hey.

773
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,266
I have a lot of clothes.

774
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,643
Fine, fine. I get it, so…

775
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,730
Let's go now.

776
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,024
Fine, let's go.

777
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,818
ROT IN HELL, ARSONIST

778
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,488
LATE DO TAE-HUN

779
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,866
Grandma, what's all this?

780
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,744
Heavens will punish them.

781
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:16,873
I thought they'd stopped,
but they did this again.

782
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:17,999
Give me that. I'll do it.

783
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:21,461
Heavens will punish them.

784
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,339
Was framing an innocent person not enough?

785
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,841
Mom, we'll do it. Get some rest.

786
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,392
My poor Tae-hun.

787
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,646
He's wronged even after his death.

788
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,609
Mom, stop. You'll collapse at this rate.

789
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,319
You damn brat.

790
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:49,280
How could you end up in a detention center
of all places?

791
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,951
Oh, dear.

792
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,246
Oh, dear.

793
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,747
My Tae-hun.

794
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,085
My poor Tae-hun.

795
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,847
Darn it. Let's go.

796
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:23,231
They're so thick-skinned.
They dare come here?

797
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:26,025
-You--
-Calm down. Don't do it.

798
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,944
Let's just go.

799
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,947
They all lost their family
at the same time.

800
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,158
Didn't we lose our family too?

801
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,869
Why must Tae-hun be treated
as an arsonist?

802
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,871
Why must he be treated as a sinner?

803
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:43,084
They need someone to resent for it.

804
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,753
Others might not understand that,
but we should.

805
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,090
For 15 years,

806
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:52,594
they shared the same grief
on the same day.

807
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:55,805
The same goes for him
who lost both his parents overnight.

808
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,608
MURDERER

809
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:11,070
LATE DO TAE-HUN

810
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:15,533
You brat.

811
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,007
Yes.

812
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,094
My dear.

813
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:39,557
It's okay.

814
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,810
He believed without a doubt

815
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,480
that Tae-hun had killed his parents.

816
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:49,400
When he belatedly found out
he was wrong, he was very shocked.

817
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,693
You saw it too.

818
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,582
I'm concerned about him.

819
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,335
He wants to avenge his parents,

820
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:10,964
but he might get hurt
by the lawsuit against Min-cheol.

821
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:15,051
Coming from the one who went wild
trying to avenge Tae-hun's death?

822
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,554
It's not the same.

823
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,391
Seon-ho isn't even 30 yet.

824
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,059
He has a bright future.

825
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,938
That's how furious he must feel.

826
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:30,358
You of all people should understand him.

827
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,695
That's why I'm worried about him.

828
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,196
You must protect him.

829
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,324
So that they can't hurt him.

830
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:44,998
LATE KANG IN-KYU, LATE SONG IN-KYEONG
THEIR ELDEST SON, KANG SEON-HO

831
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,628
CHA SU-YEON

832
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,236
KANG SEON-HO

833
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,581
It's me, Cha Su-yeon.

834
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:28,791
Are the preparations going smoothly?

835
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,002
What we need is evidence.

836
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,546
Proving the defendant's wrong

837
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,507
and providing physical evidence
will be the key.

838
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:38,217
Don't worry.

839
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,969
I'll get the evidence for you.

840
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,847
Can you at least give me

841
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,433
a heads up about the evidence?

842
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,226
You'll find out soon.

843
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:50,313
It's evidence he could never refute.

844
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:54,817
Just think about how to win the case
using that evidence.

845
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,695
Don't worry about it.

846
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,164
Evidence he could never refute…

847
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:13,252
It's going to be mud-slinging anyway,
so fight as dirty as you can.

848
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,840
Whether you win or lose,

849
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,760
you both lose in the end.

850
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,175
I wish to speak to the First Lady.

851
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:04,595
Unbelievable. How dare you show up here?

852
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:09,517
What would happen
if these words got out to the world?

853
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,602
Give Su-yeon a chance.

854
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:15,690
She's the one who'll guarantee our safety,
not the president-elect.

855
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:17,608
What deal did you make with her?

856
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:20,319
Hey, Min-cheol,
did Tae-hun start the fire?

857
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,779
He's not a murderer!

858
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:23,197
What would you do in my shoes?

859
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,324
Who would you choose?

860
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:28,619
