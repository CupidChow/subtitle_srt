1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,917
ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,961
CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

3
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,432
I invited you here today
because there's been a lot of buzz lately.

4
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,230
It's always good to be careful.

5
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,447
Be careful.

6
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,533
It's hot.

7
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:05,583
Shabu-shabu is a combat ration, you know.

8
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:09,546
I wanted to treat you to this good food
so you could keep up

9
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,131
your fighting spirit.

10
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,466
That's why I picked

11
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,009
this dish.

12
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,013
Chairman Yang,

13
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,642
you're so well-versed in food.

14
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,645
Oh, not just food.

15
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,982
As you fill your stomach,
you need a good drink too.

16
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,026
I brought some wine
to enjoy with the meal.

17
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,696
You can have one bottle each.

18
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,040
Here you go.

19
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,378
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,632
You scan it and see.

21
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,175
It's a special vintage wine.

22
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,803
I sure love food and drinks,

23
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,972
but my specialty is money math, you know.

24
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,223
150,000,000 KRW DEPOSITED

25
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,352
Please make good use of it in your work.

26
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,188
Well…

27
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,026
I don't know if I should accept this.

28
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:13,985
Me neither.

29
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,363
It's under

30
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,867
your drivers' names,

31
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,452
so don't worry about security.

32
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,831
I'm terrible with wine.

33
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,251
I'm going to get drunk today.

34
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,756
Come on. You drink to get drunk,

35
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,634
and you fight to win.

36
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:42,347
The special investigation committee
has been formed with our people,

37
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,640
but the problem is

38
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,807
the president-elect.

39
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,267
An illegitimate child?

40
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,811
This is a national disgrace.

41
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,813
It's a blow to our national dignity.

42
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,691
It is deeply humiliating.

43
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,945
He keeps bringing the special act
to the fore,

44
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:01,407
thinking he could just smooth things over,
but we can't just sit back and watch.

45
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,953
You must step up and hold him accountable.

46
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,748
There are discussions going on

47
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,835
within the party and the Assembly.

48
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,547
But

49
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,926
the inauguration is in less than a month.

50
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,346
Finish your glass.
Let me pour you another one.

51
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,893
The inauguration is coming soon?

52
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,064
A president chosen by the people?

53
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,901
We can always elect a new president.

54
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,988
Rules? We can make new ones.

55
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,823
Gosh, you guys!

56
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:47,370
You're not rule-followers! You make rules!

57
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,833
Actually,

58
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,712
we do make laws.

59
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,963
Right.

60
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,173
That's what I'm talking about!

61
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,302
Don't let the rules hold you back.

62
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,096
Just make the new rules
to drag Hyun Min-cheol down.

63
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,180
Then that'll be it.

64
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,398
God damn it.

65
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:21,571
YANG HOON

66
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,174
YANG HOON

67
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,596
I'll do it.

68
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,389
The paternity test.

69
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,477
On one condition, though.

70
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,189
I want you to stop bothering me or U-yeong

71
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,441
regarding the necklace.

72
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,236
I get what you're asking for,

73
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,197
but let me make this clear.

74
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,575
You're the one who stole the necklace

75
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,787
and started this bothersome drama.

76
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,707
I know.

77
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,629
Which is why I don't want it
to be more bothersome.

78
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,091
If the test results prove you right--

79
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,175
Then what?

80
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,804
Are you worried I might ask for more?

81
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,723
What more would you ask for?
It just means it's the truth.

82
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,433
What?

83
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,770
What were you going to ask for?

84
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,563
Money?

85
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,148
Or…

86
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,275
recognizing you

87
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,527
as family?

88
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,321
If I ask you to do that,

89
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,697
will you?

90
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,575
Does my recognition matter?

91
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,160
We're unrelated anyway.

92
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,453
What about with Mr. Hyun?

93
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,707
And Ji-yu?

94
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,422
-You want to be her sister?
-Can't I?

95
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,969
Ji-yu said it was lonely
being an only child

96
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,138
and wanted to have an older sister.

97
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,473
Are you being serious right now?

98
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,229
Was it your plan

99
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,314
all along?

100
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,568
Entering this house,

101
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,736
approaching Ji-yu,

102
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,322
and doing the TV interview?

103
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,615
Everything?

104
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,248
Never mind.

105
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,085
Nothing has been confirmed,
so I won't jump to conclusions.

106
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,635
Sign it.

107
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,102
CONSENT FOR DNA TESTING

108
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:04,734
Hello?

109
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,487
Listen to me carefully.

110
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,363
I know you're with Cha Su-yeon now.

111
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,120
You said you wanted
to catch your mother's killer.

112
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,706
I'll help you with that. In return,

113
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,585
DNA test or whatever,
don't do what Su-yeon wants you to do.

114
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,214
Is that Chairman Yang?

115
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,591
Is he telling you not to do the test?

116
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,009
Why should I listen to you?

117
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,180
Because the murderer who killed your mom

118
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,974
is Cha Su-yeon.

119
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,246
OUR KONGGUKSU IS
FRESHLY HOMEMADE EVERY DAY

120
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,134
We're closed.

121
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,470
The owner went home.

122
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,894
Darn it. Now I lost appetite.

123
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,402
I said we're closed.

124
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,412
What are you doing?

125
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,708
What the hell are you doing?

126
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,255
What?

127
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,590
I have nowhere to go.

128
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,927
You're a nut.

129
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,848
There's no one.

130
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,852
There's no one I can open up to.

131
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,523
There's no one.

132
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,094
Tae-hun was just an excuse.

133
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,849
Just like the election was an excuse.

134
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,812
Just like I divided everything
into what helps or hurts the election,

135
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,608
I divided everything

136
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,905
into what's for Tae-hun and what's not.

137
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,574
The election is over,

138
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,453
and the special act's been passed,

139
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,122
but nothing has changed.

140
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,794
If anything, things have gotten worse.

141
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,799
Even though Sun-jeong is dead now,

142
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:19,804
my wife…

143
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,979
Whatever happens,

144
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,317
I will weigh everything,

145
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,987
whether it's politically favorable or not.

146
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,990
How nasty and low, right?

147
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,288
Just like the people
I've been criticizing.

148
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,416
No, actually,

149
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,003
I'm even nastier than them.

150
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,299
I promised myself over and over again

151
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,762
that I wouldn't be like them.

152
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,148
Still, I lived my life.

153
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,902
No matter how nasty it was,

154
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,031
and no matter how low it got,

155
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,035
I lived my life.

156
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,834
But Sun-jeong…

157
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,005
She was just…

158
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,135
stuck in that photo.

159
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,888
In that photo,

160
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,226
which she wasn't even in…

161
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,690
She was stuck in there.

162
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,485
No.

163
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,989
You're wrong.

164
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,619
She had a daughter.

165
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,538
Sun-jeong had a daughter.

166
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,374
Her daughter was

167
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,211
her life.

168
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,173
Sun-jeong…

169
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,344
lived her life too.

170
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,908
There it is.

171
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,389
HASEONG HIGH SCHOOL

172
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,396
-Are you staying late to study?
-No.

173
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,481
Hey, Ji-yu is here.

174
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,459
ILLEGITIMATE CHILD

175
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,544
IS HE REALLY YOUR DAD?

176
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,712
AFFAIR

177
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,290
What's up?

178
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,751
Did the teacher send you to get me?

179
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:03,796
No.

180
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,635
Then why did you come?

181
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,722
I just wanted to see if you were okay.

182
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,892
I've been saying "the worst"
all the time lately.

183
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,896
I called my mom the worst,

184
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,232
and I called my dad the worst.

185
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,068
But

186
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,654
you know who's really the worst?

187
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,239
The kids?

188
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,824
No.

189
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,283
Then who?

190
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,119
Me.

191
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,748
My mom isn't the one
who got the wrong idea first.

192
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,459
It was me.

193
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,464
The person who might be my dad's daughter…

194
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,720
I thought
she was having an affair with my dad.

195
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,684
My dad denied it,

196
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,979
but I didn't believe him.

197
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,694
Aren't I the worst?

198
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,280
It was just a mistake.

199
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,034
That's what other kids would say too.
That it's just a mistake.

200
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,077
So I deserve a punishment.

201
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,370
Is this your punishment?

202
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,538
Yes.

203
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,876
Just ditching class
and lying down like this.

204
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,379
Doing nothing and zoning out.

205
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,007
The scariest punishment in the world.

206
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,843
Make today the last day you're punished.

207
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,266
Did you know I hated your dad?

208
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:47,566
I felt like it was your dad's fault that
my mom's life was so hectic every day.

209
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,361
I didn't know.

210
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,324
You never told me that.

211
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,578
Even when everyone was attacking me,
like today.

212
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,373
It's ridiculous to hate you
just because I hate your dad.

213
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,334
You're a different person.

214
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,419
But still.

215
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,714
We're both children of our parents,

216
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,716
but we're also just ourselves.

217
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:18,013
So we don't need to carry
our parents' burdens.

218
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,475
It may be your fault to be mistaken,

219
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,187
but other things
like the illegitimate child issue are not.

220
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,825
Then what?

221
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,702
Are you worried I might ask for more?

222
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,190
Recognizing you

223
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,441
as family?

224
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,236
If I ask you to do that,

225
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,654
will you?

226
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,868
You think you can take me down like this?

227
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,164
Nothing can take me down.

228
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,499
Absolutely not.

229
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,262
HASEONG POLICE STATION

230
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,687
Cha Su-yeon speaking.

231
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,482
HASEONG POLICE STATION

232
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,951
CRIME-FREE SOCIETY
WITH HASEONG POLICE STATION

233
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,854
Hey, hurry over.

234
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,564
Come here, you punk.

235
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,815
Who's that?

236
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,901
Wow, she looks so charismatic.

237
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,028
Wow, awesome.

238
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,571
What are you looking at? Move!

239
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,240
Come on, you punks.

240
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,714
I thought everything about the necklace
was explained in the petition.

241
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,967
Today, you're summoned for another case.

242
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,304
You recently junked a car, right?

243
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,348
A car that got into an accident.

244
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,103
But luckily, there were still
investigation records of it.

245
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,822
On March 5,

246
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,365
you caused a car accident.

247
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,867
The skid mark found at that scene

248
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,953
matches the skid mark

249
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,582
found at the hit-and-run scene
by the seashore on February 26.

250
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,342
Not just by the naked eye,

251
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:46,054
but also according to
the National Forensic Service's analysis.

252
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,806
Of course,

253
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,017
there's a video of it too.

254
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,491
February 26, around 5:00 p.m.,

255
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,743
this video was recorded

256
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,412
by the dashcam of a courier vehicle
passing the scene.

257
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,955
The victim was Eom Sun-jeong.

258
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,175
You know I crave alcohol
after I work overtime…

259
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,098
Ms. Cha.

260
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,684
You and Eom Sun-jeong
knew each other, right?

261
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,110
Take care.

262
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,404
Bye!

263
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,244
That's unusual of you to drink.

264
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,121
Are you okay?

265
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:57,167
Don't worry. I felt like drinking.

266
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,420
Put your seatbelt on.

267
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,263
Wait.

268
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,308
No way. I don't want you to catch a cold.

269
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,768
There.

270
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:18,939
There you go.

271
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,441
Ms. Cha.

272
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,030
We thought
it was a simple hit-and-run case,

273
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:31,159
but after watching News Magazine,
we learned that you were related.

274
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,829
Lee Hwa-jin, the girl
involved in the necklace case,

275
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,081
turned out to be Eom Sun-jeong's daughter.

276
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,042
Which helped us confirm
that the car whose license plate

277
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,129
wasn't caught in the dashcam footage

278
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,631
was your car, Ms. Cha.

279
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,050
On February 26,

280
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,635
around 5:00 p.m.,

281
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,555
where were you?

282
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,147
I'll call my lawyer.

283
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,539
What are you doing here?

284
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,125
I'm here because you got in trouble.

285
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,793
What's with the tofu?

286
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,128
So corny.

287
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,130
Just eat it.

288
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,258
You didn't have one
when you were released before, right?

289
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,218
That's why you came here again.

290
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,555
Did you just pull back? I said, eat it.

291
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,142
Fine. I'll eat it.

292
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,776
Is Hwa-jin still in the hospital?

293
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,321
No.

294
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,573
She's occupied with something.

295
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,742
Something? What something?

296
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,162
You're not the only one
who caused trouble.

297
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,539
Hwa-jin got into big trouble. You ask her.

298
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,249
What happened?

299
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,792
I don't know.

300
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,669
I said, you ask her yourself.

301
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,297
Aren't you worried about your only friend?

302
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,508
When she got into big trouble
after being discharged?

303
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,010
Hey!

304
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:17,766
How could I be worrying about her
when my only brother got arrested?

305
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,187
Why are you crying?
You're embarrassing me.

306
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:27,025
You could've ended up
in jail again, you know.

307
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,194
I told you to stay away from trouble!

308
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,529
I told you to stay away from trouble!

309
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,406
Geez, it hurts.

310
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,289
Ew, gross! Get off of me!

311
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,041
I'm sorry, okay?

312
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,503
Don't worry. I'll be better.

313
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,046
Get off of me.

314
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,257
It hurts.

315
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,844
Eat it.

316
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,930
-I ate it.
-Eat the whole thing.

317
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,685
CHA SU-YEON

318
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,645
I'm serious. Eat the whole thing.

319
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,650
HASEONG MEMORIAL PARK

320
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,241
EOM SUN-JEONG

321
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,538
Was it

322
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,291
really Ms. Cha's doing?

323
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,168
The police are investigating her,

324
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,712
so it'll be on the news soon.

325
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,715
So,

326
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,717
don't do the paternity test.

327
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,845
Doing that now will only help Cha Su-yeon.

328
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,431
Why is that helping her?

329
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:44,227
If she's committed a crime,
she'll go to jail, right?

330
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,315
You're so naive, Hwa-jin.

331
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,984
The president

332
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,153
has the right to grant clemency.

333
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,073
Even if she gets arrested
for a hit-and-run accident,

334
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,535
if Hyun Min-cheol wants to,
he can free her.

335
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,995
And Hwa-jin,

336
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,622
you're the only person who can stop that.

337
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,291
How, though?

338
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,210
With your existence,

339
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,298
he wouldn't dare do it,
even if he's president.

340
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,344
He abandoned your mom,
and his wife killed her.

341
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,429
So how would he dare free her?

342
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,805
I don't understand

343
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,516
what you're saying.

344
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,144
You don't need to.

345
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,230
That's just how things work,

346
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,191
and what matters now is that

347
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,818
you have the power
to make things work that way.

348
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:39,032
And how would that benefit you?

349
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,577
Remember last time?

350
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,997
After you said you'd give me money
if I did as you said,

351
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,917
you ordered that man to lock me up.

352
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:52,754
Don't you remember?

353
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,050
Come on.

354
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,719
You can't put it that way.

355
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,264
I didn't lock you up.

356
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,893
I fed you, clothed you,
and put a roof over you.

357
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:08,770
And what?

358
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:10,855
Benefit?

359
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,690
I'm getting nothing out of this.

360
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:17,570
This is all for your mother,
who died unjustly.

361
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,453
Eom Min-jeong.

362
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,294
I'm talking about your mother.

363
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,550
Your mother, who went to jail
after taking the fall for you

364
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,510
and died only a week

365
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,594
after her release.

366
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,099
Mom.

367
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,540
Remember.

368
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,294
You were never here today.

369
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:38,193
Should I reveal why you abandoned
your name as Eom Min-jeong

370
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,653
and lived as Lee Hwa-jin?

371
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,161
What are you talking about?

372
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,454
Damn it!

373
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,088
Stop putting on a show.

374
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,926
Now that all my cards are on the table,

375
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,386
I can't just sit back and watch.

376
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:10,225
I noticed you looked great on camera.

377
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,102
Why don't you go on TV again?

378
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,229
Go on TV

379
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,606
and nail Cha Su-yeon's coffin

380
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,567
with your own hands.

381
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,237
So she rots in jail forever.

382
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,787
LATE EOM SUN-JEONG

383
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,292
Hello. Please sit here.

384
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,008
What happened on the show that day?

385
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,135
The one with Hwa-jin.

386
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,061
Would you like a drink?

387
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,857
When it's so bright out?

388
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,066
Even better.

389
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,944
It's because I'm embarrassed.

390
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,822
What do you mean?

391
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,991
I need a drink.

392
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,411
Excuse me. Can I have a bottle of soju?

393
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,412
Sure.

394
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,373
Drinking in broad daylight. Interesting.

395
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,084
Lawyer Kang asked me

396
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,836
why I became a reporter.

397
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,463
What did you say?

398
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,717
There was definitely a reason,

399
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,427
but I couldn't remember.

400
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,721
Thank you.

401
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,098
Then that happened

402
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,142
on the live show.

403
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,687
Remember my former boss?

404
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,355
The Sewer.

405
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,025
The Sewer?

406
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:47,447
Because all dirty information went to him,

407
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,991
he was called the Sewer. Gu Jeong-u.

408
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,036
Oh, I remember.

409
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,873
It was a perfect nickname for him.

410
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,919
His first scoop was

411
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,130
Cha Su-yeon being an illegitimate child
when she was seven.

412
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,800
Because of that news,

413
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,678
her mother killed herself.

414
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,724
That was the only useful thing

415
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,353
I learned from him.

416
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,566
That reporters can kill.

417
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,745
That was when I realized

418
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,289
why I became a reporter

419
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,750
and why I couldn't answer him.

420
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,339
I'm sorry.

421
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,926
With the president-elect's divorce

422
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,345
and the situations changing so rapidly,

423
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,306
I was too harsh on you.

424
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,518
They say you take after someone you hate.

425
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,145
I've become like the Sewer myself.

426
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,314
The dark and dirty sewer

427
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:07,026
where all dirty stuff flows in and out,

428
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,530
using the ratings as an excuse.

429
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,037
You don't have to apologize.

430
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,873
I'm no different from you.

431
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,545
I guess it's true
that you take after someone you hate.

432
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,090
Because that happened to me too.

433
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,508
Who do you mean?

434
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,551
President-elect?

435
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,763
No. I've become like Ms. Cha.

436
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,145
"I won't become like her."

437
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,357
"I could never do things her way."

438
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,652
I used to think that.

439
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,238
Is that why you quit?

440
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,956
I didn't believe it when I heard the news,
but I get it now.

441
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,624
You really quit.

442
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,543
How are you sure?

443
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,715
You didn't ask what information I dug up.

444
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,177
Not a question on what I found out
about Eom Sun-jeong

445
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:18,347
and how I'm going to report the news
and so on.

446
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,353
I guess we won't see

447
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,647
each other again.

448
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,820
We'll meet again soon enough.

449
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,783
When we do,

450
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,702
pretend you don't know me.

451
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,751
TEAM LEADER CHEON

452
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,131
Just leave me alone.

453
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,383
Cha Su-yeon is at Haseong Police Station.

454
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,053
She's being investigated
for Eom's hit-and-run.

455
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,098
Cha Su-yeon and hit-and-run?

456
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,809
Who tipped it off?

457
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,311
That's not important right now.

458
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,688
I confirmed Cha Su-yeon is
at the police station.

459
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,067
Reporter Kim is on the site,
but that's not enough.

460
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,403
You interviewed Hwa-jin
who brought up the hit-and-run accident.

461
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,990
You should report the case yourself
to make it more interesting.

462
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,295
-I got to go.
-Son Min-ju.

463
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,382
My goodness.

464
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,844
Why suddenly call me by my name
being so friendly?

465
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,095
You heard the call.

466
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,304
Is it because of that?

467
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,181
What on earth is happening?

468
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,183
Can I

469
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,602
ask you a favor?

470
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,898
HASEONG POLICE STATION

471
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,110
Gosh, it's been hours.

472
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,571
Where were you at 5:00 p.m.
on February 26?

473
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,738
Just answer that.

474
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,661
This is so frustrating.

475
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,081
Detective, will you give us
some time alone?

476
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,086
I'll talk it out with my client.

477
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,426
You better.

478
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,406
Your schedule is open
to the public anyway.

479
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,325
If you don't cooperate with the police,

480
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,286
it will put you at a disadvantage.

481
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,330
You're here as a witness now,

482
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,706
but if you keep this up,

483
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,918
you could become the suspect.

484
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,337
Cooperate with the police.

485
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,217
Is the camera

486
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,010
turned off?

487
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,511
What?

488
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,513
Yes.

489
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,391
And we're not being voice recorded?

490
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,979
We're not. Why do you suddenly ask--

491
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,190
You deceived me, who is your client,

492
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,443
and even stole from me.

493
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,949
I will let it go,

494
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,492
but in return,

495
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,580
I need you

496
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,375
to do something for me.

497
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:38,839
WORKING WITH LABORERS
KWON HAK-SEON LAW OFFICE

498
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,883
WHY DO INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS
REPEAT THEMSELVES?

499
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,803
AUTHOR, KWON HAK-SEON

500
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,560
I'm sorry this is all I have to offer
when you came all the way here.

501
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,985
Lawyer Kwon.

502
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,112
Please chair the Committee.

503
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,121
I remember the day we first met.

504
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,832
You were going to sue

505
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,877
Haseong Petrochemical
for worker's compensation.

506
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,008
You said it was a hopeless fight.

507
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,218
That I could never win it.

508
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,346
I also said
it wasn't your battle to fight.

509
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,640
That you may be like brothers,

510
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,893
but it wasn't a battle you could fight
for someone else.

511
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,397
It wasn't for Tae-hun.

512
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,357
It was for me.

513
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,570
Turning a blind eye
and lying that it was his fault

514
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:47,074
and not the company's,
just like my coworkers did.

515
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,494
I couldn't bear to see myself

516
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,040
move on with my life
like nothing happened.

517
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,709
You

518
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,294
haven't changed at all.

519
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,430
This place hasn't changed either.

520
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,018
I wasn't going to come to you,

521
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,521
but you're the only one I can trust.

522
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,816
You'll face strong opposition.

523
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:25,237
I almost lost my lawyer's license
because I blew the whistle on H Group.

524
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,822
If I chair the Special Committee,

525
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,784
people will question its impartiality.

526
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,578
I don't want you to become the judge.

527
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,040
I want you to fight against those

528
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,250
who try to hide the truth.

529
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:39,877
A sword doesn't

530
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,296
discriminate who it hurts.

531
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,180
I went through the special act.

532
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,268
There's a clause on the investigation
of newly identified cases.

533
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:02,149
If any evidence were to emerge
that someone was involved in the fire,

534
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,487
the subjects of the investigation
could be expanded.

535
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,699
And your wife

536
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,535
is no exception.

537
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,203
Do you still

538
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,831
want me to take on the position?

539
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,012
Ms. Cha is being investigated
for the hit-and-run.

540
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,682
I found out
as I was checking for an update

541
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,976
on the hit-and-run investigation
as you ordered.

542
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,228
She's called in as a witness.

543
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,396
Let's go to the station.

544
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,317
Reporters have already flocked over there.

545
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:47,695
So?

546
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,448
Even if you go now,
there's nothing you can do.

547
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,367
Rather, you'll draw more attention
and make it worse.

548
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,161
My wife is at the police station now.

549
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,496
Did you forget
who the victim of the case is?

550
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,039
It's Eom Sun-jeong.

551
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,333
The public opinion is
as bad as it can get,

552
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:05,129
and Ms. Cha is being investigated
for the case that killed Hwa-jin's mom.

553
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,465
Witness or not, it doesn't matter.

554
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,632
The fact is

555
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,759
that I'm her husband.

556
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,844
And

557
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,514
that I can't leave her there alone.

558
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,224
President-elect.

559
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,101
Wait, President-elect.

560
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,270
Cha Su-yeon, the wife of President-elect,

561
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,315
is being investigated for
the Eom Sun-jeong hit-and-run case.

562
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,775
It's only been two days since Lee Hwa-jin,

563
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:30,529
who claims to be President-elect's
illegitimate child, urged the police

564
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,948
to apprehend the hit-and-run offender.

565
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:36,452
A hit-and-run allegation
following an illegitimate child scandal.

566
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,496
People are demanding explanations

567
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,040
for the allegations
surrounding President-elect.

568
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,671
You saw the news?

569
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,967
This is what makes journalism rewarding.

570
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,137
Since your interview aired,

571
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,264
we've been getting tons of tip-offs.

572
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,434
The once-slow investigation
has gained momentum now.

573
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,688
What's more, it's none other than Ms. Cha
in the police station.

574
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,649
So I want to suggest

575
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,818
a follow-up interview with you.

576
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,780
I have nothing left to say.

577
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,575
Come on, I'm sure you have more to say.

578
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,578
The online forum is being bombarded
by curious viewers.

579
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,206
I already said in the interview

580
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:25,251
that I came on the show
to catch the hit-and-run offender.

581
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,503
I don't care as long as
they catch the offender.

582
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:32,383
If Ms. Cha is the culprit,
that's not the end.

583
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,468
It could be the beginning.

584
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,766
The beginning? What do you mean?

585
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,686
President-elect could get involved too.

586
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,773
Do you think he really didn't know
that his wife

587
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,942
killed your mother?

588
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,407
He might've turned a blind eye…

589
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,079
or been her accomplice.

590
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,002
That's impossible.

591
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,046
Ms. Eom passed away
a week before the election.

592
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:15,175
If your existence became known,
it would've been critical for him.

593
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,012
To stop Eom Sun-jeong from talking,

594
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,140
the couple would've done anything.

595
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,518
So if you do another interview,

596
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,895
I'm sure we'll get more tip-offs.

597
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,939
A secret tends to reveal itself

598
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,776
the more you try to hide it.

599
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,960
My gosh.

600
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,629
So there is a secret.

601
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:56,925
How should I present this information
to make it look more enticing?

602
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,097
I checked the investigation records
of Eom Min-jeong.

603
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:05,100
She died from a road accident,
and Hwa-jin was with her.

604
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,853
She pretended to be
the dead daughter on TV?

605
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:11,482
She told a lie
that would be exposed right away.

606
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,444
Keep it, but don't tell Reporter Son.

607
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,614
No, do not tell anyone else that

608
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,449
Hwa-jin is actually Eom Min-jeong.

609
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,326
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

610
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,369
You can go back.

611
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,503
Hello, Chairman.
This is Cheon U-hyeok of MBS.

612
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:38,258
I got some special intel on Lee Hwa-jin,
so I called you.

613
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,887
Gosh, no.
Think of it as my thank-you gift.

614
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,807
You tipped off
Ms. Cha's hit-and-run to me,

615
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,935
and I can't just take it
without paying you back.

616
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,902
CHAIRMAN YANG

617
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,740
Hello, Chairman.

618
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,742
Well…

619
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:07,246
When should I schedule
Lee Hwa-jin's interview?

620
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,582
Well, you should strike
when the iron is hot.

621
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,043
This week works best.

622
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,046
Don't worry.

623
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:21,885
I'll skillfully coax Lee Hwa-jin into
saying things that'll put President-elect

624
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,680
and his wife in a tight spot.

625
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,557
In return,

626
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,726
please sponsor the show
that'll launch soon

627
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,940
and back me all the way, okay?

628
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,402
Did you use the shampoo I gave you?

629
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,403
Yes.

630
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,740
Not again.

631
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,744
We have a separate foot towel.

632
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,287
I washed very thoroughly.

633
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,539
Still, wipe your feet with a foot towel.

634
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,665
Fine.

635
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,506
Stop fooling around.

636
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,257
You still act like a baby.

637
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,717
Because you nag me.

638
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,221
Come here. I'll dry your hair.

639
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:01,068
Using my shampoo makes your hair soft

640
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,779
without using hair conditioner.
It's nice, right?

641
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,447
Yes, it's convenient.

642
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,451
It prevents hair loss too,
so make sure you use this shampoo.

643
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,163
Do you know where the spare is
if it runs out?

644
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,207
You always put it in the cabinet.

645
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,833
You remember.

646
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,085
Of course.

647
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,172
It's done. Turn around.

648
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:29,012
You look so much more handsome
from just drying your hair.

649
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,391
It adds volume to your hair too.

650
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,435
Are you done?

651
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,441
Since I dried your hair,
let's fold the laundry together.

652
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:51,743
The washing machine does the laundry,
but you need to hang the clothes yourself.

653
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,830
Shake them out before you hang them up
so they don't wrinkle.

654
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,957
Like this.

655
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,750
Snap your wrists.

656
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,170
-Like this?
-Not bad.

657
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,047
I know that much.

658
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,716
I'm a laundry expert.

659
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,510
I did all the washing and hanging
when you were busy.

660
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,471
You must continue to do so.

661
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,350
Do the laundry, clean the house,
and wash the dishes.

662
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:20,439
You can call yourself an adult
only when you can do all those yourself.

663
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,566
Do you have more to nag?

664
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,318
I'm feeling a bit sleepy.

665
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,197
The sleeves have become
too short for you already.

666
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,826
You grow so fast, Gang-myeong.

667
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,745
Your school uniforms?

668
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,705
We bought them just recently.

669
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,417
I'm not worried about winter uniforms,

670
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,211
but your summer uniforms
might be too small by then.

671
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,840
Should we have bought one size bigger?

672
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:49,051
I said we should buy
the summer ones later,

673
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,011
but you insisted on buying them together.

674
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,140
I wanted to see you in a summer uniform.

675
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,477
I thought that was the only day
I could see you in it.

676
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,021
Why is that the only day?

677
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,983
Are you going somewhere?

678
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,445
It was my dream.

679
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:10,864
You know,

680
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:14,493
they all wear summer school uniforms
in movies about first love.

681
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,580
You're the perfect first love material.

682
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,583
Are you done nagging? I'm going to bed.

683
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,006
An Gang-myeong.

684
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,602
I'm really going to bed.

685
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,814
Good night, my dear son.

686
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,382
Let's see how much you've grown.

687
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,010
-One span.
-Dad, it's ticklish.

688
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,386
Two spans.

689
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,472
-Stop.
-Three spans.

690
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,432
Four spans?

691
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,435
Five, six spans?

692
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,062
What?

693
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,231
An Gang-myeong, this is cheating.

694
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,525
I told you not to grow so fast.

695
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,902
Didn't I? This is cheating.

696
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,946
-Why are you growing so fast?
-Dad.

697
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,948
-Who said you could?
-Stop. It's ticklish.

698
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,866
-Who said you could?
-It's ticklish.

699
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,035
My goodness.

700
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,038
Don't grow up so fast.

701
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:09,584
Gosh, my dear son.

702
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,593
It's been hours, damn it.

703
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,345
We might really stay up all night.

704
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,681
She's one tenacious woman.

705
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,147
Lawyer Song.

706
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:14,900
What brings you here?

707
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,484
Could I have a word with you?

708
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,445
I have something to discuss.

709
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,824
Get out of the way!

710
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,868
Please, get out of the way.

711
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,119
Please, Lawyer Kang.

712
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:28,872
Please, let me out.

713
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,418
Listen, it was me.

714
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,587
I hit Eom Sun-jeong with a car.

715
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,672
So please let me go.

716
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,299
Ms. Sung.

717
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,927
Ms. Cha repeatedly told me

718
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:45,597
that you'd lie and say you did it
when you found out where she was.

719
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,515
I'm not lying.

720
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,809
How many times must I say this?

721
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,937
It was me who hit her with a car.

722
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,146
I have to go.

723
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:54,856
Ms. Cha shouldn't be

724
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,068
at a horrid place like the police station
for even a minute.

725
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,277
Ms. Sung!

726
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:02,030
Ms. Sung. Ms. Cha told me

727
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:06,284
to make sure
you didn't go to the police station.

728
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,996
How could I not go?

729
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,706
Because of my old self,

730
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,960
Ms. Cha is going through tough times
in the police station.

731
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,753
How could I not go?

732
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:20,674
I'm the one that deserves to be punished.
I'm the sinner.

733
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:22,676
No.

734
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,471
What should I do?

735
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,764
Oh, no.

736
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,891
What do I do?

737
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,852
I need you to do something for me.

738
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,438
When Ms. Sung finds out that I'm here,

739
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,774
she'll definitely want to come over.

740
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:38,984
So,

741
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,403
stop her from coming here.

742
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,247
It was Ms. Sung

743
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,042
who drove that day, right? It wasn't you.

744
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,004
Is that important?

745
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,756
You're a lawyer
who defends even the guilty, no?

746
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:08,096
Is that why you've kept your mouth shut
until now?

747
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,390
To take the rap

748
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,559
for Ms. Sung?

749
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,687
You're a lawyer, not a judge.

750
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,607
So,

751
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:23,236
Ms. Sung is innocent. Do you understand?

752
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,406
Yes, I get what you mean.

753
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,160
But there's a problem.

754
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,662
I am currently your lawyer.

755
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,748
If I'm to defend Ms. Sung,

756
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,418
both you and she need
to sign the Conflict of Interest Waiver.

757
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,502
No.

758
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:40,879
There's no need.

759
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:44,674
Lawyer Kang, I am dismissing you.

760
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,386
From now on,
you're no longer my legal representative.

761
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,848
I don't care what happens to me.
Just focus on Ms. Sung.

762
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,183
Then it's good, right?

763
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:59,022
Ms. Sung.

764
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,901
You said Ms. Cha and I must be like family

765
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:06,071
since we lived together for a long time.

766
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,327
I didn't give birth to her myself,

767
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,289
but she's more precious
than a daughter to me.

768
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:22,879
She's the only person I could rely on
for the past 40 years.

769
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,723
And she is now at the police station.

770
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,726
So let me see her at least.

771
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,686
I just want to see her.

772
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,313
I mean,

773
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,565
if I'm innocent,

774
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:46,486
you can defend me and prove my innocence.

775
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:50,615
Please. Please let me go see her.

776
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:53,576
Please, I beg you.

777
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,013
You promised.

778
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,433
We'll just check how she's doing
and come back.

779
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,435
I said I promised.

780
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:22,480
You can't say you're
the hit-and-run driver like earlier.

781
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,650
You'll get me out anyway.

782
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,363
This isn't the matter of getting you out.

783
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,866
Everyone denies their crimes.

784
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,200
You're the opposite--

785
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,202
How am I not guilty?

786
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:41,749
I made Ms. Cha suffer for half a day
in that horrendous place.

787
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,503
I hope she hasn't caught a cold
in that cold place.

788
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:50,300
If she catches a cold around this time,
she'll take long to recover.

789
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,014
My goodness.

790
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,849
How worn out will she become?

791
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,311
She only managed to recover recently.

792
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:17,494
LIHO EXPRESS

793
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,423
I took care of them as you ordered.

794
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,342
Are you sure it worked this time?

795
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,011
Yes, I'm sure, sir.

796
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,237
I'll do it.

797
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,697
The paternity test.

798
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,534
Ms. Cha is demanding

799
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,578
a paternity test from Lee Hwa-jin.

800
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,832
If Ms. Sung goes to the police station,
Ms. Cha will be released.

801
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,626
She'll do anything for Ms. Cha.

802
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:22,994
100,000,000 KRW DEPOSITED

803
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,712
-He's here!
-He's here!

804
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,258
President-elect,
share your thoughts with us.

805
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,217
To your position.

806
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,469
Get in your position.

807
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,974
-Don't push.
-Wait.

808
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,018
-Say something.
-Move aside.

809
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:50,063
Ms. Cha is being investigated
for Eom's hit-and-run.

810
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,731
How do you feel about it?

811
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,274
She's just a witness.

812
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,402
Were you aware of her involvement
in Eom Sun-jeong's death?

813
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,196
Some suggest it was planned murder

814
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,657
to silence her
about the illegitimate daughter.

815
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,035
I already said
she was brought in as a witness.

816
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:07,038
Some even suggest
that you instigated the murder of Eom.

817
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:10,625
Refrain from groundless assumptions
and reports.

818
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:13,419
"She's just a witness,
it's a groundless assumption."

819
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:17,131
Don't you think you're suggesting
guidelines on the investigation

820
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,425
just by saying that
as the president-elect?

821
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,512
The cops working on the case
could feel pressured

822
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:25,848
just from your presence here,
where Ms. Cha is being investigated.

823
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,934
I'm not trying to pressure them

824
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,062
or suggest guidelines
on the investigation.

825
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:34,565
I just want to stay
as close as possible to my wife.

826
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:38,736
If that in itself is wrong,
it can't be helped.

827
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,946
I will have to

828
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,781
commit the wrong.

829
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,617
Are you saying
you'll blatantly ignore the people?

830
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,329
The people are raising suspicions
and are outraged.

831
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:51,416
The allegations on an illegitimate child
and a hit-and-run.

832
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:53,668
The people are
demanding your resignation.

833
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:58,965
That anger.

834
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,092
That fury.

835
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,220
I'll accept wholly.

836
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,140
But I won't turn away

837
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,143
from my wife out of fear for them.

838
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,227
If

839
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:14,689
she is in any way involved
in the hit-and-run case,

840
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,442
do you intend to step down?

841
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,403
Will you be responsible for your claim

842
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,947
and put your presidency on the line?

843
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:28,786
President-elect has nothing to do
with the hit-and-run.

844
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:37,795
It's currently under investigation.
How can you be sure?

845
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:42,759
Because I am

846
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,052
the culprit.

847
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,727
The person who killed Eom Sun-jeong…

848
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,689
is me.

849
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,370
Su-yeon.

850
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,790
Tell me if you're involved
with Chairman Yang in any way.

851
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,917
This is the last chance.

852
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,585
If you mess around again,

853
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,462
then I'll reveal this.

854
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:05,925
The person standing on the receiving end
of your special act isn't Yang Hoon.

855
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,718
It's Su-yeon.

856
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,846
If the investigation

857
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,515
reveals that I or my wife
were involved in the fire,

858
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:14,225
-Honey!
-I will step down

859
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:16,227
from my president-elect position

860
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,895
immediately.

861
