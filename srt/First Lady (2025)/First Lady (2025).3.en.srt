1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,917
ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,961
CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

3
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,133
-Did you put the seatbelt on?
-Yes.

4
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,948
Mom.

5
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,283
Hold tight.

6
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,086
Mom.

7
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,296
It's okay.

8
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,801
Did you see that? Poor Ji-yu.

9
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,677
What? Was their marriage fake?

10
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,221
Goosebumps. It was all a show?

11
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,015
Nice. They were so full of themselves.
They're done for.

12
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,481
Don't look, Ji-yu. Don't look.

13
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,525
Mom!

14
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,390
Mom.

15
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,479
Mom…

16
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,030
Mom.

17
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,827
Mom…

18
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,088
Ms. Nam, what's your relationship
with Candidate Cha?

19
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,464
Is your daughter his child?

20
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,426
Rumor has it that
she's an illegitimate child. Any comment?

21
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,261
Ms. Nam Gyeong-ae.

22
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,179
-Ms. Nam Gyeong-ae.
-She's inside!

23
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,099
Ms. Nam?

24
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,851
Do you admit to having an affair?

25
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,103
If you don't respond,
this article will just go out.

26
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,772
-Will you agree to a paternity test?
-When did it begin?

27
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,232
-Ms. Nam.
-Mom.

28
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,735
-Ms. Nam, we know you're in there.
-Ms. Nam.

29
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,486
Just a quick comment.

30
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,988
This won't do.

31
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,324
Let's go to the back.

32
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,707
She's there.

33
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,667
Reporter Kim,
get some shots of the kid's face.

34
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,294
When did the affair start?

35
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,962
What are you doing to a child?

36
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,089
Is Candidate Cha your daughter's father?

37
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,591
-It's my personal life!
-Ms. Nam.

38
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,801
It's my personal life!

39
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,387
Will you agree to a paternity test?

40
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,391
When did the affair start?

41
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,644
-Ms. Cha, are you okay?
-Ms. Cha!

42
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,230
There was a car accident here.
Please come quickly!

43
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,232
-Please hurry.
-Ms. Cha, wake up.

44
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,858
Call 911!

45
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,902
-Ms. Cha.
-This is a scoop. Get some shots.

46
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,446
-Get some shots of their faces.
-Ms. Cha.

47
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,202
Call 911.

48
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,537
-Hello, are you okay?
-Ms. Cha, wake up.

49
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,207
Ms. Cha, wake up.

50
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,291
Hey, call 911.

51
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,793
Yes, please come right away.

52
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,503
All right.

53
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,798
-Ms. Cha.
-Ms. Cha, are you okay?

54
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,258
Ms. Cha!

55
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,349
WE PROMISE SINCERITY!

56
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,518
MARCH 8, 2027

57
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,366
THE 23RD PRESIDENTIAL
TRANSITION COMMITTEE

58
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,342
MY DAUGHTER

59
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,722
The approval rating poll results are out.

60
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,684
NEGATIVE: 44.8%, NOT SURE: 4.2%
POSITIVE: 51%

61
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,728
The numbers are not concerning.

62
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,023
So far, the prevailing view is
to wait and see.

63
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,861
The presidential office
has suddenly postponed the meeting.

64
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,865
They attribute it
to North Korea's missile launch,

65
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,077
but I think they want to wait and see
which way public opinion shifts.

66
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,204
After all, they have no reason to rush.

67
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,665
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

68
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,334
Please try again after…

69
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,795
JI-YU.

70
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,800
Why don't you meet Candidate Bae?

71
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,053
Even in the concession speech,

72
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,930
she didn't mention anything
about the special law.

73
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,350
You don't deserve to be here.

74
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,811
You're not my family.

75
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,521
You don't deserve it.

76
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,781
We can still bring her to our side.

77
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,577
I'M SORRY

78
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,248
We have to hurry
before President Yu moves.

79
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:18,836
Let's do that.

80
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,963
Arrange a luncheon sometime this week.

81
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,590
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,342
You may leave now.

83
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,981
JI-YU, ARE YOU OKAY?

84
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,401
CALL
MY DAUGHTER

85
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,999
Did you get back from the academy?

86
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,462
I made some curry.
Heat it up and have it for dinner.

87
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,923
Don't order delivery again.

88
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,258
I'll call you later.

89
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,219
Aren't you going home?

90
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,471
How can I,

91
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,433
when he's been like that
ever since the car accident?

92
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,017
I can't just leave him alone.

93
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:19,105
This is why people call you
a die-hard loyalist.

94
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,566
Not just me. It's both of us.

95
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,694
Come on. I don't want to be part of it.

96
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,990
I'd rather be buried alone if I die.

97
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,284
So I can finally take my sabbatical there.

98
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,495
These days,
I don't feel like living my life anyways.

99
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:40,960
I've been working seven days a week
to make him president, and now…

100
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,880
And now?

101
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,591
-What?
-Nothing.

102
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,134
I'm just saying.

103
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:53,764
Geez, I wish those phones
would just stop ringing already.

104
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,349
Seriously, it's driving me nuts.

105
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,478
I keep hearing the phone ring
in my car and at home.

106
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,231
The staff have been complaining
about it too.

107
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,525
I'm basically everyone's doormat here.

108
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,695
At work, my colleagues harass me and…

109
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,615
And what?

110
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,710
Don't change the subject again,
just say it.

111
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,337
There…

112
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,256
I told you not to change the subject.

113
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,633
No, over there…

114
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,511
Ms. Cha.

115
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,147
Ms. Cha?

116
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,585
Where is he?

117
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,257
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,175
Outsiders are not allowed to enter.

119
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,261
Outsider?

120
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,929
Please follow the procedure.

121
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,685
I thought it was urgent.

122
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,565
Please speak through your legal counsel.

123
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,233
The petition has been filed, so--

124
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,943
This is a crucial time.

125
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,029
The two-month transition period
will shape the next five years.

126
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,240
There's no time to waste.

127
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,826
The procedure is just as crucial as time.

128
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,953
I'll get in touch to schedule a meeting.

129
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,914
I'm glad you're here.

130
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,420
Let's talk inside.

131
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,949
HASEONG EXPRESS
CARGO / TRANSPORT / MOVING SERVICES

132
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,246
I heard about the car accident.

133
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,792
It wasn't an accident.

134
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,920
The car just slipped a bit.

135
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,131
It looks like you're pretty hurt.

136
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,553
Well, I got about seven stitches.

137
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,643
Things must take a turn for the better.

138
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,187
I'll see this as a starting point.

139
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,233
How's Ji-yu?

140
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,277
She's okay.

141
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,198
I heard from the butler
that she's doing okay.

142
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,034
But she won't answer my calls.

143
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,327
She will need

144
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,245
some time.

145
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,958
Good thinking.

146
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,711
Let's not take this to court.

147
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,589
Why don't we just

148
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,424
settle this amicably?

149
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,112
I forgot about it.

150
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,825
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

151
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,576
But then this reminded me

152
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,371
of how we met,

153
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,249
how we ended up here,

154
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,001
and our time spent together.

155
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,883
I give up everything.

156
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,885
Everything that I have

157
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,345
and was going to have.

158
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,014
Whatever they are,

159
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,766
I give them all up.

160
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,103
I don't need anything else.

161
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,108
All I need is you.

162
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,655
We can live separately like this.

163
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,782
And I won't ask anything of you.

164
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,992
All I want is…

165
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,287
for you to drop the divorce suit.

166
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,456
That's all I need.

167
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,332
As long as we're together,

168
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,043
they'll keep making an issue out of you.

169
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,296
No, it won't be an issue.

170
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,756
Because I'm okay.

171
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,730
Just not divorce…

172
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,828
We still have time.

173
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,165
-So…
-What do you want me to do?

174
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,751
What can I do to change your mind?

175
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,795
I'll do anything you say.

176
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,256
So please, let's not divorce.

177
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,511
Think about everything
we've been through together.

178
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,139
Honey.

179
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,893
For once, can we do as I say,
as Ji-yu's mom?

180
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,524
Don't call me that.

181
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,944
You have no right

182
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,988
to say her name.

183
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,728
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

184
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,408
Whose idea was it?

185
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,495
Why were the clothes sent here,
not to his place?

186
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,331
And it had to be
right when the reporters were here.

187
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:38,669
With all these empty boxes,
you even made up fake news.

188
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,380
You really had to put on a show like that.

189
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,715
You're the same.

190
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,345
No matter how difficult it got,

191
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,098
you always faced it down confidently.

192
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,226
I didn't expect you to run away
from the reporters like that.

193
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,658
So it was your idea.

194
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,910
Am I right?

195
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,499
I learned from the best.

196
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,462
Right now,
he should be the one being attacked.

197
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,922
Are you challenging me?

198
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,050
I'm only working for the president-elect.

199
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,718
Just like you did.

200
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,428
I wanted him to win.

201
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,138
Likewise.

202
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,641
But for the president-elect to win,

203
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,268
one of us must lose.

204
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,691
Do you really think you can take me down
with a little media spin?

205
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,321
It'll be boring
if I could take you down just with this.

206
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,370
Don't think this is over.

207
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,068
Let's not take this to court.

208
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,695
Why don't we just

209
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,863
settle this amicably?

210
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,492
It'll be boring
if I could take you down just with this.

211
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,425
Hello?

212
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,219
This is Cha Su-yeon.

213
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,518
Hello, Ms. Cha.

214
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,312
What made you call me?

215
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,440
I'm sorry to bother you this late.

216
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,941
No, it's not late.

217
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,153
No matter how late it is,
you're always welcome to call me.

218
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,616
I have something to suggest.

219
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,414
The president-elect and his wife's divorce
has come as a shock to the nation.

220
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,543
I'm here with Ms. Cha Su-yeon now.

221
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,170
Hello.

222
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,801
Your divorce has been
the talk of the town lately.

223
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,513
But since it's your personal life,
we were cautious about inviting you.

224
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,642
But Ms. Cha wanted to appear in our show,

225
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,771
so we're having her here today
on News Magazine Live.

226
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,356
First, I'd like to ask

227
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,276
how the talk of divorce came up.

228
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,195
Right.

229
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,868
Honestly,

230
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,496
I'm not sure myself.

231
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,878
Just like any other couple,
we had conflicts,

232
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,965
we argued, and we fought.

233
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,635
From trivial matters

234
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,473
like who should take out
the food trash and the recycling,

235
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,477
to bigger matters like
our daughter's extracurricular education.

236
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,690
But

237
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,735
we have always tried to be understanding

238
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,738
and generous

239
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,741
for over 20 years

240
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,494
of marriage.

241
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,168
Then since he won
the presidential election…

242
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,588
Good. Close up.

243
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,467
Cha Su-yeon sure knows the show biz.

244
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,886
She's really boosting the ratings.

245
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:02,558
Camera number three, a little tighter.

246
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,228
Good. Leave it like that.

247
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,521
I'm sorry.

248
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,275
Are you saying

249
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,444
he brought up divorce
after winning the presidential election?

250
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,404
Yes.

251
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,157
And he never mentioned it before?

252
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,742
No.

253
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:25,831
You said you had conflicts
like any other couple.

254
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,916
Though you may not remember,

255
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,128
maybe you made some mistake.

256
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,714
Does anything come to mind?

257
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,798
No.

258
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,469
I'm not the one
trying to break up this family.

259
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,764
That's why I'm here today.

260
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,351
Some say I asked for a divorce,
and I kicked my husband out.

261
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,645
I wanted to correct

262
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,607
that fake news.

263
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:57,988
I'm just an ordinary mother and a wife
who wants to

264
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,532
protect this family.

265
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,786
The wife of the president-elect is

266
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,998
not just an ordinary wife.

267
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:11,168
Suddenly being asked for a divorce

268
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,378
after 20 years of marriage

269
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,380
is not ordinary either.

270
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,592
That's true.

271
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,929
But it is also true that the discord
between the president-elect and you

272
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,931
is being interpreted

273
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,476
not as a private conflict,
but as a political separation.

274
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,519
It's still being investigated,

275
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,648
but there are allegations that

276
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,609
large political funds flowed
from Chairman Yang

277
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,694
to the president-elect through you.

278
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,115
I'll appear exclusively
on News Magazine Live under one condition.

279
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,617
What condition?

280
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,454
Let's not talk about Chairman Yang.

281
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:52,125
I want this interview to be
solely about my stance on the divorce.

282
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,585
I see.

283
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,171
I understand what you mean.

284
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,048
Don't worry, though.

285
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,550
At the end of the day,
what viewers want to know about

286
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,761
is not the investigation,

287
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,137
but the divorce.

288
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:10,394
Some even say that your involvement
in Chairman Yang's illegal succession

289
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,730
is the direct cause
of the marital breakdown.

290
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,156
That is not true.

291
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,868
Sir.

292
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,832
-Can we get the breaking news?
-I'll try.

293
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,250
You're getting it.

294
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,251
Yes, sir.

295
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,212
Skip this. We'll cut live
to the prosecutor's office.

296
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,006
Let's see Cha Su-yeon's reaction.

297
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,340
It's connected.

298
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,842
All right.

299
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,428
Reporter Son. Ready.

300
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,305
Action.

301
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,181
This just in.

302
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,935
We'll talk after that.

303
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,692
The president-elect
has formally filed a criminal suit

304
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,610
against Ms. Cha for violations

305
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,323
of the Information Network Act and
the Communications Secrets Protection Act.

306
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:09,995
The president-elect stated that
he learned only after the election

307
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,332
that Ms. Cha had wiretapped him
for 20 years,

308
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,877
betraying the trust
at the core of their marriage.

309
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,005
The wiretapping devices found
in his pen and tumbler

310
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,425
have been submitted as evidence,
which is adding to the shock.

311
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,723
You've just seen the breaking news.

312
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:34,102
The president-elect has filed a complaint
against Ms. Cha for wiretapping him.

313
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,771
-Really?
-What?

314
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,898
We'll fact-check that first.

315
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,484
Did you really wiretap him?

316
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,778
EXCLUSIVE LIVE INTERVIEW WITH CHA SU-YEON

317
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,613
Push her.

318
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,825
If you've wiretapped your husband
throughout your marriage,

319
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,995
your claim today that
you're just an ordinary wife

320
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,955
can hardly be convincing.

321
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,795
Push harder.

322
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,757
If the president-elect's claim
of wiretapping is true,

323
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,593
doesn't that make you the one
who broke up the marriage?

324
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,761
Ms. Cha.

325
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,181
Have you wiretapped the president-elect?

326
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,976
Push harder.

327
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,521
Why the silence?

328
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,273
If you can't clear the suspicion
that you wiretapped him,

329
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:24,402
everything you said today
will inevitably be seen as false.

330
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,904
Let me ask again.

331
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,948
Have you wiretapped him?

332
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,392
Geez. For 20 years?

333
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,523
She deserves to be sued, then.

334
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,954
It wasn't because I didn't trust him.

335
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,878
It was because I couldn't trust

336
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,880
Hyun Min-cheol as a politician.

337
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,133
I wasn't monitoring my husband.

338
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,595
I was monitoring the politicians

339
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,181
who approached Politician Hyun Min-cheol.

340
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,934
I was protecting him from them.

341
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,563
Do you admit that you wiretapped him?

342
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,566
I was protecting him from being deceived

343
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,110
and hurt by politicians.

344
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,864
Because my husband is a politician,

345
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,992
and I'm his wife, and at the same time,
his political partner.

346
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:59,206
People voted
for the president-elect, not for you.

347
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,333
It is true that you're his wife,

348
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:05,295
but calling yourself his political partner
sounds like a false claim.

349
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,549
It's not a claim.

350
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,219
It's a fact.

351
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:17,140
What are you doing?
Push her with the wiretapping.

352
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,185
Ms. Cha.

353
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,230
Wiretapping is a crime.

354
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,399
I'll willingly pay the price
for breaking the law.

355
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,484
However,

356
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,363
to protect Politician Hyun Min-cheol,

357
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,241
what I did was necessary.

358
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,828
Are you saying what you've done
was illegal, but not wrong?

359
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,248
What you just said,

360
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:45,252
like saying, "I had alcohol,
but I didn't drink and drive,"

361
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,005
could sound contradictory.

362
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,304
I will leave it

363
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,807
up to you to judge.

364
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,726
I believe

365
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,020
you will make a wise judgement

366
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,438
as always.

367
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,666
Well done, Son Min-ju.

368
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,085
"What you've done
was illegal, but not wrong."

369
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,045
"I had alcohol,
but I didn't drink and drive."

370
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,298
Talk about an experienced reporter.

371
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,926
Hey, I'm not a newbie
who needs compliments.

372
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,512
I'm giving you compliments
so you could do better.

373
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,222
I said, stop flattering me.

374
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,391
Fine. I'll stop!

375
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,770
Excuse me.

376
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,316
Wait.

377
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,529
You should return your mic.

378
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,156
Oh, right.

379
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,950
Let me help you.

380
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,119
It's Cha Su-yeon!

381
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,206
Ms. Cha, wait!

382
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,415
Ms. Cha!

383
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,377
-Wait up.
-Ms. Cha!

384
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,337
Wait, Ms. Cha.

385
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,510
-Wiretapping?
-What?

386
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,886
Wiretapping?

387
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,140
-It's Cha Su-yeon.
-It's Cha Su-yeon!

388
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,433
It's Cha Su-yeon!

389
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,061
-It's Cha Su-yeon.
-It's Cha Su-yeon.

390
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,646
On TV, they say, for 20 years…

391
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,648
Here! Look here!

392
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,942
Is that true?

393
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,570
-It is true.
-Ms. Cha!

394
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,613
Ms. Cha!

395
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,448
-Ms. Cha!
-Ms. Cha!

396
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,785
Ms. Cha, look here!

397
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,829
Here! Ms. Cha!

398
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,254
Ms. Cha!

399
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,048
Ms. Cha!

400
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,175
-Wait, Ms. Cha!
-Ms. Cha!

401
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,304
Ms. Cha! Just a word, please!

402
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,556
Ms. Cha!

403
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,534
Thank you.

404
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,537
Don't mention it.

405
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,664
Right, let me introduce myself.

406
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,585
I'm Lawyer Kang Seon-ho.

407
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:19,966
The lawyer of Yoon Ki-ju who is booked
for an assault.

408
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,304
I tried but couldn't reach you.
You ignored my texts too.

409
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,557
So I came to you
when I saw you on the live show.

410
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,517
What do you want?

411
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,810
What don't I want, you mean.

412
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,730
I mean…

413
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,983
"I don't want him punished."
That one sentence is all I need.

414
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,403
They give special pardons
when a president is elected.

415
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,988
Show him some mercy.

416
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:42,989
Pull over.

417
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,285
Or you could do that
in return for me driving you--

418
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,411
Pull over.

419
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,379
You just need to write some words here.

420
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,762
This is all just a formality.

421
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:09,015
It'll become a hassle for everyone
if he's referred to.

422
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:12,602
If you were to testify and so on,
reporters would flock again.

423
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,605
It'll be a bother.
Let's just wrap this up nicely.

424
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,278
We'll meet again soon!

425
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,949
Giving up isn't in my dictionary!

426
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,660
"Seon" in my name doesn't mean "kind!"

427
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,745
It means "vicious."

428
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,000
Here's the prescription and the receipt.

429
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,922
-Thank you.
-Have a nice day.

430
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,475
Ga-eun, slow down.

431
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,435
It's dangerous with cars around.

432
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,603
Okay.

433
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,024
Good job. This way.

434
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,234
Look ahead.

435
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:07,282
Goodness. Look there. It's red light.

436
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,534
-Mom.
-You stop at red light.

437
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:10,785
Mom.

438
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,788
Shall we go back this way?

439
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,418
-Let's go back slowly.
-Okay.

440
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:21,087
Let's go. Slowly, together.

441
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,464
You're doing great.

442
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,466
Good job, Ga-eun.

443
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,112
Goodness, where have you been?

444
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,114
Shall we go?

445
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,961
CHA'S REMARK ON POLITICAL PARTNER
CAUSES A HUGE STIR

446
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,880
DOES SHE ADMIT TO BEING THE MASTERMIND?

447
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,510
Let's go.

448
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,745
It's not a model where you can
wiretap real time using Wi-Fi.

449
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,500
It's an old model which you have
to retrieve to check the recording.

450
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,711
It's the same as the one
in the fountain pen.

451
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,762
Let's start with this.

452
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:56,683
The violation of Network Utilization
and Information Protection Act

453
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:00,019
and Communications Secrets Act.
Charge her with everything we can.

454
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,855
That'll change the flow.

455
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,695
How long have you known?

456
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,240
From the start?

457
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,872
I apologize.

458
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:20,915
What's important--

459
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,667
Don't get it wrong.

460
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,128
I'm divorcing for Su-yeon's sake.

461
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,132
I'm trying to prevent her
from going to jail.

462
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,383
So am I.

463
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,718
Can I

464
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,636
take your word for it?

465
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,980
That's enough.

466
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,733
Stop here.

467
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,861
Don't hurt her anymore.

468
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,566
-Hyun Min-cheol!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

469
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,527
-Hyun Min-cheol!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

470
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,530
-Hyun Min-cheol!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

471
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:38,868
-Hyun Min-cheol!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

472
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:42,538
President Yu started to investigate
Chairman Yang's illegal succession.

473
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,793
He wants to stop the special act.

474
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,921
He can't point his knife at you directly,

475
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:53,049
but if he starts an investigation
targeted at your wife,

476
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,218
many people will side with him.

477
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,473
While she's secured strong supporters,
she's also made many enemies.

478
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,559
What about Candidate Bae's speech?

479
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,811
She hasn't made it yet.

480
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,522
She seems to be weighing
the pros and cons of the act.

481
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:12,276
Since you've asked her to join,
she'd need to address it.

482
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:16,280
Let's see
how the investigation progresses.

483
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:20,993
If Candidate Bae supports the special act,
President Yu won't be able to stop it.

484
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,165
If Candidate Bae sides with President Yu,
we'll be in a bind.

485
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,210
It's a matter of probability
at this point.

486
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,878
I'll convince Candidate Bae.

487
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,381
No, it's a matter of time.

488
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,634
In the end, the target is me.

489
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,302
Not Su-yeon.

490
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,264
I can't put her in front of reporters.

491
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,975
She won't be able to stand it.

492
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,354
Will your wife accept it?

493
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,024
She'll have a hard time doing so.

494
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,861
She only fights
when she's sure she'll win.

495
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,447
If she finds out
I'm starting a fight that I can't lose,

496
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,368
she'll try to stop me, all the more so

497
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,203
if it's about her.

498
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,247
Let's get divorced.

499
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,833
What?

500
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,335
Let's divorce.

501
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,096
Just for five minutes…

502
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,019
No, let's stay like this for one minute.

503
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,058
Look at this.

504
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,021
Madam Cha admitted to bugging.

505
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,196
"It was for protection, not monitoring."

506
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,240
That's typical of her.

507
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,410
But she might face
a lot of backlash for this.

508
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,251
Hello, Reporter Son.
I was about to call you.

509
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,629
Please, I didn't do much.

510
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:40,424
It's all thanks to your heads up
that we got the right timing.

511
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,553
I found a malt whisky bar
that you would like.

512
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,933
Let's meet up with Team Leader Cheon soon.

513
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,151
-It's not true.
-It can't be.

514
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,362
Believe in her. She wouldn't do that.

515
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,863
It's not true, is it?

516
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,824
-Of course not.
-It's not.

517
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,583
-My gosh.
-I think it's Su-yeon.

518
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,502
It's Cha Su-yeon.

519
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,008
How long have you been bugging him?

520
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,845
Do you have anything to say to the claim
that you broke the family apart?

521
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,680
Will you cooperate to the police?

522
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,350
If you don't say anything,
we'll publish the news as is.

523
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,643
Ms. Cha, say something.

524
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,728
-Ms. Cha!
-Ms. Cha!

525
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,021
Just one word, please!

526
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,188
Ms. Cha Su-yeon!

527
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,065
-Ms. Cha!
-Just one word, Ms. Cha!

528
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,525
-Ms. Cha!
-Say something!

529
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,235
-Madam.
-Hang in there.

530
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,529
-Ms. Cha Su-yeon!
-Ms. Cha Su-yeon!

531
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,375
Oh, dear.

532
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,590
-Ms. Cha!
-Just a word, Ms. Cha!

533
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,258
-Ms. Cha!
-Say something!

534
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,551
Ms. Cha Su-yeon!

535
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,637
Ms. Cha…

536
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,600
Darn it. She didn't say a single thing.

537
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,813
She bugged her husband?

538
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,899
There's no way she would do that.

539
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,692
-It's not true, right?
-What?

540
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,235
Someone must've got it wrong.

541
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,446
Didn't you hear what she said on the show?

542
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,866
I'll willingly pay the price
for breaking the law.

543
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,327
She said herself that she bugged him.

544
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,913
No. Something must've gone wrong.

545
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,831
I believe in Madam Cha.

546
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,917
I can't believe it either.

547
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,002
I thought the divorce was a lie, too.

548
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,837
How could this happen?

549
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,924
It's not true, is it?

550
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,468
Is this one of those fake news?

551
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,179
You know, those fake news made using AI.

552
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,223
It is, isn't it?

553
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,309
Why won't you say anything?

554
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,815
I believe in her.

555
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,552
Ms. Cha.

556
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,805
Are you all right?

557
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,195
Ms. Cha, are you unwell?

558
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,573
I'm okay.

559
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,784
Ms. Cha.

560
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,662
I'm fine.

561
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,083
What about Ji-yu?

562
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,711
She got the stitches removed fine.

563
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,047
What did the doctor say?

564
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:13,220
That you need to get your stitches removed
and that you should visit the hospital.

565
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:18,267
He asked me repeatedly,
saying he couldn't reach you.

566
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,228
I understand.

567
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,689
I'll do that.

568
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,513
Ma'am!

569
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,599
PRESIDENT-ELECT SUES CHA SU-YEON

570
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:49,024
Did you see it?
Bugging and suing, what a mess.

571
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,903
My mom deleted the photo
that she took with Cha from her Instagram.

572
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,198
My mom posted she was close with her.
She shut down her account.

573
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,909
What happens to Ji-yu
if Cha Su-yeon is kicked out?

574
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:03,205
Either hit rock bottom with her mom
or stay with her dad, I guess.

575
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,300
Ms. Cha.

576
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,761
Are you awake?

577
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,723
I brought you breakfast.

578
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,940
It's by the door.
Have some as soon as you get up.

579
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:40,344
Why won't you eat?
You'll ruin your health.

580
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,137
Do you not have an appetite?

581
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,840
Ms. Cha.

582
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,302
It's chicken porridge that you like.
Why didn't you have it?

583
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:26,723
Even if you don't have an appetite,
have a mouthful at least.

584
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,063
Mom.

585
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,282
Mom?

586
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,619
What is it?

587
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,622
Are you all right?

588
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,666
I'm fine.

589
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,336
What is it?

590
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,713
Nothing.

591
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,801
Have you eaten?

592
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,722
Yes. I'm going to cram school now.

593
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,310
Okay.

594
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,813
See you later.

595
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,362
Make sure to eat.

596
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,031
I will.

597
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,694
MISSED CALLS
NEW MESSAGES

598
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,605
Ma'am!

599
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,369
Su-yeon.

600
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,748
A woman in her 30s was stabbed to death

601
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:23,085
in a multiplex housing
in Namil-dong, Haseong City.

602
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,462
The deceased is the mistress
of Cha Jin-taek,

603
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:29,299
an Assembly candidate for Haseong
with the illegitimate child controversy…

604
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,697
I…

605
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,075
won't die

606
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,202
like my mom.

607
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,351
VICTORY & GOOD FORTUNE LAW FIRM

608
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:30,110
You must be prepared to let the world
know all about your private life.

609
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,571
Everything about you

610
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:36,074
and your daughter will be exposed.

611
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,207
Am I at a disadvantage?

612
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:48,420
A divorce lawsuit is about
whether you gain what you want.

613
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,797
Tell me what you want.

614
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,174
I'll help you.

615
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,636
What I want

616
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,514
is half of everything he's gained

617
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,641
thanks to me.

618
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:06,188
And half of everything
he'll gain in the future.

619
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,190
If it's about the assets--

620
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,525
I'm not talking about money.

621
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,237
I'm the one who made him president.

622
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,865
So,

623
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:20,035
I should take half of
what the President owns.

624
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,745
Isn't that right?

625
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:28,251
How many do you think
voted for him because of me?

626
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,544
Ten percent?

627
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,921
Twenty percent?

628
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,715
Half at least, don't you think?

629
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,676
You can't get a divorce, then.

630
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,888
If you do, you lose your rights
as the First Lady.

631
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,684
In that case, we must overturn
the plaintiff's argument.

632
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:48,396
We need to prove you aren't in the wrong.

633
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,317
Since you've already admitted
to bugging him, it will be a hard fight.

634
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,194
Are you saying it's a long shot?

635
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,117
I'm saying we have to fight.

636
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,620
Strike back as much as you were hit,

637
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,247
with the interest on top.

638
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:10,627
We'll cling onto the plaintiff's
wrongdoing, whatever it may be.

639
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,589
If it results in mud-slinging,

640
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:18,677
the first to give up loses.

641
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,930
I won't give up first.

642
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,515
Never.

643
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,647
Then we won't lose.

644
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,691
I'll find a way for you.

645
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,319
Excuse me.

646
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,705
Hello?

647
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,333
Okay.

648
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,259
Sorry about that.

649
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,052
It's fine.

650
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,806
All right. Find a way, then.
I'll entrust it to you.

651
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,184
Something urgent came up.

652
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,562
I can't accept this lawsuit.

653
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:16,443
Then another partner in the firm--

654
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:19,112
They're handling
another lawsuit right now,

655
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:20,655
so they can't help.

656
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:26,870
I apologize.

657
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,625
Is it him?

658
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,211
Does he want to hire you?

659
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,844
What, did he get you a decent position

660
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,138
in the Transition Committee?

661
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,665
HASEONG LEGAL TOWN

662
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,210
I apologize.

663
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,045
We can't accept the case.

664
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,631
We can't accept
a politically sensitive case.

665
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,008
Civil suits related to public officials

666
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,302
are too risky,
starting with media exposure.

667
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,596
We don't specialize in family law.

668
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:30,600
PRESIDENT-ELECT PRESS CONFERENCE
HASEONG FAMILY COURT

669
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,436
My fellow citizens,
I apologize for causing you worries.

670
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,524
In this crucial period
when the government must look after you,

671
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:41,820
I'm causing you worries
regarding my marriage.

672
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,782
I'm aware of the love

673
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,327
and support you've given
to my wife and me for a long time.

674
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,997
And I know it must be making you

675
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,374
more disappointed and devastated.

676
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,961
But all I can do now is
to ask you to let us handle it.

677
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,587
I sincerely apologize.

678
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,882
But I promise

679
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:07,095
that my family issues will not interfere
with national affairs.

680
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,852
Now, we'll accept some questions.

681
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,478
I'm Reporter Park of MBS.

682
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,064
Is the bugging
the main cause of the divorce?

683
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,026
Did you start living apart
when your stuff was delivered?

684
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,610
Is it to bury the illegal--

685
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:34,622
Ms. Cha.

686
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,294
There's nowhere to go.

687
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,965
There's nowhere else to go.

688
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:48,136
No lawyer,

689
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,099
and no place to go.

690
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,852
Shall I escort you home?

691
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,586
HOMEROOM TEACHER

692
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,341
Yes, teacher. Hello.

693
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:29,844
What?

694
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,180
My Ji-yu did that?

695
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,495
Stop, stop it!

696
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,164
Stop!

697
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,084
Let me go.

698
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,004
Let me go!

699
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,967
What are you guys doing?

700
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,091
I want her to be expelled.

701
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:54,179
As the chair of the foundation,
I should sort this out.

702
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:58,975
They claim that someone hacked
into the cloud and spread the video.

703
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:01,519
Did he want my signature
on the divorce paper

704
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,898
so badly that he pushed
his own daughter over the edge?

705
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,399
I'll make the final decision.

706
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,777
You can't decide and act on your own
like you have been anymore. Got it?

707
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:10,945
I'll do it.

708
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,407
I'll divorce you.

709
