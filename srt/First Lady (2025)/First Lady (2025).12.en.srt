1
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,959
ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,003
CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

3
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,682
You're with Hwa-jin, right?

4
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,309
Bring her over right now.

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,268
I'll take her

6
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,104
to President-elect
and have it out with him.

7
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,608
But Lee Hwa-jin is
with President-elect's daughter now.

8
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,650
What?

9
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,110
Are you sure?

10
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,820
Yes, I'm sure.

11
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,917
Let me

12
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,753
meet that person.

13
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,296
Who?

14
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,423
Lee Hwa-jin.

15
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,606
I read it because you asked me to.

16
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,566
But why?

17
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,028
I thought you might be curious
about why my mom did that.

18
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,242
I would've been curious
if I were in your shoes.

19
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:01,204
Basically, she had a reason
she couldn't turn herself in.

20
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,290
It was all for Mr. Hyun.

21
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,251
Mr. Hyun?

22
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,044
I mean Dad.

23
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,048
I called her dad "Mr. Hyun."

24
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,301
But I don't know.

25
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,554
That was really just an accident?

26
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:18,888
It was a coincidence?

27
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,184
And you want me
to believe that?

28
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,478
What do you mean?

29
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,482
Are you suspecting
that she caused the accident

30
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:30,900
on purpose?

31
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:32,986
Why not?

32
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,948
Can't I have suspicions?
When you suspect others as you like?

33
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,741
What?

34
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,828
You suspected that
Mr. Hyun and I were having an affair.

35
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,332
Wasn't that why Ms. Cha suspected me too?

36
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,211
I'm leaving.

37
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,797
Weren't you the one who asked to meet me?

38
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,342
You still act like a princess.

39
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,222
You said to me last time

40
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,600
that you wanted to live an ordinary life.

41
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,313
That you wanted to live
with ordinary parents.

42
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,773
You wanted to quit
being the presidential candidate's

43
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,483
and president's daughter whatnot.

44
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,319
When you said that,

45
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,155
do you know what went through my mind?

46
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,952
"She's so ungrateful."

47
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,165
Whenever you blabbered about how tough

48
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,125
things were, do you know what I thought?

49
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,045
"She's so spoiled and immature."

50
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,963
Some people

51
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,926
don't even get to have someone
who can spoil them.

52
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,096
Even now,

53
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,433
my mom is dead,

54
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,062
and you're here acting like a baby.

55
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,945
Ji-yu.

56
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,888
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,850
I wanted to apologize to you
in person in my mom's stead.

58
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,523
I don't know if an apology will cut it.

59
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,027
I don't deserve to receive an apology.

60
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,362
That's not it.

61
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,406
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

62
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,200
The same goes for that.

63
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,787
It's not up to me to forgive.

64
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,217
Hyun Ji-yu.

65
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,470
It's nice to see you here.

66
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,558
Where are you going? You're leaving?

67
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,310
Aren't you glad to see us again?

68
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,937
She's the president's daughter.

69
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,398
I can't believe we met here.

70
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,025
I still owe you something.

71
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,570
Shall we shoot the sequel?

72
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,738
We definitely should.

73
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,823
Let's stream it live.

74
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,743
We'll make use
of the celebrity to get high views.

75
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,952
Don't.

76
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,538
Don't do what?

77
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,622
Don't do what?

78
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,082
You're so shameless.

79
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,083
Hey.

80
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,503
I'm suspended from school because you.
This is the least you can do.

81
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,921
Don't you agree?

82
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,799
Of course.
You should pay for what you did.

83
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,890
Gang-myeong. An Gang-myeong!

84
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,479
What're you doing? Get her!

85
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,030
Hurry up!

86
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,445
HYUN JI-YU

87
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,225
Sit here.

88
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,936
No, it's okay.

89
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,523
Seeing you stand
makes me feel uncomfortable.

90
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,443
Okay, then.

91
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,327
Hold on to me.

92
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,917
Are you okay?

93
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:40,960
Yes.

94
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,504
Thank you.

95
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,217
You're very adept at it,
like a professional caregiver.

96
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,472
My husband had

97
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,308
a long rehabilitation period.

98
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,523
When I first met you,
I thought you were very much like him.

99
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,485
Now that you're in this state,

100
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,694
you look even more like him.

101
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,157
Do I?

102
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,784
I don't see the resemblance.

103
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:19,081
He was angry too, just like you.

104
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,168
He wanted to take revenge
on the company for Tae-hun,

105
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,295
who was denied worker's compensation.

106
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,216
Just like how you wanted
to take revenge on me.

107
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,557
Don't look at me like that.
It was the same for me.

108
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,894
I also wanted to take revenge

109
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,562
on my father.

110
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,526
I wanted to take revenge on Father,
who drove Mom to an early grave

111
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,237
to become an assemblyman.

112
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,658
It's always anger that drives people.

113
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,701
I realized that too young.

114
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,121
So I was going to use your anger

115
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,292
and your desire for revenge.

116
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,211
But

117
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,756
there's something I didn't know.

118
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,470
Anger

119
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,138
blinds you.

120
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,892
And the first thing

121
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,229
the blinded anger goes after

122
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,524
is none other than myself.
I realized that too late.

123
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,325
Losing someone precious to you.

124
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,786
I guess I was too young to know

125
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,372
what it felt like

126
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,666
when my mom had died.

127
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,792
But

128
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,298
now that I could lose Ms. Sung,

129
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,218
I can finally understand.

130
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,138
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,978
I knew from the start
that you lost your parents

132
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,147
to the fire.

133
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,357
I knew you were the family of the victims,

134
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,318
but I tried to use you.

135
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,819
You're sorry?

136
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,617
Do you remember Song In-gyeong?

137
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,663
You wouldn't.

138
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,457
What about Kang In-gyu?

139
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,461
Are they your late parents?

140
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,965
You must've met them.

141
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,552
Fifteen years ago,
when there was the fire,

142
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,680
you were there too.

143
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:45,394
Did you see why and how
my parents had died that day?

144
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,604
Do you remember?

145
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,611
At first, I doubted and hated Do Tae-hun.

146
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,782
I believed what the media said

147
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,451
and thought he'd killed my parents.

148
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,828
But

149
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,164
Uncle Ki-ju told me.

150
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,126
It was someone else

151
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,711
who killed my parents.

152
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,595
Who

153
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,098
is that?

154
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,392
Who

155
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,228
killed my parents?

156
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,653
Was it you, Ms. Cha?

157
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,447
Was it

158
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,199
really you?

159
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,455
The person standing on the receiving end
isn't Yang Hoon.

160
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,249
It's Su-yeon.

161
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,754
I just want to know the last moments
of my parents.

162
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,263
Honey.

163
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,480
I'm sorry,

164
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,983
but I need to talk to my wife.

165
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,736
I met the first lady.

166
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,200
She said you were behind the fire.

167
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,704
That you staged it with Yang Hoon

168
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,957
so I could win the election.

169
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,626
Is it true?

170
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,339
Did you really do it?

171
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,844
I did it.

172
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,472
I killed them.

173
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,558
You…

174
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,145
It's true.

175
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,856
Honey!

176
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,823
Is that true?

177
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,117
Was it really your doing?

178
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,377
To win the election?

179
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,428
It was all planned?

180
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,075
I could become an assemblyman…

181
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,246
and the president…

182
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,834
because they lost their lives.

183
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,461
Tae-hun.

184
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,630
In-gyu.

185
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,675
And In-gyeong. Their lost lives.

186
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,886
When the doctor said

187
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,807
you wouldn't be able to stand
and walk again,

188
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,185
do you know what went through my mind?

189
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,398
I thought about how strong a weapon

190
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,776
it would be for your political career.

191
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,740
Don't make that face.

192
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,954
Had you become
permanently wheelchair-bound,

193
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,376
you would've become the president

194
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,379
five years ago, not now.

195
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,135
I didn't love you.

196
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,183
I just needed someone
to become the president.

197
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,186
To drag down Cha Jeong-yeon

198
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,772
and take revenge on my father.

199
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,317
I used you.

200
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,769
I'm sorry.

201
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,982
I need some time to think.

202
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,320
But the security rule says…

203
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,738
Please.

204
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,577
This will be my last request.

205
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,501
Then we'll wait here.

206
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,745
Will you be okay on your own?

207
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,582
You kept making a fuss
saying you were okay,

208
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,792
so I left.

209
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,379
But leaving a patient to himself
makes me feel uneasy.

210
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,299
Grandma, I'm not a patient.

211
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,927
I'll be discharged in two days,
so just focus on your work.

212
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,474
Don't leave your regular customers
to starve.

213
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,143
Fine, then. Take good care of yourself.

214
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,604
Make sure you eat the beef bone soup.

215
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,230
I'm making more, so eat up.

216
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,983
Beef bone soup is best to heal your bones.

217
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,026
I'll visit tomorrow.

218
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,611
Oh, Grandma.

219
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,655
Do you have something to say?

220
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,457
It's nothing.

221
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,251
I wanted to say something,

222
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,338
but I forgot.

223
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,132
You silly.

224
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,134
I'm hanging up.

225
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,677
Take good care of yourself.

226
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,739
That's rare

227
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,867
for a car to drive all the way there.

228
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,911
Ms. Sung.

229
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,874
What should I do now?

230
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,089
Why won't you say anything?

231
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,345
You said you'd believe me,

232
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,516
no matter what I did.

233
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,437
You said you'd be on my side.

234
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,193
Why won't you say anything?

235
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,219
Ms. Sung.

236
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,646
Ms. Sung.

237
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,871
Hello, Ji-yu.

238
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,956
Ms. Cha Su-yeon, listen carefully.

239
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,669
Who is this?

240
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,254
Why are you on Ji-yu's…

241
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,840
Ji-yu is with me.

242
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,051
Who are you?

243
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,262
If you want to meet Ji-yu,
come over with the voice recorder.

244
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,932
Yang Hoon?

245
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,475
Is it Yang Hoon?

246
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,643
Driver Kim is there, right?

247
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,940
Hand your phone over to him
and follow him with the recorder.

248
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,110
Driver Kim.

249
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,823
This isn't what I think it is, right?

250
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,791
Let me speak with Ji-yu.

251
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,335
I need to make sure Ji-yu is safe first.

252
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,712
Put Ji-yu on the phone now!

253
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,714
Mom!

254
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,384
Ji-yu, are you okay?

255
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,303
Yes, I'm okay.

256
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,100
I'll be there soon.

257
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,894
I'll be there soon, so hang in there.

258
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:11,937
Okay?

259
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,943
Do as I say, and you can meet Ji-yu.

260
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,780
I'll do as you say.

261
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,616
So don't lay a finger on Ji-yu.

262
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,078
If something happens to her,

263
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,916
I'll kill you.

264
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,131
Stay still.

265
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,808
Why turn it off--

266
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,727
You have the recorder, don't you?

267
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,563
This way.

268
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,466
My gosh!

269
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,145
Wait for a while.

270
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,533
I'll go to the Special Committee
and reveal the truth.

271
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,120
The earlier, the better.

272
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,125
See you at the Committee meeting
three days later.

273
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,261
Thank you.

274
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,140
Why are you here alone?

275
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,934
Your bodyguards?

276
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,062
What about them?
They always accompanied you.

277
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,065
They need a break too.

278
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,193
But what do you mean that you'll go

279
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,570
to the Special Committee yourself?

280
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,118
I'm sorry.

281
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,203
Please wait for a few days.

282
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,042
What I said

283
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,753
at the charnel house last time.

284
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,755
Forget that.

285
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,513
Sun-jeong suddenly passed away,

286
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,808
and I found out she had a daughter.

287
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,520
Too many things happened at once,

288
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,856
so I couldn't

289
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,900
be considerate of your feelings.

290
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,862
I'm sure you were upset too.

291
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,536
I was grateful.

292
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,246
What?

293
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,665
You scolded me

294
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,835
like I was still your son.

295
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,753
I was…

296
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,132
grateful and glad for it.

297
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,218
You feel glad for anything and everything.

298
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,806
Scold me as much as you like.

299
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,642
Reprimand me as much as you like.

300
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,896
I've more things left for you to scold.

301
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,150
You should scold me

302
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,695
so that making Tae-hun die…

303
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,824
Because of me, Tae-hun…

304
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,911
The noodles will get soggy. Eat up.

305
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,581
I won't disturb you. Start eating.

306
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,842
What's happening?

307
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,136
The neighborhood thugs
or shady-looking kids

308
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,971
would come occasionally,

309
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,058
but cars are driving in
one after another today.

310
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,941
WIFE

311
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,070
The person you called is unavailable.

312
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:49,923
Ji-yu!

313
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,425
Ji-yu!

314
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,971
Are you okay?

315
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,349
Are you hurt anywhere?

316
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,976
Mom, I'm sorry.

317
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,937
Why would you be sorry? I'm sorry.

318
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,188
Are you hurt anywhere?

319
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,231
No.

320
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,280
Goodness.

321
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,407
This is my favorite scene.

322
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,661
I almost missed it.

323
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,831
What do you want?

324
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,014
Goal.

325
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,726
Let Ji-yu go.

326
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,477
Then I'll keep

327
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,563
my mouth shut forever as you wish.

328
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,274
You're the evidence.

329
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,735
I should get rid of it.

330
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,654
I can't live worrying about it forever.

331
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,450
The historic moment from 15 years ago

332
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,244
that dominated the news

333
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,788
will hit the headlines again.

334
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,666
I'll do whatever you say.

335
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,418
Just spare Ji-yu.

336
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,128
Let, let Ji-yu go.

337
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,129
Mom!

338
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,006
This has nothing to do with her!

339
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,343
It had nothing to do with the old woman

340
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,635
who got in the accident.

341
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,017
Please, I beg you.

342
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,603
Yang Hoon, please just spare Ji-yu.

343
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,104
Let her go!

344
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,857
Darn it.

345
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,194
Are you serious?

346
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,573
I respected you so much,
and you're begging me

347
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,284
just to spare your kid?

348
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,038
Just spare Ji-yu, Yang Hoon.

349
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,582
I beg you. Spare her, Yang Hoon!

350
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,211
Are you going to burn the place down?

351
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,962
Do you think you can get away with this?

352
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,839
Fire?

353
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,174
That won't work.

354
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,468
Firefighters arrive very quickly nowadays.

355
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,891
Everyone thinks fire itself kills people,

356
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,976
but the one that's really dangerous

357
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,436
is toxic gas.

358
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,440
I'm the CEO

359
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,275
of a chemical plant, you see.

360
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,071
This is

361
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,365
phosgene.

362
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,326
And it's very dangerous.

363
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,120
No.

364
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,789
Mr. Jung, finish this.

365
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,166
-Yes, sir.
-Yang Hoon!

366
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,334
Yang Hoon!

367
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:51,438
They say fire is the best sight to watch.

368
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,190
It's nothing much.

369
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,776
Yang Hoon.

370
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,945
Gosh, you startled me.

371
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,864
I'm sorry.

372
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,575
Repent all you want in there.

373
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,744
Have fun with your daughter.

374
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,373
At least the mom and the daughter
will be together until the end.

375
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,834
That makes me feel relieved.

376
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,711
Just let Ji-yu go.

377
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,131
Please let her go!

378
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,048
Yang Hoon!

379
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,967
Yang Hoon, open the door!

380
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,302
Open the door!

381
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,637
Let Ji-yu go!

382
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,265
Yang Hoon, let Ji-yu go!

383
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,247
Mom, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

384
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,375
Shush, don't say anything.
You can't breathe in the gas.

385
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,964
There's someone here!

386
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,217
Save me.

387
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,971
Mom.

388
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,056
-Did you hear that too?
-Yes.

389
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,724
There's someone here.

390
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,145
Save me.

391
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:14,747
Honey!

392
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,048
Ji-yu.

393
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,175
Ji-yu!

394
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,013
Ji-yu.

395
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,319
Ji-yu.

396
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,821
Ji-yu. Hyun Ji-yu.

397
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,373
Ji-yu.

398
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,043
Ji-yu.

399
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:01,711
Ji-yu. Hyun Ji-yu.

400
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,089
Dad.

401
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,717
Dad is here.

402
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,093
I'm here, so don't worry.

403
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,095
You'll be fine soon.

404
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,388
Where's Mom?

405
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,894
Mom…

406
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,103
Can you go alone?

407
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,563
No, don't go.

408
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,440
I'll take her and get out soon.

409
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,567
It's dangerous here. Wait outside.

410
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,071
You'll go back in there
when you don't even know who she is?

411
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,906
You can't.

412
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,952
What would Dad have done?

413
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,247
If Dad were here,

414
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,249
he'd never give up on saving someone.

415
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,669
Mom.

416
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,174
I'll be back soon.

417
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:50,927
Mom.

418
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,305
She was with me until just now.

419
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,060
She went back in to save someone.

420
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,731
I'll go get her. Wait here.

421
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,145
Lee Hwa-jin?

422
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,771
What should I do?

423
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,066
If there's a victim,
there should be a perpetrator.

424
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,570
She killed Cha Su-yeon and her daughter
to avenge her mom

425
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,113
and died herself too.

426
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,364
It's neat.

427
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,365
Yes, sir.

428
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,742
Text a will

429
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,369
to her friend
and get rid of them all here.

430
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,582
Lee Hwa-jin!

431
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,505
Ms. Cha.

432
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,323
Don't worry.

433
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,574
We can go out.

434
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,718
Lee Hwa-jin.

435
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,178
Hwa-jin!

436
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,229
I'll do it.

437
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,313
Honey.

438
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,315
Stand back. I'll open it quickly.

439
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,803
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

440
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:39,887
I'm fine.

441
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,639
What about Ji-yu?

442
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,849
Ji-yu is fine too.

443
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,267
Let's go.

444
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,685
Wait.

445
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,186
Hwa-jin.

446
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,437
Hwa-jin?

447
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,357
She passed out.

448
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,401
Here.

449
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,570
-Hwa-jin.
-Hwa-jin.

450
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,029
-Lee Hwa-jin.
-Lee Hwa-jin.

451
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,365
Hwa-jin.

452
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,253
Watch out!

453
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,092
Lee Hwa-jin.

454
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:01,886
Hwa-jin.

455
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,679
Hwa-jin.

456
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,727
Can you hear me?

457
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,041
Honey.

458
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,631
Honey.

459
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,633
Give me a second.

460
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,218
I'll get you out soon.

461
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,575
Honey.

462
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,248
I'm sorry. Because of me, Yang Hoon…

463
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,794
Don't be sorry.

464
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,631
I should've known

465
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,093
why you did that.

466
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,470
I should've known.

467
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,764
I'm sorry.

468
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,392
No.

469
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,062
You did nothing wrong. Don't say that.

470
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,897
Do you still not get it?

471
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,318
My biggest fault

472
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,695
is that I didn't know.

473
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,782
I of all people should've known

474
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,786
what you did and why you did it.

475
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,915
What my loved one did and why.

476
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,752
I should've known.

477
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:03,716
Honey.

478
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,690
Honey.

479
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,487
The building is cracking.

480
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,573
It could collapse at any time. So…

481
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,828
take Hwa-jin and leave.

482
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,380
No.

483
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,423
I won't.

484
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,428
Take the girl and leave.

485
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,471
I don't want to.

486
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,306
Now. There's no time.

487
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,557
No!

488
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,393
No!

489
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:56,852
No!

490
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,605
-I won't!
-There's no time. Go now!

491
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,440
No, I won't!

492
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,318
Just wait. I can do this!

493
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:06,946
-Honey.
-No.

494
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,115
Think about Ji-yu.

495
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,033
No, honey. Don't do this.

496
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,410
No.

497
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,828
Don't do this.

498
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,496
Go out with her. Don't give up.

499
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,039
I can't leave without you.

500
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,167
No, don't do this.
Please don't do this to me.

501
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,086
-No.
-I'll leave it to you.

502
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,672
-No.
-Go now!

503
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,476
Ji-yu is waiting. Get out now.

504
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,454
Honey, hang in there. I'll be back soon.

505
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,497
Just hang in there for a bit.

506
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,458
Okay? I'll be back soon.

507
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,628
Get up. Let's go.

508
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,213
Stand up.

509
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,215
-Dad.
-Stand up now.

510
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,766
Dad.

511
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,479
Dad.

512
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,121
You have a photo, right?

513
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,017
Goodness.

514
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:04,230
Your daughter looks just like your wife.

515
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,401
Don't be too disappointed, though.

516
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,279
Now that I take a closer look,
she has your eyes.

517
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,343
You worked hard.

518
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,695
Do you know how rough it was?

519
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,159
I really had a hard time.

520
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,415
I know.

521
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,667
I really--

522
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,960
You did…

523
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,006
a great job.

524
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,988
I'm sorry.

525
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:33,939
You're awake.

526
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,025
Why're you sleeping like this?

527
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,320
I came home late.

528
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,449
I was going to rest for five minutes.

529
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:47,077
But I was too tired and fell asleep.

530
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,912
You must be very tired.

531
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,956
Sleep comfortably on the bed.

532
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,251
Just five minutes.

533
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,545
Let's stay like this for five.

534
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,631
You have an appointment at dawn.

535
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:00,674
Get up now.

536
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:01,925
Then one minute.

537
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,253
What is it?

538
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,050
Why look at me that way?

539
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,844
Is something on my face?

540
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,723
Honey.

541
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,234
Are you really here?

542
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,491
It's the shortest minute in the world.

543
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,600
Ms. Cha?

544
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,651
Where's my husband?

545
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:04,107
Yang was arrested warrantless
for setting the old factory on fire.

546
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,318
I don't know anything. It wasn't me!

547
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,944
Yang denied his charge,

548
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:11,657
but Jung and Kim who were arrested
for setting the fire

549
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,826
as per Yang's orders admitted their crime.

550
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:18,372
They kidnapped President-elect's daughter,

551
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,332
lured Ms. Cha to the factory,

552
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,834
and tried to kill them
by starting the fire.

553
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,545
The police secured

554
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,924
evidence that Yang was involved in
the car accident a few days ago

555
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,467
and are interrogating him.

556
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,142
Ms. Cha and her daughter
were rescued safely,

557
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:42,062
but President-elect,
who saved his family from the fire,

558
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,730
went missing.

559
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:47,526
The search authorities are
continuing the search for two days,

560
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,696
but some are expressing their concerns

561
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,656
that the golden hour has already passed.

562
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,951
-Dad.
-Stand up now.

563
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,703
Dad.

564
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,053
Ms. Sung

565
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,433
wanted to talk to you about your mom.

566
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,021
About my mom?

567
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:28,984
I'm sorry.

568
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:30,736
What?

569
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,947
Why're you suddenly apologizing?

570
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,409
On the day of the accident,

571
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:38,702
I chased

572
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,621
after your mom.

573
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,084
You chased after my mom?

574
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,920
To see her daughter…

575
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,842
To see her daughter even from a distance,

576
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:59,181
she came by for the whole week,
and I spotted her.

577
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,350
But

578
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,104
she ran away when I recognized her.

579
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,585
Mom came

580
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,420
to see me?

581
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,257
I'm sure of it.

582
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,218
This old woman here

583
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,054
got too scared.

584
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,725
I ended up running away.

585
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:27,978
I'm sorry.

586
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,064
I'm sorry.

587
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,277
I'm sorry.

588
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:49,791
TESTIMONY BY SHIN HAE-RIN

589
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,023
What about President-elect?

590
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,486
He's still missing?

591
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:29,956
The unprecedented situation
of President-elect being missing

592
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,667
made the politicians dumbfounded.

593
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,754
Both the Participation People's party

594
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:38,798
and Party for Peace and Freedom
are wishing for his safe return.

595
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:42,510
The Presidential Transition Committee
hasn't announced their stance,

596
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,639
except that they're sticking to
their transitioning duties.

597
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,234
Hello?

598
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,235
How's the Committee?

599
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:01,363
Secretary Shin.

600
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,115
I heard Ms. Cha was attending it.

601
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,450
Yes.

602
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,036
She'll attend on the day

603
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,329
Mr. Hyun was supposed to.

604
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,290
She has something to say about the fire.

605
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,961
Minister nominations?

606
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,342
The inauguration is around the corner.

607
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,302
President-elect has high standards.

608
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,679
You must check thoroughly.

609
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,348
Don't worry.

610
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,477
I'm handling all the tasks
you used to work on.

611
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,649
President-elect
doesn't accept sloppy work.

612
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,609
I'm working like there's no weekends.

613
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,529
I'm losing so much weight.

614
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,994
I thought you could wear one of these
to go to the Committee.

615
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:53,206
Since the occasion is such…

616
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,045
He…

617
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,132
is alive.

618
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:05,844
I apologize.

619
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,436
Ms. Cha attended
the Special Committee meeting

620
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,147
this afternoon in President-elect's stead.

621
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,649
Ms. Cha was accused of being involved

622
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,402
with Chairman Yang Hoon of H Chemical.

623
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:25,071
People are wondering
if she'll reveal the truth.

624
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,656
The contract workers

625
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,326
and the police who forced their way

626
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,620
into the factory to drag out

627
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,958
the sit-in protesters
caused the fire 15 years ago.

628
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:41,880
Do Tae-hun and other union members
were innocent victims.

629
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,548
So are the six people

630
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:47,010
who were at the scene of the fire,
including Song In-gyeong

631
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,511
and Kang In-gyu.

632
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,222
They died wrongful deaths.

633
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:56,478
And they're innocent.

634
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,609
If what you're saying is true,

635
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,027
you yourself

636
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,821
won't be free from the responsibility.

637
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,577
I already made the same statement
to the police.

638
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,497
I won't hide

639
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,998
or run anymore.

640
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,126
I'll take responsibility.

641
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,420
I'll accept the punishment too.

642
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,838
But

643
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,966
Yang Hoon and the contractors
aren't the only criminals.

644
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,385
Late Cha Jin-taek
of Party for Peace and Freedom

645
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,347
framed innocent Do Tae-hun
to be the perpetrator.

646
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,600
So did President Yu Jin-myeong.

647
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:40,855
The person who leaked the fabricated
investigation result to the media and

648
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,316
is present here
as the special committee member.

649
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,610
Noh Cheol-jae, the prosecutor back then.

650
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,364
Witness!

651
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:50,907
Do you have proof?

652
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,784
Remember the oath you took!

653
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:56,287
You'll be punished for perjury
if you give a false statement.

654
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,289
I have the transaction history between

655
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,543
him and Yang Hoon,
plus the recordings of our phone calls.

656
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:05,088
If it's evidence you want,
I can give it to you right now.

657
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:09,634
Mr. Noh.

658
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,845
Take your seat.

659
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,097
This time is for the witness.

660
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,981
Lastly, the media
that influenced the public

661
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,775
by reporting
the fabricated investigation result

662
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,736
as if it's true
without checking the facts.

663
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,701
All of them

664
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,870
must be responsible.

665
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,624
I understand.

666
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:46,463
The Special Committee
will investigate that too.

667
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:50,842
Thank you for testifying for a long time.

668
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,761
Is there anything else you want to say?

669
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,096
I'll give you time.

670
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,274
My husband said

671
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,528
to change the world,
he himself should change first.

672
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,573
To change the world,

673
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,867
you must change yourself first.

674
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:19,537
By changing one person like that,

675
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,955
you change the world.

676
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,042
By saving one person like that,

677
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,668
you save the world.

678
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,462
Because

679
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,422
each and every person

680
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,967
is the world.

681
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:37,222
Changing and saving the world.

682
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:42,060
He didn't do politics
with such grandiose hope.

683
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,188
My husband did politics

684
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,151
because he was afraid that the world

685
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,070
would change him.

686
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,783
He was afraid he'd turn a blind eye
to the injured,

687
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,746
that he'd turn his back on the coworker
who's fighting alone,

688
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,291
and that he'd use his family and daughter

689
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:08,086
as excuses to sacrifice someone

690
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:10,296
and become happy on his own.

691
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,694
I knew from the beginning

692
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,446
that he didn't give up on anyone,
not a single person.

693
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,032
That's why

694
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:40,952
I loved him.

695
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,747
My father

696
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,750
sacrificed my mom
to become an assemblyman.

697
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,462
My husband wouldn't let
anyone sacrifice themselves,

698
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:55,091
even if that meant
he'd become the president.

699
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,553
That's why

700
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,763
I married him.

701
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:14,360
I don't know
if my husband saved the world.

702
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,447
But he did save

703
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,783
a person's life.

704
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,953
He saved me.

705
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,832
I don't know if my husband

706
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,627
changed the world.

707
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,381
But he changed me.

708
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,385
It's my turn now.

709
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,722
It's my turn to save him.

710
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,642
To me, he is…

711
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:52,982
My whole world.

712
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:57,779
He will

713
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,447
definitely

714
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,949
come back.

715
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,820
Ms. Sung made this for you.

716
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,156
She's a patient herself.

717
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,449
She shouldn't have.

718
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,875
Is he the baby's dad?

719
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:01,509
I really can't get used to it.

720
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,553
That he's the baby's dad

721
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:05,680
and I am

722
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,849
a mom.

723
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:16,983
When Ji-yu was young,

724
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:20,153
she loved a tricycle.

725
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:24,282
She'd always say that we three as a family

726
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,826
were like a tricycle.

727
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:35,168
You, him, and the baby
are now a tricycle too.

728
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,628
Get used to it soon.

729
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,631
Are we?

730
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,262
It's cold and windy. You should go back.

731
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:47,889
Then

732
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,017
wear this at least.

733
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,280
It looks good on you.

734
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,588
Here! He's here!

735
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,256
Over here!

736
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,182
Secure airway, check for injuries!

737
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:32,767
Check for breathing!
