1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,917
ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,961
CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

3
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,131
What do you want?

4
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,635
To go back…

5
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,473
to the time
before you came up with the special act.

6
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,932
You'll stop me until the end?

7
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,601
You did the best you could.

8
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,977
So,

9
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,313
stop here.

10
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,564
Is that what you want?

11
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:09,569
You even dug up your painful memories
that have tormented you

12
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,157
and got a fake illegitimate child,
because you want me to stop?

13
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,830
Answer me.

14
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,582
Yes.

15
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,169
I want us to go back,
like nothing has happened.

16
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,963
Because nothing

17
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,965
has happened.

18
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,426
Even if I give up on the special act,

19
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,847
we can't go back.

20
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,100
"As if nothing happened"?

21
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,520
"Nothing has happened"?

22
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,441
What you said here today
will come back to haunt you.

23
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,692
I don't care.

24
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,988
As long as I can stop the special act.

25
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,160
What on earth are you hiding?

26
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,999
What is it that scares you
even more than an illegitimate child?

27
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,629
LEE HWA-JIN

28
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,318
Why did you have to go that far?

29
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,906
I know you made Park Seo-a
spread the video

30
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,659
Ko A-ram backed up to the cloud.

31
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,746
I've been thinking about it,

32
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,125
and it's just too much.

33
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,215
So you weren't just handling
the divorce case.

34
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,512
I wondered how the victims' statements
and the lawsuit

35
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,890
were moving so unusually fast.

36
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,057
It was you.

37
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,810
You won't be able
to escape punishment either,

38
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,438
for instigating those kids.

39
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,692
I don't intend to.

40
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,446
I did something wrong,

41
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,281
so I deserve to be punished.

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,583
I don't understand why you're doing this.

43
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,379
Didn't you join Hyun's campaign
because your husband was unfairly blamed

44
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,173
and denied worker's compensation?

45
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,093
Didn't you enter politics
to make things right?

46
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,054
I don't understand how someone like that

47
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,890
could commit a crime
using the president-elect as an excuse.

48
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,188
You know more about me than I thought.

49
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,191
Most lawyers get others
to do the background checks,

50
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,901
but I do it myself.

51
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,445
Just like I did
with Ko A-ram and Park Seo-a.

52
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,949
It wasn't for the president-elect.

53
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,326
It it were,

54
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:07,747
I wouldn't have pushed
his only daughter that far.

55
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,708
Then who was it for? What was it for?

56
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,628
"Punishment is not what we want."

57
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,296
"We want our family back."

58
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,259
"Revenge is not what I want."

59
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,887
"I want my mom and dad to come back home."

60
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,850
This was your eulogy for your parents
after losing them

61
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,019
to the H Chemical fire in 2012.

62
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,654
You did your research.

63
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,616
Why did you take the divorce case?

64
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,536
Why did you decide
to be on Ms. Cha's side?

65
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,373
What do you want?

66
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,962
I'm not obligated to answer that.

67
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,547
I want the truth.

68
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,634
And I want the truth
to punish those who did wrong.

69
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,761
So the victims
don't turn into perpetrators

70
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:10,351
Just like the man who got framed
for arson after an unjust death,

71
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,811
Do Tae-hun.

72
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,694
If you're on Ms. Cha's side for revenge,

73
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,322
remember this.

74
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,158
Ms. Cha must already know that.

75
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,453
She gave you the case

76
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,414
to use your resentment
towards the president-elect.

77
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,623
I don't care.

78
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,211
Because after getting revenge on him,

79
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,588
your next target is

80
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,089
Ms. Cha?

81
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,594
Or are you planning to come between them

82
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,096
so the divorce suit ruins them both?

83
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,688
Ms. Cha uses people.

84
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,648
She doesn't get used.

85
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,068
Let me ask you again.

86
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,070
What do you want?

87
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,539
It's been about ten minutes.
My client's waiting.

88
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,042
We might want the same thing.

89
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,378
If you really want revenge…

90
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,758
If you really want a just punishment,

91
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,218
the answer is

92
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,179
the special act, not the divorce suit.

93
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,515
-Once the special act is passed--
-Hey, look.

94
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,727
You don't know how awful hope is, do you?

95
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,355
I've tried literally everything
for the past 15 years.

96
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,358
I've protested, collected signatures
on the streets,

97
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,985
everything I could
to get the special act passed.

98
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,987
I was so desperate…

99
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,370
that I even became a lawyer.

100
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,378
There's this thing Ms. Cha has.

101
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,506
We can get the special act passed

102
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,424
if you help me get it.

103
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,009
A thing?

104
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,427
Something that keeps

105
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,763
the Party for Peace and Freedom
under control.

106
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:15,101
Something like an audio tape
or an accounting ledger.

107
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,811
-If you just--
-Steal it?

108
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,898
You said you tried everything.

109
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,403
So why not try

110
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,698
one more thing?

111
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,625
Are you defying me?

112
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,545
Release U-yeong first.

113
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:43,963
After that.

114
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,049
So you don't trust me.

115
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,684
I've never had a dad.

116
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,607
So I want to make sure
our child has a dad.

117
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,442
"Our child"?

118
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,069
You told me not to make it anxious.

119
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,990
It was thanks to you.

120
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,242
If I hadn't met you,

121
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,620
my life would've been so boring.

122
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,842
The guy who got arrested

123
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,927
is the father?

124
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,012
Release U-yeong first.

125
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,306
Then I'll do whatever you say.

126
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,016
What if I release him

127
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,894
and you still don't do as I say?

128
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,775
I haven't thought about it.

129
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,322
So you don't trust me either.

130
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,631
LAWYER KANG SEON-HO

131
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,844
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

132
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,846
Please leave a message after the tone.

133
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,557
Additional charges may apply.

134
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,976
It's me, Cha Su-yeon.

135
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,938
You must be being questioned right now.
Come to my place as soon as you hear this.

136
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,900
I need to have her sign a paper
agreeing to do as I say

137
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,278
in exchange
for releasing the child's father.

138
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:35,533
A legally binding document drafted
in the presence of a lawyer.

139
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,749
Once I sign the paper,

140
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,501
will you release U-yeong?

141
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,420
If we can't trust each other,

142
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,214
we have to rely on the law.

143
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,924
We're good now?

144
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,104
The Special Act for
the Investigation of the H Chemical Fire

145
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,315
and the Establishment of a Safer Society,

146
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:11,193
also known as the Do Tae-hun Special Act,
the vote on it is just a day away.

147
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,071
The Party for Peace and Freedom
has officially opposed the bill,

148
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,949
breaking from
former Assemblywoman Bae's earlier pledge.

149
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,536
Let's hear from Noh Cheol-jae,
the floor leader of the party.

150
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,788
We've never changed our party's stance.

151
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,419
We just corrected the improper deal
former Assemblywoman Bae made

152
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,504
in return for the prime minister position.

153
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,424
It hasn't been long
since the election ended.

154
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:37,261
What we need to do now is
unite the divided people,

155
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:41,515
not divide the nation
by bringing up the special act

156
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,267
and playing the blame game.

157
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,853
Tell me, how does that serve
our national interest?

158
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,315
Will your party officially
oppose the special act?

159
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,734
Well…

160
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,280
We've got to do what we've got to do.

161
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,407
Although,

162
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,952
there will be another meeting
before tomorrow's vote.

163
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,245
That's it for today.

164
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,206
-Sir.
-A quick word, please.

165
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,333
There is growing attention on whether

166
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,628
the president-elect's
first campaign pledge will fall through.

167
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,675
You did the best you could.

168
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,094
So,

169
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,679
stop here.

170
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,893
Ms. Cha left.

171
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,019
But…

172
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,857
He's stuck in there for hours.

173
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,031
Secretary Shin.

174
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,123
You can't just barge in here.

175
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,542
Don't tell him about our call.

176
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,211
Once he finds out, I'll be fired.

177
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,342
This is Shin Hae-rin.

178
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,886
I have something urgent to tell you.

179
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,310
I'm coming in.

180
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,915
I heard that Chief Secretary Lim
proposed passing the special act.

181
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,461
You're not supposed to know that.

182
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,546
I heard it from Chief Secretary Lim.

183
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,006
What else did he say?

184
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,508
That you didn't accept the offer.

185
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,719
Was that the urgent thing
you wanted to talk about?

186
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,013
You wanted to ask me
why I didn't accept it?

187
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,097
No.

188
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,766
I will get the special act passed.

189
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,480
I'm not asking for help.

190
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,231
I'm asking you to stay out of it.

191
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,149
Secretary Shin.

192
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,860
Please don't forget
why you started the divorce suit.

193
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,196
It was for the special act.

194
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,530
Not for Ms. Cha.

195
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,034
I thought it was President Yu
who was trying to stop it.

196
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,162
So I was trying to protect her from him.

197
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,663
Now you know.

198
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,417
Now you know that Ms. Cha is the one
who has been stopping it!

199
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,463
I need to check something first.

200
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,506
After that--

201
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,008
The one trying to stop the investigation
must be behind the incident.

202
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,052
Secretary Shin.

203
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,596
If Ms. Cha, who was trying to stop
the special act, is the culprit,

204
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,597
she must pay for it.

205
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,934
Only then can we prove
Do Tae-hun's innocence.

206
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,562
You know

207
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,274
politics isn't that simple.

208
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,359
I know.

209
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,780
I also know you've never turned away
from a problem with such an excuse.

210
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,158
Are you saying I have changed?

211
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,664
Maybe you have changed.

212
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,918
Please don't stop the special act
just to protect Ms. Cha.

213
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,712
And please don't stop me.

214
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,975
I can bear everything else.

215
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,271
But the 20 years that I have lived for you

216
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,065
going to waste…

217
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,609
I can't bear that.

218
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,538
My wife wants me
to give up on the special act.

219
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,125
She said if I keep pushing it,

220
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,752
she'd expose who I had an affair with.

221
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,297
Lee Hwa-jin?

222
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,176
Did you know?

223
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,638
I did get a feeling
that she was getting the wrong idea.

224
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,849
But it's not true.

225
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,059
She says it doesn't matter if it's true

226
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,021
because Lee Hwa-jin will speak
to the press herself.

227
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,817
She's going that far?

228
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,532
You're right.

229
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,202
I've never avoided anything
because politics is complicated.

230
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,247
But the problem I'm facing now
is extra complicated.

231
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,207
So give me some time.

232
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,920
Time to solve this problem.

233
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,590
We don't have time.

234
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,216
We do, until the inauguration.

235
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,259
No.

236
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,512
I'm not talking about your time.

237
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,391
I'm talking about the time I have left.

238
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,022
I made myself clear.

239
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,816
Don't stop the special act.

240
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,590
SPECIAL ACT

241
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:16,976
Secretary Shin!

242
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,645
You think I'd just walk away quietly?

243
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:23,816
One word from me,
and you're done for, Hyun Min-cheol!

244
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,403
Just imagine how many secrets
I know about you from the past 20 years.

245
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,280
And imagine what will happen
once I disclose them.

246
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,865
You have no idea!

247
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,867
Have you lost your mind?

248
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,328
You think you can just throw me out
and get away with it?

249
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,913
Calm down. Let's talk outside.

250
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,165
-Let go!
-Let's talk outside.

251
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,085
-Let go.
-Come on. Talk with me.

252
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,108
Breaking news. Civil war has broken out.

253
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,110
Secretary Shin attacked
the president-elect.

254
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,863
She was cussing and yelling.
It was no joke.

255
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,657
She was the top contributor.
I'm not surprised.

256
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,410
PARTICIPATION NATIONAL PARTY

257
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,497
The alliance of parties other than
the Party for Peace and Freedom

258
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,874
is already falling apart.

259
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,422
No wonder. The divorce and the affair
ruined the president-elect's credibility.

260
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,885
Some are already calling for
the president-elect to leave the party.

261
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,721
If we push the special act too hard
and it fails,

262
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,347
we'll take the blow too--

263
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,475
Mr. Kwon, let's take a short recess.

264
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,228
What is this?

265
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:49,485
Sir, what are they saying? Secretary Shin
lashed out at the president-elect?

266
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,861
The vote is tomorrow!

267
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:54,782
We're at war now. We can't afford
a civil war on top of that.

268
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,825
Goodness!

269
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,204
She's been the president-elect's
closest aide for the past 20 years.

270
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,415
She deserves to be honored
for her contribution, not fired.

271
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,709
This isn't just about the president-elect!

272
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,213
She's seen and heard everything
within our party about the election!

273
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,423
What if she points the gun at us?

274
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,844
Let's hear what she wants.

275
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,014
We have to ease her anger somehow.

276
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,685
Geez, what on earth…

277
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,114
Hello? Assemblyman Choi?

278
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,367
Hello, Secretary Shin. It's me.

279
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,910
So…

280
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,287
I heard something upsetting happened.

281
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,790
Upsetting?

282
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,334
It's not a personal matter like that.

283
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:52,047
The party won't crumble just because
a low-ranking member like me leaves.

284
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,967
But if the special act gets thrown out,

285
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,178
our party's identity could be at stake.

286
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,557
I just raised my voice a bit,
trying to be forthright with him.

287
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,185
I know. I know how loyal you are.

288
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,355
I understand. I do.

289
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,690
Speaking of which,

290
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:13,944
it seems like the Party for Peace
and Freedom will turn in favor of the act.

291
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:18,866
As long as we keep our stance,
we'll easily get it passed.

292
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,204
You must really like jjamppong.

293
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,165
You never go to barbecue restaurants.

294
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,003
I thought you knew that
I stopped going since the fire incident.

295
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,754
Right.

296
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,381
Sorry.

297
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,383
I forgot. Goodness.

298
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,218
Jjamppong is my comfort food.

299
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,388
I don't need to worry
about who grills the meat.

300
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,391
You do that every once in a while.

301
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,977
What about the source

302
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,063
Cha Su-yeon promised to give us?

303
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,481
No news.

304
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,402
But no news is good news, you know.

305
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,406
To catch a big fish like this,

306
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,034
I need to be patient and wait.

307
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,243
That's true.

308
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:05,996
Right.

309
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,207
You heard
about the new program launch, right?

310
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,336
Looks like they're pushing it
as the main show.

311
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,879
I saw the budget and…

312
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,797
Man, it was a lot.

313
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,427
Speaking of which…

314
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,268
What? Just say it.

315
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,148
You're on the shortlist for the host.

316
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,403
Well, of course,

317
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,240
there are candidates from outside,
and even other networks,

318
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,950
so it'll be tough competition.

319
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,204
But I'm betting on you.

320
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,416
But don't go alone, okay?

321
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,210
We've been working as a team.

322
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,587
Better the devil you know.

323
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,838
Why?

324
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,967
Is being the team leader
for News Magazine not enough?

325
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,093
Come on.

326
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,012
News Magazine is not my program.
It's yours.

327
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,598
And no one can replace you.

328
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,766
So if you're going,

329
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:09,977
take me with you.

330
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,939
Why me, though?

331
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:19,319
With your people skills, convincing people
from outside or other networks

332
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,113
would be a piece of cake.

333
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,616
I'm a loyal person.

334
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,119
What is this really about?

335
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,956
We hit a homer
with Cha's wiretapping story.

336
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,001
Let's go for a back-to-back homer
with the president-elect's affair.

337
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,544
Then the game's over.

338
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,755
Whoever's in the shortlist,
they won't be able to beat you.

339
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,051
Counting the chickens before they hatch,

340
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,095
I'm already getting full.

341
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,888
Oh, come on.

342
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,432
That's not what it is.

343
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:52,227
The universe is sending
good energy your way.

344
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,314
You know how intuitive I am.

345
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,238
Oh, boy.

346
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,908
Look who's calling.
Secretary Shin with no connections.

347
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,785
SHIN HAE-RIN

348
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:10,912
Sure.

349
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,206
Hello?

350
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,542
I was going to call you.

351
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,836
I heard you quit.

352
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,254
What happened?

353
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:25,469
Right, that wasn't so nice of me then.
I didn't answer your calls.

354
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,640
You know presidential candidates
declare their assets.

355
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,809
Who doesn't know that?

356
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,188
What? Will you report him
for breaking the election law?

357
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,983
And if declared jewelry gets stolen,

358
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,485
it's a criminal case, right?

359
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,611
Yes, it is.

360
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:46,490
A simple theft. Nothing more than
a single line in the news. Why do you ask?

361
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,786
What if it's undeclared jewelry
that gets stolen?

362
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,831
That can be a little bigger case.

363
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,377
What if the undeclared jewelry
gets stolen,

364
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,340
and you collude with the thief
to blackmail the president-elect?

365
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,217
Wow.

366
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,096
Just hearing that excites me.

367
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,264
Are you sure, though?

368
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,184
Look into Seon U-yeong
arrested at Haseong Police Station.

369
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,812
Haseong Police Station. Seon U-yeong.

370
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,398
Are you sure about this?
I need to know for sure before I dive in.

371
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,901
Kang Seon-ho is Seon U-yeong's lawyer.

372
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,402
Cha Su-yeon's divorce lawyer?

373
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,991
Does this mean
Cha has Seon U-yeong's back?

374
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,618
No.

375
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,248
She's using Seon U-yeong to join forces
with Lee Hwa-jin, her stylist.

376
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,375
Her and Seon U-yeong are close.

377
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,087
All right. Let me process this.

378
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,630
That's all I can give you.

379
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,556
Cheon is right
about the universe sending energy.

380
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,683
This is my ticket to the new program.

381
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,226
MBS REPORTER KIM YUN-JI

382
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,563
Hi, Min-ju.

383
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,399
See if there's a Seon U-yeong arrested
at Haseong Station.

384
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,652
And write down everything that you hear.
I'll be right there.

385
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,611
Hey!

386
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,784
To MBS, please.

387
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,547
That kind of paper has no legal power.

388
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,383
If you get Seon U-yeong released,

389
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,180
Lee Hwa-jin does anything you say?
What is this, a gift voucher?

390
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,348
Just make it believable to her.

391
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,766
That's what matters.

392
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,644
I'll keep the promise anyway.

393
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,067
Are you telling me to trick Lee Hwa-jin?

394
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,069
It may look like tricking her,

395
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,697
but the results will be the same.

396
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:54,701
Seon U-yeong will be released,
and the divorce case will be dropped.

397
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:02,000
A petition is enough
to release Seon U-yeong.

398
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,295
You didn't really

399
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,048
listen to what I said.

400
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,344
Stopping the divorce suit is the priority.

401
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,096
Petition or whatever comes next.

402
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,432
The detention period will expire soon.

403
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,017
Before the arrest warrant--

404
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,770
Whether he's arrested or ends up in jail,

405
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,521
I don't care.

406
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,816
Mr. Kang.

407
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,361
Don't forget who you're working for.

408
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,323
Until the divorce case is dropped,

409
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,992
there will be no petition or release.

410
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,204
Did the president-elect say
he'd withdraw the divorce suit?

411
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,747
It's a matter of time.

412
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,999
Just make sure

413
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,502
that she can rest assured.

414
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,382
Yes, ma'am.

415
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,468
I'll get going now.

416
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,392
By the way, I didn't get to eat today.

417
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,396
Before I go, can I have ramyeon
down in the kitchen?

418
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,024
Ramyeon won't do.

419
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,027
I'll have my butler prepare a meal.

420
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:14,948
Hello?

421
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,575
Could you prepare a meal for Lawyer Kang?

422
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,704
And more tea for me.

423
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,789
I want to get more rest.

424
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,041
Thanks.

425
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,878
Anything more you want to say?

426
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,213
No.

427
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,091
I'll go downstairs, then.

428
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,390
Let me know if you want more.

429
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,476
Actually,

430
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,937
I was just about to ask
for one more bowl of rice.

431
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,982
My gosh, you must've been famished.

432
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,193
That's three bowls of rice.

433
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,821
Well, I had a lot of things

434
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,449
to deal with today.

435
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,253
Do you not

436
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,506
have a family?

437
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:59,010
You're always here, you never go home.

438
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,638
I've been doing this since I was 16.

439
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,349
I never had time to make a family.

440
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,479
But then,

441
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,858
you've been with Ms. Cha for a long time.
She must be like family to you.

442
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,945
Family? No way.

443
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,073
She was the first person
to ever treat me like a human.

444
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,620
I used to be called a servant,

445
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:28,623
but she gave me the title of butler.

446
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,170
I didn't know
you were such a sociable person.

447
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,965
Oh, I apologize.

448
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,174
I went overboard.

449
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,677
No, I like it. It feels natural.

450
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,430
You don't have to stand there.

451
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,683
Please do your thing.
I'll clean up after finishing it.

452
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,018
No, you can just leave it there.

453
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,272
I'll go check on Ms. Cha.

454
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,816
I just made some more tea for her.

455
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,817
Okay.

456
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,249
No legal power?

457
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,919
That's why I came here
before going to Ms. Cha's place.

458
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,880
I thought you should know.

459
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,718
So she lied to me.

460
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,678
But

461
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,264
there's another way
to get U-yeong released.

462
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,477
Please tell me in detail
where and how you stole the necklace.

463
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,648
Why do you ask that?

464
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:39,194
I'm going to find Ms. Cha's weakness.

465
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,403
Once I find it,

466
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,655
I can

467
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,949
help get U-yeong released.

468
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,995
Trust me.

469
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,623
I will get him out.

470
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,381
I stole the necklace

471
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,217
from the walk-in closet.

472
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,422
Was it in a safe?

473
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,259
No. It was in a display cabinet,
not a safe.

474
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,220
I frequented the place,
so I knew where it was.

475
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,061
Gosh, that scared me.

476
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,996
And the cabinet isn't locked?

477
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,623
It isn't.

478
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,000
What about a safe? Was there no safe?

479
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,963
Oh, I've seen it.

480
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,757
A safe, in the dressing room.

481
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,761
When I took out the necklace
from the cabinet,

482
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,096
I saw a button under the shelf.

483
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,731
When I pressed the button,
the wall slid open.

484
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,996
Please enter your password.

485
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,586
I need to know the password.

486
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,923
Most of Ms. Cha's passwords,
including her phone,

487
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,800
are 1119.

488
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,177
Ji-yu's birthday.

489
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:04,315
Wrong password.

490
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,650
Please try again.

491
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,411
Wrong password.

492
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,537
Please try again.

493
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,707
After three failed attempts,
you cannot re-enter for an hour.

494
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,085
One hour?
It's over if it gets locked for an hour.

495
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,310
Is it six digits, not four?

496
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,397
My electronic door lock is six digits too.

497
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,654
Except for one and nine…

498
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:54,949
Zero.

499
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,451
Zero.

500
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:57,994
Zero.

501
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,872
I just need to combine them.

502
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:04,083
Most of Ms. Cha's passwords,
including her phone,

503
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,752
are 1119.

504
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,336
Ji-yu's birthday.

505
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,255
It's Ji-yu's birthday.

506
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,259
Ji-yu is a freshman in high school,
so she's 17.

507
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:16,179
I'm 29, so she's 12 years younger than me.
That means

508
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,181
she was born in 2010.

509
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,143
If it's six digit…

510
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,272
1011…

511
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,233
Nineteen.

512
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,378
Safe unlocked.

513
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,422
The door is opening.

514
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,025
What were you doing in there?

515
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,735
Shush. I…

516
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:00,616
I took a selfie
to post on my social media.

517
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,536
Don't tell your mom about this.

518
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,498
Right, and I followed your account.
Make sure you follow me back.

519
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,629
Ko A-ram and Park Seo-a
didn't contact you, did they?

520
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,009
No.

521
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,970
They haven't since they were disciplined.

522
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,600
As I said before, if they come
find you or anything, let me know.

523
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,019
I'll deal with them right away, okay?

524
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,271
Lawyer Kang.

525
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,859
Why did you come back up?

526
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:40,698
Well, I wanted to thank you for the dinner
you prepared for me.

527
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,202
I ate to my heart's content.
Thank you so much.

528
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,122
Well, then.

529
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,416
I should really get going.

530
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,350
KANG SEON-HO
LAWYER

531
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,477
REVEALING THE PRESIDENT'S HOUSE

532
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,319
He's such an attention seeker.

533
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,071
You must be tired.

534
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,075
I lost my touch from the few days' rest.

535
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,577
Since I wasn't making progress,
it was even harder.

536
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,789
You should eat.
Wash first. I'll prepare food for you.

537
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,708
I just need something

538
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,585
to drink.

539
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,001
You said you could pass the special act
if you had this. Are you sure?

540
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,877
Where are you?

541
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,546
I'll go to you.

542
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,758
I just left the house.

543
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,427
There's a secondhand bookstore

544
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,471
ten minutes from here
that I like to visit.

545
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,973
A secondhand bookstore?

546
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,394
Lawyer Kang, can you hear me?

547
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,688
I don't know

548
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,857
if I should

549
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,734
trust you,

550
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,153
Secretary Shin.

551
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,573
Why would you say that?

552
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,409
"We can pass the special act with this."

553
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:52,038
There were way too many people
who took advantage of us in the past.

554
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,333
If you use this to strike a deal

555
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,544
with the Party for Peace and Freedom
for your own political gain--

556
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,754
Don't worry.

557
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:05,176
Did you forget why I went so far
as to break the law and spread the video?

558
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,969
It was all for the special act.

559
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,056
Hand the ledger over to me.

560
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,851
I'm the only one
who can pass the special act.

561
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,868
Someone who goes by Secretary Shin said…

562
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,038
that if she had this,

563
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,836
she could pass the special act.

564
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:30,321
What? I really don't want to give it
to him, but I'm forcing myself to do it

565
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,282
because my uncle strongly insists.

566
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:37,286
And you stop me? You're pissing me off!

567
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,629
It's okay.

568
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,923
I'll check it first.

569
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,549
The security regulations say…

570
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,092
Go ahead.

571
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,432
God…

572
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,142
You're so thorough.

573
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:04,188
You don't even let him
open a bag on his own.

574
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,110
There's no issue. Would you like to check?

575
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,452
HASEONG FOUNDATION
PROSECUTOR NOH CHEOL-JAE…

576
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,669
FINANCIAL LEDGER

577
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,798
HASEONG PETROCHEMICAL

578
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,968
I need an explanation for these.

579
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,889
Secretary Shin claims
that you can seize control

580
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,809
of the Party for Peace and Freedom
with these.

581
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,853
You stole from my wife.

582
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,607
Ki-ju, what did I tell you?

583
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:52,111
I said we should've
just handed it over to Secretary Shin.

584
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,071
Did you hear what he said?

585
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:58,367
I knew he would nitpick
saying that I stole them!

586
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:03,622
I was even prepared to go to prison
in case things went wrong,

587
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:08,294
and he's acting all unbothered.
I knew he would act like this!

588
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,674
Did you hear that?

589
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,802
Seon-ho couldn't decide
who he should hand those over to.

590
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,138
I told him to give them to you.

591
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,056
For the last time,

592
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,184
I'll let myself trust you again.

593
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,115
If you intend to pass the special law
using those,

594
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,326
drink it up and take them.

595
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,500
If you're going to

596
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,754
drag your feet the way you have been,

597
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,590
just leave without them.

598
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,846
Why me, not Secretary Shin?

599
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:08,646
I didn't choose you. I was going to
give them to Secretary Shin.

600
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,605
Yoon Ki-ju.

601
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,816
Why me?

602
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,946
You know I suck
at making this kind of choice.

603
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,241
So I used my brain.

604
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,410
"If Tae-hun were here,

605
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,121
who would he have chosen?"

606
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,292
WE ARE AGAINST ILLEGAL SUCCESSION

607
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:51,206
I heard Lawyer Kang gave you the ledgers.

608
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,753
Hand them over to me.

609
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,256
I'll get in contact
with Peace and Freedom Party.

610
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,907
You want to threaten the assemblymen

611
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,868
and force them to vote in favor?

612
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,039
Of course.

613
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,209
We can't be picky with our methods now.

614
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,461
We must pass the special act--

615
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,755
What if I insist on the ethical method?

616
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,508
Will you reveal my weakness?

617
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,055
I know well that
this isn't how you like to do things.

618
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,725
But at times like this,
you must prioritize the outcome.

619
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:52,893
"At times like this"?

620
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,145
"The outcome"?

621
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,649
Who decides that?

622
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,153
Who gets to make that choice?

623
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,117
That's why I said I'd do it myself.

624
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:13,455
Just hand over the ledgers and stand back.

625
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,541
Turn a blind eye.

626
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,460
After the special act is passed,

627
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,630
you can play your role
as the president-elect.

628
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,217
That's what you took me for.

629
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,263
Someone who dumps
all the responsibilities on you.

630
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,979
H Hotel was my husband's pride.

631
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:41,066
He took me there
even before the construction was finished.

632
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:47,447
He was proud of building the tallest hotel
using the soil from the lowest ground.

633
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,951
But on the day of completion,

634
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,289
his claim for worker's compensation
was denied,

635
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:59,084
and he was investigated
for injury by professional negligence.

636
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,963
What I've done for the past 20 years
isn't any different.

637
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,174
I served you like your shadow
from the lowest place

638
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,802
and made you president in the end.

639
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:14,683
Please stay someone
I can be proud of.

640
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,561
You're the president now.

641
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,938
Do what you must as the president.

642
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,774
This should be my job.

643
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,028
Let me handle it one last time.

644
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,783
Your job is already done.

645
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,620
President-elect!

646
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,079
Your 20 years.

647
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,832
The 20 years you spent for me.

648
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,881
I wished I could stay grateful to you
until the very end.

649
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,691
This is my job!

650
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,151
Hand them over to me!

651
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,986
I told you not to stop me

652
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,155
when it came to the special act!

653
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,115
I told you!

654
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,867
President-elect!

655
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,953
President-elect…

656
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,043
President-elect!

657
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,079
Please stay someone
I can be proud of.

658
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,872
You're the president now.

659
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,667
Do what you must as the president.

660
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,585
You did the best you could.

661
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,087
So,

662
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,881
stop here.

663
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,341
"If Tae-hun were here,

664
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,094
who would he have chosen?"

665
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,663
SPECIAL ACT FOR
H CHEMICAL FIRE REINVESTIGATION

666
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:51,673
FINANCIAL LEDGER

667
00:50:56,845 --> 00:51:00,098
At the Haseong Interchange,
which leads to Yeouido,

668
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,684
a one-ton truck suddenly broke down

669
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:05,979
creating a massive congestion
around the area.

670
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,900
In certain areas,
cars have come to a standstill,

671
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,611
it's like a parking lot.

672
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,988
The police and the expressway corporation

673
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,949
request that drivers avoid the area

674
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,952
and check live traffic information.

675
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,162
What happened?

676
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,456
A truck broke down.

677
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,459
The police will tow it away,

678
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,336
but it will take some time.

679
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,185
You can't go.
Our security regulations say…

680
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:02,410
YEAR 2007

681
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,372
-My hand!
-Tae-hun!

682
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,874
Tae-hun, what's wrong?

683
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:08,917
Tae-hun.

684
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,964
-Call 911!
-Hang in there.

685
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,132
My hand!

686
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,843
Call 911!

687
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,512
-Tae-hun.
-Tae-hun.

688
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:21,513
Tae-hun.

689
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,990
President-elect.

690
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,261
I did as you said.

691
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:03,930
Of course.

692
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,766
I confirmed the President-elect's car.

693
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,936
The voting will start in 30 minutes.

694
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,689
Don't worry. He'll never make it in time.

695
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,776
But must we go this far?

696
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,487
The party is
against the special act anyway.

697
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,407
You talk as if you're a politician.

698
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,868
You might soon become one.

699
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,412
I apologize.

700
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,914
Do you know

701
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:33,960
why Europeans unnecessarily use forks

702
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,838
and even knives to have a meal?

703
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,133
Because they might die

704
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:43,887
if they let their guard down
and go to a meal empty-handed.

705
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:54,689
I'm not only good at arithmetic.
I'm pretty decent in world history.

706
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,192
It's not over until it's over.

707
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,319
How many people in history

708
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:02,697
do you think died unexpectedly
at the last possible moment?

709
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,866
That's how Genghis Khan died.

710
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,660
And so did Napoleon.

711
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,496
Who's to say I won't end up like that?

712
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,750
So don't say another word

713
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,502
and keep

714
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,964
the President-elect tied up in traffic

715
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,549
until the last possible moment.

716
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:39,693
Today, at the 22nd National Assembly's
plenary meeting,

717
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,696
a vote on the Do Tae-hun special act
will take place.

718
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,865
People are paying attention to
whether President-elect Hyun's

719
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,118
first election promise will be fulfilled.

720
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,119
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

721
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:00,839
How may I help you?

722
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:09,389
President-elect has just arrived
at the National Assembly.

723
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,475
But instead of his usual state car,

724
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,770
he arrived
on a traffic cop's motorcycle,

725
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,064
which is unprecedented.

726
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,915
Congratulations

727
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,208
on winning the election.

728
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:42,464
We should've paid you a visit first,
but you came here before we could.

729
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:49,095
From now on, it will be a private meeting.

730
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:53,433
President-elect made a difficult decision
and came all the way here.

731
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:58,063
We should have a heart-to-heart
without the cameras.

732
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:03,026
Instead of meeting the assemblymen
of Participation People's Party,

733
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,695
President-elect visited
Party for Peace and Freedom,

734
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,531
who was having their final meeting
to discuss the vote.

735
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,701
With only ten minutes left
until the voting,

736
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,287
it is presumed
that President-elect will persuade

737
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,498
the Party for Peace and Freedom himself.

738
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:19,501
If the special act is
still voted down after this,

739
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,754
President-elect will have to be
politically responsible for it.

740
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:23,922
He's facing a trial.

741
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:26,257
How dare you barge in here?

742
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,719
You're not the president yet.

743
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,221
Show some respect!

744
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,265
Did you hear that?

745
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:37,227
You came here to get some pictures taken

746
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,645
and get it on the news.

747
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,730
"I did everything I could."

748
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,900
"The act was rejected
because of Party for Peace and Freedom."

749
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:48,404
If you intend to spin the story like that,
just kill some time and leave.

750
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,158
We have less than ten minutes left
until the voting anyway.

751
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,996
Ten minutes is enough.

752
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,583
But for those ten minutes,

753
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,044
lend me your ears.

754
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,547
-What is he saying?
-That's nonsense.

755
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,006
Are you hearing yourself?

756
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,551
-You're being unreasonable.
-What on earth?

757
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,052
What does he want to say?

758
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,554
In ten minutes at that?

759
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,848
I'd like to thank Party Leader Ju Hyuk-rin

760
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,724
for arranging this meeting

761
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,811
so that I could meet
everyone here in person.

762
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,354
Why did you allow him in?

763
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,314
What does he want to say?

764
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:28,445
I don't think I need to explain why
the Do Tae-hun special act needs to pass.

765
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,779
Just a few days ago,

766
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,824
in the meeting held by
formal assemblywoman Bae,

767
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,325
most of you expressed

768
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,911
that you were in favor of the act.

769
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,332
Instead,

770
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:46,212
I'll talk about the obstacle
that hinders you

771
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,174
from voting for the act.

772
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,717
You're crossing the line.

773
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,093
What obstacle?

774
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,929
What on earth are you saying?

775
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,599
Do you have proof?

776
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,142
Show us the proof!

777
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,364
What on earth?

778
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,699
What's that?

779
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,118
-What's that?
-What's that?

780
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,461
Are those really…

781
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,807
What do you mean?

782
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,893
He brought the ledgers?

783
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,269
I mean what I said.

784
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,481
That's impossible.

785
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,325
Safe unlocked.

786
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,993
The door is opening.

787
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,719
The late Cha Jin-taek
left this legacy for my wife.

788
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,931
The past records
of your party's slush funds

789
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,850
and the recordings of
some assemblymen's corruptions.

790
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,061
What slush funds?

791
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,188
What corruptions?

792
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,149
If you're here to slander us,
you should go back.

793
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,737
I have eight minutes left.

794
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:39,617
Eight more minutes
for you to listen to me.

795
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:51,045
I will return Cha's legacy

796
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,299
to you guys.

797
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,968
It belonged to your party to begin with.

798
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,637
If this legacy

799
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:04,267
was holding you back
from voting as you wished,

800
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:07,937
don't worry about it now.

801
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,232
This is the first time

802
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,735
someone has threatened me so openly.

803
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,695
So you're saying

804
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:20,491
we should vote for the special act

805
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,493
because you know our secrets?

806
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,995
And become your puppets?

807
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,664
There are no secrets.

808
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,752
There are

809
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,171
no copies or recordings.

810
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,215
Really?

811
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:41,888
But

812
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,265
vote based on

813
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,894
your individual choice,
not based on your party.

814
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,772
The weight your vote holds…

815
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,778
Don't share it
with your fellow assemblymen.

816
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:03,368
The right and responsibility
of the vote belongs

817
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:05,787
solely to you.

818
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,918
Don't lay your responsibility
on your party.

819
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:17,215
Just like how I named the special act
after one person,

820
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,009
for today's vote,

821
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:22,804
vote as an individual,

822
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:26,265
not as a party member.

823
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,271
I just want to know.

824
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,816
Fifteen years ago.

825
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:39,153
April 2, 2012.

826
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:46,035
Why Tae-hun had to face such a death.

827
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:48,913
I just want to know that.

828
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,837
Why people try to stop me
from uncovering that day's truth.

829
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:00,758
And what exactly happened on that day.

830
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,349
I must know the truth.

831
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,641
Did you call Reporter Son?

832
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,227
After the interview,
U-yeong will be released.

833
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,188
No, I didn't do it.

834
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:58,065
I am President-elect Hyun Min-cheol's…

835
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:00,735
Is she really your daughter?

836
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:02,779
Answer me! Is it true?

837
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,865
What if the test results say
Lee Hwa-jin isn't his daughter?

838
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,033
What will you do then?

839
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:10,578
It's been two months,
and they still haven't found the culprit.

840
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:12,872
I want to find the culprit

841
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:15,708
who killed my mom.
