1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,917
ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,961
CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

3
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,048
There are no secrets.

4
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,051
There are

5
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,721
no copies or recordings.

6
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,850
But

7
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,311
vote based on

8
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,858
your individual choice,
not based on your party.

9
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,944
The weight your vote holds…

10
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,573
Don't share it
with your fellow assemblymen.

11
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,410
The right and responsibility
of the vote belongs

12
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,579
solely to you.

13
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,792
Don't lay your responsibility
on your party.

14
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,586
Just like how I named the special act
after one person,

15
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,838
for today's vote,

16
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,549
vote as an individual,

17
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,761
not as a party member.

18
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,306
I just want to know.

19
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,600
Fifteen years ago.

20
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,813
April 2, 2012.

21
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,653
Why Tae-hun had to face such a death.

22
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,405
I just want to know that.

23
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,202
Why people try to stop me
from uncovering that day's truth.

24
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,040
And what exactly happened on that day.

25
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,589
I must know the truth.

26
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,233
AGREEMENT

27
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,904
SUSPECT'S GUARDIAN: LEE HWA-JIN
ATTESTED BY ATTORNEY KANG SEON-HO

28
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,492
You can sign there.

29
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,332
LEE HWA-JIN

30
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,717
I'll get going then.

31
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,761
U-yeong…

32
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,599
Are you bringing him next time?

33
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,443
I'll do my best.

34
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,653
Did you talk to Reporter Son?

35
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,615
Yes. I'm meeting her today.

36
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,201
After the interview,
U-yeong will be released.

37
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,705
I'm counting on you.

38
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,724
What did he say?

39
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,228
Will he disclose the ledger
if the special act doesn't pass?

40
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,734
You should step up
and stop the assemblymen from voting yes.

41
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,488
No. Stop them from entering
the plenary meeting at all. Right now!

42
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,656
The president-elect

43
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,951
has a very different way
of handling things from you.

44
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,329
He didn't ask us to vote yes or no.

45
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,998
He gave us a choice.

46
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,961
Are you saying
you're not going to listen to me?

47
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,673
Do you realize I might have the copies?

48
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,132
It doesn't matter

49
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,385
whether there are copies or not.

50
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,053
What?

51
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,472
If everyone knows, it's not a secret.

52
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:29,018
Since the president-elect disclosed it,
that secret has lost its power.

53
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:33,439
Whether there's a copy or not
doesn't matter anymore.

54
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:37,235
The problem now is,
anyone who votes against it

55
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,530
will have to be responsible for it.

56
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,198
Mr. Noh.

57
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:47,036
This is probably the last time
we'll talk on the phone like this.

58
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,123
Once the special act is passed,
you'll get in trouble too.

59
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,042
Do you think
I'll just let you get away with this?

60
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,044
I'm not sure what you're talking about,

61
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,298
but there's one thing
that you don't have but I do.

62
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,801
It's the National Assembly member's

63
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,928
immunity.

64
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,680
What?

65
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,391
I suggest you first look into
how the president-elect

66
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,934
got a hold of the ledger.

67
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,604
After the special act is passed
and the investigation starts,

68
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:17,400
if information still keeps leaking,
you'll be in serious trouble.

69
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,776
Goodbye, then.

70
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,116
I'll get going now.

71
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,162
By the way,

72
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,456
I didn't get to eat today.

73
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,501
Before I go, can I have ramyeon
down in the kitchen?

74
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,717
LAWYER KANG SEON-HO

75
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,020
INCOMING CALL
CHA SU-YEON

76
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,817
PETITION FOR LENIENCY FOR SEON U-YEONG

77
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,953
INCOMING CALL
CHA SU-YEON

78
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,544
It looks like Ms. Cha's calling.
Aren't you going to answer?

79
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:27,345
Later. There's a lot to catch up.
It'd be better to do it all at once later.

80
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,066
What do you think?

81
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:45,780
This was written by Lee Hwa-jin,
she even signed it.

82
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,073
So it must be true.

83
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,325
"I'm having an affair
with the president-elect

84
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,576
and carrying his baby."

85
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,621
That's what Ms. Cha forced her to say
at the interview.

86
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:57,708
In return, she promised to argue that
the stolen necklace was actually a gift,

87
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,753
and to have Seon U-yeong released.

88
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,591
I told Hwa-jin this
so she'd accept the interview.

89
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,847
I don't know much about law,

90
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,517
but doesn't a lawyer have
a confidentiality obligation

91
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,726
to their client?

92
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,647
Right. Under Article 26
of the Attorney-at-Law Act,

93
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,566
lawyers, even former ones, are prohibited

94
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,528
from disclosing any confidential
information they learn through their work.

95
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,447
You shouldn't break the law.

96
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,283
Of course not.

97
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,244
Ms. Cha hired me,
knowing that from the start.

98
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,207
She knew I couldn't disclose it
no matter what the secret was,

99
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,126
and she wanted to use that.

100
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,628
But I'm not a lawyer anymore.

101
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,630
What?

102
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,052
Why did you become a reporter?

103
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,892
Well…

104
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,977
There must've been a reason, right?

105
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,316
There was definitely a reason,

106
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,069
but it's been so long that I've forgotten.

107
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,656
I became a lawyer to get

108
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,492
the special act passed.

109
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,079
The special act is
being voted on today, right?

110
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,375
It didn't seem easy.

111
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,923
It will pass.

112
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,810
What great weather.

113
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,730
The sun is nice, and the wind

114
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,274
is nice too.

115
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,369
Please comment.

116
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,497
Why did he visit
the Party for Peace and Freedom?

117
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,959
The assemblymen are now entering
the plenary chamber,

118
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,128
as the vote on the special act
is beginning shortly.

119
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,757
Since the president-elect tried to
convince the Party for Peace and Freedom

120
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,217
until just before the vote,

121
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,887
the result is expected to shake up
the nation's political landscape.

122
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,310
The person you've reached is unavailable.

123
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,729
You'll be redirected
to voicemail after the beep.

124
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,314
And charges will be applied.

125
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,108
Mr. Jo.

126
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,151
The special act shouldn't pass.

127
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,987
You're with Assemblyman Han, right?

128
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,030
Don't enter the chamber.

129
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,034
If you stop the special act,
I'll do whatever you want.

130
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,246
We already talked about this with Mr. Noh.

131
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,085
Do you think I'll just
let you people get away with this?

132
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,504
You'll all be done for if I start to talk!

133
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,299
It's only a matter of time
before you lose your badge!

134
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,633
Not the special act.

135
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,552
The special act can't be passed!

136
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,436
MBS REPORTER SON MIN-JU

137
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,158
ASSEMBLYWOMAN HAN KYUNG-AE
PARTY FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM

138
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,718
What is it this time?

139
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,888
Now the case will be
forwarded to the prosecution.

140
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,893
It seems Seon U-yeong is my last client,

141
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,355
so I came to take care
of my last case properly.

142
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,653
It's a petition claiming that Cha Su-yeon
gave a necklace to Lee Hwa-jin,

143
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,864
who had quit her job as a stylist,
as severance pay.

144
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,369
And this is a petition claiming that

145
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,121
Lee Hwa-jin asked Seon U-yeong to sell it

146
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,123
for her.

147
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:13,547
So the theft charge doesn't stand
in the first place.

148
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,971
If it's forwarded to the prosecution,
this will free him.

149
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:22,723
So…

150
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,935
save yourself the hassle.

151
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,022
You should've given this to me sooner.

152
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:34,068
Look at the date. I'm giving it to you now
because I received it today.

153
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,904
Ms. Cha is a very busy person, you know.

154
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,576
By the way,

155
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,789
the weather is amazing today.

156
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,709
It's a perfect weather
to be released, isn't it?

157
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,600
We're interrupting our regular programming
to bring you breaking news.

158
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,478
The Special Act on the Investigation
of the H Chemical Fire

159
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,730
and the Establishment of a Safer Society,

160
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,400
aka the Do Tae-hun Special Act,
has been passed.

161
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,605
Despite opposition
from the Party for Peace and Freedom,

162
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,857
the special act has passed

163
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,235
with 267 votes in favor,
far exceeding the required majority.

164
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,865
The Do Tae-hun Special Act,

165
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,910
considered the president-elect's
number one campaign pledge,

166
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,120
shows the new administration's
strong commitment.

167
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,956
All eyes are on
whether the truth from 15 years ago

168
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,666
will finally come to light.

169
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,501
Hi, Lawyer Song. This is Shin Hae-rin.

170
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,420
Yes.

171
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,464
It's all taken care of.

172
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,926
Nothing has changed.

173
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,345
Please handle it as discussed.

174
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,662
There has been no official response yet
from the president-elect.

175
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,790
We'll bring it to you
as soon as it's released.

176
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,752
-Mr. Hyun!
-Mr. Hyun!

177
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,094
-Hyun Min-cheol!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

178
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,097
-Hyun Min-cheol!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

179
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,892
-Hyun Min-cheol!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

180
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,060
Congratulations on
getting the special act passed.

181
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,521
You worked so hard for it!

182
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,523
-Good job!
-Good job!

183
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,904
It's all thanks to you.

184
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,122
Leave the phones,
and please go home early today.

185
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,000
Since the special act has been passed,

186
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,377
we're going to be even busier
from tomorrow.

187
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,629
Good job, everyone.

188
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,176
We'll work even harder!

189
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,020
-We'll work even harder!
-Thank you!

190
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,314
Secretary Lee.

191
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,524
Are you crying?

192
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,026
No, I'm not crying.

193
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,112
No, really. I'm not crying.

194
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,448
-Really?
-No.

195
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,533
I'm really not crying.

196
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,035
My eyes are just sweaty.

197
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,161
Oh, come on.

198
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,371
-Get him a tissue.
-No.

199
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,122
-Get him a tissue.
-I'm really not crying.

200
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,999
Come on. Don't cry.

201
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,417
Don't cry.

202
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,721
Sir, are you okay?

203
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,100
Do I look okay to you?

204
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,108
Don't you have to go see a doctor?

205
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,367
Come here.

206
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,036
I told you

207
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,747
to keep an eye on the president-elect!

208
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,040
Didn't I?

209
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,425
I'm sorry.

210
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,344
I'm sorry, sir.

211
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,058
MBS NEWS MAGAZINE
WILL START SHORTLY AT 7 P.M.

212
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,654
Is this really newsworthy?
The special act passed today.

213
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,656
Everyone's covering the follow-up on that.

214
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,284
We'll be the only one
talking about Cha's stylist.

215
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:17,953
That's right.

216
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,039
Now, they'll form
a special investigation committee

217
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,958
and the truth from 15 years ago
will come to light.

218
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,045
The world moves slowly,

219
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,797
but it heads in the right direction.

220
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,008
But none of that's for today.

221
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,385
You're talking like some hermit.

222
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,472
Don't worry.

223
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,849
Today's episode's going to be fun.

224
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,802
WE PROMISE SINCERITY!

225
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,887
WIFE

226
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,818
Now you're stealing?

227
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,279
Let's talk in person.

228
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,949
Should I come to you,
or do you want to come over?

229
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,326
You…

230
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,454
I'll come to you. Wait for me.

231
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,304
One second.

232
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,099
Hello?

233
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,892
Mr. Kang.

234
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,396
Are you in the broadcasting station now?

235
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,273
Yes, in the green room.

236
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,151
I think I found the room.

237
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,235
Hang on a second.

238
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,034
Mr. Kang.

239
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,538
I have something to tell you.

240
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,791
Could you leave us alone for a second?

241
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,168
Sure.

242
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,261
What is it you want to tell me?

243
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,433
Hwa-jin.

244
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,518
I lied.

245
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,979
I lied to you.

246
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,274
What do you mean?

247
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,694
Whether you do the interview or not,
U-yeong was supposed to be freed.

248
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,488
All we needed was the petition.

249
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,870
Then why did you tell me that
I had to do the interview to free him?

250
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,124
I was

251
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,668
using you, Hwa-jin.

252
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,338
Why?

253
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,468
There must be a reason.

254
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:24,389
Doing this interview will
put both you and U-yeong in trouble.

255
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,391
So don't do the interview.

256
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,060
I'll take care of the rest.

257
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,813
Come on. Stand up now.

258
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,232
The reason.

259
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,901
You didn't tell me.

260
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,071
There is

261
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,573
no time.

262
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,993
I need to know the reason
to decide whether I do it or not.

263
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,376
Have you hated someone so much
you wanted to kill them?

264
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,796
I have.

265
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,675
At first, it was Do Tae-hun, the dead man.

266
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,801
Then,

267
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,220
it was the person who framed him.

268
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,597
It was Ms. Cha.

269
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,436
What did she frame him for?

270
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,315
For killing my parents.

271
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,362
That's why I lied to you.

272
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,239
I wanted to use you

273
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,742
to take my revenge on her.

274
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,204
You must've really hated her.

275
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,382
You asked if I've hated someone
so much I wanted to kill them.

276
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,677
I have…

277
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,556
killed someone.

278
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,026
Ten minutes until the show.

279
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,736
Please stand by in the studio.

280
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,032
Wait, Hwa-jin. It's not too late yet.

281
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,454
Please follow me.

282
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,498
Hwa-jin.

283
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,005
Don't worry.

284
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,550
U-yeong will never be arrested again.

285
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,211
Did you look through the questions?

286
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,840
We'll take it slow, so don't worry.

287
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,260
Remember what we talked about earlier?

288
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,805
Just think this is a replay of that.

289
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,851
Where's the camera I should be looking at?

290
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,229
Oh, you can just look at me.

291
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,733
You need to act naturally
for the viewers to be convinced.

292
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,943
That's most crucial.

293
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,403
Okay.

294
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,698
Thirty seconds until the intro.

295
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,963
Dad.

296
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,007
Hey.

297
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,218
Have you had dinner yet?

298
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,097
You should've given me a heads-up.

299
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,015
We just had dinner.

300
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,774
Ji-yu, can we talk a little bit later?

301
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,526
I need to talk to your mom first.

302
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,867
Okay.

303
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,646
Would you like a drink?

304
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,567
Your usual tea?

305
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,235
Ma'am.

306
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,863
Could you bring us some wine?

307
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,037
The special act you wanted so badly
has been passed.

308
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,248
We should have a toast, don't you think?

309
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,129
I'll bring one right away.

310
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,429
When was it?

311
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,432
I'm talking about Lawyer Kang.

312
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,644
I doubt
he was on your side from the start.

313
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,564
What did you offer in return

314
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,191
to make him steal it?

315
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,903
Right.

316
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,030
Was he also

317
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,574
going for the special act?

318
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,291
I'll answer all your questions.

319
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,126
What happened

320
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,504
and everything.

321
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,089
Everything you want to know.

322
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,217
And in return,

323
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,678
answer this one question.

324
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,179
What is it?

325
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,556
Why were you
so strongly against the special act?

326
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,935
Just tell me that.

327
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,196
It's not what you think.

328
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,950
You just needed to trust me.

329
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,704
Just like you always have,
you should've trusted me.

330
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,372
But you chose

331
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,958
the special act over me.

332
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,584
That's not what happened.

333
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,462
It wasn't about choosing or not choosing.

334
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,880
You…

335
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,966
never change.

336
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,010
You can't give up on anyone.

337
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,180
No matter how much I tell you
what helps you win,

338
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,557
you just won't listen.

339
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,933
Because

340
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,603
you went into politics
just for that one person.

341
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,023
You think politics is
all about that one person!

342
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,859
If you knew that,
why did you go against it so hard?

343
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,895
Now it's passed,
you'll find out eventually.

344
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,608
That's why you were so determined
to get it passed, right?

345
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,776
That's right.

346
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,030
But I want to hear it from you.

347
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,658
The truth of that day.

348
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,711
Mom! Lee Hwa-jin is…

349
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,672
Lee Hwa-jin is on TV!

350
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,673
What?

351
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,218
She's on TV now.

352
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,349
Today, we have a special guest here.

353
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,434
LEE HWA-JIN
CHA SU-YEON'S STYLIST

354
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,360
Lee Hwa-jin will come forward herself.

355
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,862
And say the baby is yours.

356
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:21,699
You didn't…

357
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,244
No, I didn't do this.

358
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,623
We've received a shocking tip alleging
that Ms. Cha Su-yeon framed someone

359
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:32,460
as the president-elect's affair partner
and forced her into a false interview.

360
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,965
Ms. Lee Hwa-jin,
who provided the tip, is here with me now.

361
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,345
Thanks for coming.
It must've been a hard decision.

362
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,181
First, could you introduce yourself?

363
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,775
What's wrong with the guest?
Is she frozen?

364
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,155
Come on.
This is going to mess up the show.

365
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,614
Reporter Son, do something.

366
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,623
SHOCKING TRUTH BEHIND THE NEXT FIRST LADY!

367
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,378
Damn it. Dead air.

368
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,755
-Cut the feed.
-Hold on.

369
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,428
Ms. Lee.

370
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,599
I understand this can be stressful.

371
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,602
But you took the courage to come this far.

372
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:34,189
So please tell the viewers your story.

373
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,498
I am…

374
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,170
President-elect Hyun Min-cheol's daughter.

375
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,933
I thought I didn't have a father,

376
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,185
but I recently learned that I had one.

377
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,854
Ms. Lee.

378
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,359
Are you saying
you're the president-elect's daughter?

379
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,112
Yes.

380
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,657
That's right.

381
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,993
What was it called?

382
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,163
Ms. Cha told me.

383
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,457
Oh, I remember now.

384
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,126
An illegitimate child.

385
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,048
The president-elect's illegitimate child.

386
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,260
You said you learned about it recently.

387
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:49,472
When and how exactly
did you learn about it?

388
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,183
It was at the funeral on the election day.

389
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,435
At the funeral?

390
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,522
Whose funeral was it?

391
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,524
That's what I asked too.

392
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,609
"Who is she?"

393
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,489
LATE EOM SUN-JEONG

394
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,798
Who is she?

395
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,967
What is she to you?

396
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,844
This pendant.

397
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,556
You said your friend gave it to you.

398
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,392
Yes.

399
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,977
She's that friend's mom.

400
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,321
But…

401
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,658
you didn't tell me

402
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,368
what she was to you.

403
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,706
She's someone…

404
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,711
I had to meet again at least once.

405
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,339
But I was too late.

406
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,675
I came too far.

407
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,681
That friend.

408
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,101
You said she died, right?

409
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,529
Five years ago in a road accident.

410
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,534
She was on a motorcycle, and it slipped.

411
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,364
What is it?

412
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,992
Why are you looking at me like that?

413
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,871
It's nothing.

414
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,666
By the way,
what happened between you and Ji-yu?

415
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,668
There seems to be a big misunderstanding.

416
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,420
It's because of the pendant.

417
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,090
I don't know if she was joking,
but she refused to return it.

418
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,468
I see.

419
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,637
Anyway, why here?

420
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,390
Why did you bring me here?

421
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,601
I have a favor to ask.

422
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,647
Can you stay here

423
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,151
for the next three days
until the funeral's over.

424
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,695
Why?

425
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,075
If she's here all alone,

426
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,078
she might feel very lonely.

427
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,540
She had a very lonely life.

428
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,710
Her daughter's friend staying here

429
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,756
will be better than
a complete stranger doing it.

430
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,936
Is there really

431
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,023
no one to do it for her?

432
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,401
There used to,

433
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,320
but they're gone now.

434
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,408
One friend died because of me.

435
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,788
And the other friend is

436
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,458
in the police station because of me.

437
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,418
That's all?

438
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,588
She had someone whom she called mom.

439
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,056
She was a mother figure to her.

440
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,436
But if she comes here,
she'll be too devastated.

441
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,529
I'll do it.

442
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,743
But pay me three days' worth of wages.

443
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,415
I'll let Secretary Shin know.

444
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,458
And

445
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,502
I'll pay for the ring too.

446
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,216
But you said it was a present from you.

447
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,885
If Min-jeong gave it to you,

448
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,179
it belongs to you now, not me.

449
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,514
So take it.

450
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,725
"Min-jeong"?

451
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,727
The friend who gave you that ring.

452
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,981
Wasn't her name Min-jeong?

453
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,693
I never mentioned her name.

454
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,091
Does President-elect know about this too?

455
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,303
Did you tell him you're his daughter?

456
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,474
I didn't have time to tell him.

457
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,351
Why?

458
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,186
Ms. Cha got the wrong idea

459
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,814
that I was having an affair
with the president-elect.

460
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,025
Did you tell her she was wrong?

461
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,277
Of course I told her it was nonsense.

462
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:22,365
But she didn't think so.

463
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:26,535
She thought others would also
get the wrong idea about our relationship

464
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,080
and tried to claim
I was Mr. Hyun's mistress.

465
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,131
I don't really understand.

466
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:44,262
You didn't say anything when you were
accused of being Mr. Hyun's mistress.

467
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,847
Why are you revealing the truth now?

468
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,351
Why are you announcing it so publicly?

469
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,209
To find the hit-and-run offender
who killed my mom.

470
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,380
It's been two months,
and they've yet to catch the offender.

471
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,426
That's why I'm revealing
that I'm Mr. Hyun's daughter.

472
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,928
It'll get on the news this way,

473
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,806
and I'll be able to find witnesses.

474
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,311
I want to find the person

475
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,647
who killed my mom.

476
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,674
Mom, what was she talking about?

477
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,470
Dad.

478
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,639
Is what Hwa-jin said true?

479
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,391
Is she really your daughter?

480
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,439
Answer me! Is it true?

481
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,655
Ma'am, please take Ji-yu to her room.

482
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,115
Yes, ma'am.

483
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,034
Why won't you answer me?

484
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,748
Is what Hwa-jin said true?

485
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,752
Is she really your daughter?

486
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,387
Mom, say something.

487
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,058
Let's go.

488
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,771
You're the worst.

489
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,191
You two are the same.

490
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,027
You're the worst.

491
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,336
When did you

492
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,881
find out about this?

493
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:29,969
I had a guess.

494
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,679
At the funeral,

495
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:33,848
as she claims?

496
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,683
No.

497
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,230
On the day I saw the ring on her pendant.

498
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,826
That ring…

499
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,411
Pardon?

500
00:40:59,165 --> 00:40:59,999
This?

501
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,667
Can I

502
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,336
have a look?

503
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,779
What's wrong?

504
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,792
SECRETARY LEE BEOM-SEOK

505
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,131
Yes, I'll head out now.

506
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,972
I forgot to take this.

507
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:01,185
I should've packed it. I forgot.

508
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,940
Let's talk on the way. I'm running late.

509
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,442
Oh, okay.

510
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,498
When I asked how she got the ring,
she said

511
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,792
her friend had gifted it to her.

512
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,295
And that friend was dead.

513
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:33,175
That means Lee Hwa-jin is lying.

514
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,553
She could be passing off
as her dead friend.

515
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,554
No.

516
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,806
I don't know why,

517
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,226
but she lied to me.

518
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,187
Sun-jeong was the same.

519
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,565
What do you mean, the same?

520
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,650
She would faint every now and then,

521
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,403
just like Hwa-jin.

522
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,494
It's often hereditary.

523
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,707
For example, if the mom has the symptom,
the daughter has it too.

524
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,379
So I was always concerned.

525
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,589
No.

526
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,217
You just want to believe it.

527
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:20,598
You just want to believe that
the child you've never met is still alive.

528
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,767
Hwa-jin is assuming
the dead girl was your daughter

529
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,978
and is simply spouting nonsense,

530
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,105
and you just want to believe her.

531
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,863
Twenty years ago,

532
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,159
when Sun-jeong left, I had this thought.

533
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,663
That it might be you

534
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,584
that made her leave.

535
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,504
Why bring that up now--

536
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,298
Like how you chased Ki-ju away,

537
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,802
you might've chased Sun-jeong away.

538
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,806
Was it you?

539
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,645
Did you force Sun-jeong to leave?

540
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,110
Did you know

541
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,740
she was pregnant?

542
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,211
Let's do a paternity test.

543
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,796
That comes first.

544
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,360
I think

545
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,530
we need to talk, don't you think?

546
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,369
This is totally messed up.

547
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,747
Is this really okay?

548
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,419
You said today's news would be fun.

549
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:14,503
This is impressive.

550
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:18,340
Was it a surprise?
I thought it was going to be a blooper.

551
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:21,510
I told you
we'd definitely get the upcoming show,

552
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,095
didn't I?

553
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,725
Are you serious right now?

554
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:33,272
We almost took Cha Su-yeon's word for it
and reported her as Mr. Hyun's mistress.

555
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,524
If what Lee Hwa-jin claims is true,

556
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,444
we almost made a false report
of them having an affair!

557
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,821
That would've been a disaster.

558
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:41,905
A disaster that

559
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,199
would've destroyed a person, no, a family.

560
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,325
And you're talking

561
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,119
about the next show?

562
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,579
But it didn't happen.

563
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,712
What's with her? She was fine just now.

564
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,797
-Shame on you!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

565
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,757
-You don't deserve it!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

566
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,801
-Step down!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

567
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,678
-Shame on you!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

568
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,847
-You're an embarrassment!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

569
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,559
Before he could enjoy the excitement
of getting the special act passed,

570
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:14,480
the president-elect is facing a scandal
involving an illegitimate child.

571
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,731
That's his car.

572
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,150
-He's here!
-He's here!

573
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,653
Step down, Hyun Min-cheol!

574
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,280
-Step down!
-Step down!

575
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,240
Step down, Hyun Min-cheol!

576
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,492
-Step down!
-Step down!

577
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,494
Step down, Hyun Min-cheol!

578
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,329
-Step down!
-Step down!

579
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,331
Step down, Hyun Min-cheol!

580
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,458
Contrary to the prediction

581
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,044
that he'd refrain
from responding officially,

582
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,463
the president-elect showed up himself.

583
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,173
-Step down!
-Step down!

584
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,758
Step down!

585
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,259
-Step down!
-Step down!

586
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,677
Is what she said true?

587
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,679
Is Ms. Lee Hwa-jin your daughter?

588
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,224
People are demanding a paternity test.

589
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,558
Will you agree to it?

590
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,480
STEP DOWN, GET LOST

591
00:46:56,563 --> 00:47:00,526
STEP DOWN, HYUN MIN-CHEOL

592
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,911
Ask me again.

593
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:14,498
Some are demanding
a paternity test regarding this issue.

594
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,169
I need her consent

595
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,630
to do a paternity test.

596
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,259
I'm asking about your willingness.
Are you willing to take the test?

597
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,720
If that's what the people want,
I will take the test.

598
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:32,307
What will you do if the test result says
she is your daughter?

599
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,017
Take responsibility!

600
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,769
Take responsibility!

601
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,396
Take responsibility!

602
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,022
Take responsibility!

603
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,401
I will take responsibility
if the situation calls for it.

604
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:45,279
What kind of responsibility
are you talking about?

605
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,118
A responsibility as a father.

606
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,252
But my responsibility for the nation

607
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,297
and its people is just as important.

608
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,216
What's important now

609
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,011
is the special act
for the people's safety.

610
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,263
-Boo!
-Boo!

611
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,764
Step down!

612
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,308
-Step down!
-Step down!

613
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,227
The committee
with investigation and prosecution rights

614
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,229
is being formed in the wrong way.

615
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,648
Kim Jeong-taek, Chair of the committee,

616
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,652
is the CEO of the law firm which recently
merged with the law firm appointed

617
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,362
for H Group's illegal succession.

618
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,573
Vice Chairman Shim Yun-seop

619
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:33,910
caused controversy by defining
the workers on strike as terrorists.

620
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,622
The special act is to uncover the truth

621
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,001
of the fire
and stop tragic accidents from recurring.

622
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:45,130
Thus, the current committee members
must be reconsidered to support the act.

623
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,715
Step down, Hyun Min-cheol!

624
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,383
-Step down!
-Step down!

625
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,926
Step down, Hyun Min-cheol!

626
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,887
President-elect, you should go in.

627
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,180
President Yu,

628
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,932
prior to the special investigation,

629
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:59,269
started sealing up the relevant documents
as presidential records.

630
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,480
To uncover the truth,

631
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:05,817
we need
your constant attention and monitoring.

632
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,325
You should go in.

633
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,743
We'll continue next time.

634
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,411
-Step down!
-Step down!

635
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,163
Step down, Hyun Min-cheol!

636
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,539
-Step down!
-Step down!

637
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:23,210
President-elect emphasized
the neutrality of the committee members

638
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,337
and the independence of the committee.

639
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,715
But it is being overshadowed
by the illegitimate child scandal.

640
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,843
Some protesters are
demanding his resignation

641
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,428
and even using violence,

642
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,806
alluding to severe chaos.

643
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:45,440
Sis. She's toying with us.

644
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:51,530
Was it you?

645
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,073
What?

646
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,992
Hwa-jin's interview.

647
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,828
Did you get her to do it?

648
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,040
Did you pay her?

649
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,836
Calm down.

650
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,504
It wasn't me.

651
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,758
Were you aware of it too?

652
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,510
The illegitimate child issue?

653
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:19,099
The blood test result the nurse gave me.

654
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,269
Hwa-jin is Rh-negative.

655
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,397
So is Ji-yu, right?

656
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,902
That's uncommon in Korea.

657
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:35,073
Between 0.15 to 0.3 percent.

658
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,033
And I'm good at math.

659
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:41,288
That's about two out of a thousand people
with that percentage.

660
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:45,834
The doctor and the nurse
weren't surprised by her pregnancy.

661
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,503
Only two out of a thousand
are Rh-negative,

662
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:51,214
and two of them were rushed
to the hospital together.

663
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,841
Of course they were surprised.

664
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,553
So you're not 100% sure.

665
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,013
That doesn't matter.

666
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:00,599
We'll just carry on as is.

667
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,352
The special act's been passed.

668
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:08,023
I counted on you.

669
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,067
You've no idea
how disappointed I am in you.

670
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,864
The ledger you used like a family heirloom
has become useless now.

671
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,658
The few committee members
that are on my side

672
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,577
are our only barricades now.

673
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,163
First, we need to appease
the public criticisms

674
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,373
about the committee member appointments.

675
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:29,586
I was looking high and low
for something that could do that.

676
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,672
And at this crucial time,

677
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:37,219
she drew in everyone's attention
with the illegitimate child scandal.

678
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,805
We should be grateful, shouldn't we?

679
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:44,351
So I'm supporting to the fullest
with the protesters and the media.

680
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,189
What do you want?

681
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,400
Why did you ask to meet me?

682
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,073
Min-cheol said this on TV.

683
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,784
The paternity test can't be done
without her consent.

684
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,788
What if the test results say
Lee Hwa-jin isn't his daughter?

685
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:05,956
What will happen then?

686
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,708
The scandal will be gone
despite all my efforts.

687
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:14,297
So you're saying I shouldn't try

688
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,591
to get him to do the test.

689
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,559
Just in case, you know.

690
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:27,269
An illegitimate child.

691
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,646
Let's keep this issue rolling.

692
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:32,482
The assemblymen you controlled
with sticks,

693
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,484
I'll get them back with carrots.

694
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,321
They avoided me
when the special act was passed,

695
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,700
but after this scandal,
they're slowly coming back to me.

696
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,452
They're messaging me on Telegram, you see.

697
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,872
Old habits die hard.

698
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,582
Those scum

699
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,792
can't refuse my free money.

700
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,462
So don't do anything, Su-yeon.

701
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,215
Put your lawsuit on hold for a while too.

702
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,635
If the paternity test is
accepted as evidence

703
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,388
and the result isn't what we want,
it'll be our loss.

704
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,558
The result we want?

705
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:10,562
The result you want, you mean.

706
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,772
Come on.

707
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:13,857
Su-yeon!

708
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,735
I'm so hurt right now.

709
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:21,531
We're in the same boat,
at least when it comes to the special act.

710
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,204
If you get arrested, we all will be.

711
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,124
If I get arrested, you all will be too.

712
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:39,090
HASEONG MEMORIAL PARK

713
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,247
Mom.

714
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,667
Let's go now.

715
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,293
LATE EOM SUN-JEONG

716
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,513
Was it that day?

717
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:30,308
The day you suddenly visited me
and talked about Sun-jeong.

718
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,643
Was it that day?

719
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,104
Why didn't you tell me?

720
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,441
I'm sorry.

721
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,611
That poor thing.

722
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,823
If I'd sent her off myself,

723
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:49,119
I wouldn't be feeling this devastated.

724
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,455
And what is it about her daughter?

725
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,165
Did you know about it?

726
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,671
Say something.

727
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,798
Why won't you say anything?

728
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:04,050
Mom, stop it.

729
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,218
Let's go.

730
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,555
Let's go.

731
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,348
Goodness.

732
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:15,353
Oh, dear. That poor thing.

733
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:52,140
YEAR 2007

734
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,279
-Why're you always holed up here?
-Gosh.

735
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,659
Is this a ring?

736
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,661
Did you carve it yourself?

737
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,956
You're so crafty.

738
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,709
Or should I say you're devoted?

739
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:20,752
Keep it down.

740
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,588
Is this for Sun-jeong? A propose ring?

741
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,883
No, it's just her birthday present.

742
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,384
Is that so?

743
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,971
Since her birthday is in half a year…

744
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,557
It must be her birthday present.

745
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,601
What is it?

746
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,064
What are you hiding?

747
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,651
If it's a snack, give me a bite.

748
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,693
It's nothing.

749
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:48,196
What is it? Give me some too.

750
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,323
It's not a snack. It's not food.

751
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,327
You're acting suspicious.

752
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,496
Even if it's not a snack,
I want to see it.

753
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,582
I said it was nothing. Just let it go.

754
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,293
You're acting weird, Min-cheol.

755
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,715
I'll count to three.
Fess up before I'm done counting.

756
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,218
One.

757
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,012
Two.

758
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,266
You should just give it to her.

759
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,642
Two and a half.

760
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,060
Give it to her.

761
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,603
I'll really count three.

762
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,397
It's over if I do.

763
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,315
Two and a quarter.

764
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,526
I'll really count to three!

765
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:29,654
Gosh, just give it to her now!
You're so frustrating.

766
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,915
Hey, your knee!

767
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:42,709
Knee!

768
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,961
Get on your knee and do it properly.

769
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:47,213
Okay.

770
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,138
Is she punishing you? Is this a school?

771
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,683
Get on one knee.

772
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,652
I'm sorry.

773
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,072
I'll buy you a real ring next time.

774
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:56,866
No.

775
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,288
I like this.

776
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,087
It's the one and only ring in the world.

777
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,821
Did you get the diary?

778
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:19,949
Yes. But have a look at this first.

779
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:23,369
About the case you asked me
to look into as a buy-one-get-one-free.

780
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,912
Look at this.

781
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,998
I was checking the dashcams of

782
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,334
the courier trucks
that passed by the place

783
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,628
around 5:00 p.m.
when the accident happened.

784
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:34,964
But they're very busy with their work,

785
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,675
so it's been taking so much time
to reach them.

786
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,887
Many have deleted the dashcam footage
of February 26 as well.

787
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:45,808
But after Hwa-jin went live on the news,

788
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,102
I'm getting tons of tip-offs.

789
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,438
Not just the delivery men,

790
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,857
but people who passed by that place

791
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,859
when the hit-and-run happened

792
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,778
are uploading their accounts.

793
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:57,987
This is one of them.

794
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,800
Here.

795
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:23,054
It didn't capture
the car plate number, though.

796
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:27,433
The police might take some time.

797
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:28,976
But,

798
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:33,815
they will find out in the end.

799
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,166
Ms. Cha is being investigated
for the hit-and-run.

800
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:17,126
You know Eom Sun-jeong, don't you?

801
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,170
Witness or not, it doesn't matter.

802
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:21,714
The fact is that I'm her husband.

803
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,674
I'm the one who hit her!

804
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:26,594
It was Ms. Sung who drove that day, right?

805
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,095
Eom Min-jeong.

806
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:32,266
Should I reveal why you abandoned
your name as Eom Min-jeong

807
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,060
and lived as Lee Hwa-jin?

808
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:39,440
There's something I need you to do,
Lawyer Kang.

809
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,527
