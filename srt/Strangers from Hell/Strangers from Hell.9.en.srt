1
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,467
NO OUTSIDE VISITORS
ALLOWED IN THE RESIDENCE

2
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,378
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS

3
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,381
AND INCIDENTS APPEARING
IN THIS FILM ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,414
Young man in room 310.

5
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,756
You need to move out.

6
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,848
How many bags of flesh
can we get from him?

7
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,080
Time to work.

8
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,199
Jong-u.

9
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,261
Ji-eun.

10
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,972
Ji-eun!

11
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,559
Ji-eun. Ji-eun!

12
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,938
-Ji-eun. Wait...
-Let me go!

13
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,149
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

14
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,651
I'm so sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

15
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,112
Let's talk. Ji-eun, wait.

16
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,490
I can explain everything.

17
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,451
Let's have a short chat, okay?

18
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,579
About what? About that residence again?

19
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:32,003
I knew you were starting to get weird,

20
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,964
but I just figured
you had a tough time adapting to Seoul.

21
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,467
I just figured that's the case
and waited for you.

22
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,678
I thought things would get better
if I give you some time, but what is this?

23
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,138
What's this mess?

24
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,059
Ji-eun.

25
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,895
Hey, look at me.

26
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:55,693
We... We need some time, Jong-u.

27
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,011
We only have the recording for one week.

28
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,640
I didn't see him coming back down.

29
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,788
Hello, sir. I wanted to ask you something.

30
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,915
Do you know this town pretty well?

31
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,167
I know this area inside out.

32
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,170
I see. Then have you seen something

33
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,548
like an abandoned car around here?

34
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,757
-A car?
-Yes.

35
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,636
I don't think I've seen a car here.

36
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,263
Oh, you haven't seen one.

37
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,765
But why are you asking me this?

38
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,559
Goodness, I'm sorry.

39
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,396
I'm Constable So Jeong-hwa
of Eunhye Patrol Division in Eunhye-dong.

40
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,606
-A police officer?
-Yes.

41
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,443
There's one more thing I wanted to ask.

42
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,153
Do you know

43
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,946
any desolate and secluded place

44
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,866
where a car could get in?

45
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,037
Well, if you keep driving up there,

46
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,664
there is a desolate and secluded place.

47
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,500
But you shouldn't go there by yourself.

48
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:38,087
Sir, then how can I get there?
Do I keep going up?

49
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,922
Do I go straight?

50
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:44,052
If you drive for another 500m,
you'll find a grassy field.

51
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,472
There's a little road
a car could barely pass.

52
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:51,392
If you keep going down that road,
you'll find a desolate and secluded place.

53
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,220
That's liquid from food waste.

54
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:20,982
It's right here.

55
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,067
Let me call him.

56
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,740
OFFICER CHO HYEON-HO

57
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,621
Hello?

58
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,081
-Hey, Hyeon-ho.
-Yes, Jeong-hwa.

59
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,584
-I need you to check a VIN.
-A vehicle identification number?

60
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:46,090
Yes, it's KNAJC5213.

61
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,025
JONG-U, I'M HAVING A DRINK
WITH THE GUY IN ROOM 304

62
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,943
BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM THAT WEIRD

63
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:14,827
HEY, ARE YOU INSANE...

64
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,537
Something doesn't seem right.

65
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,375
SEOK-YUN

66
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,304
Seok-yun didn't send me that text.

67
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,748
Sir, to Eunhye-dong intersection.

68
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,258
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

69
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,513
DAMN IT, WHY WON'T YOU PICK UP YOUR PHONE?

70
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,810
-So this was used to set it on fire?
-Yes.

71
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,271
-Please check the rest of the scene.
-Yes, sir.

72
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,567
Man, I'm sorry,
but please move out of our way.

73
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,069
-Right, I'm sorry.
-Yes.

74
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,784
Excuse me.

75
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,869
Officer So Jeong-hwa?

76
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,162
Yes.

77
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,207
I'm Detective Lee Gwang-jae.

78
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,042
Oh, hello.

79
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,881
Hey, it's great to have
a sense of duty as an officer.

80
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,175
But there are procedures
when it comes to investigating.

81
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,136
-Yes, right.
-Don't you know what happens

82
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,637
if you ignore rules in an organization?

83
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,349
I'm sorry, but I told you over the phone

84
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,645
that Detective Cha
could have been abducted or murdered.

85
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,564
I told you that I found a syringe--

86
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,025
-Right, that syringe.
-I said... Yes.

87
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,902
Did you find anything else
or anyone you suspect?

88
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,238
Well, not yet,

89
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,532
but I'm suspicious of the dentist,

90
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,619
-and I'm not sure--
-A dentist? Are you saying

91
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,329
a dentist killed someone with a syringe?

92
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,415
No, that's not what I meant.
I wanted to send it to you

93
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,042
-to have you check--
-Hey, wait.

94
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,793
-Sir.
-One second.

95
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,463
-Officer So Jeong-hwa.
-Yes?

96
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,424
Did you find out an accurate location
of where his car was parked

97
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,551
or where he went after he left that place?

98
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,970
That's what I want to ask you to do.

99
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,097
-I want you to check--
-You picked up a syringe there

100
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,308
and are asking me to do this, aren't you?

101
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,811
Don't you think it's too much to ask me
to do that over some syringe?

102
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,856
-There are syringes all over the world.
-Detective, one second.

103
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,025
Yes, go ahead.

104
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,494
-Follow me.
-Yes, sir.

105
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,499
Officer, could you tell me
what's going on?

106
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,002
Someone found a dead body in Wonmok-dong.

107
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,671
-A dead body?
-Yes, with a needle mark on its neck.

108
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,953
I'll go in, bring Seok-yun,
and come right out.

109
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,580
It's too dangerous
to leave him here alone.

110
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,676
Excuse me.

111
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,930
Can you tell everyone
to walk around quietly?

112
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,850
Why do people in that residence
make so much banging noise?

113
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:09,353
We can't focus on our prayers...
My goodness!

114
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,885
Seok-yun.

115
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,679
Seok-yun.

116
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,353
Jong-u.

117
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:37,274
Did I surprise you? You said
you were coming, so I did it for laughs.

118
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,443
-"For laughs"?
-Yes.

119
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:40,736
Hey.

120
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:46,283
You asshole. Is this funny to you?

121
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,828
-Is this funny to you?
-I'm sorry.

122
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,499
Gosh. Do you want to joke around
in this situation?

123
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,292
I'm sorry, Jong-u.

124
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,294
Hey.

125
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,755
Are you one of them?

126
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,757
What do you mean, one of them?
I'm on your side.

127
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,678
How is it?
Do you feel that heat in your hands?

128
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,808
Calm down.

129
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:17,231
At that moment, I briefly thought,
"What if this asshole is

130
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,149
in league with them?"

131
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,901
Jong-u, one second.

132
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,736
Calm down.

133
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:27,199
Stay here with me.
You know that I like you.

134
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,661
You idiot. You need to move out soon.

135
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,330
I can't leave, Jong-u.

136
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,207
You crazy idiot.

137
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,711
You're just like these assholes.
Do you get it?

138
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,797
Jong-u. I'm...

139
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,175
In my opinion,

140
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,512
-you don't need to be so scared of them.
-What?

141
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,515
I had a talk with them, and they seem
to be pretty good people, Jong-u.

142
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,267
Let me go, you jerk.

143
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,062
So you should open up your heart
and get along with all of us.

144
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,858
-You're out of your mind.
-Let's try to get along, Jong-u.

145
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:05,279
Jong-u!
You can't judge a person by their cover.

146
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,822
Jong-u.

147
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,700
Do you want to come
and watch me perform, Jong-u?

148
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,662
Jong-u, please!
Please come and watch me perform.

149
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,790
Please...

150
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,044
Please.

151
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,881
Stay with me, please?

152
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,014
See that?

153
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,892
No matter how close you are with him,
you're still a stranger to him in the end.

154
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,060
I...

155
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,606
I really did my best.

156
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,441
You saw everything.

157
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,779
-So, please...
-I know you did your best.

158
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,994
But you still failed,

159
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,121
so you need to be punished.

160
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,543
Man, I thought you died already.

161
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:08,342
That lady played around
with you a little too much, didn't she?

162
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,553
Should I just let you live?

163
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,768
Just you wait.

164
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,938
We'll cut everyone
who's here including you

165
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,149
and turn all of you into meat anyway.

166
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,324
But today, let me get

167
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,080
a little taste of you. Okay?

168
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,884
Damn it.

169
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,888
Damn it. You.

170
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:10,904
Okay. It's more fun
when you get desperate.

171
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,284
Let's have some fun, then.

172
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,252
Damn it.
How is he going to nag at me this time?

173
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,130
Get some rest.

174
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,767
Yes, inspector. What is it?

175
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,393
Mr. Hong Nam-bok, where are you?

176
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:45,147
Where do you think? I'm at home.

177
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,691
Those evil bastards.

178
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,237
I'll never come back here.
I'm never coming back.

179
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,657
Evil bastards.

180
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,870
Anyway, your electronic anklet
is out of battery, so go up and charge it.

181
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,872
I'll come if I don't see your location
in 10 minutes.

182
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,290
Time to charge my battery.

183
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,375
Fine.

184
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,631
I need to get out of here fast.

185
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,299
Where will you go?

186
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,346
Hey, Ms. Um. Do you speak Chinese?

187
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,016
Goodness. Haven't I told you?

188
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,144
My ex-husband was... No.

189
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,898
My ex-ex-husband was a Korean-Chinese.

190
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,402
You get very lucky with men.

191
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,906
What do you think of me?

192
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,909
If you get lonely at nights,
come to my room.

193
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,371
Back when I ran the orphanage,

194
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,834
I was really good
at picking out kids who are lying.

195
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,879
Kids like that all had goofy eyes

196
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,756
just like you.

197
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,011
Do you want to know
how my ex-husband died?

198
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,973
He went blind,

199
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,892
then he fell down the stairs and died.

200
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,065
That crazy woman is out of her mind.

201
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,942
Be careful with the stairs.

202
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,449
So what about the security camera?
Was it turned off?

203
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,452
Nothing was recorded.
I think he was hit with that.

204
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,787
-With this?
-Yes.

205
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:24,872
And what about the syringe?

206
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,875
There's a needle mark on his neck.

207
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,752
-Did you find the syringe?
-No, it wasn't here.

208
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,880
-The culprit probably--
-Hey, wait.

209
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,133
After the NFS
conducts the postmortem exam,

210
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,511
we'll find out the kind of drugs
that were injected to the victim.

211
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,015
If the drug turns out to be the same
as the one in that syringe you found,

212
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,642
I'll head over to the residence
and check--

213
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,103
I definitely told you
about that residence before.

214
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,646
Exactly, so I'll check.

215
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,066
That might be way too late.
The culprit may be killing another person.

216
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,569
Young lady, I... Hey, officer.

217
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,987
-Yes?
-I'm working, aren't I?

218
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,241
We're doing our best right now,
so go back to your division and wait.

219
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,619
-Okay? Let her go.
-Please leave.

220
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,919
You've been wondering about

221
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,256
-what's happening on the fourth floor.
-Please spare my life.

222
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,967
And what happened to the guy
who lived here before.

223
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,682
They're all here.

224
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,820
I got it. I got it. I got it.

225
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,031
Time to eat.

226
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,827
What is this?

227
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,166
Who dared to make a scratch
on my property?

228
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,919
Where will you go?

229
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,465
Hey, Ms. Um. Do you speak Chinese?

230
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,126
Let's put on new shoes

231
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:38,088
And jump around

232
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,138
I knew it, that's my brother.

233
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,184
Going on?

234
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,603
No... No.

235
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,773
I was just passing by. I was leaving.

236
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,819
What is it?

237
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,863
Really?

238
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:07,993
If you leave now,
you'll lose a huge scoop.

239
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,288
-A scoop?
-A serial killer.

240
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,456
Serial?

241
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,583
I can give you a hand.

242
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,087
What do you want from me? Money?

243
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,089
I don't need any money.

244
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,676
I... I just want
to teach someone a lesson.

245
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,094
That...

246
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,389
That guy with bushy hair
who just walked in there?

247
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,933
It's not just one. Two people.

248
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,018
Two?

249
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,856
-Do you have evidence?
-I'll give that to you.

250
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,234
You can just write
what I want you to write.

251
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,779
So? Are you in or out?

252
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,575
Which one do you want to choose?

253
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,702
Hurry up and choose.

254
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,585
I won

255
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,713
this round.

256
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,603
Please spare my life.

257
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,315
How would Jong-u feel when he gets this?

258
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,152
Don't you want to know?

259
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,364
Please let me live.

260
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,749
I need to finish this. Wait here.

261
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,779
We... We need some time, Jong-u.

262
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:22,711
JI-EUN, I'M SORRY

263
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,136
EUNHYE PATROL DIVISION

264
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,768
-Jeong-hwa.
-Yes?

265
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,395
Did you sleep here?

266
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,152
What's all this?

267
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,197
The case file.

268
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,784
-That residence?
-Yes.

269
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,455
Is something going on with you?

270
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,208
No matter what happens,
you should sleep at home.

271
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,044
I'll get changed.

272
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,816
DESIGNER SON YU-JEONG

273
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,526
MR. SHIN DIED YESTERDAY. HAVE YOU HEARD?

274
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,153
Hey, long hair.

275
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,783
You wanted to kill him

276
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,161
when your girlfriend got out of his car.

277
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,664
That jerk definitely killed him.

278
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,167
Jong-u, one second. Stay here with me.

279
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,794
You know that I like you.

280
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,212
You need to move out soon.

281
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,548
I can't leave, Jong-u.

282
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:37,053
Jong-u, please! Stay with me, please?

283
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,806
That means yesterday, Seok-yun was also...

284
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,810
No. No.

285
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,274
No. Hey, no.

286
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,240
Officer Kim Han-jung of
the emergency hotline. How may I help you?

287
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,285
Kill... Killers. There are killers.

288
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,494
Pardon? Killers?

289
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,581
I think there are murderers
at the residence I live in.

290
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,459
-A residence?
-These... These people are

291
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,003
all conspiring together.

292
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:14,090
-They... They already killed...
-Sir, please calm down.

293
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,343
They killed three... No, four.

294
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,846
They might have killed many more
than that.

295
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,390
Did you witness the scene yourself?

296
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,809
I haven't seen them do it.

297
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,520
-Are you drunk?
-What?

298
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,732
Sir, you may face legal charges
for making prank calls

299
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,109
-after you get drunk this early.
-What?

300
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,445
-Prank calls are criminally punishable.
-Prank...

301
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,739
Did you call this a prank call?

302
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,326
People are dying right now.
How do you call this a prank?

303
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,745
In that case,
go to a nearby patrol division and--

304
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,040
You crazy assholes! People are dying!

305
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,550
What do I do now?

306
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,057
MY MOM

307
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,731
Hey, Mom.

308
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,192
-Jong-u.
-Yes?

309
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,656
What's wrong? Is something going on?

310
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,454
No.

311
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,748
Really?

312
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,003
Anyway,

313
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,090
why are you calling so early?

314
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,675
Was my brother hurt again?

315
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,387
No, I just thought of you.

316
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,558
Are you sure you're doing okay?

317
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,229
Yes, but I have to get to work now.

318
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,648
-Really? Make sure you eat breakfast.
-Okay.

319
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,150
I'll hang...

320
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,694
Jong-u.

321
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,448
I'm always here for you.

322
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,117
-You know that, right?
-Yes.

323
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:31,311
-Goodness, hello.
-Hello.

324
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,021
Are you here to pray for your son?

325
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,023
Yes, he has a test coming up soon.

326
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,609
Was he studying to become a teacher?

327
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,818
No,

328
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,112
he's taking
the Public Service Aptitude Test.

329
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,782
You should've sent him to our residence.

330
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,201
He would've passed already
if he studied here.

331
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,244
Don't even say that. Why would he...

332
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,834
He studies at an academy.
Please excuse me.

333
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,002
Ma'am.

334
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,965
My spirit hasn't been very clean lately.

335
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,384
Could you spare some of your time?

336
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,970
-I want to talk to you about my faith.
-What?

337
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,265
Goodness, I'm a deaconess too.

338
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,559
That's why my residence is called Eden.

339
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,065
-Well...
-Let's go over there and talk.

340
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:20,276
-Okay, but...
-Let's go.

341
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,404
-But I...
-I've been really troubled lately.

342
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,825
Come here.

343
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,537
I'm a regular here. It's quiet and great.

344
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,873
If we feel blessed,
we can sing some gospel songs too.

345
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,251
-Come on.
-Okay.

346
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,714
-Goodness, right.
-It's cool in here.

347
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,592
Tropical Storm Gini has arrived in Korea
as it advances north,

348
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,053
and a typhoon watch has been issued
all around the country.

349
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,889
Especially, Gyeonggi region
is experiencing heavy rain

350
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,350
of 30 to 40mm per hour...

351
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,686
We can start promoting the show

352
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,688
-about eight weeks before the premiere.
-Okay.

353
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,148
The agency will give us
more information on the cast,

354
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,150
so we'll put it together
and send it to you in a week.

355
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,445
Okay. Please do a good job
on the cast information.

356
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,824
-It's important to get a good start.
-Yes, of course.

357
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,495
Once you have the information,
we want it to go viral,

358
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,957
so please keep putting it out there
on our social media account too.

359
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,041
Yes.

360
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,879
Do you have the promotional material?

361
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,591
Bo-min, can you reach Ji-eun?

362
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,719
I've been contacting her, but not yet.

363
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,429
She's so irresponsible.

364
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,599
It's okay.

365
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,268
Camera three, let's take that again.

366
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,104
Okay. Stand-by, cue!

367
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,552
Jong-u.

368
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,347
-Jong-u.
-Isn't that Yoon Jong-u?

369
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,224
What's with him?

370
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:37,747
But why?
Why do these things keep happening?

371
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,501
Do you really have no idea?

372
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,837
You killed them.

373
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,175
You killed both Jae-ho and Seok-yun.

374
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,554
Be honest.

375
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,392
It felt good, didn't it?

376
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,602
It wasn't me.

377
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,482
No. I didn't kill him.

378
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,943
I didn't do this.

379
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,948
-It wasn't me.
-Jong-u?

380
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,327
What are you doing?

381
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:30,550
"Gregor looked around in the dark
after he woke up.

382
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:35,179
Soon, he realized
he couldn't move an inch.

383
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,267
But he didn't think it was odd.

384
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,521
It seemed more unnatural
that he had been moving around

385
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,441
with such thin legs of his.

386
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:51,195
On the other hand,
he felt relatively comfortable."

387
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,452
Don't you think
that's how Jong-u feels right now?

388
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:07,837
Are you reading that...
that boring book again?

389
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,882
I cleaned up his room.

390
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,177
What should we do

391
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,596
if the man in room 303 doesn't return?

392
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,518
He'll come soon. Don't worry.

393
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,104
Are... Are you a fortune teller or what?

394
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,107
How do you know that?

395
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,944
I prepared a present for him.

396
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,446
He'll definitely come to get it.

397
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,324
Well, I guess it's good to be with us.

398
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,911
You can kill people as much as you like.

399
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,580
You can wrap this up.

400
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,207
Really?

401
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,793
Yes, I have to

402
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,420
be somewhere.

403
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,922
Where?

404
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,008
We need to get rid of

405
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,677
some smelly things
before we get out of here.

406
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,221
You're right.

407
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:04,477
All right! This is exciting!

408
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,608
My way hurts a little,

409
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,861
so try to hold out.

410
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,405
Please spare my life...

411
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,907
What?

412
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,909
Please...

413
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,702
I can't hear you.

414
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,289
-Please don't...
-What?

415
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,959
-Please...
-I can't hear you.

416
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,961
Please don't...

417
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,845
Goodness,
why did you make him look like this?

418
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,272
Hey, we'll be leaving here soon,

419
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,984
so I cleared my conscience
of all the sins I've committed.

420
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,902
Are you going out?

421
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,363
Yes, I have
some businesses to take care of.

422
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,199
Good for that man in room 303.

423
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,703
Wait, hey.

424
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,915
What will you do with them

425
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:11,085
-once we move out of here?
-What?

426
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,088
If the man in room 303 will be joining us,

427
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,048
you'll get rid of them.

428
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,885
Yes, I'll get rid of them.

429
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,970
Both of them. Okay?

430
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,889
Both of them.

431
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,391
I'll be back.

432
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:26,767
Mun-jo.

433
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,314
We'll only have
good people here now, right?

434
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:51,500
Let's see if you're still alive.

435
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:59,383
You... You seem to hold out very well.
Is it because you're still young?

436
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:04,096
Young man. Do you want some meat?

437
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,685
-Yes?
-No. No...

438
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,689
Why? You enjoyed it last time.

439
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,695
My gosh.

440
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,990
Things must be pretty troublesome for you.

441
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:27,161
You ended up getting caught
by these weird people.

442
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,750
But I don't know, man.

443
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,544
That asshole in room 303

444
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:39,465
is on a completely different level
of craziness.

445
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:47,181
But what do you think, young man?

446
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:53,562
Don't you think he... he looks down on me?

447
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,690
What do you think?

448
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,360
It does seem like he looks down
on me, doesn't he?

449
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,530
He always wants to get his way,
doesn't he?

450
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:07,285
That asshole killed my brother too!

451
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,247
Man, I'm suddenly getting riled up.

452
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,377
Damn it!

453
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:24,468
That asshole keeps killing people
like they're nothing but bugs

454
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,430
just because
we help him clean up his mess.

455
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,557
This is so annoying!

456
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,269
Should I just kill him? Hey.

457
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:35,896
Young man. Should I kill him?

458
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,482
Say something, young man.

459
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,779
Young man. You want to run away

460
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,907
from here, don't you?

461
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,286
So do you want to make a bet?

462
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:53,039
Let's make a bet and see
if you can run away or not.

463
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,457
Okay, sounds good!

464
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,001
All right,

465
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,755
before that asshole comes back...

466
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:08,012
Okay, now. You can go now. Go.

467
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:11,057
Okay, go. Let's go. Go!

468
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:14,226
You can do it! Okay.

469
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,230
Okay, that's it. That's it.

470
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,027
You can't give up
in a situation like this.

471
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,154
You can do anything!

472
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,241
Heave-ho. Heave-ho.

473
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:33,162
Green light, green light, red light!

474
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:36,957
Green light, green light, red light!

475
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,879
Green light, green light, red light!

476
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:47,468
Green light, green light, red light!

477
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:54,600
Green light, green light, red light!

478
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:59,522
Green light, green light, red light!

479
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,442
Green light, green light,

480
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,070
red light!

481
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:10,074
How far did you go? Young man?

482
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:16,330
Goodness! Room 310, what happened?

483
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,624
Please... Please help me.

484
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:28,175
This way. Come this way.
My goodness, what happened?

485
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,803
Go inside.

486
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,103
Stay hidden, okay?

487
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:54,368
Ms. Um, have you seen the young man
in room 310?

488
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,497
I'm not sure.
I think I heard something on the rooftop.

489
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,085
Why don't you go up there?

490
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,363
You already got caught!

491
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,241
Thank you.

492
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,120
You two were having lots of fun.

493
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,512
POLICE

494
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:07,858
What is this?

495
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,571
I got a report yesterday and went over.
It looks like someone poisoned their food.

496
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,660
Its mom and other kittens all died.
This is the only one that survived.

497
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,538
Eden Residence.

498
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,211
What's going on in that place?

499
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,005
I'm so frightened.

500
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,094
Everyone who lives

501
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,931
in that residence is weird.

502
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,902
It's all meaningless.

503
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,196
Just forget them and move on.

504
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,157
I just had a nightmare. That's all.

505
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,955
OFFICER SO JEONG-HWA

506
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,668
Jong-u.

507
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,881
-Sergeant Yoon, this is bad.
-What is?

508
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,843
Sergeant Cho is trying to kill
the new guy again.

509
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,886
That crazy idiot!

510
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,015
He had been quiet for a while.
What's with him again?

511
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,099
It's you, isn't it?

512
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,310
It's me, Chang-hyeon.

513
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,606
I can't believe I ran into you.
What are you up to?

514
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:32,651
My friend's father passed away,
so I was at his funeral.

515
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,903
Wait, you look...

516
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,364
Is something going on?

517
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,494
Goodness.

518
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:44,788
Jong-u.

519
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,132
Why?

520
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,009
He won't pick up?

521
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,385
No.

522
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,930
Come here.

523
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,147
Am I really a police officer?

524
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,150
I can't even do anything.

525
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,111
Jeong-hwa.

526
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,989
What should we do? Goodness.

527
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,701
You two. Are you talking behind my back?

528
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,370
No way. We wouldn't do that.

529
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,830
-Work hard.
-Yes, sir.

530
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,167
Look at you. Is that so?

531
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,429
What is he doing? Gosh.

532
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,495
Did you bring it?

533
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:11,041
Goodness, sir. You're very impatient.

534
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,469
What is this?

535
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,266
Why did he put these in such a big can?

536
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:35,524
-Are you sure about this?
-Of course, I am.

537
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:40,028
When will you publish the article?

538
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,864
It'll come out tonight.

539
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,366
It'll be a huge issue
once it gets published.

540
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:48,620
I'll write some comments
once it's published.

541
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:53,125
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

542
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,303
A KILLER WHO LIVES AT A RESIDENCE!

543
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,555
THE TRUTH BEHIND THE SERIAL MURDER
CONSPIRED WITH A DENTIST

544
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,485
You must like killers.

545
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,821
There's huge trouble over here.

546
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,658
Goodness, there's a dead body here.

547
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,205
Yes, it's...
It's near the entrance of Eunhye Park.

548
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,541
It's... I don't even know where it is.
It was so horrible.

549
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,127
I can't believe this happened

550
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:40,422
in such a quiet town like this. Goodness.

551
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,799
Yes, come quickly. Okay.

552
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,152
Hey, Officer Cho.
Contact the Detective Division...

553
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:05,030
Never mind. Call our captain first.

554
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:08,116
Hey. Don't touch anything. Okay?

555
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,702
-What are you doing, idiot?
-What?

556
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,871
-Call the captain first.
-Yes.

557
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,623
This is insane.

558
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,627
Hey! Call him, you idiot.

559
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,006
Everyone is throwing up, my gosh.

560
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,097
Do you want to order something else?

561
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:37,312
Can we move to a seat
in a corner, Chang-hyeon?

562
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,107
Why do you suddenly want to move?

563
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,863
Is this better?

564
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,116
Yes.

565
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,996
Anyway, what brings you to Seoul?
You live in Busan.

566
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:55,622
What?

567
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,375
Oh, a senior from college said

568
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,876
he'll give me a job here.

569
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,920
I see. You came to work.

570
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,047
Where do you live?

571
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,345
-Jong-u.
-Where do I live?

572
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,516
Something did happen to you today.
What's with you?

573
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,400
Jong-u.

574
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:28,989
It's kind of funny for me
to suddenly tell you this

575
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:31,658
when I hadn't been in touch
ever since I got discharged,

576
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,077
but to me, personally,

577
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:38,040
you were like an older brother to me.

578
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,458
I'm really thankful to you.

579
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,376
Think about it.

580
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,254
My father passed away
when I was a private,

581
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,549
so I couldn't even adapt
and had a tough time all alone.

582
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,094
You were the only one who looked after me.

583
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:54,890
You were the only one who cared
and was worried about me.

584
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,185
To this day,
no one looks after me like you did

585
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,771
after I got a job out here in the world.

586
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,230
I mean it.

587
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,692
I'm really thankful for that.

588
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,861
I still think about it.

589
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:11,323
Anyway, so I want to help

590
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,993
as much as I can

591
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,038
if you're troubled in some way.

592
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,626
It's okay, so tell me. What is it?

593
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,720
Man, these bugs.
They're all around the car.

594
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,514
We'll find out once we investigate.

595
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,641
-Hey, give them the material.
-Yes, sir.

596
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,603
Hello.

597
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,022
-We meet again.
-Yes.

598
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:47,317
Is this case related
to Mr. Shin Jae-ho's case?

599
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:51,488
The M.O. is completely different.
Mr. Shin got drugged through his neck,

600
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,365
then was hit by a blunt weapon to death.

601
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,951
This time, he was stabbed directly
on the neck.

602
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,036
Then why are you here?

603
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,165
I heard they were acquainted.

604
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,959
They were acquainted?

605
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,712
But I don't think these are related
to that residence.

606
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,964
It could've been personal grudge
or vengeance.

607
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,549
We'll find out once we investigate.

608
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,134
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

609
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,607
In a word,

610
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,943
you're fucked.

611
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,362
Your situation is just fucked.

612
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,322
Okay, wait.

613
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:38,994
People who moved out of that residence

614
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,872
all seem to have gone missing,

615
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,833
and you think a few of them

616
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:48,962
seem to be locked up
on the fourth floor of your residence?

617
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,132
Including that senior of yours, right?

618
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,343
-That funeral.
-Yes?

619
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,014
It was his funeral.

620
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,023
Jong-u.

621
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,694
Does this make any sense?

622
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:15,322
I mean, how can something that horrible

623
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,200
happen in the middle of Seoul?

624
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:21,787
Unless they're completely crazy.

625
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,121
They are crazy.

626
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,999
They're crazy assholes.

627
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:34,466
Did you report them to the police?
What did they say?

628
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,427
They asked if I was drunk

629
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,971
and I should stop making prank calls.

630
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,355
JI-EUN

631
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,781
Ji-eun.

632
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,284
Jong... Jong-u.

633
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,686
HE CAME TO SEOUL BECAUSE OF ME
I FELT BAD. WHERE ARE YOU?

634
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,980
JI-EUN, I'M AT YOUR PLACE
CAN YOU COME OUT FOR A SECOND?

635
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,606
IT WON'T TAKE LONG

636
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,823
JAE-HO, IS THIS REALLY YOU?

637
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,117
YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE YOURSELF

638
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,834
HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS AT HOME?

639
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,673
JAE-HO

640
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,823
Hey.

641
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,744
Hello.

642
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,082
How did you know I was here?

643
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,043
Jong-u told me.

644
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,378
-He did?
-Yes.

645
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,965
He wanted me to give you this.

646
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:43,470
Where is he right now?

647
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,598
I know where he is. Come with me.

648
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,351
It's okay.

649
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,010
Jong... Jong-u.

650
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,975
It's me.

651
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,229
Why are you with Ji-eun?

652
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,317
She wants to see you.

653
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,569
I beg of you.

654
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:46,616
Please don't lay a finger on her.
Please, I ask of you.

655
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,871
I'm not sure. I have a different idea.

656
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,877
Are you going to get her too?

657
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,463
Yes, it's just as you imagined.

658
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,884
This woman is useless to me.

659
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,845
You crazy asshole.

660
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:12,058
You asshole.
If you lay a finger on her, I'll kill you.

661
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,602
I will kill you, okay?

662
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,438
Jong-u.

663
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,988
What do you think? She wants you to come
and be with her like that guy in room 310.

664
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,908
-Will you run away again?
-You crazy asshole!

665
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,619
Ji-eun!

666
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,206
I'm going to kill you.

667
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,167
I'll kill you.

668
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,377
Where are you?

669
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,546
I look forward to seeing you.

670
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,425
I'll wait for you in your room, Jong-u.

671
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,318
Taxi!

672
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,574
Jong-u, wait.

673
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,451
Eunhye-dong. Eunhye-dong intersection.
Please hurry.

674
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,995
-Wait for me.
-Chang-hyeon, I have to go.

675
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,622
You can't deal with a lunatic alone!

676
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,541
-I have to hurry.
-Go inside. Move. Sir, please go.

677
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,214
Yes, it was all deleted.

678
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,677
In the end,
I found myself returning to that place.

679
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,237
EDEN RESIDENCE

680
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,738
Once I go in here,

681
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,950
could I come back out alive?

682
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:57,038
But at that moment, I realized

683
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:02,043
there was nowhere to hide
or to run away anymore.

684
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,663
Jong-u. If you go in there,
you'll both get hurt.

685
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,914
I'll come over.

686
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:40,999
Freeze.

687
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:41,958
Jong-u.

688
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,918
Isn't this fun?

689
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,546
You can kill anyone you want to kill

690
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,506
and save anyone you want to save.

691
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:49,924
It feels like being a deity.

692
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:53,511
No. Humans don't do the things you do.

693
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:57,390
This hell will be over once you die.

694
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,101
Okay. Then starting now,

695
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,021
let's finish writing the ending
of your novel, babe.

696
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:07,317
