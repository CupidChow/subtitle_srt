NO OUTSIDE VISITORS
ALLOWED IN THE RESIDENCE

ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS

EDEN RESIDENCE

5
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,398
What's with this residence?

6
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,245
Let's go, Jong-u.

7
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,252
What are you doing? Let's go inside.

8
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,011
OFFICER SO JEONG-HWA

9
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,105
Yes, Jong-u. Hello?

10
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,359
Jong-u, are you listening?

11
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,152
Jong-u.

12
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,655
You were right.

13
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,407
I think those people are
a group of murderers.

14
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,576
We received a report
at our patrol division today--

15
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,662
I'm about to go up to the residence.

16
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,541
Jong-u, you can't go in there.

17
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:08,336
My girlfriend is locked up in here.

18
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,963
What? Your girlfriend?

19
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,383
Oh, okay, then...

20
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,677
Then I'll be there.

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,388
-So--
-Then Ji-eun could fall in bigger danger.

22
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,558
What they want is

23
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,726
for me to show up.

24
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:27,147
Once I show up, they'll let her go.

25
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,358
Jong-u. If you go in there,
you'll both get hurt.

26
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,862
So stay there, please. I'll come over.

27
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,155
I have to go.

28
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,658
It will never end if I don't go.

29
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,620
Jong-u...

30
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,622
Darn it.

31
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,876
-Jeong-hwa! We got the analysis result
-What?

32
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,335
of the knife found on the scene,

33
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,421
and it looks like it belonged
to the missing An Hui-jung.

34
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,590
-What?
-So Special Detective Division

35
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,842
will investigate him as a suspect,
not a missing person.

36
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,719
No one would leave the evidence like that.

37
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,305
Wait, everyone is here.
Where are you going?

38
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,514
Jong-u just called.

39
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,474
-He's going into the residence.
-Jeong-hwa, that's--

40
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,852
I'm going in there.
Call me if something happens.

41
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:06,936
Wait...

42
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,982
And Hyeon-ho.

43
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,485
If you can't reach me, please come for me.

44
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,747
-Chang-hyeon.
-Yes?

45
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,542
If something seems dangerous,
you have to get out immediately, okay?

46
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,003
Hey, I used to be in the judo club.

47
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,673
-You have to come out immediately.
-Okay.

48
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,935
What's that?

49
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,438
They're in here right now.

50
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,149
Damn it.

51
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,115
Be careful.

52
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,430
The case...

53
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,892
I got it.

54
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,042
I don't think anyone is here.

55
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,303
What is it?

56
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,946
Be careful.

57
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:42,133
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU

58
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,218
Jong-u, maybe they're somewhere else.

59
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,847
They're here right now.

60
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,648
What are you doing?

61
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,234
What are you doing? Get up.

62
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,362
I suddenly got drowsy
now that I feel relieved.

63
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,447
Hey, we haven't found Ji-eun yet.

64
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,991
Why don't you grab your laptop first?

65
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,286
You said all of your works are in there.

66
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,962
Hey, did...

67
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,966
Hey, did you drink this?

68
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,095
-What?
-Did you drink this?

69
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,349
You can't just grab anything and drink it.

70
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,812
Jong-u. I can't seem to move at all.

71
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,524
Hey, wake up. Wake up. Get up.

72
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,397
Goodness, why are you so surprised?

73
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,451
Why are you on the desk?

74
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,205
Where's Ji-eun? Where is she?

75
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,915
Goodness, man.

76
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,043
Why are you looking
for your girlfriend here?

77
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,211
Isn't that so?

78
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,129
Should I look for her first?

79
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,843
Stop saying bullshit
and tell that asshole to come out.

80
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,972
-Gosh, you're so scary.
-Tell that asshole to come out right now!

81
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,807
Over there.

82
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,601
Ta-da.

83
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,896
I knew you'd be back.

84
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,108
What did you do to Ji-eun?

85
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,610
What did you do with Ji-eun?

86
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,613
You already know what happened to her.

87
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,578
Cut the crap before I kill you.

88
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,165
Okay, then. Kill him with this.

89
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,042
Then I'll let your girlfriend live.

90
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,294
What?

91
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,009
You have no other choice.
Why are you hesitating?

92
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,637
-What's this?
-When I went to fix my laptop,

93
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,431
they were giving away prizes
right out front.

94
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,182
This is actually the prize
for the last place.

95
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,519
It's cute. I'll put it on my bag. Thanks.

96
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,520
Okay.

97
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,775
That... That sounds fun.

98
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,904
This is awesome.

99
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,202
Jong-u, what's that asshole saying?

100
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,539
No, right?

101
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,584
Jong-u.

102
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,017
That looks fun.

103
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:53,527
Hey, the moment you touch that,
you'll lose your hands.

104
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,113
Looks great.

105
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,493
Moray. Tuna.

106
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,495
Snakehead fish.

107
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,247
Should we sell you at Jagalchi Market?

108
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,480
This was a novel I started writing
in this residence.

109
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,775
Yes.

110
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,863
Until the day I came to this place,

111
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,615
I always thought
the world I lived in was hell,

112
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,742
not this place.

113
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,208
Living in dire poverty,

114
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,503
my brother who drags me down,

115
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,631
my poor mom,

116
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,302
and the army and college.

117
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,054
However,

118
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,349
the real hell was this place.

119
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,064
A horrendous hell created by strangers.

120
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,659
Goodness, that was for your brother.

121
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,495
My goodness. This isn't good.

122
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,080
I'm in such a hurry
that this won't even work.

123
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,373
Jong-u!

124
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,045
Jong-u, give me a second. I'm all done.

125
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,379
No, I'm late.

126
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,395
Bye.

127
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,314
Jong-u, I'm all done.

128
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,608
-I have to go. It's okay.
-Wait just a little. I'm done!

129
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,819
Jong-u! Goodness, take this.

130
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,240
-Take this. Take it. Here.
-I... Okay, go. Bye.

131
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,326
Make sure you eat well
no matter how busy you are.

132
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,786
Okay, I'll manage.

133
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:49,870
Jong-u.

134
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,249
Be careful with people.

135
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,169
People are the most frightening
above anything else.

136
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,691
Ji-eun.

137
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,403
Ji-eun.

138
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,531
Ji-eun...

139
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,660
Ji-eun.

140
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,121
Min Ji-eun!

141
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,083
Ji-eun!

142
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,673
How's the moment
when your speculation gets confirmed?

143
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,383
Isn't it electrifying?

144
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,010
What have you done to her?

145
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,930
What have you done to Ji-eun?

146
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,100
I had to finish this.

147
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,938
This right here. This is Ji-eun's.

148
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,273
Isn't it pretty?

149
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,739
What have you done?

150
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,868
What have you done?

151
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,830
She's not dead yet.

152
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,834
I just put her to sleep. That's all.

153
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,348
Listen up

154
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,225
to what I'm about to say.

155
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,106
This is something

156
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,692
you'll find interesting too.

157
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,991
I'll let you live.

158
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,659
Jong-u!

159
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,334
Who is it?

160
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,086
Oh, my.

161
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,713
Are you going to shoot me with that?

162
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,089
Freeze.

163
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,801
Officer, you're way too casual
with your language.

164
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,553
What did I do wrong?

165
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,929
Where's Yoon Jong-u?

166
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,017
Why do you ask me that?
Didn't he come here with you?

167
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,771
Jong-u.

168
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,191
It's me, Jeong-hwa.
Scream out if you're here. Jong-u!

169
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,528
My goodness, you're scaring me.

170
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,740
I don't think you should do that.

171
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,164
Jeong-hwa, what's this sound?

172
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,832
Where are you?

173
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,919
Jeong-hwa. What... Jeong-hwa!

174
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,215
Jeong-hwa. Hey, are you all right?
Corporal Park!

175
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,509
Jeong-hwa, where are you?
Are you at the residence?

176
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,431
Why can't you do your job properly?

177
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,656
We'll be leaving anyway.

178
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,784
Lock her up in the basement.

179
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,079
Not the fourth floor, but the basement?

180
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,290
The handsome young man is
on the fourth floor.

181
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,960
We need to let him be alone with that guy.

182
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,673
I think the police will be here soon.

183
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,134
They don't even have a warrant.
What can they do?

184
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,470
I'll manage, so get rid of her.

185
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,973
Goodness, you're getting
into your character again.

186
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,894
I always wanted to be an actress.

187
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,151
Use your brain.

188
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,930
Hey, look at this.

189
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,558
That woman pushed me like this.

190
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:48,187
That must have hurt. But ma'am,
I think this is a misunderstanding.

191
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,481
What misunderstanding?
You need to arrest her now!

192
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,233
If you don't, I'll report her.

193
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,361
-Ma'am--
-I'm sorry, ma'am, but Jeong-hwa did that?

194
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,238
Are you saying I'm lying?

195
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,573
We can't reach her right now.

196
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,326
Why would I ever make up such a lie?

197
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,661
Please calm down a little.

198
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,914
Then we'll check
if she's here or not before we go.

199
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,708
What's with you?
How many times do I have to tell you?

200
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,960
That bitch grabbed my arm
and threw me on the floor!

201
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,588
-Don't call her a bitch. Don't say that!
-Hey, stop.

202
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,923
What else would I call her, then?

203
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,675
-Calm down.
-She just called her a bitch.

204
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,428
-Goodness, my poor life.
-Calm down.

205
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,556
Ma'am, then we'll call an ambulance
for you. Please go inside.

206
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,642
-Corporal, we have to check.
-I think this is a bump.

207
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,519
We'll take a measure
once we get a hold of her.

208
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,021
Okay, then. Goodness.

209
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,066
She's not a police officer, but a thug.

210
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,901
-Hey, come.
-Goodness, my head hurts.

211
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,363
How can she be like that?

212
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,782
Goodness. How can she do that?

213
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,874
-She won't pick up, right?
-Her phone is off.

214
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,293
-It's not like there's no signal.
-Do you have a warrant?

215
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,420
We can only go in with a warrant.

216
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,713
But her phone is still--

217
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,425
She could have just turned it off.
Come on out.

218
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,544
When will you publish the article?

219
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,462
It'll come out tonight.

220
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,715
It'll be a huge issue
once it gets published.

221
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,219
I'll write some comments
once it's published.

222
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,890
Cho Yu-cheol.

223
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,936
CHO YU-CHEOL

224
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,192
Died? Died?

225
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,699
FREELANCE REPORTER, CHO YU-CHEOL
FOUND MURDERED

226
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,910
Did... Did he notice something?

227
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,495
You can wrap this up.

228
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,122
Really?

229
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,623
Yes,

230
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:17,377
I have to be somewhere.

231
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,628
Where?

232
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,007
We need to get rid of

233
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,551
some smelly things
before we get out of here.

234
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:29,097
Damn it, when did he die? Damn it.

235
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,183
When did he die?

236
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,739
POLICE

237
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:45,924
Ms. Um didn't kill this cutie

238
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,302
and hid her here.

239
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,771
She's so soft.

240
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,279
She seems very easy to cut through.

241
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,583
Mr. Hong.

242
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,713
So it was you
who's been messing with my things.

243
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,467
We shouldn't have to differentiate
what's yours and mine. We're a family.

244
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,178
A family? Since when?

245
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,138
I told you not to mess with my stuff.

246
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,313
Goodbye, Mr. Hong. Goodbye.

247
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,152
Damn it, blood. Goodbye.

248
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,256
We should probably get out of here soon.

249
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,300
Wait.

250
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,930
If you keep doing this,
I can't wait any longer.

251
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,475
We've suffered enough
because of the young man.

252
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,228
Do you still not trust me?

253
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,856
It's not that I don't trust you,

254
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,234
but I can't let you challenge me.

255
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,988
Don't worry. You brought me up.

256
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,281
Yes.

257
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,826
You should keep your respect
if you owe me.

258
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:07,834
Right, and when we move out,
let's go to a cooler place.

259
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:08,918
Okay.

260
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,714
Do you want to go see the man in room 303?

261
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,050
He should be done by now.

262
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,843
Really?

263
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,303
No.

264
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,223
He's in the kitchen.

265
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,933
That's new.

266
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:37,614
Young man in room 303, let's play.

267
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,116
Hey.

268
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,493
What?

269
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,624
I let him have his way,
and this is how he repays?

270
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,252
Are you trying to betray me?

271
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,980
I know you're there.

272
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,239
Where are you?

273
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,450
Hide well.

274
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,080
You need to listen to the director.

275
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,166
You shouldn't get so cheeky.

276
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,213
Mun-jo.

277
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,387
I brought up that orphan
who was about to die, that bastard.

278
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,057
Where are you?

279
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,309
Where are you?

280
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,527
If I had known you'd be like this,

281
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,864
I would've killed
that young lady in the basement.

282
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,339
Ms. Um died.

283
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,551
Deuk-su

284
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:05,887
died too.

285
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:16,940
And now, you need to die too.

286
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,166
What are you doing here?

287
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,258
Why?

288
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,094
Are you going to kill me with that?

289
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:50,139
Damn it. You're awfully quick-witted.

290
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,809
Come on. It's not that I'm quick-witted.

291
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,019
You're just dumb.

292
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,397
Shut up, you asshole!

293
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,322
It hurts, doesn't it?

294
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,367
It must hurt like shit.

295
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:15,373
This is your problem.

296
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,211
-You're so dumb.
-What?

297
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,130
You should've pushed it all the way in!

298
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:31,931
You can never kill me.

299
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,391
Do you know why?

300
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,814
Because there are too many
of me in this world.

301
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,969
Mr. An Hui-jung?

302
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,349
Oh, no.

303
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,310
Mr. An, are you okay?

304
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,479
Goodness, Mr. An.

305
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,371
What are you doing? Pick it up.

306
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,289
Yes, sir.

307
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,417
This is Eunhye Patrol Division.

308
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,587
Yes.

309
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,842
Eden Residence?

310
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,844
Are you sure?

311
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,639
Yes, all right. We'll be there right now.

312
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,475
What is it?

313
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,976
It's the sex offender tracking center.

314
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,354
Someone's anklet was just destroyed
at Eden Residence.

315
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,438
What?

316
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,510
Isn't this fun?

317
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,848
You can kill anyone you want to kill

318
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,975
and save anyone you want to save.

319
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,062
It feels like being a deity.

320
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,776
Babe, you and I can do anything together
from now on.

321
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,571
Aren't you excited already?

322
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,866
Yes, I am excited

323
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,369
that I'll get to kill you now.

324
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,045
Okay.

325
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,715
Then starting now,

326
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,135
let's finish writing the ending
of your novel, babe.

327
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,394
You asshole!

328
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,197
Let me ask you something.

329
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,743
Why do you do this?

330
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,874
There's no reason.

331
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,252
That's what people are made of.

332
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,172
It's your instinct

333
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,092
to chew each other out
when we're with one another,

334
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,221
then grow tired as we watch them

335
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,390
suffer.

336
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,648
No.

337
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,026
Humans...

338
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,323
No matter how wicked someone is,
humans don't do the things you do.

339
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,366
I'm not sure.

340
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,080
Babe,

341
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,460
you enjoyed it
when people here were starting

342
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,004
to die off.

343
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,675
You and I will be

344
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,805
together forever.

345
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,599
Stop with your crazy bullshit.

346
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:12,905
This hell will be over once you die.

347
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,500
You need to die
in the most tormenting way.

348
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,961
You fucking devil.

349
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,171
I knew it, babe.

350
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,632
You are

351
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,843
the best piece of artwork I created.

352
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,253
Are you in pain?

353
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,590
What about your head, Jeong-hwa?

354
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,760
Where's Jong-u?

355
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,263
Jong-u... Jong-u is in the ambulance.

356
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,432
Are you okay?

357
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,395
Gosh, what a relief.

358
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,898
Goodness.

359
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,900
Let's go, Jeong-hwa.

360
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,932
SAEMTEO DENTAL CLINIC
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

361
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,934
What's "temporarily closed"?

362
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,249
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

363
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,501
I'll take the bus out front.

364
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,837
I'll take the taxi over there.

365
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,965
-Okay. Great work to this day.
-Yes.

366
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:19,800
Goodbye.

367
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,218
Goodbye.

368
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:22,970
Bye.

369
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,348
Bye, Byeong-min.

370
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,192
A grotesque case
of serial murder broke out

371
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,404
at a residence in Eunhye-dong,
Seoul, by its residents

372
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,782
such as Seo, twins named Byun, and Hong.

373
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,828
They met at an orphanage 20 years ago
and conspired to kill people.

374
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:52,332
The murder of a family
at a pension in Gyeonggi Province

375
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,586
was also most likely
to have been committed by them.

376
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:59,173
-Yoon, a man who had been living in...
-Director, have you heard of that case?

377
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:03,343
Yes, of course.
I heard Ji-eun is involved.

378
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,305
Yes, she said her boyfriend writes,

379
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,765
and he had been living in that residence.

380
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,893
The comments are insane.

381
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,854
People are saying
her boyfriend was the murderer.

382
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,398
This is
why you shouldn't date just anyone.

383
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,609
He is being treated at a hospital.

384
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,112
Hey, we should eat. What do you want?

385
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,157
He's doing his best to cooperate...

386
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,076
-Pizza?
-Pizza? But you drank last night.

387
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,120
Well, I want something greasy.

388
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,664
-Okay. Bo-min, let's order some pizza.
-Okay.

389
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,083
-There's a place out front.
-Okay.

390
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,631
Wow, he's awfully hurt.

391
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,883
Mr. An Hui-jung.

392
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,636
Well...

393
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,013
Goodness, excuse me.

394
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:52,434
I'm Detective Lee Gwang-jae,
Detective Cha Seong-ryeol's colleague.

395
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:55,145
You know him, don't you? He...

396
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:58,273
-Excuse me, is he unable to speak?
-Yes, he cannot speak.

397
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:05,531
Hey, I'm sure you don't want to remember,

398
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,866
but we came in need of your testimony.

399
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,785
-Hey.
-Okay.

400
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,995
Sir, let me ask you something.

401
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:15,666
People tried to kill you
at Eden Residence, didn't they?

402
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,543
Who were they?

403
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,508
It's okay. They aren't here right now.

404
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,083
So they all tried to kill you?

405
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,670
What about Mr. Yoon Jong-u?

406
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,924
Oh, Mr. Yoon Jong-u?

407
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,262
He was pretty normal.

408
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,432
He was just like any other guys
at his age.

409
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,977
He didn't talk much.

410
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:22,816
But he had a bad habit
whenever he got drunk.

411
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,028
That's when I knew he had a temper.

412
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,656
But he seemed pretty cheerful
when he first came,

413
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,200
but he kept getting darker and darker.

414
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,538
He'd offer to do overtime
even before we told him.

415
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,585
It seemed like he was reluctant
to go home.

416
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,254
He said he didn't want to go back
to that residence.

417
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,923
His face would get gloomy

418
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,885
when Mr. Shin brought up that place.

419
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,679
Oh, right. One time,

420
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:56,808
Reporter Cho was alone
in the office with him.

421
00:48:56,892 --> 00:49:00,646
He said he got a creepy vibe from him.

422
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,398
-"Creepy vibe"?
-Yes.

423
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,445
He brought up a story
about a murderer like it's nothing.

424
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:12,908
And he was really scary
when he beat up Mr. Park.

425
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:16,495
I... I was assaulted
at the office with a keyboard.

426
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:18,330
I was going to sue him.

427
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:23,752
That asshole was a crazy jerk.

428
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,757
Look... Look at this.
I got eight stitches.

429
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,593
I... I didn't even do anything.

430
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,639
Damn it.

431
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,141
But still, the CEO...

432
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:42,104
He definitely conspired
with that asshole and killed him.

433
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,481
Definitely. 100 percent.

434
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:48,235
An asshole like that should stay away
from this society.

435
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:51,154
Please do that, detective.

436
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,614
Jong-u heard

437
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,992
Seo Mun-jo abducted his girlfriend

438
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,494
and went to the residence.

439
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,914
He called me before he went in.

440
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,461
What will happen to him?

441
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:07,963
-Yoon Jong-u?
-Yes.

442
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:13,135
He was involved with Reporter Cho Yu-cheol
and Shin Jae-ho,

443
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,972
so we investigated him
as one of our suspects.

444
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,349
But there's no evidence
that he was directly involved

445
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,809
and the situation is the same.

446
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:23,353
He said he killed Seo Mun-jo,

447
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:28,608
but the field investigation result showed
it could count as self-defense.

448
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:30,652
I see.

449
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,487
I'm relieved.

450
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:38,243
Then did Seo Mun-jo kill everyone

451
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,870
except for Hong Nam-bok?

452
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:43,165
Yes, Hong Nam-bok was killed
by Um Bok-sun,

453
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:46,626
then Seo Mun-jo killed
Um Bok-sun and Byun Deuk-jong.

454
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,920
The circumstances look that way,

455
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,465
and we also found his fingerprint
and bloodstain.

456
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:56,720
Then are they also the culprit
of the pension murder case?

457
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,013
Probably.

458
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,099
-Officer.
-Yes?

459
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:05,228
Did you say you saw
Um Bok-sun killing Hong Nam-bok?

460
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:09,858
Yes, I was unconscious,
but I heard the sound.

461
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,235
That's odd.

462
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,453
Ji-eun, I have a question.

463
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,050
I'm sure it's tough to remember,

464
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,597
but Jong-u said he killed Seo Mun-jo
on the fourth floor.

465
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,933
By any chance,

466
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:48,188
if you heard something
or remember anything...

467
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,733
I don't really remember.

468
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:59,282
But Jong-u was muttering something
to himself.

469
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,326
What was he saying?

470
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,745
Please spare my life.

471
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,433
Please spare my life.

472
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,728
Please let me live.

473
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:33,733
It wasn't me.

474
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,652
It wasn't me!

475
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,573
You need to die.

476
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,161
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

477
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,582
Yes, all right.

478
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:53,211
I was worried when I heard
you've been refusing to see anyone.

479
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,630
I'm glad I got to see you.

480
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,093
What do you think will happen?

481
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:04,681
Oh, on the fourth floor of the residence
and in the basement,

482
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:09,352
we found lots of bloodstains
of those who went missing.

483
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,939
Since it's obvious that they did this,

484
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,401
what you did will be considered
as self-defense.

485
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,778
And we have
Mr. An Hui-jung's testimony too.

486
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,864
You won't have to worry.

487
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,617
-Those kids.
-Pardon?

488
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,620
What will happen to them?

489
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,212
Good kids. Goodness.

490
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,466
What do you think

491
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,803
makes something good or evil?

492
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,682
Yes? Well...

493
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:51,728
I'm not sure.

494
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:57,943
I'll go down to write again.

495
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,988
Sure. Jong-u, get well soon.

496
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,990
Don't worry too much.

497
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,827
And lastly,
there's something I wanted to ask.

498
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,623
What really happened

499
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,836
at the residence on that day?

500
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,300
Then did Seo Mun-jo kill everyone?

501
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,553
Yes, Hong Nam-bok was killed
by Um Bok-sun,

502
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,932
then Seo Mun-jo killed
Um Bok-sun and Byun Deuk-jong.

503
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,227
-Officer.
-Yes?

504
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:36,189
Did you say you saw
Um Bok-sun killing Hong Nam-bok?

505
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:41,027
Yes, I was unconscious,
but I heard the sound.

506
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,196
That's odd.

507
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:47,033
This is a little different
from the murder at the pension.

508
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:51,079
Back then, the suspect was
someone more professional.

509
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,873
It seemed like he was enjoying murder,

510
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,418
and everything was done neatly.

511
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,837
But this time, it's a bit different.

512
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,630
It looks like it was done by an amateur.

513
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,967
This suspect stabbed and beat up
someone who already died again and again.

514
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:08,054
It kind of seems like
one person did all this.

515
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:12,809
Did Seo Mun-jo really kill everyone?

516
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,353
I'll get going now.

517
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:17,897
Oh, sure.

518
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,502
THE METAMORPHOSIS

519
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,580
Jong-u,

520
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,874
I have to give you something.

521
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,336
I found this on the fourth floor.
It had your name on it.

522
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,337
Here.

523
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:34,599
Did you say you saw
Um Bok-sun killing Hong Nam-bok?

524
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:39,020
Yes, I was unconscious,
but I heard the sound.

525
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:52,617
Did Seo Mun-jo really kill everyone?

526
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,160
That's odd.

527
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,704
It looks like it was done by an amateur.

528
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,586
This suspect stabbed and beat up
someone who already died again and again.

529
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,256
It's not very neat.

530
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,388
It kind of seems like
one person did all this.

531
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:22,814
People like you

532
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,150
don't deserve to live.

533
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,486
No, I should have killed you before.

534
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,492
Did that asshole tell you
to kill everyone?

535
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,327
Go rot in hell.

536
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,204
You're awfully

537
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,749
quick-witted.

538
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,877
It's not that I'm quick-witted.

539
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,837
You're just dumb.

540
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,381
Die! Die!

541
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,884
Die!

542
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,826
You and I will be

543
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,831
together forever.

544
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,626
You need to die
in the most tormenting way.

545
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,003
You fucking devil.

546
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,339
I knew it, babe.

547
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,883
You are

548
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,053
the best piece of artwork I created.

549
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,999
Something seems odd. Why did he do this?

550
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,966
He must have hated them a lot. Yes.

551
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,051
That could happen
if he held a deep grudge against them.

552
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,344
Right?

553
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:17,887
Yes.

554
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,306
-It's true.
-He must have hated them so much.

555
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,873
I'll let you live.

556
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:29,751
But

557
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:33,296
kill everyone else who's outside.

558
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,889
I'll kill them all.

559
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,811
I'll kill you all.

560
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,441
I'll kill you all.

561
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,870
DIE, DIE, DIE, DIE, DIE, DIE

562
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:10,291
Die! Die! Die!

563
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,418
Die!

564
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,504
You had fun

565
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,548
when you killed everyone here.

566
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,134
Didn't you?

567
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:42,782
You are

568
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,368
the best piece of artwork I've created.

569
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:48,121
Please spare my life.

570
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,624
Please let me live.

571
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,001
You and I will be

572
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:59,298
together forever.

573
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,219
It wasn't me.

574
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,263
It wasn't me!

575
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,055
Babe.

576
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:37,516
