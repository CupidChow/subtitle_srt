ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS

AND INCIDENTS APPEARING
IN THIS FILM ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,926
Babe.

5
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,472
How do you want me to kill you?

6
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,185
Open your eyes.

7
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,315
Wake up.

8
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,181
Who are you?

9
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,228
Who are you?

10
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,739
Run away.

11
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,244
I said, run away.

12
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,224
Eat slowly.

13
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,017
Here.

14
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,270
Dad, your stew is the best.

15
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,565
-It's delish.
-It's deli what?

16
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,900
Delish...

17
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,111
We say that
when we eat something delicious.

18
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,739
-If it's that good, have another bowl.
-Okay.

19
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,949
I made a lot of rice.

20
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,867
After I finish this one.

21
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,583
Do you still have a toothache?
You didn't go to the dentist, did you?

22
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,626
I didn't.

23
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,922
I should have taken better care for it
after my nerve treatment,

24
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,549
but I was too busy to go again.
It keeps hurting.

25
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,345
It doesn't hurt enough to make you go.
Make sure you go tomorrow.

26
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,638
I'll go later today.

27
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,724
You idiot. Dentists don't open on Sundays.

28
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,560
There are dentists
who are open on Sundays these days.

29
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,312
-Really?
-Yes.

30
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,064
It's good that you work hard,

31
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,607
-but do look after your health.
-Okay.

32
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:44,158
Dad. Our newbie officer looked
into that woman,

33
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,078
and something about her is really weird.

34
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,916
She had two husbands,
but they both died in accidents,

35
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,503
and so did their parents,
then she took their death benefits.

36
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,588
Then she ran an orphanage,

37
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,092
but a fire broke out there,
and she got compensated for that too.

38
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,512
Really? Then she probably had been
a suspect.

39
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,474
And if there was a fire at an orphanage,
we would've seen it on TV.

40
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,060
Right?

41
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,938
Yes, you're right.

42
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,109
Dad, thank you so much. You're the best.

43
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,863
Hey, an old story said you'll become a cow
if you lie down as soon as you eat.

44
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,993
SAVER: ORPHANAGE FIRE, UM

45
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,873
SAEMTEO ORPHANAGE FIRE...

46
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,459
Hello.

47
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,962
SAEMTEO DENTAL CLINIC

48
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,756
IS THE SUSPECT THE TWO-FACED DIRECTOR?

49
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,946
I once read from a book

50
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:08,868
that criminals usually start off
by killing animals.

51
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,080
It may not be just a prank.

52
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,165
Do you think so too?

53
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,001
Why? Do you have a suspect?

54
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,193
Man, this is driving me insane.
I keep having nightmares.

55
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,196
This won't do. I have to go out.

56
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,916
-Hello, one second.
-Hello.

57
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,547
Thank you for helping me late last night.

58
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,382
Thanks for the charger.

59
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,383
Sure.

60
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,427
Wait, that's not it. I'm sorry.

61
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,723
This is... Yes, this is yours.

62
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,851
Right, this is my broken charger.

63
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,979
You have to keep your voice low
in this place.

64
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,981
Oh, I'm sorry.

65
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,400
No, you don't have to apologize to me.

66
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:26,446
It's just people here are a bit like that.

67
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,990
Just don't raise your voice.

68
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,118
Okay. You must've been living here
for long.

69
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,247
It hasn't been long since I moved here.

70
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:40,334
I see. It hasn't been long, then.
How's this residence?

71
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,421
The place I used to live in
had pretty awful people.

72
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:47,383
In that case, let's not talk here.
Let's go talk outside.

73
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,342
Sure.

74
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,429
-Are you on your way out?
-Yes, let's go.

75
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,144
Are you going somewhere?

76
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,439
I'm going out for a walk. What about you?

77
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,857
I'm going out to perform.

78
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,901
Perform? Are you a singer?

79
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,361
No, I'm not a singer. I rap.

80
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,280
Wow, that's pretty amazing.

81
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,699
It's not a big deal. What do you do?

82
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,035
I work for a show promotion company.

83
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,996
Really? Then do you promote
music shows as well?

84
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,539
No, we promote theater arts.

85
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,042
I see. But still, we're both
in the arts industry.

86
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,668
Which way are you headed?

87
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,504
-I'm going that way.
-I see.

88
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,838
What about you?

89
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,466
-It doesn't matter to me. Let's go.
-Okay.

90
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,845
It's an awfully hot day. How old are you?

91
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,805
I'm 27.

92
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,975
I see. You look really young. I'm 25.

93
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,395
Anyway, how did you end up moving here?

94
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,814
I saw it on an online housing website.

95
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,567
It's my first time living in a place
with no air conditioning.

96
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,529
May I call you Jong-u?

97
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,488
Sure.

98
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,157
You can speak casually to me.

99
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,410
I'll do that when I feel more comfortable.

100
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,954
-Sure.
-Let me give you a hand.

101
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,080
Thanks.

102
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,209
Is there anyone else
who's our age in the residence?

103
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:08,798
There are a few men in their 30s,
but they're all crazy.

104
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,174
They're crazy?

105
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,343
Well, yes, something like that.

106
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,721
If you don't have any plans today--

107
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,806
Hello.

108
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,725
Hello.

109
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,811
You must be new.

110
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,981
Oh, yes. I moved in yesterday.
I'm Kang Seok-yun.

111
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,775
Nice to meet you. You must live here.

112
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,318
Yes, I do.

113
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,195
You're very energetic.

114
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,116
Yes, even I think I'm pretty outgoing.

115
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,786
Were you two having an interesting talk?

116
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,914
Well, we were just introducing
one another.

117
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,083
Are you going somewhere?

118
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,002
To take a walk.

119
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,628
A walk.

120
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,089
It's a good idea to take a walk.

121
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,008
It's not that hot today.

122
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,594
-Aren't you hot?
-Pardon?

123
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,347
I mean, you're wearing long sleeves
in the middle of summer.

124
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,558
Oh, you don't want to get sunburned.

125
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,059
No,

126
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,437
I have scars on my arms.

127
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,438
Scars?

128
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,231
Yes.

129
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,236
When you have time, let's grab a beer
with everyone who lives here.

130
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,405
You guys do that here?

131
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,325
Of course. There aren't a lot of people,

132
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,870
but we're all around the same age.
You'll feel very comfortable here.

133
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,913
I see. Sounds great to me.

134
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,834
-Excuse me, then.
-Sure, goodbye.

135
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,508
Wow, he's really good looking too.

136
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,929
And you too. I guess everyone
who lives here is scorching hot.

137
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,474
Man, I'm so jealous.

138
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,269
Jong-u!

139
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,064
-Jong-u!
-Yes?

140
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,693
If you don't have any plans,
do you want to come and see me perform?

141
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,737
-Your performance?
-Yes.

142
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,366
Fine. I'm stuck here anyway.
Let's go with him.

143
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,576
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

144
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,455
-But don't laugh at my poor performance.
-I won't do that.

145
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,501
Anyway, where do you perform?

146
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,381
-Why did you turn off your phone?
-Let's do it here.

147
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,552
I wrote it in a hurry
at the residence last night.

148
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,221
Please do understand
even if it's a bit tacky.

149
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:26,477
I think it's my first time
seeing someone rap on the street.

150
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,105
My gosh, I'm really nervous.

151
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,650
But I'm really bad.
So don't expect too much.

152
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,277
-Sure.
-Okay, Jong-u. Gosh, I'm nervous.

153
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,863
You can sit over there. Yes.

154
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,908
Give that to me! What's with you?

155
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,543
Give me your phone. Give it to me.

156
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:01,011
When I was five
My mom ran away with our money

157
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,348
When I turned 13
My dad ran away with our money

158
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,934
Lions, wolves, crocodiles

159
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,478
They all fight with their lives
To protect their kids

160
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,605
But my mother, father
They ran away to save themselves

161
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,067
My grandma raised me
The abandoned little kid, all alone

162
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,404
She always said to me
That damned money is the root of evil

163
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,449
I promised myself as I watched my grandma
Going to the market early to work

164
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,910
I won't throw away what's more important
Because of that damned money

165
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:29,248
I sang every night
Holding my grandma's wilting hands

166
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,750
That I will never let go of her hands

167
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,919
But I couldn't keep that promise

168
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,173
My grandma didn't wake up
When the alarm went off early morning

169
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,884
And left me
With a few 10,000 won bills in her hands

170
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,768
Thank you.

171
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,030
Let's walk a little slower. My feet hurt.

172
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,616
Hey, what's that?

173
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,202
-What?
-You got a lot of that on your leg.

174
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,162
What? What is this?

175
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,041
-We didn't even sit anywhere.
-We didn't.

176
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,544
-What is this?
-You should take those off.

177
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,384
What kind of an asshole would do this?

178
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,969
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

179
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,600
SAEMTEO DENTAL CLINIC

180
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,944
-Hello.
-Hello. May I have your name?

181
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,530
So Jeong-hwa.
I made an appointment for two o'clock.

182
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,617
Yes, right. He's almost done,
so please take a seat for a moment.

183
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,577
Okay.

184
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,266
That's a picture of us volunteering
for the elderly in my neighborhood.

185
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,559
I see.

186
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,687
We do that once a month.
Do you want to be a part of it?

187
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:57,855
What?

188
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,482
No, wait. Right.

189
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,817
Dr. Seo, by any chance,

190
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,446
have you heard of Saemteo Orphanage?

191
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,656
They use the same name
as my dentist's office.

192
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,574
Yes.

193
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,454
I know it very well.
I grew up in that place.

194
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,788
What?

195
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,583
That's why I named my clinic after that.

196
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,044
I wanted to help people
like that orphanage.

197
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,879
Then Dr. Seo,

198
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,881
who's this lady?

199
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,425
-Director Um Bok-sun?
-Yes.

200
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,969
She was a director at our orphanage.

201
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,348
This expression is a cliché,

202
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,808
but she's like a mother to me.

203
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,978
She runs a residence now.

204
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,648
-It's over there--
-Yes, the one on top of that hill.

205
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,902
Oh, right. You must know
since this is your jurisdiction.

206
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,528
-Yes.
-You're right. It's that residence.

207
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,238
I live there now.

208
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:52,868
What? Why do you live there?

209
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,620
Well...

210
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,956
There was this house
I was supposed to move into,

211
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,416
but my move-in date has been postponed.

212
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,543
Gosh, what am I saying to you?

213
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,880
I wanted to live with Ms. Um again too.

214
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,548
I see.

215
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,968
I get it.

216
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,055
Anyway, you seem to have
a lot of questions for me.

217
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:18,227
No, it's not that.
There seems to be a lot of coincidences...

218
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,646
No, never mind. Yes.

219
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,357
-Shall we go in, then?
-Yes, shall we? Okay.

220
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,323
Jong-u, what do you want?

221
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,827
Gosh, isn't this place pretty expensive?

222
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,455
No, not at all. I'm a regular here,
and it's very affordable.

223
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,333
-Do you want  tteokbokki ?
-Well, whatever is fine.

224
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,169
We'll take  tteokbokki  and  ramyeon .

225
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,879
-Sure.
-Thank you.

226
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,966
Do you want to grab some beer?

227
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,801
No, let's have soju.

228
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,720
Then a mix of soju and beer.

229
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:54,763
No, just soju.

230
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,931
-Just soju?
-Yes.

231
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,099
Okay, soju it is.

232
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,018
Soju...

233
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,371
-Thank you.
-Sure.

234
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,425
Did anything happen to you yesterday?

235
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,720
I was shocked by your face yesterday.
You looked very dark and...

236
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,186
And what else?

237
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,563
Well,

238
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,274
I could sense

239
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,777
murderous spirit in your eyes.

240
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:00,037
After I moved to that residence,

241
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,374
I had a really tough time
for about a week.

242
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,085
Did something happen?

243
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:11,507
I could tell from your rap
that we're in similar places in life.

244
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,218
-Did you move here from a rural area?
-Yes.

245
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,804
-And you have a single mother.
-Yes.

246
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,806
It's the same with me.

247
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,851
Really? Wow, I didn't... Goodness.

248
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:27,397
You didn't look like that.
I thought you never lived a tough life.

249
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,069
-While we're on the topic...
-Yes?

250
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,365
-We have to get out of here.
-What?

251
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,745
EDEN RESIDENCE

252
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,922
It's seasoned perfectly.

253
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,063
Should I go to the sea to catch a fish?

254
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,690
You better repent.

255
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,900
Should I go to the sea to catch a fish?

256
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:16,029
Should I go to a mountain to catch a fish?

257
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,490
Should I go to a mountain to catch a fish?

258
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,077
I will fill up this bottle with fish

259
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,748
La, la, la, la, and return home gladly

260
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,464
La, la, la, la

261
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,259
And return home gladly

262
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,597
Should I go to the sea to catch a fish?

263
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,102
To a mountain...

264
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,446
Come here. Let's eat.

265
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,948
I brought some Korean beef.

266
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,535
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

267
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:13,313
That gangster said "I know you're all
in the same crowd." and went back in.

268
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:17,359
And it seemed like something was going on
by the way they looked at him.

269
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,154
It sounds like they're all
in the same crew.

270
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,866
Do you think they're in organ trafficking?

271
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:29,538
That's why I've been anxious, but
it's still a residence where people live.

272
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:34,042
No way. I doubt it's that bad.
Hey, I'll speak casually to you now.

273
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,545
-Yes, sure. Go ahead.
-I'm sure that place will become

274
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,756
a little more humane
now that you moved in.

275
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,342
Who lived there before?

276
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,097
-That gangster was in your room.
-Right.

277
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,184
He made a huge scene, saying
someone had been coming into his room,

278
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,687
then packed up his stuff
and moved out that night.

279
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,897
Then another guy moved out
the day after that.

280
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:00,652
-Jong-u, I really love crime films.
-Okay.

281
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,197
And after I heard your story,
something definitely smells fishy.

282
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,451
I think we'll find something
if we do a little more digging.

283
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,161
Why would we do that?

284
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,873
Do not provoke those lunatics.

285
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,959
I'm the most concerned
about the fourth floor.

286
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,587
You said someone went
into the fourth floor.

287
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:23,467
If no one lives there, who went in,
and why did that person go in there?

288
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,135
I'm sure

289
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,429
it's for a typical reason.

290
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,556
-Yes.
-Something must be hidden there,

291
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,016
-or it could be...
-Yes.

292
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,643
-...the crime scene. Yes.
-The crime scene? Yes.

293
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,646
Ms. Um said no one lives there.

294
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,942
But I kept hearing weird sounds,

295
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,694
like someone banging.

296
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,239
Something smells absolutely fishy.

297
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,409
I'll take a look quietly.

298
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,745
-Hey, hey.
-Yes?

299
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,122
Don't.

300
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,749
Yes.

301
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,210
I got it.

302
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,962
Don't go on the fourth floor. Seriously.

303
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,089
Okay.

304
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:10,055
So? How long do you plan on living here?

305
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,142
I have to stick around until
I get a part-time job to save up money,

306
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,102
so it'll be

307
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,646
at least six months.

308
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:22,234
Goodness, you have a poor life too.

309
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:26,446
It's okay. Everyone is supposed
to suffer when they're young.

310
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,158
-Anyway, while we're on the topic--
-Yes?

311
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,454
If someone tries to go into my room

312
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,499
or open the door,
could you take a picture of them?

313
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,502
If you locked the door,

314
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,922
how can anyone go in?

315
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,343
Ms. Um said it can't be opened,

316
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:52,055
but who knows? What if she's with them?

317
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,433
Then she could just open the door
for someone.

318
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,689
Anyway, it felt kind of leery
whenever I walked in.

319
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,154
Then if something looks fishy

320
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,698
and suspicious, I'll capture everything.

321
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,493
-Okay, thanks.
-Don't mention it.

322
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,871
Anyway, Seok-yun.

323
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,000
You and I both

324
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,295
have to focus on moving out
of this residence.

325
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,046
That's the only way we'll live.

326
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,549
Jong-u, we need money to move out.

327
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,638
Damn it, money. We have no money.

328
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,474
I'll become super successful,
buy you beers,

329
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,394
and do everything for you.
Don't worry. Really.

330
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,438
Yes, you'll be huge. I'll get going.

331
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,439
Hey,

332
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,191
what's your plan?

333
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,402
I have to go. I have to see my girlfriend.

334
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,362
-Oh, you have a girlfriend.
-Yes.

335
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,572
I'm jealous.

336
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,242
Where are you going?

337
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,746
I'm tired after writing my rap
all through last night.

338
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,040
I'll get washed up and go right to sleep.

339
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,752
Make sure you lock your door
before you sleep, okay?

340
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,879
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

341
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,217
I'm so relieved you heard me out today.

342
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,010
Gosh, don't mention it.

343
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,888
-I'll get going.
-Okay, Jong-u. Goodbye.

344
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,723
-I'll see you at home.
-Yes,

345
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,142
have a great night.

346
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,494
She wouldn't be sleeping yet, would she?

347
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,876
JI-EUN, ARE YOU ASLEEP?

348
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,431
-Go now. Thanks for the ride.
-It's nothing.

349
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,559
It's sad to let you go like this.

350
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,353
It's not sad at all.

351
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,063
Do you want to grab some beer
at your place?

352
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,315
What beer? I have a roommate.

353
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,775
We can all drink together.

354
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,027
Call me if you want to.
May I come in for a rest?

355
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,238
-Just go already.
-I suddenly got tired.

356
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,031
-Go.
-I'll call you right away.

357
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,074
Okay.

358
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,831
She's so cute.

359
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,006
SEOK-YUN

360
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,968
What? He's in front of my room again.

361
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,513
JI-EUN: I'M ABOUT TO SLEEP. WHAT IS IT?

362
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,032
ARE YOU OKAY?

363
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,534
HEY!

364
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,122
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

365
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,332
JI-EUN

366
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,396
What is this guy doing? Damn it.

367
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,402
Will you please pick up?

368
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,365
-Hey, Jong-u.
-Hello? Hey!

369
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,242
Hey, why won't you pick up?

370
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,704
Hey, I was really shocked.

371
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,414
What is it? What happened?

372
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,542
He suddenly looked back
while I was filming him in secret.

373
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,544
I really took that by chance.

374
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,383
Hey, then did you get caught?
Are you okay?

375
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,344
Yes, I'm fine.
He kept asking what I was looking at,

376
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,930
so I just made an excuse
and came up to the rooftop.

377
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,559
Anyway, he looks really creepy.
Should I upload this online?

378
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,522
Damn it. Hey, did he follow you up there?

379
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:14,943
I told you not to mess with them.
You never know what they'll do.

380
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,113
I'm on my way home. I'll see you there.

381
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,989
Okay, come quickly.

382
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,951
I'm starting to get scared now that I hear
what you're saying.

383
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,454
Hey, go back to your room
and lock up your door, okay?

384
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,249
You never know when they'll barge in
and stab you with a knife.

385
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,669
Okay, Jong-u. Come quickly.

386
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,671
Okay, bye.

387
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,761
Man, what a lunatic.

388
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,264
He's a complete lunatic.

389
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,308
That crazy son of a bitch.

390
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,310
Damn it.

391
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,872
Will you be careful?

392
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:12,000
You should watch where you're going.

393
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,128
What did you say?

394
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,506
Man in room 303.

395
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,091
What?

396
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,346
You know, this is all because of you.

397
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,098
Damn it.

398
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,059
I'm talking to you.

399
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,105
What?

400
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,776
Are you...

401
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,820
trying to ignore me?

402
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,698
If you're going to talk,
you need to be more articulate.

403
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,075
Why do you keep saying weird stuff?

404
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,955
I was joking too!

405
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:55,585
Why... Why did you get so serious?

406
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,589
The new guy is on the rooftop too.

407
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,183
Jong-u!

408
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,937
-You scared me!
-I'm sorry. Did I surprise you?

409
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:18,149
Hey, that baldy...
That weird bald guy was up here.

410
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,734
-Are you okay? Are you hurt?
-No.

411
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,777
Was everything all right?

412
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,403
-Yes, but I found something funny
-Go on.

413
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,696
when I went down to my room.

414
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,825
Hey, you need to sit still
while you're staying here, okay?

415
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,951
No way.

416
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,496
This is the guy
who used to live in my room, right?

417
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,373
Yes.

418
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,916
Wait.

419
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,293
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
AN HUI-JUNG

420
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,337
What? He was born in 1984?

421
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,756
No way.

422
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,968
It was right there

423
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,388
-by my bed when I went back to my room.
-Oh.

424
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,306
So I got this feeling right away.

425
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,269
I mean, why would he leave his wallet here
if he was going back to his hometown?

426
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,478
And there's quite a lot of cash.

427
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,523
Don't use his money.

428
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,317
Why not?

429
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,571
-He might come back for it. Keep it well.
-No way.

430
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,907
A detective has been looking
for this guy too.

431
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,576
"A detective"?

432
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,828
-A detective--
-Just leave it as it is.

433
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,205
Then shouldn't we report this
to the police?

434
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,623
Just stay still, will you?

435
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,208
Stop meddling
with other people's business.

436
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:18,710
Please.

437
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,674
Man, this isn't good.

438
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,136
I'll move out as soon as I get paid
this month. I can't live here.

439
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,470
-You're moving out?
-Yes.

440
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:34,058
I was going to hold out
until I have enough key money,

441
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,311
but I can't live here.

442
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,230
But isn't the rent too expensive

443
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,524
once you move out of here?

444
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,526
Even so,
I want to live a normal life. Hey.

445
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,155
How can I live here when a guy stands
in front of my room with a knife?

446
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,364
You're right.

447
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,949
Do you want to move out with me?

448
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:54,037
I can't. It's not like I have a job
and can get paid like you.

449
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,832
Hey, it's not a real job for me either.
It's an internship.

450
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,168
My paycheck is almost nothing,

451
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,753
but I'm moving out anyway.

452
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:07,675
Those freaks. If it hadn't been for them,
I would've held out here no matter what.

453
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,803
My mom said people are hell,

454
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,097
and this place definitely showed me that.

455
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,142
You're right.

456
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,477
But you know,

457
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,771
how did this place

458
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:23,441
end up gathering
so many lunatics like them?

459
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,485
It's not like they were brought here
on purpose.

460
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,987
Do you know which one among them is
the craziest one?

461
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,114
It's him. The guy we met this morning.

462
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,867
Oh, the long sleeves.

463
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,411
-Yes, the black long sleeves in summer.
-Yes.

464
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:39,248
He smiles creepily at us saying, "Babe."

465
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,584
-Isn't that gross?
-It's like he loves us or something.

466
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,337
Man, I probably shouldn't say this,

467
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,132
but these freaks should all die
in an accident.

468
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,634
-Because these lunatics...
-Jong-u.

469
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,260
...don't do anything for our society.

470
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,887
-Jong-u.
-They just... Why?

471
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,806
What?

472
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,524
See that?

473
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,653
It's great to open up, isn't it?

474
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,615
If you want to hate someone, hate them.

475
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,535
If you want to talk behind someone's back,
do that too.

476
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,788
If you want to kill someone, kill them.

477
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,749
That's real courage.

478
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,544
You might fall.

479
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,972
Did he hear...

480
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,349
He heard everything, right?

481
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,810
Yes, I think so.

482
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,189
-Damn it.
-Jong-u, he looks really dainty,

483
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:49,736
but something about him is creepy.

484
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,905
I told you that he's weird. Whatever.

485
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,657
Did you shower?

486
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,037
-Why?
-If you didn't, let's shower together.

487
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,457
I'm so nervous that I keep my eyes opened
even while I wash my hair.

488
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,751
I see. Okay. Let's go.

489
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,837
-Let's shower and go to sleep.
-Okay.

490
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,922
Man, that feels good.

491
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,802
This is so refreshing.
Wow, this is like a paradise.

492
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,097
Wow, this is refreshing.

493
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:23,269
I don't need anything

494
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,897
Only you can save me

495
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,149
No, not this.

496
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,443
I don't need anything

497
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,445
Only you can save me

498
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:36,824
You're my themed-stock share,
And I'm your savior

499
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:40,995
Why?

500
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,168
-Hey.
-What?

501
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,754
Why did you suddenly mention
themed-stock share?

502
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,800
Themed-stock share?
I was just trying to make it rhyme.

503
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,385
-That's cold.
-Do you even know what it means?

504
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,595
No idea.

505
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,855
-Seriously...
-That's really cold.

506
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,273
Hey, Themed-stock Share?

507
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,610
Then why don't you rap,
"You're my manipulated stock share"?

508
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,862
-What's manipulated stock share?
-It's like you play games

509
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:18,783
when you meet your girlfriend.
Don't be so calculative.

510
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,536
-Go to sleep.
-You're teasing me so much.

511
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,331
-Go to sleep.
-Okay, goodnight.

512
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,791
-Seok-yun.
-Yes?

513
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,461
Hey, still,

514
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:35,299
this place seems more like home
now that you're here.

515
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,052
Gosh, don't mention it. Goodnight.

516
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,053
Thanks.

517
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,599
-Themed-stock share.
-Themed-stock share.

518
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,001
Damn it, I should've gone to the restroom.

519
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,713
This is awfully inconvenient.

520
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:19,028
This is gross. So gross.

521
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,672
That asshole is holding a knife again.

522
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,967
I need to take a picture
and report him to the police first.

523
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,225
Young man, what are you doing over there?

524
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,937
Goodness, what's wrong?
What were you up to?

525
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,023
Oh, these eggs?
I wasn't going to eat them alone.

526
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,276
These were boiled nicely.
Do you want some?

527
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,904
-Why? Did you see something? Why?
-Come on, Ms. Um!

528
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,572
You ruined it.

529
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,241
Hey, Jong-u. What's up?

530
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,492
-Hey, Seok-yun.
-Why?

531
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,871
-Man. Unbelievable.
-What's with him?

532
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:14,542
That pervert had a knife in his hand.

533
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,795
He was trying to go into my room
with a knife in his hand.

534
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,381
-Really?
-Man, this is unbelievable.

535
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,385
I really saw him. I really did.

536
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,054
So I was trying to take a picture, but...

537
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,974
Man, Ms. Um, seriously...

538
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,726
Young man.

539
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,187
What are you talking about?

540
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,982
Are you saying
you couldn't catch him because of me?

541
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,108
Ms. Um.

542
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,819
Why did you have to come out
at that moment?

543
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,447
If it hadn't been for you,
I would've taken a picture.

544
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,200
That means this time,
I could have gotten hard evidence.

545
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,536
-Really?
-Damn it.

546
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,664
I needed to catch that evidence.

547
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,583
-Seriously?
-Yes.

548
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,501
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

549
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,003
Are you 100 percent sure?

550
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,424
Tell me. Are you 100 percent sure?

551
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,847
Then you can go to his room and check.

552
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,184
He had a knife with him,
so you can see if he has it there.

553
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,019
-Hey.
-Yes?

554
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:19,190
-You're our witness. Okay?
-Okay.

555
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,505
How dare you fuck with him?

556
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,674
Do you know how scared everyone is
because of you?

557
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,636
You're behind in rent, and you have
these women's pictures on the wall!

558
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,556
Do you know how uncomfortable
these two young men are because of you?

559
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:58,687
I... I can't sleep with so much noise.

560
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,817
Did you just laugh?

561
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,693
Did you just laugh while I'm talking?

562
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,946
You hit me way too hard.

563
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,031
Did I disappoint you in some way?

564
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,868
Look through his room.
He definitely has a knife in there.

565
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,831
Look through his room.

566
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,751
-Me... Me?
-Then should I do it?

567
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:25,047
No... No. I should do it as a manager.

568
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,471
Look... Look at all this garbage.

569
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,397
Please... Please clean up once in a while.

570
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,280
It... It smells like an old man in here.

571
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,116
Hey, handsome young man.

572
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,618
What if he doesn't have it?

573
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,495
What?

574
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,791
Have you gone deaf or something?

575
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,628
-What will you do if it's not there?
-Of course, it'll be there.

576
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,256
See this? No one can go to sleep

577
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,092
because you made a huge scene like this!

578
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,510
It's because of me?

579
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,722
What if everything was
a misunderstanding and confusion?

580
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,808
-Confusion?
-How will you compensate?

581
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,271
Are you sure you saw him?

582
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,319
I looked through everything,

583
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,155
-but there's nothing.
-If he had it, you would've found it.

584
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,991
-Why would he have anything like that?
-Move.

585
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,035
-Goodness.
-My gosh!

586
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:42,166
You... You have a serious trust issue.

587
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,715
My goodness, what's he doing?

588
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,799
Hey.

589
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:59,225
Jong-u. Hey, Jong-u. Calm down.
Calm down for now.

590
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,560
-Let me go!
-Calm down, Jong-u. One second.

591
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,563
-Hey, one second. Jong-u. Calm down.
-Young man.

592
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:08,400
Go ask your mom to make you some tonic.

593
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:11,946
You'll keep seeing things
if you're low on energy.

594
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:14,949
Hey.

595
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,370
-Take that off.
-Are you out of your mind?

596
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,038
Take off your clothes.

597
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,291
You asshole. Do you think I'm a pushover?

598
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,668
Do you want me to take it off?

599
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,129
Jong-u, Jong-u!

600
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,633
-Take that off.
-What?

601
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:37,054
Take that off before I kill you, okay?

602
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,337
There's no way I'm mistaken.

603
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,592
There is no way I'm mistaken.

604
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,896
Jong-u, you're late.

605
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,817
He must have partied on the weekend.

606
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,488
You're completely out of your mind now.

607
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:02,825
That means you don't want to do your job.

608
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,660
I don't have a man to date.

609
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,329
-Then go clubbing or something.
-"Clubbing"?

610
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,330
Gosh.

611
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:12,167
-What did you do on the weekend?
-Why? Are you going to hit me?

612
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,921
Jong-u, are you already slacking off?

613
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:21,385
I went bowling for the first time
in a while, and my back hurts now.

614
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,345
You need to take
some nutritional supplements.

615
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,764
You should start working out.

616
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:30,352
Damn it, if I had a girlfriend,
I would ask her to look after me.

617
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,773
Jong-u, Ji-eun must be
looking after you very well, right?

618
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,613
Shut up, asshole, before I kill you.

619
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:52,332
Why are you spacing out so much today?

620
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:56,128
-Go to a sauna or something.
-Mr. Ko, look after me.

621
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,214
-What's with him?
-I take so many pills.

622
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,425
Damn it, I want to get married.

623
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,303
Let's do a good job today too!

624
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,680
Go to a massage parlor.

625
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:08,557
I really need a massage today.

626
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:26,200
You... You act nice on the outside,

627
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,495
pretending like you're kind and innocent,

628
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,915
but you talk behind people's back
and look down on them.

629
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,793
Do you think I don't see through you?

630
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:41,298
I... I don't plan on getting along

631
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,052
with bastards like you,

632
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,471
so don't talk to me in private,

633
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,056
okay?

634
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:53,810
Let's see who quits this job first.

635
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,148
What?

636
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,859
Get back to work already.

637
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,704
That's when I realized

638
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,875
that hell wasn't the residence
or this company.

639
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,711
It was people around me.

640
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,472
You know what?
The CEO of this company is hungry.

641
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,474
-Do you want  sundaeguk ?
-Sounds great.

642
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,227
-Darn it, why  sundaeguk  again?
-What do you want, Jong-u?

643
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,603
I'm not eating.

644
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:40,649
Really? Okay, then.
What about you, Byeong-min?

645
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,359
-Pork cutlet.
-Anything but pork cutlet.

646
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,902
-Anything is--
-Let's go, then.

647
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,238
Let's eat something else.

648
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,864
-Hamburger steak.
-Anything but that.

649
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,826
-Let's eat  sundaeguk .
- Sundaeguk  sounds good.

650
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:03,130
SEOK-YUN

651
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,507
Hey, what is it?

652
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:09,052
Hey, Jong-u. I just came to the kitchen
to get some water,

653
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,471
and that pervert glared at me.

654
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,640
Is that funny to you?

655
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:17,352
No, I think that guy is a real lunatic.

656
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,855
He's really insane, so be careful.

657
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:22,065
Okay, Jong-u. Bye.

658
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:52,429
-Great job today.
-Great work.

659
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,431
-Great job, Yu-jeong.
-Sure.

660
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,434
Jong-u, aren't you going home?

661
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:02,314
Is it because you were late this morning?
Let's leave together.

662
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,066
Just come.

663
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,248
-Hey, he's shooting!
-He's coming at me.

664
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,209
-What was that?
-I made a mistake.

665
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:11,258
-Have you gone insane? Save him!
-What are you saying?

666
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,302
-You idiot.
-Stop it.

667
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,641
-Damn it. Are you dead?
-Hey, hey!

668
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,268
-Get out. Get out of there.
-I died.

669
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,561
Stop bothering me.

670
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,732
What was that? What are you doing?

671
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:27,858
Get out.

672
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,863
Why are you shooting me? You're insane.

673
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,782
Hey, let's go that way.

674
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,786
-Hey, there's one in front of us.
-I have no ammunition.

675
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,750
-There are a lot of people.
-Guys. Guys?

676
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,501
-What?
-Come again tomorrow.

677
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,337
-What?
-Come again tomorrow. It's ten o'clock.

678
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,883
-We'll just finish this turn.
-It's past your hours. Turn it off.

679
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,760
-Man, what's with you?
-Come again tomorrow.

680
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,434
-He told us to turn it off. Let's do that.
-Damn it.

681
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,312
We have to do it
if the part-timer says so. Shit.

682
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:11,920
Hey.

683
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:20,136
Damn it, we're regulars there.
Why the hell did you tell on us?

684
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,888
You should've just played your game.

685
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,766
We have nowhere to go now because of you.

686
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,310
-You need to take responsibility.
-Yes, he should.

687
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,354
What do you want me to do?

688
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,939
Well, what can we do?

689
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,317
-Then hang out with us.
-Sounds great!

690
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,569
Let's hang out, okay?

691
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,863
It's late. You should go home.

692
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,948
-Damn it.
-We have no home.

693
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,157
Let's hang out at your place.

694
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:43,201
-Go home.
-Let's go to your place.

695
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,160
Hey!

696
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,372
You shouldn't do something bad like this.

697
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,457
-Something bad?
-Why are you scared?

698
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,335
-Don't be scared. You make us feel sorry.
-Are you scared?

699
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,838
-You're way too old to be scared.
-Seriously.

700
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,631
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

701
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,633
-Hey.
-You can just get beaten up.

702
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,677
Don't laugh like that.

703
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:04,097
-How are we supposed to laugh, then?
-Seriously. How are we supposed to laugh?

704
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,557
Let's laugh in a different way.

705
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,225
-A different laugh.
-Don't laugh like that.

706
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:10,228
Okay, fine. Let's laugh differently.

707
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:13,982
Let's laugh differently.

708
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:20,822
Damn it!

709
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,410
Sir, he might die.

710
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,378
Sir, please spare him.

711
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,086
ADVANCEMENT, ARMY LIFE

712
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:19,214
-Sergeant Yoon, this is bad.
-What is?

713
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:22,384
Sergeant Cho is trying to kill
the new guy again.

714
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:28,264
He had been quiet for a while.
What's with him again?

715
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,434
Can you go stop him?
We'll all end up with penalty points.

716
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,436
-I have a leave next--
-I don't want to talk to him.

717
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,814
You know that he doesn't respond to me.

718
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:40,527
At least he pretends to listen to you.
Please do this for us.

719
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,446
Damn it.

720
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,659
I would've killed him already
if we were out there.

721
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,285
Think about everything he put us through.

722
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:52,497
Where had lunatics like him been hiding
all along?

723
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,960
Will you please stop?
What if our admin officer saw you?

724
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,379
Do you want to get locked up
at a guardhouse again at your rank?

725
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:04,884
Enough! Stop it, you crazy jerk!

726
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,512
Jong-u.

727
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,685
Help me...

728
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:23,278
You liked him too, babe. Didn't you?

729
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:28,742
I told you to get out of here quickly
before you go insane like me.

730
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:37,208
What are you looking at, asshole?
Do you want to die too?

731
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,214
You asshole!

732
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:48,720
Stop! Stop it! Stop it.

733
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,973
-Calm down!
-Stop it, you asshole!

734
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,520
Jong-u.

735
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,316
Spare my life.

736
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,282
I'm sorry.

737
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,912
If I had known this would happen,
I would've beaten him up myself.

738
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,331
To be honest,

739
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,919
-I don't regret this.
-Pardon?

740
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,004
To be honest, that took a load off me.

741
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,093
I should've killed him
while I was beating him up.

742
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,807
I was going to go find him
once I get discharged.

743
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,600
I totally understand.

744
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:39,104
Those crazy lunatics deserve the same.

745
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,271
If we don't do that,

746
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,232
-he'll never change.
-If we sit still,

747
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,901
they think we're scared of them.

748
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,822
They'll wake up
only when they get beaten up.

749
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,073
You've done well.

750
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,951
We'll file in our petition too.

751
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:56,913
Everyone in this troop knows
what he had been doing.

752
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,334
I'll get to the infirmary, sir.

753
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,044
Goodbye.

754
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,187
I should have killed him.

755
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,046
Are you okay?

756
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,519
Goodness, you're bleeding.

757
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:10,445
Don't say anything. You're badly hurt.

758
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,660
Don't worry now.

759
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,038
I'm by your side.

760
00:58:58,409 --> 00:58:59,327
Who are you?

761
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,496
What do you think I am, babe?

762
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:05,166
A dentist who lives at a residence?
Or a serial killer?

763
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,211
Call me immediately if anything happens.

764
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,963
Will you please leave me alone?

765
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,881
Haven't I told you before, babe?

766
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,467
Once I pick my target, I never lose them.

767
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,677
Are you all right, Jong-u?

768
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,513
If you want to kill him, do it.

769
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,391
That's who you really are.

770
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,185
Why did you meet with Ji-eun?

771
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,813
You need to move out.

772
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,649
