1
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:09,426
NO OUTSIDE VISITORS
ALLOWED IN THE RESIDENCE

2
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,587
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS

3
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,381
AND INCIDENTS APPEARING
IN THIS FILM ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,178
Tropical Storm Gini has arrived in Korea
as it advances north,

5
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,513
and a typhoon watch has been issued
all around the country.

6
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,433
Especially, Gyeonggi region
is experiencing heavy rain

7
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,477
of 30 to 40mm per hour

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,145
as well as strong wind,

9
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,356
which will cause
a considerable amount of damage.

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,277
Please take all precautionary measures
to reduce the damage from this storm.

11
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,529
I don't think anyone is here.

12
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,581
Why?

13
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,418
This was a novel I began to write
while I lived in this residence.

14
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,547
Yes.

15
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,510
Until the day I came to this place,

16
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,720
I always thought
the world I lived in was hell,

17
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,889
not this place.

18
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,148
However,

19
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,279
the real hell was this place.

20
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:58,201
A horrendous hell created by strangers.

21
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,495
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU

22
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,740
This place was hell.

23
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,162
A horrendous hell created by strangers.

24
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,254
How did I end up falling into this hell?

25
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,217
What did I ever do wrong?

26
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,247
-Goodness.
-I'm sorry.

27
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,263
Excuse me, sir. Sir!

28
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,348
Hey!

29
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,727
JI-EUN

30
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,066
-Hey, Ji-eun.
-Jong-u, did you arrive?

31
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,277
Why does he leave like that
even though I'm calling him out?

32
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,404
Man, the weather is awful.

33
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,491
Is something going on?
You don't sound too well.

34
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,620
What? No, it's nothing. Is it okay
for you to call? Aren't you at work?

35
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,373
-Oh, I'm working away from the office.
-You're out of the office?

36
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,710
I took on a new program,
so I'm meeting this reporter.

37
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,463
Right, that new TV show
you're in charge of?

38
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,550
Jong-u, I have to go now.
I'll call you later.

39
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,523
Seoul.

40
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,200
It's my laptop.

41
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,745
It's all shattered right here.

42
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,415
-That'll be 200,000 won.
-200,000 won?

43
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,168
-Yes.
-But the screen... It's just the screen.

44
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,836
-Hey, let's do this.
-Yes.

45
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,130
Just fix it for him at 180,000 won.

46
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,467
It's that expensive
to replace just the screen?

47
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,345
I'm practically giving it away to you.
Don't tell anyone else.

48
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,139
It costs over 300,000 won
at the official service center.

49
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,524
Then please do make sure you fix it well.

50
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,193
-Sure.
-Don't worry. I'll make it almost new.

51
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,486
Do make it look new, will you?

52
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,154
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

53
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,753
Excuse me, how much does it cost
to replace a laptop screen?

54
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,505
How big is it?

55
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,048
Mine's 15 inches.

56
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,885
It's 200,000 won,

57
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,763
but I'll do it for 150,000 won.

58
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,348
-For 150,000 won?
-Yes.

59
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,767
If you pay with cash,
I'll take off a little more.

60
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,316
Come and give it a try.
We're giving away prizes

61
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,528
no matter which mark you hit.

62
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,948
We're doing giveaways right now!

63
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,908
Come and give it a try.

64
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,287
We're giving away a laptop
for the first place winner!

65
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,958
Congratulations! You got fifth place.
Come and take your gift.

66
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,961
Congratulations!

67
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,677
May I try... Could I...

68
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,345
Of course, go ahead
and give it another try.

69
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,145
LUCKY DART GAME

70
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,129
I only won five last place gifts.

71
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,841
But still, it's pretty.

72
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,847
WUSANG RESIDENCE

73
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,771
It's that room in the end.

74
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,398
It's quiet and clean.

75
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,319
And it's very sunny, so you'll like it.
It's right here.

76
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,322
-How much do you charge?
-550,000 won.

77
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,534
Goodness.

78
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,287
ERASE NOTE

79
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,580
HUIMANG RESIDENCE

80
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,838
-How much is it?
-450,000 won.

81
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,174
ERASE NOTE

82
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,259
DANMI, SEONHWA, MANBOK

83
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,063
I'll give you 10 percent off
if you pay 3 months up front.

84
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,190
Then how much will it be?

85
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,359
270,000 won.

86
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,373
ERASE NOTE

87
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,457

91
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,934
Push your bags inside.

92
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,397
LOOKING FOR A ROOM?

93
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,783
MONTHLY RENT

94
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,707
190,000 WON

95
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,589
32 MINUTES, 15 STOPS, 1,450 WON

96
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,348
-Hello?
-Yes, this is Eden Residence.

97
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:44,018
I just saw... I called about the room
you're renting out. Is it still available?

98
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,436
Of course.

99
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,230
-Is your rent 190,000 won?
-Yes, it is.

100
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,607
Then I'll stop by in a little bit.

101
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,817
-Sure, see you soon.
-Yes.

102
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,889
EDEN RESIDENCE

103
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,351
How am I going to live
in a place like this?

104
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,020
This really isn't right.

105
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,259
EDEN RESIDENCE

106
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,846
LAND, FACTORY, STORAGE FOR SALE OR RENT
GORAE REAL ESTATE

107
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,132
-Are you the young man who just called?
-Yes.

108
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,676
Goodness, it must've been tough
to walk up in this hot weather.

109
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,969
I'm sorry I'm late.

110
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,848
Don't mention it. It's pretty desolate,
so first-time visitors all get confused.

111
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,433
Here, have this.

112
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,020
You had a great voice on the phone,
and you look handsome too.

113
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,772
-I...
-Look at how sweaty you are.

114
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,651
I saw that men's rooms and women's rooms
are separated here as I walked up.

115
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,236
You must have a lot of rooms.

116
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,904
No, that was ages ago.

117
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,491
Everyone left when the area was designated
for redevelopment, so only a few remains.

118
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,951
When will the redevelopment happen?

119
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,662
I heard they'll begin in six months.

120
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,163
Why? Are you here for the long haul?

121
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,873
No, I'll leave soon.

122
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,167
That's great news, then.

123
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,087
The rent only went down
because we're getting redeveloped.

124
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,214
We have a great facility here.

125
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,759
I'm always concerned about the health
of our residents... Gosh, that's room 302.

126
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,721
I think of our residents' health,
so I give out eggs for free

127
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,808
and make kimchi myself too.
See if this is for room 303.

128
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,017
-Is it?
-Yes, it is.

129
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,602
Why can't I see this?

130
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,021
I'm sure you shopped around.

131
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,148
You won't find a place like this.

132
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,401
Here. Take a look.

133
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,158
Goodness, there's garbage.

134
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,287
You won't find a place like this
with that price in Seoul.

135
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,831
You said you're leaving soon anyway.

136
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,167
Yes, I'll leave soon, but...

137
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:41,505
Even if this area will be redeveloped,
how can it be so cheap?

138
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,343
Goodness. My gosh.

139
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,555
I'm a deaconess at church,
so I really can't lie.

140
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,640
I'll be frank.

141
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,435
Someone who lived here before you
committed suicide.

142
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:55,769
What?

143
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,314
No, it didn't happen in this room.

144
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,026
Gosh, I don't want to do my business
by fooling others,

145
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,194
so that's why I'm telling you.

146
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,032
Are you not from Seoul?

147
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,783
I came from another town.

148
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,453
-I see. Are you a college student?
-No, I work.

149
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:16,624
Really? You looked so young
that I thought you were in college.

150
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,250
-I...
-What's with you?

151
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,586
Stop blocking my way in this hot weather.

152
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,671
Mr. An, why are you like that again?

153
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,966
Turn on the air conditioner already.
I'm going to die from this heat.

154
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:31,722
I mean, he could just slide by.
Why is he getting so angry?

155
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:35,726
Goodness, that thug or something
is really getting on my nerves.

156
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,104
-Young man, don't worry.
-Okay.

157
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,398
He'll be gone soon.

158
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,234
He'll be leaving.

159
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,321
Come this way.
I'll make some iced coffee for you.

160
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,531
You can give it a thought
while you drink that.

161
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,888
Everyone else is nice other than that guy.

162
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,057
I see.

163
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,645
Here, have some.

164
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,315
So? Did you make your decision?

165
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,534
Okay. What? Yes, right here.

166
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:37,871
Yes, right here. Okay. Okay, good.
You made a good choice.

167
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,958
Okay, then. Take this.

168
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,878
You can go to that room you saw, room 303.

169
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,465
This is a spare key, so don't lose it.

170
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,550
Yes.

171
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,678
Make yourself at home and relax.

172
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,890
And you share the restroom
and the shower with everyone.

173
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,435
-It might be troublesome, but just use it.
-Okay.

174
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,230
-Everyone here ended up doing well.
-Okay.

175
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,898
Do have a good life here.

176
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,150
Nice to meet you.

177
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,527
Don't mention it. Nice to meet you too.

178
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,282
Goodness, that's noisy.

179
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,513
Hello.

180
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,192
Do you have something to say?

181
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,209
That... That isn't your room.

182
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,838
Your room is... right here.

183
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,965
Do you live here?

184
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,468
I'll be living here starting today.

185
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,243
The bed is creaking.

186
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,580
It's moldy, and it smells like... Gosh.

187
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,376
And I get barely any sunlight in here.

188
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,848
Okay, I'll stay here for just six months

189
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,975
until I save up enough for key money.

190
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,396
I won't find another place like this
at this price.

191
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,324
Yes, Mom.

192
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,492
Jong-u, did you arrive well?

193
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,077
Yes, I got here well.

194
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,205
How's your friend's place?
Is it all right?

195
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,623
It's fine.

196
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,875
Be good to your friend.

197
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,211
Okay. Don't mind me.

198
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,173
-One second. Who is it?
-Oh, okay. You must be busy.

199
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,549
Open the door.

200
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,802
-Mom, I'll call you later.
-Okay. Make sure you eat well.

201
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,095
Okay, bye. Bye.

202
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,104
-Yes?
-There are rules to communal living.

203
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,439
Pardon?

204
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,650
If you're going to make a call,
do it outside.

205
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,945
Wait, I... I just... Did that sound...

206
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,279
Didn't you just make a call?

207
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,948
You just heard me?

208
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,575
Right, I'm sorry.

209
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,911
Don't let me catch you again.

210
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,421
What's with him?

211
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,681
That kid keeps getting on my nerves.

212
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,695
You crazy idiot!

213
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,755
Hey, Ji-eun.

214
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,674
Hey, Jong-u. Did you find a residence?

215
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,134
Yes, I did.

216
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,594
I see. Where is it?

217
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,138
-Eunhyeon-gu.
-Eunhyeon-gu?

218
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,391
Isn't that too far from Daehak-ro?

219
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,395
It's okay. It's not that far.
It only takes about half an hour.

220
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,106
And it's pretty close
to where you live too.

221
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,943
Okay, then. I'm glad if you're glad.

222
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,280
When do you get off work today?

223
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,866
-If it's okay, I'll be there after--
- Room 303 guy?

224
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,202
Goodness, sorry, keep talking.

225
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:55,082
I'm sorry, Jong-u.
I wanted to see you today too.

226
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,960
But it's my boss's birthday,
so we're having a company dinner.

227
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,420
I see.

228
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,673
You have to move in today,
and tomorrow is your first day at work.

229
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,219
You should get some rest today,
and we can meet tomorrow. Is that okay?

230
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:11,765
Sure, I'll be in Seoul from now on,
so we can meet more often from now on.

231
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,726
Okay, bye.

232
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,899
Handsome young man, are you here
to take a tour of the rooftop?

233
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,150
Yes.

234
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,319
Don't you like it?

235
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,238
Sure.

236
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:31,034
Goodness, right.
I forgot to mention this before.

237
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,078
There are women's rooms
on the fourth floor,

238
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,038
but no one lives there anymore.

239
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,415
I had to renovate this place
because of a fire,

240
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,252
but the economy is pretty bad,
so I can't even take out a loan.

241
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,630
So don't go in there. You'll get hurt.

242
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,798
Okay.

243
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,367
"A man

244
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,871
with an odd gait is

245
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,083
walking down

246
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:06,463
an alley.

247
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,633
In the black plastic bag

248
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,510
he's holding

249
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,305
in his hand"...

250
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,252
Hey, kitty. Hi.

251
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,713
You're so pretty.

252
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,361
Mr. Byun,
you must be feeling great today.

253
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,949
Well, I... I just...

254
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,829
You must feel great today too.

255
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,498
You need to be quiet at night.

256
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,875
It's troublesome for others.

257
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:35,719
Okay. I... I'll be... I'll be quiet.

258
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,096
As... As if I'm dead.

259
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,067
That... That looks good. Coffee.

260
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,277
Sure.

261
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,407
FAITH CHURCH

262
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,216
-What's that?
-Hello.

263
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,094
Goodness, give this to me. This is...

264
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,432
Young man, have you been
fooling around somewhere?

265
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,059
I was just adoring it.

266
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,978
Goodness, you're going to kill them all.
You'll kill them all.

267
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,484
My goodness, he'll end up hurting himself.

268
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,362
I won't take that from you.

269
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,553
Why... Why are you hesitating?

270
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,516
Just... Just cut that thing off.

271
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,666
Hey, that's unfair.

272
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,606
Hey, sir.

273
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,445
Do you know what's good about
a residence like this?

274
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:03,700
It's that even if someone dies here,

275
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,577
absolutely no one

276
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,456
will care about that.

277
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:21,134
Babe, wake up.

278
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,175
Hey, Jae-ho.

279
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:06,012
Where are you? You should've called me
as soon as you got to Seoul.

280
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,765
Right, I'm sorry.
I've been looking for a room.

281
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,268
Right, I see. Did you find a place?

282
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,103
Yes, I found a residence in Eunhyeon-gu.

283
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,980
Why are you whispering?

284
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,566
This place isn't soundproof at all.

285
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,069
Come out. Let's grab some beer.

286
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,403
Where should I meet you?

287
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,532
It's a place in Daehak-ro...
I'll text you the address.

288
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,950
Okay, text me.

289
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,580
Darn it.

290
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,916
Man.

291
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,222
EDEN RESIDENCE
4TH FLOOR, WOMEN ONLY

292
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,617
My gosh, hey.

293
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,704
What are you doing? Hey.

294
00:31:55,955 --> 00:32:00,084
Hey. There was a fire here,
so no one lives here anymore.

295
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,004
I mean, you can't shoot me with this.

296
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,506
Don't you know that it's dangerous?

297
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,594
Hey, and

298
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:13,932
I came up because I heard something
from up here. By any chance...

299
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,143
Did you hear the sound of a ghost?

300
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,229
Goodness, that's frightening.

301
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,310
Jeong-hwa, isn't it hot?

302
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,437
Let's just call a tow truck.

303
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,565
Mr. Park, start the car. Hurry. Hurry up.

304
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,567
-We can just call--
-Come on, Mr. Park.

305
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,027
You must be really hot.

306
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,572
Good.

307
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,827
Let's go.

308
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,499
Jeong-hwa, the engineering major.

309
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,084
No, the goddess of engineering.

310
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,169
-Let's go.
-Let's hurry. Let's go.

311
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,094
Hello. We received a report.

312
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,512
Why are you so late?

313
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:38,057
I'm sorry. Our car broke down
on the way. Where is it?

314
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,226
It's that black plastic bag.

315
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:44,397
I kept smelling something weird
and came out to find that. Gosh.

316
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,175
-It's that again?
-Yes, it's a cat.

317
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,593
-A dead cat?
-Yes.

318
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,803
It's the tenth time this month.

319
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,847
Man, who's doing this?

320
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:24,103
See? There's no security camera here.
This person knows their way around here.

321
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,271
That's a possibility.

322
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,607
Yes, so please put one up.

323
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,068
I can't live with this anxiety.

324
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,737
You shouldn't be asking us.

325
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,697
File a civil complaint
with the district office.

326
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,533
And call the cleaning department of
the district office to take care of this.

327
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,411
Officer. Is that something
a police officer should say?

328
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,331
-I mean, it's--
-We'll contact the district office

329
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,709
and take care of this,
so don't worry and go home.

330
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,337
Please get rid of it now.
It gives me the creeps.

331
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,505
Goodbye.

332
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,807
Are we some kind of cat morticians?

333
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,437
Mr. Park, wasn't it like this
three months ago

334
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,856
during the pension murder case?

335
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,983
-Back then? Like what?
-Yes.

336
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:15,154
The cats around there began to die off,
then someone got murdered.

337
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,908
Man, people like that should be destroyed.

338
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,326
They're the problem.

339
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,580
Hey, go to a dentist
and pull out that tooth.

340
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,624
A lot of places are open late nowadays.

341
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,627
I don't have to go to a dentist over this.

342
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,838
-Man.
-You should probably go see a dentist.

343
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,340
No, that's not what's important.

344
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,261
Do you know the Kang Chi-sun case?

345
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:41,055
Did you know
that he killed and ate his pet dog?

346
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,723
Psychopaths...

347
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,518
Psychopaths are unable to keep a pet

348
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,854
-because they can't sympathize.
-Darn it. You're too persistent.

349
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,897
And most serial murderers...

350
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,774
And most serial murderers

351
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,944
have abused animals before
according to research.

352
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:58,030
That's why we're at a point
where we must investigate this case.

353
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,616
-You need to see how this is weird.
-Okay.

354
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,161
I mean, think about
that pension murder case.

355
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,371
Those cats began to die off first.

356
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,123
Was the culprit practicing or what?

357
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,749
Jeong-hwa, go see a dentist first--

358
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,043
No, I'm not going. I'm not.

359
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,378
That's not what is important now.

360
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:18,092
Our night hours are over,
but the director is doing it just for you.

361
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,805
Aren't you open until 10:00 p.m.?

362
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,516
Only on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

363
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,061
-Officer So Jeong-hwa?
-Yes.

364
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,981
I just got a call from Corporal Park.

365
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,483
-From Mr. Park?
-Yes.

366
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,235
I'll get her. You two can go home.

367
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,904
-It's all right.
-Really?

368
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,530
Yes, you're dismissed.

369
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,325
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

370
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,912
All right, let's see.

371
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:57,506
Goodness, your cavity looks bad.
You'll need nerve treatment.

372
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,760
Does... Does that hurt a lot?

373
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,180
I guess police officers are scared
of dentists too.

374
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,183
Goodness, no.

375
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,102
Right, so does it hurt?

376
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,064
-I'll make sure it doesn't.
-Okay.

377
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,523
I'll anesthetize you first.

378
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:19,278
-Doctor, can... Can you do it slowly?
-Sure.

379
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,571
Open your mouth.

380
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,411
SAEMTEO DENTAL CLINIC,
EUNHYE PATROL DIVISION

381
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,541
Take these precautions,
and this is your prescription.

382
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,378
So? It didn't hurt at all, did it?

383
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,297
No, oddly.

384
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,884
But you have to return next week
to receive your nerve treatment.

385
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,804
Can you come at 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday?

386
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,306
Yes, I can make that.

387
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,891
-I'll make your reservation.
-Okay.

388
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,145
Anyway, you must be close
to Corporal Park.

389
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,148
We met while volunteering.

390
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,653
I'm sorry you couldn't go home
because of me. Thank you.

391
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,531
Goodness, you do harder work than me.
I should be grateful for you.

392
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:08,077
-Please excuse me, then.
-Sure, bye. Goodbye.

393
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,420
Hey, I'm having a tough time

394
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,672
running my business on a loan too.

395
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,841
No one runs a business
with their own money.

396
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:26,053
How much can you borrow? That's important.
Anyway, congrats on coming to Seoul.

397
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,181
It's all thanks to you.

398
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,392
Bottoms up.
Let's drink until we drop dead.

399
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,898
Do you still write and stuff?

400
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,608
Yes.

401
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,655
Goodness, man. You haven't given up yet?

402
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,283
Goodness. Anyway, what's your next story?

403
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,660
I'm writing a crime series.

404
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,581
You have such a pretty face,

405
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,000
but your head is filled
with stuff like that.

406
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,587
You really are something.
What have you done in Seoul?

407
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,299
I looked for a room, then I--

408
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,842
Why don't you live with Ji-eun?

409
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,887
It'll be great to live with her.
You can kiss her and stuff.

410
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,350
It has been forever since I met her.
Let's call her.

411
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,019
She's having a company dinner
for her boss's birthday.

412
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,687
-Birthday?
-Yes.

413
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,857
Who cares if it's her boss's birthday?
Is she forced to be there?

414
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,234
This is why people say
the Korean office culture is so ancient.

415
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:25,112
Hey, that never happens at our company.

416
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,323
We're completely free-spirited.
You'll love that for sure.

417
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,243
You've always been free-spirited.

418
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,288
That's true. How's your residence?

419
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,085
It's unbelievably tiny.
And it's not soundproof at all.

420
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,087
And we share the restroom.

421
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,424
I heard some residences these days
have restrooms in the room.

422
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,469
Places like that are too expensive.
How can I rent a place like that?

423
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,139
Is it? Hold out for a little while.

424
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,642
I'll give you a full-time job
after your internship ends.

425
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,231
Anyway, you seem pretty amazing now.
You became a CEO.

426
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,608
Come on. It's nothing.

427
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,152
But you're already a CEO of a company.

428
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,071
I'm just making money.

429
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:11,534
Anyway, let's say
Ji-eun wants to marry you.

430
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:15,079
But if you don't have enough money and
can't marry her, she'll break up with you.

431
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,872
That happens often around...

432
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,629
You just frowned.
And you frowned before too.

433
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:24,880
No, I didn't.

434
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,345
It's because
you keep bringing up weird stories.

435
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,141
Weird stories?

436
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:36,892
No.

437
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:41,897
Not at all.

438
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:48,404
My gosh, man.
You're still that feisty kid.

439
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,783
Let's go grab a smoke.
Were you just scared?

440
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,618
I think you were.

441
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:04,837
Do you think I'm your friend?
How dare you speak like that to me?

442
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,714
-You jerk.
-I didn't say that.

443
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,717
Do you have a lighter?

444
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,260
I don't smoke anymore.

445
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,054
-Really?
-No.

446
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,849
You're very determined.

447
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:22,354
Hey, Jong-u. You need to work really hard.

448
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,690
You know that young people now
can't find jobs, right?

449
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,569
People that have amazing backgrounds
asked me for a job,

450
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:32,239
-but I chose you.
-Thank you.

451
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,866
-Do a good job.
-Of course.

452
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,369
I adore you so much, don't I?

453
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:40,664
I told all my employees
that you're very skillful, so do well.

454
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,709
-I'll do my best.
-And stop frowning.

455
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,503
Okay.

456
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,259
Why is he showing off so much? Damn it.

457
00:41:56,263 --> 00:42:00,059
What's with you? Hey. You.

458
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,900
He might end up killing him.

459
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,778
Jae-ho, isn't that too much?
We should probably stop them.

460
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,365
Let them be. It's best to stay away
from other people's problems these days.

461
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,993
I saw them smoking, so I asked if I can
borrow the lighter, but they said no.

462
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,912
I should probably make a report.

463
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:24,124
Fine, jerks. Stop meddling with them
and stay still, will you?

464
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,336
If you get into their fight,
they might end up blaming you later.

465
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,879
Let's go.

466
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,120
Jong-u, what are you looking at?

467
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,871
Stop it!

468
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:08,877
Hey, stop. Stop it, jerk!

469
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,671
-Hey!
-I said, stop it!

470
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,426
Stop it! Stop! Stop it!

471
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,769
Here. Are you okay?

472
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,229
Thank you.

473
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:32,359
Man, you look like a young gentleman,

474
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:36,572
but you really are something. Aren't you?

475
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,950
Hey, round two is on me too. Let's go.

476
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,368
Jae-ho.

477
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,496
Please excuse me today.

478
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:48,584
What are you talking about?
I emptied my schedule tonight for you.

479
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:52,338
Hey! Yoon Jong-u!

480
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,049
I'll buy you a drink next time.

481
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,135
I get it, so come here. Yoon Jong-u!

482
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:04,808
Come here.

483
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,271
I said, come.

484
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:15,819
Taxi!

485
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,366
Use this for the ride.

486
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,911
-I'll take the bus.
-Just get in.

487
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,455
Be at work on time tomorrow.

488
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:31,293
Here. Darn you. Here. Be there on time.

489
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,096
Goodness, some drunkards
got into a fight again.

490
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:48,227
Do you know the theory that humans are
innately evil? I think that's right.

491
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,729
Look at how cruel babies are.

492
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:55,109
They rip apart bugs and kill them
with an innocent smile on their face.

493
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,236
There's this saying, you know.

494
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,988
"Strangers are from hell."

495
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,865
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

496
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,786
I'm sorry, but I'm kind of tired.

497
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,997
Goodness, you're too young to be tired.

498
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:23,720
EDEN RESIDENCE

499
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,207
What are you doing?

500
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,173
How do you feel?

501
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:01,383
About what?

502
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:06,597
When you stand here like that,
doesn't it feel like

503
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:10,809
you're in a long tunnel
that you'll never escape?

504
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,936
What on earth is he suddenly saying?

505
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,063
I think I'll be able to escape.

506
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,443
You're funnier than you look.

507
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:22,446
Is he picking a fight or what?

508
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,037
Do you want to borrow my toothpaste?

509
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,415
He's not stuttering.

510
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,708
Oh, okay.

511
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,385
Let me borrow your shampoo too.

512
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,803
-Hey, are you making  ramyeon ?
-Yes.

513
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,056
Make some for me too.

514
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,393
You'd better be careful.

515
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,730
Did you know
that room 313 was here just now?

516
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,148
Room 313?

517
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,234
Yes, he stood here
watching you draw water just now.

518
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,402
What?

519
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,077
Room 313, that pervert.

520
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,871
-Are you going to add the eggs?
-Yes.

521
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:21,333
-You should never do that.
-Why not?

522
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,668
Try breaking one, then.

523
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:37,265
The owner lady brings
some rotten eggs from somewhere

524
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,684
just to show off to us.

525
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,485
How many are you having?

526
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,279
Cook just five packets.

527
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,875
-How old are you?
-I'm 26.

528
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:07,254
You're much younger than me.
Bring some kimchi.

529
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,429
People say you should suffer
when you're younger, but that's a lie.

530
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:20,434
If you get stuck in a loony bin like this,

531
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,686
even normal people will go insane.

532
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,646
Everyone who lives here is insane.

533
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,316
I'm leaving next week.

534
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,112
I'm going back to my hometown
to run a fishing hole or something.

535
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,700
What am I saying to a kid like you?

536
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,957
Hey, kid. Be careful of the guy next door.

537
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,795
You seem like a baby brother,
so let me warn you.

538
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:53,884
Do not get friendly with the people here.
Get out of here as soon as possible.

539
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,553
Did you see those people's eyes?

540
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,222
You never know
what guys like them will end up doing.

541
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,274
Hey. You're good at cooking  ramyeon .

542
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,147
You... You must have had some  ramyeon .

543
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,859
Why... Why are you so shocked?

544
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,861
Gosh. Let me get some sleep!

545
00:51:57,072 --> 00:52:01,201
Hey, room 306.
Stop going around making weird sounds.

546
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,119
I... I'm sorry.

547
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,971
Did you see those people's eyes?

548
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,723
You never know
what guys like them will end up doing.

549
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:29,104
At that moment, I ended up taking out

550
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,981
all the stress from my day on him.

551
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:32,399
What are you looking at?

552
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,239
I shouldn't have done that.

553
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,200
I said, what are you looking at?

554
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:48,790
Man, what a shithead.

555
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,996
Should I kill him or not?

556
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:14,042
Should I kill him or not?

557
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:18,546
Should I kill him or not?

558
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:23,760
Should I kill him or not?

559
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:28,473
Should I kill him or not?

560
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:33,436
Should I kill him or not?

561
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:38,191
Should I kill him or not?

562
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:43,279
Should I kill him or not?

563
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,711
Do you want me to kill you already?

564
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,007
Okay. How do you want me to kill you?

565
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:06,344
Babe, tell me.

566
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:48,863
Where are you going?
Come here, you jerk. I said, come.

567
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:53,034
Come here. Come. Come!

568
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:55,495
-Ouch!
-What did you mess with in my room?

569
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:59,582
-Why did you get in here? Why?
-I... I didn't...

570
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:02,418
-Show me your hand. Show me.
-It wasn't me.

571
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:05,880
Show me. Stand up straight.
What did you take from my room?

572
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,090
Why did you come into my room?

573
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,509
I... I didn't. I really didn't do it.

574
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:13,638
What did you take? Hey. What was it?

575
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:16,224
I seriously didn't do it!

576
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,393
Of course, you did.

577
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,981
What are you going to do if it wasn't me?
Do you want to bet your hand?

578
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:50,216
Is... Is something funny going on,
Deuk-su?

579
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,929
Are you two trying to tease me?

580
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,807
What? They were twins?

581
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:02,437
You need to give me your hand now, right?

582
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,856
Then you'll give me your leg.

583
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,233
-Damn it. Move aside. I said, move aside.
-Sir, calm down.

584
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,860
Move aside before I beat you up.

585
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:10,987
What's going on?

586
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,035
Calm down.

587
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,912
Who do you think you are?

588
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,456
We're all neighbors here, aren't we?

589
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,708
It's because he keeps on coming
into my room!

590
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,668
Did you see him go into your room?

591
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:28,129
Mr. Byun, did you go into his room?

592
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,923
Are you all joking around as a group?

593
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:34,177
Why would I go in there?
I have my own room!

594
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,553
You little jerk.

595
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:59,536
Calm down. We have a new guy here too.

596
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,331
They already knew

597
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:21,266
that this place was hell.

598
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,549
I heard things got rowdy last night.

599
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:58,428
That gangster guy just told me
he'll be leaving.

600
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:01,431
There are only
good young men here now, right?

601
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,641
I'm Yoon Jong-u,
and it's my first day here.

602
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,060
-Did you greet him?
-I met him just now.

603
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,354
It must belong to the person
who lived here before.

604
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,689
Are you sure you're all right?

605
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,984
You ended up giving me too much to do.

606
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:14,736
I'll be busy.

607
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,530
I'm going straight home after work today.

608
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,408
I want to see you.

609
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:25,580
