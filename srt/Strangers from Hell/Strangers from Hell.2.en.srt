4
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,691
Do you want me to kill you already?

5
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:11,029
Okay. How do you want me to kill you?

6
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,241
Babe, tell me.

7
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:24,292
Where are you going?
Come here, you jerk. I said, come.

8
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:28,421
Come here. Come. Come!

9
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,174
-Ouch!
-What did you mess with in my room?

10
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:35,053
-Why did you get in here? Why?
-I... I didn't...

11
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,181
-Show me your hand. Show me.
-It wasn't me.

12
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,518
Show me. Stand up straight.
What did you take from my room?

13
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,727
Why did you come into my room?

14
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,063
I... I didn't. I really didn't do it.

15
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:49,192
What did you take? Hey. What was it?

16
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,778
I seriously didn't do it!

17
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,905
Of course, you did.

18
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,493
What are you going to do if it wasn't me?
Do you want to bet your hand?

19
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,520
Is... Is something funny going on,
Deuk-su?

20
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,650
Are you two trying to tease me?

21
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,111
What? They were twins?

22
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:37,782
You need to give me your hand now, right?

23
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,368
Then you'll give me your leg.

24
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,787
-Damn it. Move aside. I said, move aside.
-Sir, calm down.

25
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,372
Move aside before I beat you up.

26
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,374
What's going on?

27
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,505
Calm down.

28
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,382
Who do you think you are?

29
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,010
We're all neighbors here, aren't we?

30
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,220
It's because he keeps on coming
into my room!

31
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,222
Did you see him go into your room?

32
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,725
Mr. Byun, did you go into his room?

33
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,560
Are you all joking around as a group?

34
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:09,647
Why would I go in there?
I have my own room!

35
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,815
You little jerk.

36
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,679
Calm down. We have a new guy here too.

37
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,144
You should apologize.

38
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,439
People get the wrong idea
because you keep laughing like that.

39
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,733
You shouldn't cause trouble for others.

40
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:58,154
Yes... Yes. I'm sorry, sir.

41
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,159
Will you accept his apology?

42
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,625
I know you're all in the same crowd.

43
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,460
What crowd?

44
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,759
Go back inside. You can't do this
just because you lived here for long.

45
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,273
It's not always like this around here.
You must be shocked.

46
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,899
Oh, it's okay.

47
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,693
Are you sure you're all right?

48
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:41,281
Yes. I have to be at work tomorrow,
so please excuse me.

49
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,491
-I see. So you work.
-Yes.

50
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,535
You looked so young
that I thought you were a student.

51
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,745
Goodbye.

52
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,808
Should I just cut it off?

53
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,539
Young man.

54
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,917
Goodness, why are you so shocked?

55
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,091
You're too young to be that surprised.
Maybe you have a weak spirit.

56
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,675
Is there something you need to say?

57
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,513
I heard things got rowdy last night.
I'm sorry about that.

58
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,057
We're usually dead silent though.

59
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,143
It can happen when a lot of people
live together. It's fine with me.

60
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,229
-Thanks for being so considerate.
-Sure.

61
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,148
But that gangster guy

62
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,983
just told me he'll be leaving.

63
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,610
So don't worry about it.

64
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,070
Oh, I see.

65
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,198
I mean, to be frank,
he was really scary, wasn't he?

66
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,242
When I'm sitting in my office,

67
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,161
he'd look at me with these evil eyes.

68
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,704
-It just felt so--
-Well, I...

69
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,082
I'm sorry, but I have to get to work.
Please excuse me.

70
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,959
Sure. Go now.

71
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,252
Young man.

72
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,257
There are only good young men
left here now, right?

73
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,820
-You must be going to work.
-Goodness.

74
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,032
-Are you going to work?
-Yes.

75
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,410
Where do you work?

76
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,830
At the Daehak-ro area.

77
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,874
That's pretty far.

78
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,125
Yes.

79
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,045
Hey, isn't it hot?

80
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,052
What's with him?
He's just giving me that creepy smile.

81
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,305
Have a great day at work.

82
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,224
Sure.

83
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,611
CAT KILLING SPREE

84
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,408
6TH DEAD CAT, 13TH DEAD CAT
2ND DEAD CAT

85
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,917
"Eunhye-dong cat killing spree"?

86
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,335
Yes.

87
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,961
If you get concerned
over every little thing,

88
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,713
you won't be able
to deal with your job later.

89
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,466
Yes, I just get easily worried.

90
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,219
-We still shouldn't let it slide easily.
-What's she saying?

91
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,929
Then let it slide with difficulty.

92
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,685
A total of 13 cats died over just a month,
and they died brutally.

93
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,313
-Where are you going?
-To the scene.

94
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,816
What scene? Are you going
to the place where those cats died?

95
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,859
Yes.

96
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,569
I knew you'd do that.

97
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:53,533
Officer Cho, you know that Jeong-hwa is
the busiest one in our division, right?

98
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,825
And for no reason.

99
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,036
-Jeong-hwa, should I come with you?
-No, it's fine.

100
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,788
It's way too hot today. Don't go out.

101
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,832
Forget it and let's have some cup  ramyeon .
Bring it with hot water in it.

102
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,504
Su-bok, you make it yourself.
That's going on a power trip.

103
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,172
-We're eating it together.
-I'll be back.

104
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,009
-We are?
-Forget it if not.

105
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,888
POLICE

106
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,236
203-3 YEONJI-DONG, HYEHWA-GU, SEOUL

107
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,533
This is it.

108
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,756
What is it?

109
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,758
I'm starting my internship today.

110
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,427
-Internship?
-Yes.

111
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,638
-I haven't heard anything.
-Really?

112
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,879
Mr. Shin Jae-ho?

113
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,924
Excuse me, there's a delivery...
I'll have it.

114
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,681
His rudeness is pretty offensive.

115
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,651
-Excuse me, who are you?
-Good morning.

116
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,943
-Jae-ho, you're here.
-Hello.

117
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,696
He must be new. New and fresh.

118
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,449
Hey, man. Call me Mr. Shin at work.

119
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,536
Everyone, say hello to him.

120
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,122
This is Mr. Yoon Jong-u,
my junior from school I told you about.

121
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,248
Oh, your junior.

122
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,753
I'm Yoon Jong-u, and
it's my first day here. Nice to meet you.

123
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,963
Nice to meet you.
I'm Ko Sang-man, a manager.

124
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,341
-Hello.
-I'm Son Yu-jeong, a designer.

125
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,386
Mr. Park Byeong-min, Did you greet him?

126
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,221
I met him just now.

127
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,015
Byeong-min, do look after this guy.

128
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,643
He's a smart guy, so he'll be
pretty useful after a bit of training.

129
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,603
You can sit by Mr. Park.

130
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,314
Let's have our weekly meeting
in ten minutes.

131
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,316
-Yes.
-Jong-u.

132
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,243
Damn it, it didn't get charged again. Man.

133
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:49,083
Jae-ho, that guy seems pretty weird.

134
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,544
-Who? Helmet?
-Helmet?

135
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,505
-He has a huge head.
-Yes, you're right.

136
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,132
But he's good at his job.

137
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,677
If you humor him, he'll treat you well.
So try to be cute.

138
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,679
You're a type who can easily get on

139
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,265
-your seniors' good side.
-Okay.

140
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,935
Hey, your life in college or the army
aren't truly the start of your adulthood.

141
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,521
It's right here. Your work.

142
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,897
-Hold yourself back and work...
-Yes.

143
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,274
-...even if you get annoyed.
-Okay.

144
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,317
You can't make living
by picking up dimes on the ground.

145
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,280
Okay, Jae-ho. Oh, right. I mean, Mr. Shin.

146
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,824
-Just call me Jae-ho when we're alone.
-Okay.

147
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,492
Wait here. I'm going to the restroom.

148
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,245
-What's that?
-What?

149
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,497
It looks like someone spit on you.

150
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,335
Gosh. Man, it was that guy.

151
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,546
-What? Who did it?
-Man.

152
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,927
This guy I met in front of my residence.

153
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,430
Man, what is this?

154
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,807
There are a lot of weird guys. Goodness.

155
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,395
Do you remember those guys who went to
the emergency room in front of that bar?

156
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,273
They were strangers, drinking separately,
and they got into a fight saying,

157
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,860
"What are you looking at?"
"No, what are you looking at?"

158
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,155
Isn't that absurd? He would've died there
if it wasn't for you.

159
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,949
That guy who spat on you is probably...
You know.

160
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,746
He probably can't control his anger.
You just need to ignore guys like that.

161
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,415
You also lose your temper at times,
so be careful.

162
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,459
And don't frown when I'm around.

163
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,548
What are you looking at?

164
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,385
Man, what a shithead.

165
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,158
What was that?

166
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,119
My knife.

167
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,645
Let go of me. Let go.

168
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,564
It's your turn, sir.

169
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,083
Damn it.

170
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,973
EDEN RESIDENCE
4TH FLOOR, WOMEN ONLY

171
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,471
Let's see.

172
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,738
Hello?

173
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,617
-Are you the owner of car number 9688?
-Yes.

174
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,996
This is Officer So Jeong-hwa
from the Eunhye Patrol Division.

175
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,248
May I check your dashcam?

176
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,516
-That's Yuseon Stationery.
-Pardon?

177
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,060
It's across the bowling alley
at the intersection. You don't know?

178
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,229
Right, the intersection.

179
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,566
-I mean, do you see that intersection?
-Yes.

180
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,817
-The hair salon.
-Yes.

181
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,777
-Take a right there.
-A right.

182
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,946
Yes, then you keep going from there.

183
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:15,534
There are a lot of teenage students
with shaved heads during that hour.

184
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,415
-Yes, I see. May we fast forward?
-Sure.

185
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,753
-Wait, stop.
-Okay.

186
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,924
This guy. Does he come here often?

187
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,926
Oh, this guy?

188
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,013
He lives over there.
The redevelopment district.

189
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,099
The redevelopment district?

190
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,107
I heard almost everyone moved out.

191
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,401
What was that residence called again?

192
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:53,155
Was it Eaden? Eden? Something like that.

193
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,948
There's a place like that around here?

194
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,035
It's quite deserted, so even those
who live around here don't really know.

195
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,328
It's up there.

196
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,209
Eden Residence.

197
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,337
EDEN RESIDENCE

198
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,160
Excuse me.

199
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,374
-What brings a police officer here?
-Hello.

200
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,544
-You're sweating so much. It must be hot.
-No, it's all right.

201
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,838
-Enjoy the cool air.
-It's okay.

202
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,382
-Are you the landlord?
-Yes, why?

203
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,051
I wanted to ask you something.

204
00:18:56,135 --> 00:19:00,013
This man right here.
He lives here, doesn't he?

205
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,641
Yes, he lives in room 306.

206
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,184
So he lives here?

207
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,520
Yes, he does. He lives in this residence.

208
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,397
But why?

209
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,567
Well, I wanted to ask him something.

210
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,527
Goodness, again?

211
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:18,240
My gosh, I kept telling him to stop,
but I guess he did it again.

212
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,368
He's a nice guy,
but he's not in his right senses.

213
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,622
Room 306! Come on out!

214
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,499
There's a police officer lady here.

215
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,228
I told you, didn't I?

216
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,565
You'll be punished badly
if you do that to a poor animal.

217
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:57,112
No... No. I... I adored it.

218
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:10,417
I got one for you when I bought one.
It was cheap. And buy one get one free.

219
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,586
-I already have one, so it's okay.
-I see.

220
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,088
They're pretty.

221
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,927
But they'll look better on Jong-u.

222
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,471
Mr. Park, may I give them to him?

223
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,682
-Jong-u, you don't have slippers, do you?
-Yes?

224
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,685
-No, I don't. But...
-Try these on.

225
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,023
Come on, try them on.
It's okay. It's all right.

226
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,117
They look great on you.
You look so cute in them.

227
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:48,538
Yu-jeong. He has a girlfriend.
Don't flirt with him.

228
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,457
What did I do?

229
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,876
Gosh, Jong-u.
You're so popular. Good for you.

230
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,754
The unpopular guy is going out
for a meeting.

231
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,673
-See you later.
-See you.

232
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,056
Sir, if you keep killing those cats,

233
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,517
you may get up to 2 years in prison
or 20 million won of fine

234
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,561
for violating the Animal Protection Law.

235
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,982
Do you understand what I'm saying?

236
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,860
Sir, please stop playing around.

237
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,950
Sir, you can't shoot a gun
at a police station.

238
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:29,162
Sir, please don't play around.
You killed 13 of them. 13 cats.

239
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:33,083
You brutally killed 13 cats.

240
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,962
Don't you feel bad for them? Don't you?

241
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,427
I... I didn't kill 13 cats.

242
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,470
-What?
-Officer So?

243
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,348
I... I killed one.

244
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,354
Stop playing around and sit right there.

245
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,029
Corporal Park said there's no evidence
that he killed all of them.

246
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,822
Sir. Come here.

247
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,743
-According to the previous reports,
-Come here, sir.

248
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:12,414
the cats were mostly burnt or blackened.

249
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,957
Isn't this a bit different?

250
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,918
Exactly. I think that's why
we need to investigate this.

251
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,962
How are we going to investigate this?

252
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,214
Look at him. There's no talking to him.

253
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,884
-You can have one.
-Give him a fine and send him back.

254
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,135
Captain.

255
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,095
Aren't you going to do other duties?

256
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,057
Please don't shoot. Give me that gun.

257
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,600
-Sir!
-Guns...

258
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,478
If you do this again,

259
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,105
you'll be sent to prison. Okay?

260
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,944
I... I'm sorry, Officer.

261
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:48,200
Okay. Don't do that.
And you shouldn't shoot officers...

262
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,410
I mean, other people. Okay?

263
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,539
-I... I won't--
-Let him go.

264
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,083
Yes, sir.

265
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,919
You may go now, sir. Get up.

266
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,879
Come on.

267
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,842
Oh. Goodbye.

268
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,845
Goodbye.

269
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,140
Captain, I understand,
but you can't send him back like that.

270
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:16,436
I do feel bad for the cats, but...

271
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,940
How many complaints
have we been getting for dead cats?

272
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,651
It's honestly a lot. Isn't that so?

273
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,403
Whatever. I had one too many drinks
last night, so my stomach hurts.

274
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,910
-Hey... Hey, kitty. Kitty.
-You can take this.

275
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,204
Kitty. Kitty.

276
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,589
Thanks.

277
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,550
-Officer Cho.
-Yes, sir?

278
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,009
Put this up.

279
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,181
We have fingerprints on our database
to prevent missing cases,

280
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,350
so we can just look it up
if this person is registered.

281
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:59,479
That only goes for children
and old people with dementia.

282
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,773
Hey, let me see.

283
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,030
MISSING: KUMAIL, MALE, AGE 37
NATIONALITY: PAKISTAN

284
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,203
What? Mount Bong near Eunhye 1-dong?

285
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:20,542
Su-bok, isn't this near Eden Residence?

286
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,545
EDEN RESIDENCE

287
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,276
Man, I'll just cut open your throat.

288
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,905
But you bet your hand.

289
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,910
Are you scared?

290
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,999
Are you? You are, aren't you?
Are you scared?

291
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:13,386
Man, I would've cut you to death already
if it hadn't been for that guy.

292
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,067
I heard you were taken
to the police station.

293
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:32,739
They asked me questions at...
at the police station,

294
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,243
so I kept saying I didn't know anything.

295
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,870
Then they just told me to go.

296
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,791
Those stupid people had no idea.

297
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,710
I told you to be careful
so he wouldn't find out.

298
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:50,924
No... No one found out though.

299
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,887
I'm not talking about the police.
Don't let that guy catch you, idiot.

300
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,933
I... I understand.

301
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,769
Okay.

302
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,775
It has been an hour,
but they don't ask me to do anything.

303
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,362
Mr. Park. What should I do?

304
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,408
Mr. Park?

305
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:22,664
Yes, sir. this is Son Yu-jeong.
Have you had lunch yet?

306
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,710
-Did you check the last email?
-Mr. Park, do you need me to do anything?

307
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,670
There's nothing for you to do.

308
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,130
Nothing?

309
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,675
If you have nothing to do,
go make me some coffee.

310
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,968
Coffee? Okay.

311
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:51,609
That's what you mean, right?
Okay, I got it.

312
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,446
On that day? I can do that.

313
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,116
I'll give you a call after I check.

314
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,243
All right.

315
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,122
Mr. Park, your coffee.

316
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,834
Did you spit in this?

317
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,627
What? No way.

318
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,218
Take this.
That performance will be held next month.

319
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,304
Try to write up a press release.

320
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:23,767
You can look up on the internet
how to write... You know,

321
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,644
references, so you can use that.

322
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,271
Yes, sir.

323
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:34,152
Mr. Shin said you're smart.
Let's see how good you are.

324
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,653
Pardon?

325
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,788
WOMEN'S SLIPPERS

326
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,084
Women's slippers?

327
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,962
He likes her?

328
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,179
-Jong-u.
-Yes?

329
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,599
We'll forward our office number
to your number from now on.

330
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,434
-I see.
-We get a lot of calls after our hours.

331
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,352
Okay.

332
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,603
Then don't get flustered,

333
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,897
-just pick it up, and take care of it.
-Yes.

334
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,066
Ask Mr. Park if you have any questions.

335
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,109
Yes.

336
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,277
-Hey, Jong-u.
-Yes?

337
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,780
-Will you keep doing that?
-What?

338
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,659
I mean, you don't have to stand up
to listen like an elementary school kid.

339
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,702
-You can sit.
-Yes.

340
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,332
We got an elementary school kid.

341
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,128
Okay, look over here.

342
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:38,508
Take a toothbrush,
brush down and up, then top-down.

343
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,177
And then from inside to out.

344
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,390
You can start with your gum
and brush your teeth like this. Okay?

345
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,474
Okay.

346
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,769
You'll be in pain
if you don't brush your teeth well.

347
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,980
You have to keep your promise with me.

348
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,231
Okay.

349
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,527
He just has to manage his teeth well.
You don't have to worry.

350
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,696
Thank you so much, doctor.

351
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:04,075
He cries and makes a huge scene
if he goes to another dentist.

352
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,078
But he's so good
whenever he comes to see you.

353
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,957
He likes you a lot.
He says you're very cool.

354
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,212
I see.

355
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,091
Okay.

356
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,971
I want to see you.

357
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,808
I'm going straight home after work today.

358
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,895
Let's wrap up the day and go home.

359
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,774
Did you think I'd say that? Let's have
a company dinner. It's Jong-u's first day.

360
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,776
Something came up at home, so...

361
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,736
You thought I'd say that, right?

362
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,945
I'm all for it.

363
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,156
I actually have plans today, so--

364
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:47,786
Jong-u, you just say yes
and follow as a new guy.

365
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,163
-That's it.
-Yes, sir.

366
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,124
He said yes right away. So cute.

367
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:57,086
Yu-jeong, stop hitting on a guy
who has a girlfriend.

368
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,048
-Why not? You never know. Right, Mr. Ko?
-What's wrong with you?

369
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,259
You're way too confident. Let's go.

370
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,929
Good for you, Jong-u. You're so popular.

371
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,096
It's not like that.

372
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,642
I think his face turned red. He's so cute.

373
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,561
He's so full of himself.

374
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:22,821
Ji-eun. Write up the cue sheet
for the production presentation

375
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,949
of the new variety show
before you go home today.

376
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,828
-Yes. Wait, ma'am.
-Yes?

377
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,872
But Bo-min is in charge of that.

378
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,544
Do you think I asked you because
I didn't know? She took a sick day.

379
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,712
-Do that for me.
-But still...

380
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,633
We didn't divide up our duties
for nothing.

381
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,305
Ji-eun. I'm asking you for a favor

382
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,642
because you're the most trustworthy.
Don't you get it?

383
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,396
But Ji-eun, at times you...
How can I put this?

384
00:30:56,479 --> 00:31:00,316
You don't seem very friendly.
Don't you think so?

385
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,902
Yes, okay. I'm sorry.

386
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,906
And don't frown over something like that.
That makes both of us feel bad.

387
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,035
Come on, brighten up. Show me a smile.
We're all working hard, okay?

388
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,288
Send me the email. Bye.

389
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:32,432
JONG-U: I'M SORRY, JI-EUN. I DON'T THINK
WE CAN MEET TODAY. IT'S A COMPANY DINNER.

390
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,865
OKAY, KEEP IT UP

391
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,576
IS SOMETHING...

392
00:31:55,455 --> 00:32:01,419
I'LL CALL YOU ONCE WE'RE DONE

393
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,901
Exactly. Who knew
I'd be here working at an office?

394
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,614
Jong-u. I heard you used to write.

395
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,450
He's an awfully good writer.

396
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,911
We called him a genius author
in our department.

397
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,163
-Really?
-Of course!

398
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,375
Professors adored him so much
and said he will become

399
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,502
the new leader of Korean literature.

400
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:45,213
No, there are numbers of authors
who are leading Korean literature--

401
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,174
What do you mean? This world

402
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,802
just hasn't noticed
a genius artist like you.

403
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:54,055
Wait, you went to the finals
of the Spring Literary Contest--

404
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,432
-Hey, don't bring that up.
-Why did you fail again?

405
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,643
-Anyway, what was it called?
-Stop it. Mr. Shin.

406
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,562
Anyway, everyone! This genius

407
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,942
is sitting here doing his internship.
Do you know how heartbreaking this is?

408
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,986
He had such a tough time
writing his stuff.

409
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,906
For three years, in the club room...
Did you take time off because of tuition?

410
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,244
Anyway, he practically lived
at the club room for three years.

411
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,830
-He had a tough time like that.
-Really?

412
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,124
But he's now living at a residence again.
It breaks my heart.

413
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:25,503
Hey, Yoon Jong-u! Forget about literature.
Money is the best. Just quit, you idiot!

414
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,881
This field is completely rotten!
What art? That's complete nonsense.

415
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,467
You're just living off others' hard work.

416
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,970
I've had drinks with artists already.

417
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,730
Who do you think you are
to tell me to quit?

418
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:49,318
Just quit. Just quit, will you?
This field is completely rotten.

419
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,405
There's no need for you to do anything
with people like that.

420
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,906
-Hey. Hey, you.
-Stop it.

421
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,786
Do you think writing that will change
the world or what?

422
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,580
-Let's go for round two.
-Goodness.

423
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,583
Mr. Shin, we have to work tomorrow.
We don't need to drink more.

424
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:06,085
-Let's stop here.
-Don't come to work tomorrow, then.

425
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,755
-Why are you so drunk today?
-I'm not drunk!

426
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,632
-Goodbye, then.
-He must be happy to have you here.

427
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,552
-Goodbye.
-Okay. Let's go.

428
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,848
Do you want to grab
another drink together?

429
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,224
Okay, sure.

430
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,436
I'll get going.
I haven't had enough sleep.

431
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,063
-Really?
-Yes.

432
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,522
That's disappointing.

433
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,817
Then I'll just go home too.

434
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,361
-There's a cart bar over there.
-Jong-u, where do you live?

435
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,655
I live in Eunhyeon-gu.

436
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,699
That's exactly the opposite of my place.

437
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,786
It would've been great to share a taxi.
It wouldn't be boring.

438
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,579
-I'll get going. See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

439
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:49,128
Well, I'll get going too.

440
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,301
-Hey, intern.
-Yes?

441
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,971
Let me give you a piece of advice.

442
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,017
Stop showing off just because
you're friends with the CEO. Okay?

443
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,561
-What do you mean?
-Stop showing off, you jerk!

444
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,948
I need to hold back. Hold it back. Gosh!

445
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,109
CALLING
DETECTIVE CHA

446
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,039
-Hello?
-Detective, this is An Hui-jung.

447
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,165
An Hui-jung! Where are you?

448
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,709
-Some crazy guys are trying to kill me.
-Hey. Hey!

449
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,429
I told you to keep your eyes on him.

450
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,975
I'm sorry.

451
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,520
I was too hungry.

452
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,930
Why are you two fighting?

453
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,351
Have you had dinner?

454
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:17,438
I told the new young man
that only good people are left here now.

455
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,565
What is this?

456
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,650
If you're going to keep this up, move out!

457
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,277
I'm sorry, Ms. Um.

458
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,989
I can't believe you boys are
sitting around and fighting each other.

459
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,532
Go repent. Repent!

460
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,957
I... I will be careful too.

461
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,927
So Jeong-hwa, 9 p.m. Thank you.

462
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,139
-Officer So.
-Hello.

463
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,183
Your appointment isn't today.

464
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:57,186
Something suddenly came up,
so I had to change it last minute.

465
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,147
The doctor on the night shift today
won't hurt you as much as I did.

466
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,482
I hope your procedure goes well.

467
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:05,236
Oh, okay. Are you going on a date?

468
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,533
I'm meeting someone important.

469
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,619
I don't know who it is, but I'm jealous.

470
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,746
-See you later, then.
-Yes.

471
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,915
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

472
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:34,932
DENTAL CLINIC

473
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:57,997
It has only been a day,
but I don't want to go in there.

474
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,593
-You must be coming home now.
-Yes.

475
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,096
Have you had dinner?
Do you want me to fry you some eggs?

476
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,265
No, I had a company dinner.
It's all right.

477
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,478
I just boiled some eggs. Do you want one?

478
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,605
It tastes wonderful with a bit of salt.

479
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,273
My stomach is a little upset.

480
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,150
-Your stomach is upset?
-Yes.

481
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,735
Then I'll prick your finger for you.

482
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,904
-You'll feel better right after.
-It's not that bad.

483
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,238
-Please excuse me.
-Sure.

484
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,325
Let me know whenever.
I'll prick your finger right away.

485
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,495
Goodness, why does he have
an upset stomach?

486
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,041
Why does she keep telling me
to eat those eggs?

487
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,435
Man, this room is unbelievably tiny.

488
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,355
Man, I have nothing to do now.

489
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,465
Gosh.

490
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,511
THANK YOU
THANK YOU

491
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,471
What?

492
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,350
It must belong to the person
who lived here before.

493
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,399
DIE, DIE, DIE

494
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,861
DIE, DIE, DIE

495
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,280
Could it be...

496
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:40,784
Even if this place will be redeveloped,
how can it be so cheap?

497
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,037
I'll be frank.

498
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:47,374
Someone who lived here before you
committed suicide.

499
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,467
Just forget it.
I'll have a can of beer and go to sleep.

500
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,983
JI-EUN, DID YOU GET OFF WORK?

501
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:26,955
Yes, hello?

502
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,584
Yes, isn't this JH Contents?

503
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,923
Pardon? Oh, yes. Yes, you're right.

504
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,593
Hey, Yu-jeong used to pick up the phone.
You must be new.

505
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:44,056
Oh, yes. I'm Yoon Jong-u, the intern.

506
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,100
I see, Im Jong-u.

507
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:49,436
-No, it's Yoon Jong--
-Okay, Im Jong-u, I get it.

508
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,399
Can you text me the information
on Dachimban's performances?

509
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:57,319
Goodness, right... Right now?

510
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,530
Yes, please hurry. Thanks.

511
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,526
Where is it?

512
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:50,080
-Goodness, who are you?
-My gosh.

513
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:53,208
-Hello, I'm a police officer.
-A police officer?

514
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:58,172
By any chance, do you know this man?

515
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:03,343
I was going to file a report
if he didn't show up by tomorrow. Wait.

516
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,428
Who? This guy?

517
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:08,140
-I mean, that guy.
-Yes?

518
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,976
He hasn't paid any of his rent.

519
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,061
-His rent?
-Yes, he's behind on his rent,

520
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,189
-then he just ran away today.
-He lives here?

521
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,024
Yes, he does. In room 310.

522
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,984
-In room 310? Let me see room 310, then.
-Yes.

523
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,361
Goodness, I was betrayed so much...
Come here. Come inside.

524
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,447
I've been betrayed so much
by the people I trust.

525
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,408
Why is it so dark in here?

526
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:29,912
Goodness, there's no use in keeping
the hallway light in this economy.

527
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,498
-Come this way. It's a waste.
-Is this it?

528
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,959
-Yes. Goodness. He got drunk...
-Man, this idiot.

529
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,711
-...and began to break everything.
-Okay.

530
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:41,215
Then he threatened his next door,
saying he'll kill him or something.

531
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:45,219
I should've kicked him out already,
but I'm too soft-hearted.

532
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:48,472
-Did he disappear today?
-He got drunk last night

533
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,516
-and beat up the guy next door.
-He hit him?

534
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,060
Yes, I got angry and told him to leave.

535
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,688
I guess he thought it was his chance
to leave and he ran out of here.

536
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:00,150
-Who did he beat up?
-The guy next... Goodness.

537
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,694
Room 306, come here.

538
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,821
-He's here?
-Yes.

539
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:08,575
He's here to take the guy in room 310,
so come and tell him.

540
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,494
-It's this guy.
-Hello.

541
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,499
Yes, he suddenly said

542
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,003
I'm being way too loud,
then slapped my face.

543
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,839
-He stutters.
-I told him to stop,

544
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:26,760
but you know what he's like, officer.

545
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:31,890
He has... He has scars and a scary face.

546
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,476
He's saying he's scary. Great job.

547
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,353
Is it funny that you got beaten up?

548
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,522
Is that funny? Wasn't he beaten up?

549
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,566
He's not in his right mind.

550
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:44,194
All right, then. Give me a call

551
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,863
once he comes back.
We'll look for him too.

552
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:50,867
He beat someone up, didn't pay his rent,
then ran away. You need to find him.

553
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,078
You can file a report
with the police station.

554
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,248
You're telling me to file a report?
My goodness.

555
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:01,211
How do you know this man?

556
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:08,844
My gosh, it looks like
he got into huge trouble.

557
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,433
Hey, wait.

558
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,020
Do you live here? At this residence?

559
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:19,896
Yes.

560
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,524
I'm a detective.

561
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,735
-Okay.
-Yes.

562
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:28,405
Do you know this man?

563
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,116
-He's--
-Do you know him?

564
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,369
No, I wouldn't say I know him.

565
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,623
We talked a few times, that's all.
I just moved in.

566
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:38,790
I see.

567
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,753
Did you find anything
out of the ordinary about him?

568
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,171
-Out of the ordinary?
-Yes.

569
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:48,717
Did he seem different,
or did he do anything weird?

570
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:51,720
Did something happen to him?

571
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:52,846
What?

572
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:56,683
Why do you suddenly ask?

573
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:00,270
I mean, a detective is here
looking for him.

574
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,730
Oh, that's not the case.

575
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,066
He's on the wanted list,

576
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,651
-but he called asking for help.
-What?

577
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,194
He said someone's trying to kill him.

578
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,863
-What? That's--
-Why? Do you remember something?

579
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,198
No, no.

580
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:18,205
He didn't seem to be on great terms
with the people who live here.

581
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,748
-With the people who live here?
-Yes.

582
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,458
What else? Anything else?

583
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,002
-This is... This is just my take.
-Okay.

584
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,255
He seemed to be a bit scared
of the people living here.

585
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,341
All right, then.

586
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:33,095
Please give me a call
if you remember anything else.

587
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,639
-Okay.
-Call me on that number.

588
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:38,225
-I'm sorry about that. Get a good rest.
-Sure.

589
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,529
Young man! I almost forgot.

590
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,072
-Yes?
-Take your delivery.

591
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,370
What?

592
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:04,918
-Ms. Um. Come on.
-What? What is it?

593
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,588
Did you... Ms. Um. Did you open this?

594
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:12,008
No, it wasn't me.

595
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:16,138
Room 313 opened it,
thinking that it was his.

596
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,850
That happens when you live in a place
with a lot of people.

597
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,018
Loosen up.

598
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,275
Let me see.

599
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,960
That guy who spat on you is probably...
You know.

600
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,214
He probably can't control his anger.
You just need to ignore guys like that.

601
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,925
Fine, just let it slide.

602
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:16,156
If he fixed the computer,

603
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,034
he should have turned it off.

604
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,837
Wait, did that pervert...

605
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,391
CHA SEONG-RYEOL

606
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,936
I'm leaving next week.

607
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,855
I'm going back to my hometown
to run a fishing hole or something.

608
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,192
Right, he said he'll be going back
to his hometown.

609
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,240
Where are you, Hui-jung?

610
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:03,995
No!

611
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:10,919
Do you want to play too?
Do you want to die?

612
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,247
He must be gone already.

613
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,258
You ended up giving me too much to do.

614
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,677
I'll be busy.

615
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,807
Whatever. I'm sure he'll be fine.

616
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,497
JI-EUN: I JUST GOT OFF FROM WORK.
I'M ON MY WAY HOME NOW.

617
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,563
I'm going straight home after work today.

618
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:10,825
I knew you were a big flop.

619
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,454
What I do is art,

620
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,165
not just murder.

621
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:18,917
Why...

622
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:25,381
So why did you do this
without my permission?

623
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,676
We have our rules.

624
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,496
Thanks for everything so far,

625
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,290
babe.

626
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,519
No. No. No way.

627
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:22,897
I'm sure people here aren't
in their right minds anyway.

628
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:27,360
Maybe you're a bit too sensitive.

629
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:30,405
-What?
-Jong-u, you must be tired.

630
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:33,575
Don't let it get to you, and go to sleep.

631
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,744
Ji-eun, it might sound like

632
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:40,373
I'm making a big deal out of nothing,
but if you come and see--

633
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:44,294
Jong-u, I'm really tired
from working long hours.

634
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:45,837
Let's talk again tomorrow.

635
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,256
Is that all right?

636
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,924
Okay, then.

637
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,634
Goodnight.

638
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,971
Okay, goodnight.

639
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:05,940
Are you the new guy?

640
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,151
Yes.

641
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:15,533
Ms. Um told me
that we have a new resident in room 303.

642
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:16,743
Yes.

643
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,330
Don't you like it here?

644
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:25,293
It's suffocating in that room
as if you're lying in a coffin.

645
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:29,380
But you feel a little better
if you grab a can of beer up here.

646
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,674
Yes, you're right.

647
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:42,060
Anyway, why do you keep smiling at me?

648
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:49,067
Oh, I'm sorry if I offended you.

649
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,276
No.

650
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,362
Just because.

651
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,031
-I like you.
-What?

652
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:05,708
I had this thought when I saw you.

653
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:14,342
That you might be one of my kind.

654
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:15,718
What?

655
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,677
You know, there are these people

656
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,888
who look perfectly fine on the outside
but have the desire to kill.

657
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:04,183
You can't open the door
without a key, right?

658
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,602
Yes, you can't.

659
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:09,731
I want to work
on the... the new guy already.

660
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:13,026
He looked really soft.

661
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:15,320
He said he was scared.

662
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:19,574
That some weird people are trying
to kill him.

663
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,327
Come to think of it,
that gangster guy is suddenly gone too.

664
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,245
Isn't this weird?

665
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,583
