1
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:09,384
NO OUTSIDE VISITORS
ALLOWED IN THE RESIDENCE

2
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,378
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS

3
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,339
AND INCIDENTS APPEARING
IN THIS FILM ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,508
I see.

5
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,471
Okay.

6
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,267
I want to see you.

7
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,146
I'm going straight home after work today.

8
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,899
It sounds like fun.

9
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,142
You're here.

10
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,478
I'll manage this.

11
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:05,375
I knew you were a big flop.

12
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,754
What I do is art,

13
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,507
not just murder.

14
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,342
Why...

15
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:20,765
So why did you do this
without my permission?

16
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,102
We have our rules.

17
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,215
Thanks for everything so far.

18
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,051
Babe.

19
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,973
Are you the new guy?

20
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,892
Yes.

21
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:10,732
Ms. Um told me
that we have a new resident in room 303.

22
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,900
Yes.

23
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,445
Don't you like it here?

24
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,742
It's suffocating in that room
as if you're lying in a coffin.

25
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,871
But you feel a little better
if you grab a can of beer up here.

26
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,915
Yes, you're right.

27
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:41,054
Anyway, why do you keep smiling at me?

28
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:45,350
Oh, I'm sorry if I offended you.

29
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,643
No.

30
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,895
Just because.

31
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,940
-I like you.
-What?

32
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:59,113
Do you want a can of beer?
I just bought it, so it's cold.

33
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,540
You must have hurt your hand.

34
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,420
Oh, I got hurt at work.

35
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,048
You must be in a rough business
if you hurt your hand working.

36
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,138
You have very delicate fingers.

37
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,475
Do you write by any chance?

38
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,561
How did you know?

39
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,984
People each have
their own special ambiance.

40
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,402
Something like that.

41
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,863
I do something similar too.

42
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:47,245
I break things up,
put them together, and recreate.

43
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,248
What's with this guy?
He's getting way too friendly.

44
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,000
What's your favorite genre?

45
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,963
I like crime novels.

46
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,136
What are the chances?
I like crime novels too.

47
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,262
Really?

48
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,848
I like Raymond Chandler.

49
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,561
-Ray... Really?
-Yes.

50
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,231
Hey, I like him too. Goodness.

51
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,818
Actually, to be honest,

52
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,863
I didn't think I'd meet someone here
who likes the same author as me.

53
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,990
Not a lot of people know
who Raymond Chandler is.

54
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,826
-Have you read  The High Window ?
-Of course, I have.

55
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,871
This is so uncanny.

56
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,750
-If it's not too much to ask...
-Yes?

57
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,669
Could you tell me a little
about the novel you've been writing?

58
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,296
-My work?
-Yes.

59
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,048
I'm not finished writing it yet.

60
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,258
Just tell me a little bit about the story.

61
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,885
-My work?
-Yes.

62
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,679
It's a work in progress, but...

63
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:52,226
Well, on the outside,
this person is an up-and-coming pianist.

64
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,729
But actually, this person is

65
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,815
a serial murderer
who has been killing people in this story.

66
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,734
-I see.
-Right?

67
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:03,905
You know, there are these people

68
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,948
who look perfectly fine outside

69
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,367
but have the desire to kill.

70
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,494
Right.

71
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,458
-What's the method of murder?
-What?

72
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,211
Your main character. The pianist.

73
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:22,590
Oh, right.
Well, there's a murder signature

74
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,592
that the main character uses.

75
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,553
It's always on the night
before his recital,

76
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,432
and he always uses his bare hands.
He doesn't use tools. He uses his hands

77
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,392
to choke someone to death.

78
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,604
Then the murderer keeps his eyes
on his victim until they die.

79
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,524
He keeps staring.

80
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,112
So here's the psychology
of this main character.

81
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,239
The main character wants to use
his two hands.

82
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,325
And his hands are very pale and slender.
He wants to feel

83
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:53,830
his victim's withering temperature
with his own two hands. With his hands.

84
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,957
Thanks for everything so far.

85
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,668
Babe.

86
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,962
That's cool.

87
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,382
-Goodness.
-That's really cool.

88
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,385
Gosh, I feel like
I'm the only one who's talking.

89
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,598
But I don't think
the victim is withering away.

90
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,060
-Aren't they blazing up instead?
-Pardon?

91
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,106
I mean, when he chokes his victims,

92
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,818
his hands aren't touching
the cold piano keys,

93
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:28,030
but grasping a fireball blazing up
in thousands of degrees.

94
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,785
Maybe he wants to feel that.
It's just a thought I...

95
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,999
Goodness, I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have said that to a writer.

96
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,335
Gosh, I'm hardly a writer.
I'm not a writer. No.

97
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,381
I'm sure everything will go well for you.

98
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,342
Cheers.

99
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,847
What a relief.

100
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,559
It seems like
he's the most normal guy here.

101
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,441
Goodnight.

102
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,151
-Sure, goodbye.
-Bye.

103
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,113
When he chokes his victims,

104
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,034
his hands aren't touching
the cold piano keys,

105
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:59,372
but grasping a fireball blazing up
in thousands of degrees.

106
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,958
Maybe he wants to feel that.

107
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,628
I could probably add that to the novel.

108
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,809
I thought I left my laptop opened.

109
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,816
There's no way it'll close by itself.

110
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,118
I THINK THAT MAN HAS BEEN COMING
INTO MY ROOM

111
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,122
-Mr. Byun, did you go into his room?
-Are you all joking around as a group?

112
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,499
Why would I go in there?

113
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,585
I have my own room!

114
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,423
Did that man come into my room too?

115
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,550
No, let's not get overly sensitive.

116
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,219
I might end up becoming insane
like that guy.

117
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,558
So why... Why did you kill him?

118
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,810
I... I was going to do it.

119
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,273
I want... I want the saw.

120
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,525
No, you're the pickax!

121
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,236
Come here and take the sack!

122
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,576
What a crazy man.

123
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,562
What are you doing? Hey.

124
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,360
-I said, what are you doing?
-Playing with fire.

125
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,117
This... This is so annoying!

126
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,453
Darn it. It's so freaking hot.

127
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,540
People will start to climb up here
for the mineral spring. Hurry up and dig.

128
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,041
Gosh.

129
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,169
I'm dying of heat.

130
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,921
JEONG-IN TAKES A SHOVEL AND HITS THE SACK

131
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,049
I'm dying... Dying of heat.

132
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,176
I'm dying of heat!

133
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,513
Damn you! Die.

134
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,974
Die. Die.

135
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,935
Die. Die. Die!

136
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,771
Die. Die.

137
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,232
DIE, DIE, DIE

138
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,532
Man, it's even hotter now.

139
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,619
Gosh, that's so cool.

140
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,707
It's not easy to find a place like this.

141
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,543
How many times do we have to do this?
Darn it.

142
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,712
Make sure you sprinkle it all over.

143
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,674
And put away anything
that can be used as evidence.

144
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,718
Make sure you take the license plate.

145
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,012
It's not like we killed him.

146
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:48,267
No, not because of the police.
It's that man!

147
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,689
We always do his dirty work.
Do you think I don't have a safety net?

148
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,829
Get up, you idiot!

149
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,754
-Where's your rank and name?
-Private Yoon Jong-u!

150
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,423
Listen to that tiny voice.
Where's your discipline?

151
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,592
You fell asleep, didn't you?

152
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,178
N... No, sir.

153
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,055
Don't bullshit me.

154
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,766
Get down.

155
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,060
I said, get down.

156
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,775
Close your eyes.

157
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,739
I said, close your eyes.

158
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,034
If you want to sleep that badly,

159
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,620
you can sleep like this, you idiot.

160
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,410
Jeez. Why did I dream
about the army again?

161
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,375
Using the toilet outside
reminds me of the army.

162
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,512
Man, that guy is just impossible.

163
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:55,019
Why would he want to do that this early
in the morning?

164
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,650
I hope that guy didn't open my laptop.

165
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,988
Man, it's really bothering me.

166
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,388
I don't see that guy who spat on me.

167
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,474
I was going to tell him off
when I see him.

168
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,185
Hello.

169
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,775
Oh, hello.

170
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,944
-Did you get a good sleep?
-Yes.

171
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,657
It sounded like you were having
a nightmare. I could hear you.

172
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,493
Did I bother you? I'm sorry.

173
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,620
Don't worry about it.

174
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,873
You can practically hear
the person next door breathing here.

175
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,208
Figures.

176
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,503
The rooms are separated, but it feels like
we're all living together.

177
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,839
Right, have you seen the guy
who lives next door to me?

178
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,427
-Room 302?
-Yes.

179
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,349
Why?

180
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,685
It's just that I haven't seen him
since last night.

181
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,564
Come to think of it,
that gangster guy is suddenly gone too.

182
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,775
Isn't this weird?

183
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:30,030
We all live here, but we don't really know
about one another.

184
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,866
It's probably good manners
to pretend like we didn't notice.

185
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,201
I guess so.

186
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,289
I'm sure no one came
to live here willingly.

187
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,042
Do you want to grab a beer
on the rooftop after work tonight?

188
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:47,798
I'm meeting my girlfriend tonight,
so I can't.

189
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,051
-So you have a girlfriend.
-Yes.

190
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,970
Of course, you do.
You're a really good-looking guy.

191
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,639
Then please excuse me.

192
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,600
I'll take a rain check on that beer.

193
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,936
Sure, we aren't in a hurry.

194
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:14,616
-Hello. Hello.
-Yes, hello.

195
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,252
I'll just ignore them.

196
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,215
You must be getting ready for work.
You're one diligent young man.

197
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:34,344
Goodness, why didn't you wash it off...
You're such a baby.

198
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,057
Come here. I'll make breakfast.
I'll fry some eggs for you.

199
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,600
No, I don't eat breakfast.

200
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,482
Ms. Um. Ms. Um?

201
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,400
What?

202
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,404
You can never open the door
without a key, right?

203
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,115
Yes, you can never open it.

204
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,909
Why? Did something go missing?

205
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,452
No, it's nothing of that sort.

206
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,038
Oh, and...

207
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,253
Could you tell the man in room 313

208
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,923
to close his doors when he's in?

209
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,593
Why? I can't really ask him to do that.

210
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,553
It must be suffocating
to be in such a small room.

211
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,348
-His room reeks.
-His room smells?

212
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,851
And he watches too much porn.

213
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,729
-What's "porn"?
-What?

214
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,775
Okay, fine. I'll have a talk with him.

215
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,318
-Okay.
-Okay.

216
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,490
You're so cute. Have a great day at work.

217
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,985
This way, I can find out
if someone had been in my room.

218
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,366
I'll take a picture too.

219
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,697
Locked the door.

220
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,331
Man, what's with that guy?

221
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,263
I'll just slide by quietly.

222
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,018
But what is he holding behind him?

223
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,856
Excuse me, room 313.

224
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,403
Goodness, have a great day at work.

225
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,488
Yes.

226
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,157
Bye.

227
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,953
Goodness, close your door
after you ventilate your room.

228
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,372
I keep getting complaints.

229
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,916
Keep... Keep that door closed.

230
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,609
Did you take good care of him?

231
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,947
Yes. We do this all the time.

232
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,288
Take care of the guy in room 310 tonight.

233
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,999
Okay, we'll do it tonight.

234
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:38,964
JI-EUN, CAN YOU HAVE DINNER TONIGHT
AFTER WORK?

235
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,553
YES! LET'S MEET TONIGHT FOR SURE!

236
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,736
Goodness.

237
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,489
Why are you here alone?

238
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,910
Have you eaten?

239
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,371
Where's your mom? Goodness.

240
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,042
Where did your mom go? Why are you alone?

241
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,587
Have you eaten?
You probably haven't, right?

242
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,843
-Hello.
-Do you have cat food?

243
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,178
-Cat food?
-Yes.

244
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,971
You'll find it
in the household items section.

245
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,650
Hey, what are you doing?

246
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:47,157
Why do you keep feeding the cats?
Stop it. Stop this.

247
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,077
They keep coming around if you feed them.

248
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,703
What are you doing?

249
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,997
I can't sleep at night because of them.

250
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,529
MISSING: KUMAIL, MALE, AGE 37
NATIONALITY: PAKISTAN

251
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,684
Excuse me. No, it's okay.

252
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:01,523
By any chance, do you know Mr. Kumail?

253
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,903
Do you know my husband?

254
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,074
-When will you get rid of this?
-Tonight.

255
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,286
Ms. Um has been complaining of the smell.

256
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,539
Sir. Sir?

257
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,875
Wake up, sir. It'll end very soon.

258
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:24,045
-All right! This is so exciting!
-Sir, it'll end very soon.

259
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:28,300
We didn't put him to sleep.
Why is he like this? Open your eyes!

260
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,260
Let's see.

261
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,349
I'll cut his neck open.

262
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,727
You two can clean up afterward.

263
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,480
You have to give me his hand.

264
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:46,693
I want to work on the...
the new guy already.

265
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:50,071
He looked really soft.

266
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,743
Be careful.
Didn't you see how room 302 died?

267
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,287
You'll all die if you keep acting up.

268
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:02,792
Good... Goodness, I'm so scared.

269
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,628
Sir? Hey.

270
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:10,091
Room 302... The guy you loved... I mean,
the one you were scared of is dead.

271
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:14,638
Let's see. Halibut.

272
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:19,309
Rockfish. Blowfish.

273
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,647
-Shit.
-That's almost a span long.

274
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,444
Hey, Ji-eun. I'm on my way to work.

275
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,489
You've been busy, haven't you?

276
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:36,785
Yes, we're launching
four new programs this month.

277
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,372
Gosh, I'm so tired. What about you?

278
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,541
It has only been a day for me.

279
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:47,212
But my direct senior is kind of a jerk.

280
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,756
He tried to keep me
under his discipline since day one.

281
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,008
But still, try to get along with him.

282
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,761
You shouldn't get on his bad side.

283
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,392
If you're going to make a call,
do it outside. Think of others.

284
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,102
Yes, coming.

285
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,398
-Sorry. I have to go. I'll call you back.
-Right.

286
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:09,901
Okay. All right. I'll call you. Bye.

287
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,543
-Was that your boyfriend?
-Yes.

288
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,005
The guy who writes?

289
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,881
Yes.

290
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,552
He hasn't debuted, has he?

291
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,886
No.

292
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,389
Goodness, figures.

293
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:43,059
Everyone and their mother wants to write
a novel. It won't be easy.

294
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,772
I'm sure you know
since you're in this industry, right?

295
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,191
-Please excuse me.
-Okay.

296
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,741
-Ji-eun.
-Yes?

297
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,162
Are you sure you ran a spell check
on this press release?

298
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,955
Yes, I did.

299
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,583
You did, but there are typos left?

300
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,338
I just skimmed through it
and found three errors.

301
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,507
What if we handed it over
to be published like this?

302
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,345
Our pride is at stake, isn't it?

303
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,930
I'm sorry. I'll revise it.

304
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:25,310
You know that I'm a perfectionist.

305
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,479
I'm very sensitive to these things.

306
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,609
You keep missing the basics.

307
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,237
-I'm... I'm sorry.
-You may go.

308
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:50,168
PURPOSE OF THE NOVEL

309
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,753
KIM BO-MI, LEE BOM

310
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,056
My husband won't pick up his phone.

311
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,892
He's not usually like that.

312
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,769
He called me every day.

313
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,068
He lives here.

314
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,196
When you last talked to him,

315
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:22,242
did he say anything weird,
or did he seem any different?

316
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,453
He said he was scared.

317
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,830
Scared?

318
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,624
"Eden Residence"?

319
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,587
Wait, you two didn't live together?

320
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,762
The restaurant I work at is far away.

321
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:47,517
We decided to live separately
to make money.

322
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,938
My husband said that place scared him.

323
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:59,571
That some weird people are trying
to kill him.

324
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,656
He said that?

325
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,033
It's all my fault.

326
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,830
It's all my fault.

327
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,719
You know what?

328
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,638
There are three things that are missing
at a residence like this.

329
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,892
People who study for exams, sunlight,

330
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,269
and people who look for us.

331
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,396
But you

332
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,525
ended up making someone look for us.

333
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,321
That's against the rules of a residence.

334
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,323
You should've been careful.

335
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,827
But actually,

336
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,662
it doesn't really matter.

337
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,750
The guy who came looking for you is dead.

338
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:58,880
Cover me up down there too.
How many times do I have to tell you?

339
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,382
And you'll soon die too.

340
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,725
But I...

341
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,186
-Hello.
-Jong-u is here.

342
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:17,941
Yes, he's our new intern.
This is Reporter Cho Yu-cheol.

343
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,276
-Nice to meet--
-Did you forget

344
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,612
what I asked you to send me
on the phone last night?

345
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:25,532
Gosh, I forgot. I'm sorry.

346
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:30,537
No worries.
I'm glad he didn't forget to come to work.

347
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:35,625
-Goodness, Mr. Cho. You're here.
-Hello.

348
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,711
-Mr. Shin will be here in the afternoon.
-What?

349
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:42,257
He's hungover. I can't believe
he's doing this in our busy season.

350
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,551
Right, I heard he had too many drinks
last night.

351
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:48,721
Aren't you all a little too sloppy
at your jobs?

352
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,474
Do you think show promotion is a joke?

353
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,937
Come on, you write articles
on shows you haven't even watched.

354
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,065
Hey, Yu-jeong. Are you attacking me?

355
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,191
No way.

356
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,403
Gosh. I should go now
since you're so scary.

357
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,280
I'll be back when Mr. Shin is in.

358
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,615
-Yes, goodbye.
-Goodbye.

359
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,993
My gosh.

360
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,912
Goodness, great job on dealing with him.

361
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,833
Is he a pervert or what?
Why is he making a scene this early?

362
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,712
-Hey, Mr. Intern.
-Yes?

363
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,422
-What was your name again?
-It's Yoon Jong-u.

364
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,632
Yes, Jong-u. Come here for a second.

365
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,887
We're way too busy,
so we have to get you to work right away.

366
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,555
Do you know how to use PowerPoint?

367
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:34,017
-I haven't--
-You just have to organize these

368
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,643
according to the manual.

369
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,812
Ask Mr. Park if you get stuck.

370
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,147
Okay.

371
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,901
Let's see.

372
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,869
You jerk. You idiot.

373
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:57,749
Say, "Please spare my life."

374
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,130
This jerk.

375
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,175
Okay, let's see.

376
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,179
You jerks, enough is enough.

377
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,140
-All right!
-Damn it!

378
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,558
Give me your hand.

379
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,524
You shouldn't tell him to say
"Please spare my life." It's my turn.

380
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,736
I need to hit you. Wait.

381
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,740
-What are you doing?
-I bet three too.

382
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,618
-You bet for "Who are you?"
-You heard him, right?

383
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,328
-Stop lying!
-Shit.

384
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,748
Shit.

385
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,128
I'm a really good dentist,

386
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,631
but I didn't numb your mouth,
so it'll hurt a little.

387
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,468
You can't help it.
You'll need to live through.

388
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,723
All right, now. Okay.

389
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,477
Okay. We'll be done soon.

390
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,773
OFFICER SO JEONG-HWA

391
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,567
REQUEST FOR A BACKGROUND CHECK
BYUN DEUK-JONG

392
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,908
-I... I didn't kill 13 cats.
-What?

393
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:18,329
-Officer So?
-I... I killed one.

394
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,965
78 BUNSEON-GIL, IJWA-RO
HWAGUN-RI, GYEONGGI PROVINCE

395
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,977
I have no idea how to do this.

396
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:51,279
Excuse me, Mr. Park.
Could you please give me a hand?

397
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,657
-So I take this and--
-What is this?

398
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:58,953
You can't do something that basic?
How did you manage to graduate?

399
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:04,167
If you used connections to get a job,
you need to work hard.

400
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,880
What did you do at work today?
You just spaced out, didn't you?

401
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,509
You went straight to bed last night,
didn't you?

402
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,680
Did you review what you learned at work?

403
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:18,806
I'm sorry.

404
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:39,619
Man, I got stuck again.
How do I get this to work?

405
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:44,165
I really don't want to ask that guy.

406
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,968
What is it? Do you have a question?

407
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,639
What? Oh, I don't know how to do this.

408
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:04,685
You just have to press
ctrl and z together. Easy, isn't it?

409
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,939
Yes.

410
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,733
You should ask Mr. Park
whenever you have a question.

411
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,902
Why are you grumbling like a puppy?

412
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,070
Yes, okay.

413
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,988
You're too cute.

414
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,847
He's unbelievably pathetic.

415
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,100
He's just like that pervert
at the residence.

416
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,435
Goodness, I'm sorry.

417
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,479
-Mr. Shin, are you okay?
-Is Mr. Cho gone?

418
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,274
He is. You came late
on purpose, didn't you?

419
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,069
-Have some  tteokbokki .
-Why did you get  tteokbokki ?

420
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,405
You're having  tteokbokki
when you're hungover? Will you be okay?

421
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,990
Come on. What did Mr. Cho say?

422
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,408
He was looking for you.

423
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,743
What would he say?
He just made a scene and left.

424
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,912
-Great job.
-Looks good.

425
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,997
Let's eat.

426
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,125
Sundae  looks great.

427
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,064
78 BUNSEON-GIL, IJWA-RO
HWAGUN-RI, GYEONGGI PROVINCE

428
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,057
Man, he's going to tell me off again.

429
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,353
Mr. Park, I'm sorry,
but could you take another look at this?

430
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,195
You have to apply
what I already told you before.

431
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,406
Don't... Don't you understand?

432
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:50,745
My gosh. Use your head when you work.

433
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,538
Don't just do it blindly.

434
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,042
Even an elementary school kid
can do better than you.

435
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:00,713
Why did you punch in the numbers?

436
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,841
Didn't you use a formula
to calculate these?

437
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,552
Man, you don't even know the basics.

438
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:11,307
We have to change all the numbers
when the prices change later on.

439
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,185
You'll be done in no time
if you use VLOOKUP on these.

440
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:18,105
Just do a simple search
and you'll find everything online!

441
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,157
Will you please shut up?

442
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,954
-What are you doing? Can't you hear me?
-Pardon?

443
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,999
Why are you so out of it?

444
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:42,171
You don't seem clueless.
It looks like you aren't willing enough.

445
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,175
All right, let's wrap up and go home.

446
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,635
-Yes.
-Yes.

447
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,150
-Are you leaving?
-What?

448
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:08,030
If I were you, I'd stay behind
and study a little for my job.

449
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:12,284
You should at least earn your keep.

450
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,331
See you tomorrow.

451
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,626
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye. Great work.

452
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,936
JI-EUN, I HAVE TO WORK OVERTIME

453
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,063
SO WE'LL HAVE TO MEET ON THE WEEKEND
I'M SORRY

454
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,871
WE CAN'T HELP IT, THEN
CALL ME WHEN YOU GET OFF WORK

455
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,247
YES, OKAY

456
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,335
78 BUNSEON-GIL, IJWA-RO

457
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,377
Why, hello.

458
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,339
I'm Officer So Jeong-hwa
of Eunhye Patrol Division in Eunhye-dong.

459
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,216
I'm actually here

460
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:54,053
to ask a few questions
about your nephew, Mr. Byun Deuk-jong.

461
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,055
May I ask for your cooperation?

462
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:05,314
They've always been weird

463
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,483
ever since the day they were born.

464
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,859
They've been weird?

465
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,820
Other people say

466
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,199
I must have seen something wrong
while I was drunk,

467
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:19,620
but I clearly saw them

468
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,457
put our place on fire to kill me.

469
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,587
But they were children back then.

470
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,423
Are you doubting what I'm saying?
Do you think I'm drunk?

471
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,716
-I'm sorry.
-Do you?

472
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:36,971
I'm sure of this.
No one else knows except for me.

473
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,642
Sir, do you have any pictures
or belongings

474
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,852
of the twins left here?

475
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,397
Let's see.

476
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,361
This is it.

477
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,175
POLICE

478
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:48,959
The box...

479
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,426
Where is it?

480
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,488
-Move aside.
-Yes.

481
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,923
After I sent them off to an orphanage,

482
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,718
they sent me something
after a long time has passed.

483
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:44,223
May I take this to have a look,
then bring it back?

484
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:47,685
Throw it out or do whatever you want.
I don't even want to look at it.

485
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,228
Thank you.

486
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,321
1998
SAEMTEO ORPHANAGE

487
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,646
1998
SAEMTEO ORPHANAGE

488
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,924
Let us begin the burning ceremony
of the frogs.

489
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,809
What are you doing over there, boys?

490
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,645
Goodness! You little rascals.

491
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,814
You guys caught a lot.

492
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,610
We'll get to eat some frog legs tonight.

493
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,945
-Thank you.
-Let's do it together.

494
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,030
Should we?

495
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,449
Show me a smile.

496
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,747
Wow, this is huge.

497
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,583
What is she doing?

498
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,377
Hey, come and eat.

499
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,246
It's too late
to ask her to meet, isn't it?

500
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,582
You worked overtime,
then you work at home too?

501
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,503
Yes, I have a meeting tomorrow.

502
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,630
You're a workaholic.

503
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,175
Stop picking a fight with me.

504
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,015
JONG-U

505
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,186
She must be busy.

506
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:50,993
I wonder if that cat came back.
It must be hungry.

507
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,959
Hello.

508
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:11,888
-Heave-ho. Heave-ho.
-Be careful.

509
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,807
-Careful.
-Heave-ho. Goodness!

510
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,519
Make sure you clean it up, okay?

511
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,146
This is so exciting!

512
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,064
Be quiet! People will wake up!

513
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,443
-And stop fooling around.
-Don't worry.

514
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:26,486
You hold the front.

515
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,864
No, you hold the front!

516
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,616
Hold the front, will you?

517
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,992
No, you do it.

518
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,286
You do it. You're the younger one.

519
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,583
Should... Should I do that?

520
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:43,795
-Let's go. Heave-ho!
-Go, go.

521
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,673
-Heave-ho!
-Go, go.

522
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,259
Wait. Wait.

523
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,888
Heave-ho. Wait.

524
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:20,082
-Heave-ho.
-Heave-ho.

525
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:23,919
-Heave-ho.
-Heave-ho.

526
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:27,339
-They're the twins.
-Heave-ho.

527
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,007
What are they doing this late at night?

528
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:34,388
-Heave-ho.
-Heave-ho.

529
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:39,184
-What's in that sack?
-Heave-ho.

530
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:42,896
Heave-ho. I want to take the front.

531
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,015
Quiet.

532
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:52,924
Hi. Kitty.

533
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,511
You're so pretty. Come here.

534
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,016
What are you doing?

535
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:06,688
I had to go to the police station
because of you, you crazy jerk.

536
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:09,316
You crazy jerk.
So why did you get caught? Jerk.

537
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,486
I killed just one of them.

538
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,030
This is so annoying!

539
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,201
Die. Die!

540
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:23,789
-Die! You fat pig.
-Stop that and move it!

541
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:32,547
Die! You fat pig! Die!

542
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,774
Die!

543
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,701
What are you looking at?

544
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,079
What?

545
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,750
They're the twins.

546
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,629
I just saw them while I was passing by.

547
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,718
-Mr. Byun.
-Die!

548
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,977
He... Hello.

549
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:30,856
What are you doing here?

550
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,984
Ms... Ms. Um told us

551
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:37,404
to take out the garbage.

552
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:42,450
We help her out
instead of paying the rent.

553
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:47,163
I see. I thought you were throwing out
a dead body or something.

554
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,749
-Isn't that so?
-What?

555
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,965
Oh, a little.

556
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,387
Why are you throwing out the garbage here?

557
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:12,147
Ms. Um told us to throw it out
where there aren't any cameras around.

558
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:18,445
But that black stain.

559
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,615
What's that? It looks like blood.

560
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,829
It's... It's the water that came out

561
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,414
from food garbage.

562
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,627
Filthy water came out.

563
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:38,798
Goodness, she doesn't separate
regular garbage from food garbage?

564
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:43,470
This is pretty bad, isn't it?

565
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,764
Well, I...

566
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,433
I'll talk to Ms. Um and--

567
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:51,937
You can just open it.
Can't we open it and see?

568
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,982
Let's just see what's inside
so that we wouldn't get the wrong idea.

569
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:10,622
The man from room 303 is right. Open it.

570
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:16,169
Hurry up and open it.
If you don't, I'll call the police.

571
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:34,646
If you're curious, see for yourself.

572
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:12,934
Mr. Byun, you can't throw out
dead cats over here.

573
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:16,896
It... It died from having too...

574
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,190
too much rat poison.

575
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,490
Are you all right?

576
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,037
Goodness, I'm leaving.

577
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:33,872
Wait for me.

578
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:39,836
Go... Go have a great night.

579
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,345
You must've been shocked.

580
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,057
No. No, I'm fine.

581
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,434
Why is he so calm?

582
00:55:57,395 --> 00:56:00,774
My father is a vet,
so I'm used to seeing dead animals.

583
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,067
What is this?

584
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,445
It seems as if he's reading my mind.

585
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,324
I guess you didn't get to see
your girlfriend today.

586
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,408
No.

587
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:13,620
Do you want to go in
and grab some refreshing beer?

588
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:19,209
It gets lonely to be in the room all alone
after a long day.

589
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,461
Don't you feel that way too?

590
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,219
Right, one second.

591
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:46,402
-Try this. It's to die for.
-Okay.

592
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,912
Ms. Um made it for us. Try some.

593
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,163
Okay.

594
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,389
Maybe it's because I just saw a dead cat.

595
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,558
It tastes kind of odd.

596
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,686
I guess you don't really like it.

597
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:23,898
Yes, it's not really for me.

598
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:29,154
I guess this part isn't for you.

599
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,575
-What?
-There are other parts. Do you want some?

600
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:37,328
It's pretty late. Let's have a quick drink
and call it a day.

601
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,217
That's weird. This is good meat.

602
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,031
Why do you look so startled?

603
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,910
Do you think this is human meat
or something?

604
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,914
People here are really strange.

605
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:06,167
And I'm not sure who it is,
but someone's keep coming into my room.

606
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,877
Do you know that he went missing?

607
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,380
Of course. I reported him as missing.

608
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,257
Hey. Behind us.

609
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,968
Sir, may I check your trunk?

610
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,011
How's the guy in room 303?

611
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,847
Hey. Smile. I said, show me a smile.

612
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,684
-Hi, Se-eun.
-He's scary.

613
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:26,062
Was anybody else reported as missing
other than that man?

614
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,690
Why? Do you have a suspect?

615
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,194
