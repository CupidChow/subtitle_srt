1
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:09,384
NO OUTSIDE VISITORS
ALLOWED IN THE RESIDENCE

2
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,378
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS

3
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,381
AND INCIDENTS APPEARING
IN THIS FILM ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,972
I knew you were a big flop.

5
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,559
What I do is art, not just murder.

6
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,022
Is he really the replacement
for the man in room 302?

7
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,275
You can't judge a person by their cover.

8
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,319
He's scary.

9
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,863
Do you want to grab a beer
on the rooftop after work tonight?

10
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,824
I'm meeting my girlfriend tonight,
so I can't.

11
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,618
So you have a girlfriend.

12
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,495
Of course, you do.
You're a really good-looking guy.

13
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,373
What are you looking at?

14
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,000
Why do you look so startled?

15
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:28,755
He must be very sensitive.
It's perfect for my taste.

16
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,049
You really wanted to kill him earlier,
didn't you?

17
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:31,966
What?

18
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,636
He's a loser, human garbage
who watches nothing but weird videos

19
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,263
with his doors wide open,
and he came into your room

20
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,892
to touch your things with his dirty hands.
I'm sure it gave you the creeps.

21
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,229
You don't think you fit in here, do you?

22
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,773
"I'm different from these people."

23
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,192
But you're also kind of anxious.

24
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,236
"What if I end up like them?"

25
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,697
No, you think,
"Did I already become one of them

26
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,408
by living in a place like this?"

27
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,744
Should I just kill him?

28
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,913
-They laughed.
-What?

29
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,334
They didn't seem suppressed.
They seemed to enjoy it.

30
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:10,672
Sir. You can let me off here.

31
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,049
I'm not going home.

32
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,719
I'm sorry. I have to go see Jong-u.

33
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,974
Sir, can you make a U-turn over there?

34
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,400
Jeong-hwa, wake him up.

35
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,659
Jong-u.

36
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:44,706
Jong-u.

37
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,500
Are you okay?

38
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,423
Eden Residence.

39
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,927
What's going on in that place?

40
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,062
EUNHYE PATROL DIVISION

41
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,363
I'm so frightened.

42
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,117
I'm really...

43
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,288
I'm so scared.

44
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,587
Everyone who lives

45
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,966
in that residence is weird.

46
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,730
JONG-U, I'M IN FRONT OF YOUR RESIDENCE
I'M COMING UP TO SEE YOU

47
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,190
Ji-eun.

48
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,494
May I help you?

49
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:05,828
What?

50
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,581
Who are you?

51
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,836
-Don't be scared. I live here.
-I see.

52
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,213
Are you looking for someone?

53
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,883
I came to see my boyfriend.

54
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,469
You must be here to see Jong-u.

55
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,429
Yes.

56
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,975
How did you know?

57
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,184
We're close.

58
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,188
You really are pretty just as I heard.

59
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,402
It seemed like he cares about you a lot.

60
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,322
He said something like that to you?

61
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,326
What about him? What did he say
about the people who live here?

62
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:51,082
Everyone who lives here is insane.

63
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:56,087
He just said there are good people here.

64
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,007
Good people?

65
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,972
Oh, you should go upstairs.
Men's rooms are on the third floor.

66
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,098
Okay.

67
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,158
-Send me a reply.
-Don't worry. I'm sure she'll be fine.

68
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,911
Will you send me a reply, please?

69
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,873
Ji-eun, come on.

70
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,879
-What's wrong?
-Her phone is off.

71
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:42,300
Ji-eun, what's going on, really? Damn it.

72
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,239
What is this? Gosh.

73
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,712
What brings you here this late?

74
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,423
Hello.

75
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,177
I came to see someone who lives here.
His name is Yoon Jong-u.

76
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:30,348
Oh, that handsome young man?
You must be his girlfriend.

77
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,185
Yes, is he back yet?

78
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,521
I don't think he's back yet.

79
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,107
All right.

80
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,819
Wait. Goodness, your hand got dirty.

81
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,737
Come here. Wash your hands before you go.

82
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,531
No, it's all right. I'm fine.

83
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,033
Goodness, come and wash your hands.

84
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,036
You have to hold your boyfriend's hand.
Come here. Come.

85
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,914
-No, it's... I'm fine.
-Make yourself at home.

86
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,138
Min Ji-eun. Min Ji-eun!

87
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,098
Min Ji-eun!

88
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,227
Did you find her?

89
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,732
-Die. Die! Die!
-Ji-eun.

90
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,986
-Ji-eun!
-Jeong-hwa!

91
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,612
Die!

92
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,909
Why won't you pick up your phone?

93
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,911
-Ji-eun.
-Officers.

94
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,874
Why are you with them?

95
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,084
Why didn't you pick up and come so late?

96
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,171
First off, let's go out. Let's go.

97
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,505
-Handsome young man.
-Calm down.

98
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,924
Did you think we did something bad?

99
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,384
-You're scaring me.
-Goodness!

100
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,055
-Wait, I... Why are police officers here?
-No way.

101
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,850
Come out. Follow me outside.

102
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,810
What's with you?

103
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,979
This isn't good manners!

104
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,064
-I told her to wash...
-I got this!

105
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,692
Damn it. Unbelievable. Be quiet!

106
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,614
Ji-eun, you're okay, aren't you?

107
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,701
Ji-eun.

108
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,123
Why did you dare
to go up there all by yourself?

109
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:23,461
I told you how dangerous those people are.

110
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,421
Jong-u.

111
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,426
I'll take you home. Let's go.

112
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,094
-I'm leaving alone.
-No, come here.

113
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,847
-We'll take you to the main street--
-No, we'll manage.

114
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,098
Let me go.

115
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:38,935
Ji-eun.

116
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,688
And Jong-u,

117
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,775
there are people who only look fine

118
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,654
on the outside,
but are much stranger than them.

119
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,115
They aren't pretty bad.

120
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:57,745
It's because you haven't lived here.
If you tried staying here for a day,

121
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,913
you'll see how weird they--

122
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,416
Then you can just move out!
Why do you live here like this?

123
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:09,840
Sorry.

124
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,843
Let's talk again tomorrow.

125
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,513
I'll go home alone.

126
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:27,024
We'll take her home safely. Yes.

127
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,127
Your boyfriend was really worried.

128
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,297
That's why we came.

129
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,484
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

130
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,612
Did something happen?
There were police officers here.

131
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,988
It's nothing.

132
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,491
Tomorrow is the weekend.
Do you want to grab a drink together?

133
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,619
-I--
-We can talk about your novel too.

134
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,579
I have to meet my girlfriend.

135
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,962
THE METAMORPHOSIS  BY FRANZ KAFKA

136
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,427
Handsome young man.

137
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,180
Open the door for a second.

138
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,850
Young man.

139
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,479
-What is it?
-You weren't asleep.

140
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,898
-How are you feeling? Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

141
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,275
Hey, you should drink this

142
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,735
-and get back to sleep.
-I'm fine.

143
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,738
This is the best drink for hangovers.
It'll kick in right away.

144
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,491
Drink up so that I can take the bottle.

145
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,994
Did your girlfriend go home all right?

146
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,624
Yes, but Ms. Um,

147
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,087
a place like this...
I mean, only men live here.

148
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,424
-Yes.
-Please don't let my girlfriend in.

149
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,552
You'll make me really sad
if you keep saying things like that.

150
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,054
-Will you keep doing this?
-What now?

151
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,473
I mean, I told you last time

152
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,851
that there are only good people left here.

153
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,186
Don't get the wrong idea about them
when you live--

154
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,689
-Please... Please just be careful.
-Your neighbors will be sad too.

155
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,482
-Please be careful.
-Even I feel like this.

156
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,494
Man, I'm so dizzy.

157
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,872
Did she spike that drink?

158
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,790
This isn't good.

159
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,084
I have to get out of here.

160
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,255
Yes. I can't keep living here like this.

161
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,095
I need to check if Ji-eun is home
before I fall asleep.

162
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,983
Didn't he seem a little weird?

163
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,735
What?

164
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,362
The guy who came to our division.

165
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,366
He was talking gibberish.
He seemed a little odd to me.

166
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,413
Do you know why people become weird?

167
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,456
Pardon?

168
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,375
It's not that you're weird,

169
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,045
your surroundings turn you like that.

170
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,007
If people say you're weird and crazy
when you're the same as before,

171
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,509
who could keep their sanity?

172
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,929
That's true, but...

173
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,434
Officer Cho, did you say you lived
in this neighborhood for long?

174
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,647
I didn't just live here for long.
I was born here.

175
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,651
Then do you know anything
about that residence?

176
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,694
I don't know anything in detail,

177
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,323
but a huge fire broke out
in that residence before you came.

178
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,493
So I heard they'll close it down soon,

179
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,788
but the owner's wife continued
to run that place after her husband died.

180
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,375
But there aren't many people here because
this area is designated for redevelopment.

181
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,794
I'm not sure if it's worth any money.

182
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,007
I've seen a lot of people
who live at a residence

183
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,261
while studying
for the police employment test.

184
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,308
But people in residences rarely ever look
at each other in the eyes.

185
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,602
It's a sort of a rule there.

186
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:17,773
You can feel that people are there,
but you keep each other's privacy

187
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,900
by living as quietly as you can
like you're a ghost.

188
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,611
But those people didn't seem
to be like that.

189
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:23,821
Jeong-hwa,

190
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,156
maybe they are more like family

191
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,242
since that place is pretty tiny.

192
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,828
Did they look like a family to you?

193
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,254
Man, I'm sick and tired of killing cats.

194
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,549
Why are we sitting around like this?

195
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,802
Don't... Don't be so smart.

196
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,722
If you keep acting up,

197
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,807
you... you will die at once

198
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,727
like that man in room 302.

199
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,563
Do you think
I'll die that easily like him?

200
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,442
Just... Just you wait.

201
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,195
I'll turn this game over at once.

202
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,699
At once, my ass.

203
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,327
You two are both scared by him.

204
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,500
Don't... Don't you know
that you always have to look

205
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,794
before you leap?

206
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,756
Hey. We have more people.

207
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,510
You, me, and your brother.

208
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,639
And we can always knock out that lady.

209
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,558
Goodness.

210
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,145
You have no idea.

211
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,816
The... The scariest person
in this residence

212
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,903
is none other than Ms. Um.

213
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,503
"He was so tightly tied
that he couldn't...

214
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,588
-How's the young man in room 303?
-...move an inch."

215
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,424
"The little legs on the side..."

216
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,134
-Hey, you know what?
-"...and was trembling..."

217
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,222
-"Legs on the other side..."
-We keep getting flies here.

218
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,099
Shouldn't we wrap this up

219
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,517
-and leave this area?
-"From behind..."

220
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,439
Ms. Um, don't you know what I can do?

221
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,193
Goodness, of course, I know.

222
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,237
I made you who you are.

223
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,197
"However, I..."

224
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,657
But you failed once

225
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,701
with room 302.

226
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,643
This time, I'm sure.

227
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,771
So don't worry
and wait a little longer, okay?

228
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,112
Hey, I'm not worried.

229
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,951
If anything, I can kill them all.
Why would I be worried?

230
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,126
Jong-u.

231
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,672
Jong-u.

232
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,318
Ji-eun.

233
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,195
Ji-eun.

234
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,175
Isn't that hilarious?

235
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,259
Ji-eun,

236
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,471
I told you not to come here!

237
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,185
Ji-eun.

238
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:52,965
This is driving me insane.
I keep having weird dreams.

239
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,443
What's this pervert doing?

240
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,527
Hey,

241
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,404
do you have anything to say to me?

242
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,079
Do you have anything to say to me?

243
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,836
-He's so disgusting. Damn it.
-Hey.

244
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,422
Just let me know

245
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,759
if you want me to kill you.

246
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,930
I'll kill you right away.

247
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,272
Hey,

248
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,233
kill me.

249
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,819
Do it. Kill me.

250
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,030
Kill me.

251
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,657
Try to kill me!

252
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,284
Did you think I'll be scared? Damn it.

253
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,953
Hey, kill me.

254
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,497
It's done.

255
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,251
That unbelievable idiot. Gosh.

256
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:53,877
Hey!

257
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,755
That unbelievable idiot.

258
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,803
-Is... Is something fun going on?
-Why are you stepping in?

259
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,556
Just shut up, you crazy bastard.

260
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,852
Did...

261
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,648
Did you just call me

262
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,900
a crazy bastard?

263
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,862
What are you trying to do?

264
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,448
Huh?

265
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,968
So? Should we do it now?

266
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,261
What?

267
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,683
The talk.

268
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,894
You forgot again.

269
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,190
I don't think we can reach
a conclusion in this way.

270
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,943
May I have a talk
with the man in room 303?

271
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:04,197
It's not even fun anymore. Let's stop.

272
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,200
Everyone is just getting restless.

273
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,537
The guy in room 303 gets you wrong

274
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,748
because you keep saying
weird things like that.

275
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,585
I think you're the one
who's weirder right now, sir.

276
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:38,315
Do you think I'm joking
because I've been nice all along?

277
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,151
So?

278
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,403
Should I take part in this too?

279
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,574
You... You

280
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:49,993
shouldn't frown.

281
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,538
Smile, and you will be blessed.

282
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,417
Let's all smile together.

283
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,588
Apologize. Apologize to him.

284
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,635
I was just bored, that's all.

285
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,889
He... He was just bored,

286
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,976
that's all. Yes.

287
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,526
-Let's go.
-Okay.

288
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:31,284
Gosh, it's not as hot
as yesterday, isn't it?

289
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,120
What did you want to say to me?

290
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,625
It's nothing special.

291
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,378
I wanted to break up that fight
since everyone seemed upset.

292
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,090
So why were you fighting?

293
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,467
He said he'll kill me.

294
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,055
He's pretty weird, isn't he?

295
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:58,562
Ms. Um said his business in China
went under or something like that.

296
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,107
But

297
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,067
I think he swore at you today

298
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,863
because you made a scene last night
while you were drunk.

299
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:09,948
What?

300
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,242
What's he saying? I didn't make a scene.

301
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,369
Oh, you don't remember.

302
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,371
Figures. You were wasted.

303
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,835
You got drunk,
screamed in the hallway, cussed,

304
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,546
knocked on everyone's door,
and made a huge scene.

305
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,965
Me? I did that?

306
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,512
Check the security footage if you don't
believe me. It should be there.

307
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,604
But I like that more.

308
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,522
What?

309
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,443
Instead of bottling everything up,

310
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:51,156
it's better to say what you want
and do what you want to do.

311
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,700
That's more human.

312
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,956
I'll go down first.
Come once you cool down.

313
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:20,769
Jong-u, there were bad articles published
about our show after the first episode,

314
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,563
so we'll have to meet later tonight.
Is that okay?

315
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,446
Yes, I'm fine. I hope things go well
with your work. See you tonight.

316
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,163
Where did I put it? Darn it.

317
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,624
-Ms. Um.
-Hey, come in.

318
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,752
May I check the security footage?

319
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,921
You want to see it again?

320
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:51,716
Yes, the guy in room 304 said
I made a huge scene yesterday,

321
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,635
but I don't remember anything.

322
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,096
-Do you really want to see it?
-Yes.

323
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,560
What?

324
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,080
Stop staring at me.

325
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,707
Hey,

326
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,668
-If you're drunk...
-You need to live...

327
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,629
-...just go sleep, okay?
-...more like a decent human.

328
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,298
Do you want to die?

329
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,885
Live like a decent human, you pervert.

330
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,429
Hey.

331
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,850
I know what happens to jerks like you.

332
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,190
-Live like...
-Goodness.

333
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,902
-Why... Why are you...
-Like a decent human!

334
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,114
...being so loud in the night?

335
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,201
Gosh, it's so loud.

336
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,419
That crazy bastard.

337
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,465
Hey, you asshole!

338
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:17,510
Handsome young man! Last time,
he made a scene, asking me to show him

339
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,220
-the security footage.
-Just go to sleep.

340
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,182
-He's pretty feisty... Goodness.
-Go to sleep!

341
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:26,186
-My gosh. He's coming over again.
-You crazy bastard.

342
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,607
Are you laughing?

343
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,320
Stop laughing!

344
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,158
Stop laughing.

345
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,289
Calm down.

346
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,709
What is this?

347
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,304
You know what?

348
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,940
You are

349
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,570
the creepiest guy here.

350
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,958
Babe, you must be awfully angry today.

351
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,137
Are you okay?

352
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,183
That happens to guys
when they're drunk. It's okay.

353
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,854
But I like that more.

354
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,772
What?

355
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,985
Instead of bottling everything up,

356
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,531
it's better to say what you want
and do what you want to do.

357
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,908
That's more human.

358
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,953
Wait, I...

359
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,622
Something suddenly came up with me,

360
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:13,293
so if I move out now,
could you return at least half of my rent?

361
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,628
Why are you suddenly moving out?

362
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,423
What? I have to be near my work...

363
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,925
No, never mind. Okay.

364
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:27,557
Yes, sir. Our official statement
was released this morning.

365
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,350
Yes.

366
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,604
I sent you the email. Please check.

367
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,522
Yes.

368
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,609
Ji-eun.

369
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:39,861
Jae-ho.

370
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,199
What brings you here?

371
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,744
I couldn't reach you on the phone,
so I got worried and came.

372
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,245
About me?

373
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,622
What?

374
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:54,417
Yes. Both of you. How's Jong-u?

375
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,214
I just saw him off at that residence.

376
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:04,844
It seems like he's having a tough time,
adapting to his life in Seoul.

377
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,638
Gosh.

378
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,766
I thought so too.

379
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,936
-He always tries to pick fights.
-What?

380
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:18,233
He almost got into a huge fight
when we were at the pub.

381
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,360
Goodness.

382
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,656
I had a tough time
trying to hold him back.

383
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,115
Great job, Jae-ho.

384
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,494
Hey, keep giving him a hand for a while.

385
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,501
He keeps trying to fight his boss
at work too.

386
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,670
-That senior of his?
-Yes.

387
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,089
What's with him?

388
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,382
I feel really bad

389
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,551
for calling him over to Seoul.

390
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,302
-No, Jae-ho.
-Gosh.

391
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,597
Let's give him some time.
I'm sure he'll be fine.

392
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,932
What are you doing tomorrow?

393
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:55,770
I'm meeting Jong-u.
We're going to have a talk.

394
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,688
I see.

395
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,815
What about on Sunday?

396
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,192
Nothing special.

397
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,487
That's great.
Let's have a talk this weekend.

398
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,572
About what?

399
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,576
Jong-u is in serious condition.
Things will get worse if we let him go on.

400
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,121
Oh, okay. I'll let Jong-u know.
Let's have a talk.

401
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,623
No, let's not do that.
We can meet by ourselves.

402
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,959
-"By ourselves"?
-He might lose his temper again.

403
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,379
I'll talk to him. I'll call you.

404
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,089
He's making my life pretty difficult.

405
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,300
Okay, I'll call you. Go.

406
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,429
-We're meeting this weekend, okay?
-All right. I'll call you.

407
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,474
Ji-eun, I'm going out for a meeting.

408
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,642
Yes, ma'am.

409
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,105
Why aren't you setting me up
with your senior you mentioned?

410
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,567
Oh, he has been busy lately.

411
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,029
You are leading him on, aren't you?

412
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:46,988
What?

413
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,490
Come on, you know what I'm talking about.

414
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,284
I'll be back.

415
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:20,229
Grandma. What was Grandpa like?

416
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,276
A good person.
He had been nothing but good.

417
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,154
Come on, a person can't always be good.

418
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,990
My husband said,

419
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,161
"If you believe someone is
a kind and a good person,

420
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,373
that person can be as good as,
no, even better than

421
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:42,418
who you expect them to be."
That's what he said.

422
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,234
He left the door open again.

423
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:30,466
Wow, this guy is total human garbage.

424
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,511
I seriously want to get out
of this place already.

425
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,488
What are you watching?

426
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,783
Oh, this is my colleague's case.

427
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,368
Have you seen the remote control?

428
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,663
I keep telling you to leave it

429
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,374
-where it belongs.
-Dad. Listen up.

430
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:08,087
People are disappearing one
after the other at a residence.

431
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,465
But my colleague thinks

432
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:14,761
that residence has something to do
with those missing person cases.

433
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,387
-A case?
-Yes.

434
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:21,434
There's speculation, but no evidence.

435
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,519
That's why he's troubled.

436
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,439
But it really gets on my nerves.

437
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,857
What about it?

438
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,650
It's a residence.

439
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,944
Yes, so what about the residence?

440
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,280
All you can do is lie down and sleep
in that tiny room.

441
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,907
If something like that happens
to you there,

442
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,577
it's way too heartbreaking.

443
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,746
Goodness, you're so nosy.

444
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:45,500
Come on. Don't be so hard on me
if you won't help.

445
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,712
I doubt it's a one-man crime.

446
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,172
Right?

447
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,883
I mean, think about it.

448
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:59,263
There are a lot of security cameras
and people who are watching

449
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,516
-at a residence.
-You're right.

450
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,894
And if someone had been doing this
all alone,

451
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:08,397
it will be difficult to hide the evidence
without any traces.

452
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:13,611
And I'm sure there's a leader among them.

453
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,071
"A leader"?

454
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,866
My gosh, you're so slow.
Will you try to think?

455
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,368
Just give me a hand, please.

456
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,829
-I'm trying to watch TV.
-Please?

457
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,165
-So...
-Yes.

458
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,959
If they're

459
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,670
murdering people together,

460
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,381
they flock around
whoever that's the strongest.

461
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:37,927
Once the leader assigns roles,
they move together according to the plan.

462
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,012
"According to the plan."

463
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:44,350
That's why it's difficult
to find any traces.

464
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,270
I'm sure there's a leader
who's taking the initiative.

465
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,025
Is she the one?

466
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,866
It could be someone else.

467
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:05,830
But this is somehow related
to this woman anyway.

468
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:09,876
Then I'll have to look into her first.
Thanks, Dad.

469
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,506
Hey, wait. Why are you looking into that?

470
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,886
Dad, this is bad. Get ready.
I forgot about the movie time. Hurry.

471
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,263
What's with her?

472
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,147
Do you like it?

473
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,316
Yes.

474
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,526
This room is 350,000 won.

475
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,280
A lot of people came by today,
so you better seal the contract soon.

476
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,949
Or you can put down some money.

477
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,796
-May I go in and take a look?
-Yes, take your time.

478
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,889
How much is this place?

479
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,058
-This room is 250,000 won.
-It's 250,000won?

480
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,228
-You have to decide today.
-Today?

481
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,855
A room this cheap won't stick around
until tomorrow.

482
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,864
Hey, do you really want to move in here?

483
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,618
I'm thinking about it right now.

484
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,704
I'm only telling you this
because I'm not the owner.

485
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,958
-I wouldn't live here if I were you.
-Why not?

486
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,126
Man, this is crazy.

487
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,426
An old man who lived here
passed away recently.

488
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:46,305
-What?
-You know, he lived alone and died alone.

489
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,936
The owner kept insisting
that it wasn't the case,

490
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:56,190
but a cleaning company recently came
and took everything away.

491
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,025
Man.

492
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:03,531
Then will that have an impact on the price

493
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,908
and bring the rent down?

494
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,161
Hey, a person died here.
Do you still want to live here?

495
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,957
I mean, if the price goes a little lower,

496
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,251
I might consider it.

497
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:20,172
Look at how I just got chills.
I can't live in a place like this.

498
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,802
You can't lead a normal life here.

499
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,681
All right, then. I'll think about it.

500
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,099
-Really?
-Yes.

501
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,001
Dad, how's this color?

502
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,504
I'm tired. Just get anything.
Let's go already.

503
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,007
I can't just get anything.
Look at me. How's this?

504
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:08,012
You said we're going to the movies.
They all look the same. Get whatever.

505
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:11,015
How are these the same? You're mean.

506
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,142
Help me as the legend
of the Special Detective Division.

507
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,727
-It's tough to choose one.
-Goodness.

508
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,228
That's an ancient story.

509
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,772
You're really mean.

510
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,034
What is it?

511
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:31,952
What's wrong?

512
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:35,956
I thought I just saw my dentist.

513
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,001
-Is he a guy?
-Yes.

514
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,504
-Is he hot?
-Yes.

515
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,258
He's really hot, but it's not like that.

516
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,931
I know how a man is
when I get one look at his face.

517
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,392
What? I thought you said
that was an ancient story.

518
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:58,938
Goodness, but I can still tell
who's a good guy to be your boyfriend.

519
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,232
This one looks the best on you.

520
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,110
Okay. Let's go. Let's hurry. Hurry up.

521
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,862
-What? I'll get both, okay?
-Okay.

522
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,364
-Really?
-Yes.

523
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,459
Should I ask Jae-ho for an advance?

524
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,462
Even if he does give me an advance,

525
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,714
I'll have less than a million won
after paying for everything.

526
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,175
How can I afford to live in a room
that costs 400,000 won?

527
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,929
-You know my friend, Su-yeong?
-Su-yeong? Yes.

528
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,681
The guy she's marrying
doesn't own a house.

529
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,349
He lives in a rented house.

530
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,519
Wasn't he rich?
He pretended like he was well-off.

531
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:42,565
Exactly. That's
why Su-yeong is completely blown.

532
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,902
I can't believe he doesn't own a home
at that age. What a loser.

533
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,487
Isn't it absurd?

534
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,823
How could a loser like him
want to date someone?

535
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:51,866
Exactly.

536
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:58,581
-Hey, let's go inside and talk.
-Okay.

537
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,626
Did you see him?

538
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,795
Yes, his eyes looked awful.

539
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,199
-Hey, let's go. I'm hungry.
-Okay.

540
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,076
-What are we eating?
-This one.

541
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,536
You eat it.

542
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:43,751
This is driving me insane.
Why do I keep seeing him?

543
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,254
Hey, Ji-eun.

544
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,714
Ji-eun.

545
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,674
What's wrong? Is something going on?

546
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:54,553
Oh, I think it was that guy
from the residence.

547
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,305
That guy?

548
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,100
Did you run into him yesterday?

549
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,437
His hair is about this long,
and he has a pale face.

550
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,065
He wears a shirt that comes down to here--

551
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:09,652
He must be here to watch a movie.
Or it may have been someone else.

552
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:12,947
Listen.

553
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,115
Last time, he came

554
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,201
all the way to my work.

555
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,119
I think he has been following--

556
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,412
Jong-u, please.

557
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,790
Will you stop?

558
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,417
Why do you take things so far?

559
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:27,711
I mean,

560
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,131
you aren't the only one
who lives in a residence.

561
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,009
There are a lot of weird people
when you're out in the real world.

562
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,220
Why do you get overly sensitive?

563
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,266
Do I look like a loser to you too?

564
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,600
What?

565
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,648
-Jong-u, you're too much.
-What's too much?

566
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,900
Ji-eun.

567
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,988
Can't you of all people hear me out?

568
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,700
I'm leaving. You're making me tired.

569
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,204
Fine, go.

570
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,666
You only listen to what you want to hear.

571
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,713
Get a good rest this weekend.

572
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:33,986
Hey, Hyeon-ho.

573
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,779
Did you find out something?

574
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,573
Something isn't right about that woman.

575
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,950
Really? Give me a second.

576
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,745
Okay, shoot.

577
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,414
First off, she married twice,

578
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,334
but she doesn't have any children,
and both her husbands died in accidents.

579
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,336
And her parents died in an accident too.

580
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:51,920
Okay.

581
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,922
And here's the scariest point.

582
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:57,468
She took everyone's death benefits.

583
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,470
It's about a billion won.

584
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:05,225
"A billion won"? Okay.

585
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,062
Then she started an orphanage
with the death benefits,

586
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,649
but that orphanage had fire insurance,
so she got a lot of benefits from that.

587
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,068
I see. Okay.

588
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:17,071
And she took over that residence
once her husband died.

589
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,656
Jeong-hwa,

590
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,241
shouldn't we pass this over
to the Detective Division?

591
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,535
Right?

592
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,205
We should do that.

593
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,249
But all we have now are speculations.

594
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,213
Anyway, thanks, Hyeon-ho.

595
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:37,925
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay.

596
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,229
Hello.

597
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,239
Goodbye.

598
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,865
This is odd.

599
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,659
Why is it so quiet today?

600
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,442
Who are you?

601
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,320
Hi, I'm the new guy across the hall.

602
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,532
By any chance, may I borrow your charger?

603
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:08,951
A new guy?

604
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,286
Excuse me.

605
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,169
-Hello.
-May I help you?

606
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,754
Oh, hi.

607
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,882
I have to use my phone later in the night,

608
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,551
but I don't have a charger.

609
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,678
May I borrow yours?

610
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,199
Thank you.

611
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,202
The convenience store right down the hill
has chargers.

612
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,620
Okay.

613
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:55,956
Thank you.

614
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,628
Thank you. I'll return it right away.
Thank you.

615
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,580
Hey, stop it. Put that away.

616
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,338
Why do we always have to
clean up the mess?

617
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,425
Do you want to cut this, then?

618
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:52,137
Hey, do you think this is easy?

619
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,681
I always need pain relief patches
after I do this.

620
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,988
Be quiet, you idiot!

621
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,158
Be quiet.

622
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,249
Why do we have to be quiet? Why?

623
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,922
Be quiet, you idiot.

624
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:30,050
Did you eat something bad today, asshole?

625
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,344
Are you afraid
that room 303 might find out?

626
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,222
If he does, we can just kill him.

627
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:39,351
You idiot. You were frightened before.

628
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,269
Who was frightened?

629
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:45,816
-Him?
-I... I wasn't scared.

630
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:46,900
Me?

631
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,240
Do you want me to show you?

632
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,993
Show me.

633
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,965
They said no one lives on that floor.

634
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,969
But why do I keep hearing things
ever since the day I moved in?

635
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:38,827
Show me.

636
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,296
Don't... Don't get smart, you idiot.

637
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,590
I'll really do it.

638
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,050
Is anybody there?

639
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,597
Is anybody there?

640
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,272
Is anybody there?

641
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,690
Good.

642
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:12,527
He came to die on his own.
We can just end him here.

643
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,995
I thought he was a quiet guy.

644
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,372
He's a total nutcase though.

645
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,933
Is anybody there?

646
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:57,989
Mom, one second.

647
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,062
Hey, Mom.

648
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,089
Die,

649
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:57,924
asshole.

650
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,345
Yes, Mom.

651
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,890
Where are you?

652
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,308
Me? Now?

653
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,935
Where else would I be?

654
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,314
I'm at home. Why?

655
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:28,955
It's a rule to be quiet at a residence.

656
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,791
You lived here long enough to know that.

657
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,467
I really love this work right now.

658
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,928
So I don't care who it is.

659
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,680
Whoever that tries to tamper
with my artwork,

660
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,976
I will not condone them. Okay?
Do you understand?

661
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,357
Well, I...

662
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,489
Why?

663
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,575
Do you want to leave this place too?

664
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:14,542
There... There's no way.

665
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:18,588
I love this work so much.

666
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:23,843
Okay.

667
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:29,140
Deuk-su took the train to heaven first?

668
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:34,688
Okay, okay.
It'll be great to be there quickly.

669
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:38,984
Mr. Byun, will you listen to what I say
and do a better job?

670
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,822
Of... Of course.

671
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,451
I... I love this work

672
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,245
so

673
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,332
mu... much.

674
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,883
Anyway, what's wrong with your voice?

675
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:09,556
I had a dream about you,
but it was really strange.

676
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,225
Is everything all right?

677
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,352
Yes, everything is fine.

678
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,478
Jong-u,

679
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,731
be careful with people.

680
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:21,026
People are the most frightening
above anything else.

681
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:25,030
Okay. Don't worry about me
and get to sleep.

682
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:28,283
It's tough to go out to the market
early in the morning.

683
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,661
-Jong-u.
-Yes?

684
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,455
It must be tough.

685
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,706
No...

686
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,168
Come on. Don't worry
about something like that.

687
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,003
I'm not a baby.

688
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,048
Children will always be a baby
to their parents.

689
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,924
Okay, get to sleep.

690
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:48,678
Okay. Don't open the window
even if it gets hot.

691
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,389
Okay. I'm hanging up. Go to sleep.

692
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,147
Anyway, who went in there?

693
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,579
Whatever. Let's not get bothered.

694
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,061
Who are you?

695
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:06,816
Who are you?

696
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,328
Run away.

697
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,041
I said, run away.

698
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,472
If someone tries to go into my room

699
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,684
or open the door,
could you take a picture of them?

700
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,686
Man in room 303.

701
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:28,731
-Help me...
-You know, this is all because of you.

702
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:32,026
Come here. Let's eat.

703
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,028
Have you heard of Saemteo Orphanage?

704
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,239
They use the same name
as my dentist's office.

705
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,741
Hey, have you gone insane?

706
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,620
We have nowhere to go now because of you.

707
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,038
Don't laugh like that.

708
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,000
