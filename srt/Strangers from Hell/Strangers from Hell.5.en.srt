NO OUTSIDE VISITORS
ALLOWED IN THE RESIDENCE

2
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,378
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS

3
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,381
AND INCIDENTS APPEARING
IN THIS FILM ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,774
Did I get sick
from eating something wrong today?

5
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,942
I'm awfully tired.

6
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,326
Did something happen today
that bothers me?

7
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:26,503
Did I take some weird drug?
What's wrong with my body?

8
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,048
What is this?

9
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,760
What's going on all of a sudden?

10
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,953
Why am I so dizzy?

11
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,330
Pull yourself together.

12
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,072
Is he really the replacement
for the man in room 302?

13
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:37,949
Why?

14
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,909
Does he look weak?

15
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,581
Deuk-su.

16
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,957
Yes?

17
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,920
You can't judge a person by their cover.

18
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,568
Someone came into my room.

19
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,868
Ms. Um.

20
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,122
-That's nuts.
-Ms. Um.

21
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,333
-Goodness.
-Ms. Um, I think someone was in my room.

22
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,250
-Goodness,
-It's true.

23
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,044
you know everyone who lives here.

24
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,048
No, Ms. Um. I'm sure someone came in.
I already checked.

25
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,133
So who came into your room?

26
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,468
No idea. That's why I'm checking.

27
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,638
Is that security camera working?
Is it recording everything?

28
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,014
Let me check that.

29
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,893
I thought you were a quiet guy,
but you're pretty feisty.

30
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,771
-Just show me. How can I check that?
-Goodness.

31
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,564
It's right here.

32
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,526
My gosh, you're such a nuisance.

33
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,529
Hey, this works.

34
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,865
I thought it wouldn't work since it's old.

35
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,368
Here, you can use this.

36
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,790
Maybe you kept your door open.

37
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,751
I locked it in the morning
and checked to make sure.

38
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,961
And I used dust...

39
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,671
Dust?

40
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,926
I just have this feeling I can't explain.
I found it. Look.

41
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,053
Feeling? What feeling?

42
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:30,395
See that? Look. No one is around.

43
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,523
Goodness, you got paranoid for nothing.

44
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,817
-It's just your feelings.
-This can't be right.

45
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,443
There's nothing going on.

46
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,786
Goodness. What's with that man?

47
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,916
My gosh. He's doing that again.

48
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,502
Goodness.

49
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,506
That guy sleepwalks,
so he keeps walking around.

50
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,341
Does she expect me to believe that?

51
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,595
Wait, did he just open your door?

52
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,685
Wait, go forward.
Goodness, it's not working.

53
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,271
Why did it go off? It's broken. It's gone.

54
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,565
This is really old. It's way too old.

55
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,734
I don't think he opened the door.

56
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,029
Goodness, this isn't going to work.

57
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,740
-It's definitely the pervert in room 313.
-Can I get this fixed?

58
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,492
This is... Young man.

59
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,912
Wait, young man.
Don't do that in this hot weather.

60
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,290
-Hey, man, come out.
-Goodness. Young man.

61
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,210
Hey. Come on out.

62
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,129
Come on out!

63
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:45,261
-What are you doing?
-Goodness, calm down.

64
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,804
-Hey.
-My goodness.

65
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,307
You went into my room, didn't you?

66
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,101
I just checked the security footage,
so tell me the truth.

67
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:58,107
-Ms. Um. You saw it too, didn't you?
-What?

68
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,903
I did see it, but I don't think
he actually opened the door.

69
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,447
You went into my room.

70
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,533
-That's his only undershirt.
-You went in, didn't you?

71
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,327
-Stop it.
-Do you want to die?

72
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,204
-You do, right?
-Don't do that.

73
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,747
Tell me that you want to die.

74
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,916
-I'll kill you.
-Stop it already.

75
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,960
So what? You didn't go on?

76
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,838
-You went in!
-What's going on?

77
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,219
Please calm down.

78
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,474
Are you all right?

79
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,035
That was the moment that I realized

80
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,204
why that gangster trembled so much

81
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,498
when he saw these men.

82
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,922
I'm scared.

83
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,259
I'm frightened of these people
who are smiling

84
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,387
at me right now.

85
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,232
Okay. Calm down.

86
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,942
Calm down.

87
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,444
You should all go back in.

88
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:28,406
Yes, you're all neighbors. Come on.

89
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,576
All right. Goodnight.

90
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,704
Pull yourself together, Yoon Jong-u.

91
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,965
Can we chat for a moment?

92
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,054
What?

93
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,933
What's wrong?

94
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,436
I just heard something in here.

95
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,938
Really? I didn't hear anything.

96
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,441
-What?
-Didn't Ms. Um tell you?

97
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,152
No one lives on the fourth floor
after the fire.

98
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,195
Right.

99
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,905
But I heard something.

100
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,072
Right.

101
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,450
A woman who lived on the fourth floor

102
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,202
seemed to have kept a cat.

103
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,623
That woman died in the fire,
but that cat has been coming in and out.

104
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,167
Should we put out some mousetraps?

105
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,263
The night view here is great.

106
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,058
Anyway, what happened?

107
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,560
You didn't seem like a type
who would get that worked up.

108
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,064
Did anyone ever come into your room
without asking?

109
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,859
The guy in room 310 had a fight,
saying someone came into his room.

110
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,737
Am I getting filmed right now?

111
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,739
I...

112
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,076
I think you're filming me.
What are you doing?

113
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,828
Oh, nothing. It was pretty.

114
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,706
But Ms. Um said she didn't see him

115
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,335
actually go into your room
on the security footage. Is that true?

116
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,004
It's because the footage was cut off

117
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,340
right before he went in.

118
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,010
Come on, of course, he went in. He did.

119
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,305
Figures. People who live here are

120
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,307
all kinds of eccentrics.

121
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,602
Here's why I'm sure of this.

122
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,147
I've been really suspicious lately,
so I put some dust on my laptop.

123
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,401
Once someone opens the laptop,
the dust would fly away immediately,

124
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,779
so you can tell
if someone had been in there or not.

125
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,866
But the dust was gone
when I opened the laptop.

126
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,578
I remember turning off my laptop,
but it was on.

127
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,204
Yes, I understand.

128
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,207
I would've reacted the way you did
now that I heard your story.

129
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,004
Anyway,

130
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,966
you really wanted to kill him earlier,
didn't you?

131
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,342
What?

132
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,553
Think about it.

133
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,307
He's a loser, human garbage
who watches nothing but weird videos

134
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,976
with his doors wide open,
and he came into your room

135
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,730
to touch your things with his dirty hands.
I'm sure it gave you the creeps.

136
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,694
You don't think you fit in here, do you?

137
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,823
"I'm different from these people."

138
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,451
But you're also kind of anxious.

139
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,121
"What if I end up like them?"

140
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,791
No, you think,
"Did I already become one of them

141
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,253
by living in a place like this?"

142
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,092
But don't worry.

143
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,970
You're different from these people.

144
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,599
Because you can do whatever you want

145
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,893
whenever you want
if you put your mind to it.

146
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,105
I'm sorry.
If you're done, may I take this?

147
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,486
Okay, sure.

148
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,408
Hey, Mom.

149
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,411
Yes, I'm about to sleep. What?

150
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,121
-Jong-u.
-Yes?

151
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,457
-Do you have some money?
-Money?

152
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,585
Your brother just had a seizure.

153
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,839
We came to the emergency room,
and we're a bit short on money.

154
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,424
Is he okay? Is he badly hurt?

155
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,637
It's nothing huge.
He fell over and got cut.

156
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,227
So how much do you need?

157
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,437
Do you have about 200,000 to 300,000 won?

158
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,481
Tell me how much you need.
Tell me the exact number.

159
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,902
Never mind. I have to send it
on my phone, so hang up for now.

160
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,863
Okay, Jong-u. I'm sorry.

161
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,408
Forget about it. Don't say that. Bye.

YOUR TRANSFER HAS BEEN COMPLETED
BALANCE: 1,800,000 WON

165
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,119
You're home.

166
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,288
I'm home.

167
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,706
My granddaughter.

168
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,044
Grandma. You recognize me?

169
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,504
Are you teasing me?

170
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:39,383
Did you think
I wouldn't recognize my granddaughter?

171
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,427
Grandma.

172
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,723
Be careful.

173
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,561
Don't trust people too easily. Okay?

174
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,897
You shouldn't trust people.

175
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,733
Grandma, what do you mean?

176
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,029
Who are you, young lady?

177
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,201
-Who is this?
-Grandma.

178
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:36,649
That guy seems pretty nice,
yet he makes me feel very uncomfortable.

179
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,234
The way he smiles is weird too.

180
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,445
Man, I feel crappy.

181
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,770
Did you see that?

182
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,607
That's how you deal with

183
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,735
idiots like these.

184
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,791
Is... Is something fun going on?

185
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,756
It's not always like this around here.
You must be shocked.

186
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,801
There are only good young men
left here now, right?

187
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,846
I know how people like you are.

188
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,848
Hey, smile.

189
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,391
I said, show me a smile.

190
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,810
Maybe you're a bit too sensitive.

191
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,649
But don't worry.

192
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,943
You're different from these people.

193
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,906
Because you can do whatever you want

194
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,241
if you put your mind to it.

195
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,578
It's not always like this around here.
You must be shocked.

196
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,247
-There are only good young men...
-Maybe you're a bit too sensitive.

197
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,541
-I know how people like you are.
-...left here now.

198
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,752
It's not always like this around here.
You must be shocked.

199
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,837
Maybe you're a bit too sensitive.

200
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,412
Man, is there bad feng shui in this room?

201
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,748
I've been getting nothing but nightmares
even since I moved in.

202
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,885
Was he in my room?

203
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,389
Why... Why are you staring at me?

204
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,781
Why... Why are you staring at me?

205
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,700
You're making me embarrassed.

206
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,412
Stop laughing, you idiot.

207
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,875
-My gosh, you're unbelievable.
-It's so hilarious, isn't it?

208
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,836
Ji-eun. I need to talk to you.

209
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,713
Yes.

210
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,845
Ji-eun, I have a favor to ask.

211
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,931
Can you check on the filming
for the making film tomorrow

212
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,100
and follow the camera
to get the actors' interview?

213
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,018
What?

214
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,063
And write up the questionnaire
for the interview before noon,

215
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,981
and have them confirmed by their agencies.

216
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,650
We don't have much time,
so make sure you do it in a hurry.

217
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:53,280
I thought I made myself clear
on the division of our duties last time.

218
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,325
And if I have to be there tomorrow
for the shooting,

219
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,619
I already made
another appointment ahead of time,

220
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,120
so I don't think I can do that.

221
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,332
What?

222
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,962
I called the marketing team, and
they're filming the making tomorrow.

223
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,757
I told the making video team
that we'll be there tomorrow,

224
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,594
and I asked them for help
on getting the actors' interview.

225
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,473
Really? Bo-min,
you took great care of everything.

226
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,309
This person I know couldn't care less
because it's not her duty.

227
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,938
Who? Of course, I should do it.
This is our team's work.

228
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,191
-Thanks. You may go.
-Okay.

229
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,615
Ji-eun, did you hear that?
"This is our team's work."

230
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:38,909
Yes.

231
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,203
Who are we to you, Ji-eun?

232
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,997
Are you going to do your job alone
and get your promotion?

233
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,250
-No, I--
-You always stay out of everything

234
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,626
like this.

235
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,545
Right? Why do you work at a company?

236
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,296
Aren't we all here to work together?

237
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,598
It's okay. You can pick it up.
It must be your boyfriend.

238
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,517
-It's all right.
-Pick it up.

239
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:18,073
-Hey, Jong-u.
-Someone came into my room yesterday.

240
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,616
-I checked the security--
-Jong-u.

241
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,621
Let's talk again later. I'm busy.

242
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,379
Unbelievable.

243
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:43,724
ARE YOU OKAY? IS SOMETHING GOING ON?

244
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,026
-Jong-u.
-Goodness.

245
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:57,446
I'm sorry. I wasn't trying
to make you surprised. I'm sorry.

246
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,783
Are you feeling sick?

247
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,329
-Me?
-Yes, you don't look so well.

248
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:09,833
I just couldn't sleep well. Right.

249
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,006
-This belonged to that foreign man...
-Thank you.

250
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,341
...who lived there before.

251
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,593
-I'll get going.
-Sure.

252
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,387
Jong-u,

253
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,848
did anything else happen

254
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,143
that you thought was weird
at the residence?

255
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,271
-Anything weird?
-Yes.

256
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,859
Well...

257
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,820
-It's the fourth floor.
-Okay.

258
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,738
It's odd.

259
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,242
I heard no one lives there,

260
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,202
but I keep hearing sounds.

261
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,578
What kind of sounds?

262
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,748
You know,
I kept hearing something banging.

263
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,668
-Like the sound of--
-But I'm not sure what it is.

264
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,759
Jong-u?

265
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,554
-I'm not really sure. Goodbye.
-What?

266
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,057
Oh, okay. Goodbye.

267
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,567
It was her.
It was Ms. Um of the residence.

268
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,111
Why did she come all the way here?

269
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,946
There's no reason for her to be here.

270
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,364
Why was she here?

271
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:28,578
My gosh! What are you doing, mister?

272
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,580
Gosh, I'm...

273
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,251
What are you doing? Are you insane?

274
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,421
Forget it. What a shitty way
to start the day!

275
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,975
Did you get some eggs?

276
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,353
Yes, the twins love these.

277
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,938
It won't even last a week.

278
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,066
You're such a kind lady, Ms. Um.

279
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,652
Why were you up there?

280
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,822
I thought I saw some mice,
so I placed some mousetraps.

281
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,115
EDEN RESIDENCE

282
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,618
-Hey, wait.
-Yes?

283
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,621
The young man in room 303

284
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,750
seems to meet that police officer often.

285
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,210
It seemed like

286
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,463
he gave her something this morning.

287
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,509
Did you see what it was?

288
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:28,388
I saw them from afar,
so I didn't get a good look.

289
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,058
What should we do?

290
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,561
We can probably deal
with the young man in room 303,

291
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,689
but that female officer.
Should we get rid of her?

292
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,194
No, I'll manage.

293
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,945
Are you sure?

294
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,699
What if something goes wrong?

295
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,784
Ms. Um.

296
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,913
Don't you trust me?

297
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,709
Goodness, what's not to trust about you?

298
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,253
Okay, you can manage.

299
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,423
I'll just sit back and enjoy the ride.

300
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,018
-Are you looking for a room?
-Yes.

301
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,687
Great, you can take a look around.

302
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,688
Okay.

303
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,942
It's a bit of a climb up to this hill.

304
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:25,612
Summer will pass by soon enough.
It's only tough when it's hot.

305
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,240
It's great
to get a bit of a workout, isn't it?

306
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,784
We provide free eggs,

307
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,620
and I give homemade kimchi
made only with Korean ingredients.

308
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,372
You won't find another room like this.

309
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,540
I see.

310
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,458
Take your time.

311
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,127
May I think about this just a little more?

312
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,046
Why? What are you worried about?

313
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,132
I'm sure you shopped around.

314
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:49,052
You can't find a room like this in Seoul
with that kind of money.

315
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,137
But still.

316
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,305
Did you say the rent is 200,000 won?

317
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,725
Why? Did you find anything else
that's lower?

318
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,853
I can give you a discount.

319
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,604
I see.

320
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,023
I'll give it some more thought.

321
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,192
There's nothing to think about.

322
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,486
You won't find a room like this.

323
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,406
It'll be tough to find another place.

324
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,951
He won't find another room like this one.

325
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,110
Ma'am, it's me. Bok-sun.

326
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,907
Goodness, you're lying down.

327
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,076
Goodness, why did you come

328
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,204
so late this month?

329
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,789
Things have been busy at the residence.

330
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:03,501
I brought some great medicine for you.

331
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,421
-What did you bring?
-This is a good one.

332
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,132
You didn't have to bring this.

333
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,427
Drink up. It's good for your body.
That's it.

334
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,889
-Drink up.
-Gosh, that's refreshing.

335
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,892
I heard it's good for your body.

336
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,604
-Are you all done?
-Yes.

337
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,981
You should get good sleep now.

338
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:30,445
You'll feel much better after that.
Let me help you lie down.

339
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:34,866
Goodness. You've become much thinner.

340
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,286
Sleep well.

341
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:04,104
REASSURING PLUS HEALTH INSURANCE

342
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,777
Hello!

343
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,865
What? Intern, are you here all alone?

344
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,410
Yes, they all went out for a meeting.

345
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,829
Man, they're all slacking off.

346
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,292
I guarantee that this place will close
within a year.

347
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,335
Goodness.

348
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,590
Can you give me the clippers?

349
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,092
Pardon?

350
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,012
Clippers. They're in Byeong-min's drawer.

351
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,149
What is this?

352
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,985
He's a complete stalker.

353
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,409
It's hot. Do you have anything?

354
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,120
Do you want something to drink?

355
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,873
Then I'll have iced coffee.

356
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,666
Let's see how good you are, Mr. Intern.

357
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,171
If you have some fruit,
give me some of that too.

358
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,518
Man, this is excellent!

359
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,731
Mr. Intern, please keep making my coffee
from now on, okay?

360
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,692
Right, so what do you write again?

361
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,902
A play?

362
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,738
I write a novel.

363
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,490
A novel.

364
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:43,286
I see. You're an artist, Mr. Intern.

365
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,789
That's why your coffee is
at a state of the art.

366
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,417
So what do you plan on writing?

367
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,169
A crime novel.

368
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,464
A crime novel. Crime novels are great.

369
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,966
You can ask me if you need any story.

370
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,010
Okay.

371
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,220
Right.

372
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,972
Didn't you say you live in a residence?

373
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,224
Yes.

374
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,852
Then there must be a lot
of unique characters there.

375
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,272
You never know.
There might be a serial killer.

376
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,401
People who study for exams
have a really tough life.

377
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,444
People with a lot of stress

378
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:19,322
have a higher possibility
of committing a crime.

379
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,950
What if someone lies there dead next door?
That's frightening.

380
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,953
-Then I'd know right away.
-What?

381
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,997
You can even hear the next door breathing.

382
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,584
Really?

383
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,587
And there are no test-takers
at this residence.

384
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,717
But I'm sure there are a lot
of unfortunate people living there.

385
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,846
Right, do you remember
the recent internet cafe murder case?

386
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,849
That guy's inferiority complex exploded
on the victim.

387
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,768
I've seen a lot of men like them
over my career as a reporter.

388
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,938
And if you look at their eyes,
they're very sunken,

389
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,274
and something about them is very dark.

390
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,193
Anyway, it seems like
they're suppressing something down.

391
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,279
And where do you think
people like them all live?

392
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,365
They laughed.

393
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,577
What?

394
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,914
They didn't seem suppressed.
They seemed to enjoy it.

395
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,132
-Hello.
-Why are you so late?

396
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,509
-You're here.
-Why didn't you call us before you come?

397
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,011
Hey, where's Mr. Shin?

398
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,764
Mr. Shin? Isn't he in there?

399
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,559
Man, it's really hard to meet him.

400
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,686
Do I have to come
at least three times or what?

401
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,105
Anyway, I have to go now. Bye.

402
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,565
You're leaving already?

403
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,151
Oh, Mr. Intern. Was your name Jong-u?

404
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,988
Jong-u makes awesome coffee.
I'm sure he'll be an excellent employee.

405
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,907
You don't have to see me off. Bye.

406
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,533
Okay, goodbye.

407
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,371
Mr. Intern.

408
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:55,335
Did you take the nail clippers
from my drawer?

409
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,294
Yes.

410
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,713
-What?
-Mr. Cho asked for them.

411
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,427
May I get back to work?

412
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,060
Hey. Where's Mr. Shin?

413
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,687
No idea. Give him a call.

414
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,107
Here.

415
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,654
Gosh, should I start a cafe?

416
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,113
Right,

417
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,366
how's Jong-u doing?

418
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,576
The first question you ask me is
about Jong-u?

419
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,453
You'll make a great wife.

420
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:31,663
I mean,

421
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,708
he seems kind of odd
ever since he came to Seoul.

422
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,294
I wasn't the only one, then.

423
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,714
He always gets really cold
whenever I mention his residence.

424
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,259
Is something going on at the residence?

425
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,427
Nothing is going on.

426
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,931
He's sensitive because he lives there.
And he probably thinks he's pathetic.

427
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,432
Don't be so mean.

428
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,894
So be good to him at work.

429
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,565
Hey, you won't find a CEO
who's more considerate than I am.

430
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,442
It sounded like
his direct senior is bullying him.

431
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,570
Tell him that enough is enough.

432
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,322
My boss is stressing me out a lot too.

433
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,450
All right.
Are you going to keep nagging at me?

434
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:13,955
Why?

435
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,915
Is she annoying you a lot?

436
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,419
What's wrong?

437
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,465
Man, you must be awfully stressed out.

438
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,556
-Here, take this.
-It's all right, really.

439
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,641
Come on, it's nothing.

440
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,352
She'll get angry at you
for going out during working hours.

441
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,478
Thanks.

442
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,647
I can do this much to cover for you.

443
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,858
I'll make sure I treat you
with something good later.

444
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,360
-Forget it. Go.
-Bye.

445
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,322
-Okay.
-Let's grab a drink with Jong-u soon.

446
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,990
Okay. Thanks for the lunch.

447
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,700
-I'll call you.
-Go.

448
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,244
Is that your boyfriend?

449
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,996
Oh, hello.

450
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,876
-He's not.
-Really? I knew it.

451
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,963
He's just a friend.
He was a senior in college.

452
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,925
Does he work around here?

453
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:12,263
He runs a business in Daehak-ro,
and he came nearby on business.

454
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,057
Do you want some coffee?

455
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,683
He came here from Daehak-ro?

456
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,895
Does your boyfriend know?

457
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,647
What?

458
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,900
Are you slow,

459
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,653
or are you leading him on?

460
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,989
Anyone can tell
that he has a thing for you.

461
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,159
It's not like that.

462
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,039
Do you want me to set you up with him?

463
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,834
I think you'd make a better match
for him than me.

464
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,837
Okay, then. Do set him up with me.

465
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,299
Why? You don't want someone else
to have him?

466
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,052
No, of course, not.

467
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,806
Okay. You're looking after your senior
like this, Ji-eun.

468
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,575
You hit it, didn't you?

469
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,663
Seriously? I'm going to kill you!

470
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,917
Why... Why do you say that? That's scary.

471
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,504
Don't be like that. Don't do that.
Do you want to make a bet?

472
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,714
Bet what?

473
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,257
Let's bet our wrists.

474
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,426
All right!

475
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,511
-Isn't it fun?
-Like this!

476
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:40,393
It's the fourth floor.
I heard no one lives there,

477
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,438
-but I keep hearing sounds.
-What kind of sounds?

478
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,939
Something banging.

479
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,994

EDEN RESIDENCE
4TH FLOOR, WOMEN ONLY

482
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,371
Wait.

483
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,291
Open the door!

484
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,752
Oh, no.

485
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,058
Wait, stay still.

486
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,688
Die. Die.

487
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,071
Damn it!

488
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,922
Gosh.

489
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:11,075
Please help me. Please help.

490
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,160
You're badly hurt.

491
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,580
-Please help me.
-Your hands are hurt too.

492
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,376
Please help me.
I hurt my feet, so I can't walk.

493
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,212
Please help.

494
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,342
Then you should crawl.

495
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,053
What?

496
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,934
Why? Don't you want to live?

497
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,689
If you want to live, crawl.

498
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,077
I guess she still had blood flowing.

499
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,628
I heard from Ms. Um

500
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,756
that you two were like sisters
in that prayer house.

501
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,342
I'm sorry.

502
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,470
I'm sorry.

503
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:16,182
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

504
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,892
I'm sorry.

505
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:22,062
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

506
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,106
Stop begging.

507
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,276
You'll die anyway.

508
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,154
I'm sorry. I'm...

509
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:38,537
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Hey.

510
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,583
I brought mushroom tea for you.

511
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,546
You'll be on the express train
to heaven once you drink this.

512
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,466
You're in luck.

513
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,999
Great work this week.

514
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,584
-Great job.
-Good job.

515
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:29,171
You've done well on your first week,
Jong-u. Great job.

516
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,883
Do look after Jong-u, will you?
Hasn't he done well, Byeong-min?

517
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,885
Do take care of him, please.

518
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,304
-We'll do our second round...
-Hello?

519
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,348
-...at the place we didn't go last time.
-Hello?

520
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:42,309
-It might be crowded.
-Hello?

521
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,353
-Please buy some flowers.
-I'm not buying.

522
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,231
-You're helping out an old woman in need.
-Hello?

523
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,649
Please give me a hand.

524
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,442
-It'll be crowded.
-How much is it?

525
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,653
-It's 5,000 won.
-Is it 5,000 won?

526
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,321
Is that for your girlfriend?

527
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:58,826
I thought of my mom who's in Busan.
Here, 5,000 won.

528
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,744
-He's such a darling.
-Thank you.

529
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,871
What a great son. Such a great son.

530
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,377
Should I have bought one too?
I could've given it to my mom.

531
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,005
She sells those flowers
and drives a Mercedes around.

532
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,091
-Do you have a car? You don't have one.
-You can have it.

533
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,386
-May I really have this?
-Sure.

534
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,724
Are you sure I can have this, Jong-u?

535
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,392
Yes.

536
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,022
Please buy some flowers.

537
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,025
-Hello.
-How much is this?

538
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,192
That's 10,000 won.

539
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,529
Why don't you take some fish
to eat raw, then?

540
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,574
Or butterfish?
Butterfish is really delicious right now.

541
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,410
What brings you here?

542
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,246
I'm going to Seoul.

543
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,998
You're going to Seoul right now?

544
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,416
Not right now.

545
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,212
A senior from college said
he'll give me a job at his office.

546
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,423
-Really?
-Yes.

547
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,676
Goodness, I can't believe
you got a job, Jong-u.

548
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,346
Great. I'm glad you made that decision.

549
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,307
-I just came to tell you.
-Okay.

550
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,517
Jong-u.

551
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,646
That senior of yours is a great guy.

552
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,481
Be good to him.

553
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,817
Man, if it hadn't been for Yu-jeong,
we would've gone to a place

554
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,944
where men could have some real fun. Right?

555
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,615
-Hey, what do you think of Yu-jeong?
-What?

556
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,742
I think she's interested in you.

557
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,286
She was thrilled
when you gave her that flower.

558
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,290
Jae-ho, I have Ji-eun.
And Ms. Son isn't that kind of a person.

559
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,542
My gosh, you're getting cold on me again.

560
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,213
You need to get rid of that habit.

561
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,465
Why are you so slow?

562
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,510
What did you want to say?

563
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,762
By any chance,

564
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,557
may I stay at your place today

565
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,936
and just this weekend?
Things are weird at the residence--

566
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,647
I'm sorry, but I have things
to do this weekend.

567
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,274
And I don't let people come to my place.
You know that.

568
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,610
Why? Are they redecorating?

569
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,529
No, the people there are...

570
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,531
Mr. Shin, they're full.
Let's go somewhere else.

571
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,282
-There are no seats.
-Man.

572
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,744
Then let's go to that huge place
where we went to last week.

573
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,122
-You know, the place with darts.
-Let's go to a pub.

574
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,998
Sounds great.
Let's grab some cold beer at the pub.

575
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,543
-Man, those old men. A pub?
-What's good there?

576
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:15,254
I always had to drink alone
with those old guys,

577
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,548
so it's really great to have you, Jong-u.

578
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,143
UNKNOWN NUMBER
DON'T YOU WANT TO KILL HIM?

579
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,228
This place was pretty great.

580
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,484
What is this?

581
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,390
If it really was him, what should I say?

582
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,392
Should I just report him to the police?

583
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,562
No, no.

584
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,357
No, he didn't do anything.
How am I going to report him?

585
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,152
It was definitely that guy.

586
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,505
What the...

587
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,726
I was really popular.

588
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,896
I'm not kidding.
I was huge back in college.

589
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,314
Stop talking nonsense.

590
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,608
All the girls... Hey, tell her.

591
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,193
He's my witness.

592
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:04,029
-Yes, he'd know.
-Of course. He was in my crew.

593
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,907
He's not saying anything.
Stop bullying nice Jong-u.

594
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,868
Hey, I dated the girl
who was the model for our university.

595
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,662
Tell her. Isn't that right?

596
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:15,374
Lee Do. Class of 2008, Lee Do.
You know her, right? Do you?

597
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,376
-See that? She was really famous.
-Really?

598
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,961
She was the most famous one in our school.

599
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,295
You are charming, Mr. Shin.

600
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,505
-Of course.
-What charms?

601
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,048
What? He's good looking.

602
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:26,593
There are girls
who like manly men than pretty boys.

603
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:30,138
-That's right. He looks really manly.
-How does he look manly?

604
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,767
My gosh. I would've punished you
back in school.

605
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,564
-She doesn't need you.
-Enough is enough.

606
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,817
He'd run after her
even before he put on his shoes.

607
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,987
-He ran after her.
-That's enough, kid.

608
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,409
And he kept telling her
that he'll buy her food.

609
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,370
-I'm serious.
-That's enough.

610
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,164
-And he told her he'll buy her meat.
-Hey.

611
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,834
I don't think you dated her.

612
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,839
-You bothered her every day.
-This jerk.

613
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:07,384
-And you kept calling...
-Our new guy must be stressed out.

614
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,928
Should we get going, then?

615
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,222
-I'm going to the restroom.
-Okay, go ahead.

616
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,642
Mr. Shin. Goodness.

617
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,604
-He's going to the restroom.
-Can you pay first?

618
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,689
Mr. Shin, wait for me.

619
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:23,233
He always ran after her.

620
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,029
Jong-u, are you okay?

621
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,030
Hey.

622
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,158
I'm fine. I'm okay.

623
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:34,286
In that case, I'll go ahead and pay.

624
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:39,124
-And this. I'll take this.
-Take your flower.

625
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,339
Wait, I should go.

626
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,681
It's you, Mr. Park.

627
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,853
Hey, Mr. Park,

628
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:06,985
I'll say just one thing today.

629
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,281
Byeong-min... Mr. Park.

630
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,826
Stop gawking

631
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,245
at a woman's behind

632
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,123
when you're at work.

633
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,835
It's... It's not like
you're a damn pervert.

634
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:29,341
How... How dare you?
Did... Did you see me do it?

635
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,927
-Hey, guys.
-I'll report you!

636
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,303
-Do it. Try!
-Both of you. Mr. Park!

637
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,971
-Mr. Park!
-That's sexual harassment.

638
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,599
Come on out, Mr. Shin got into a fight.

639
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,810
-I'll talk to you later.
-Hurry up.

640
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,645
Give us your number.

641
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:42,854
-I can't even wash this.
-How much is it?

642
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,856
-We'll pay for it.
-It's expensive, you ass.

643
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,401
-Let's not cause any trouble, okay?
-Hey, hit me.

644
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,445
-Mr. Shin, calm down. Stop.
-What do you want?

645
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,698
-Hey, hit me. Are you that rich?
-We're sorry.

646
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,659
-We apologize, okay?
-What's with you?

647
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,370
-We'll pay for your shirt.
-Come here. Come.

648
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:00,330
-Hey, hit me.
-We're sorry.

649
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,207
-You apologize!
-I'll give you the money!

650
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,667
Mr. Shin, will you calm down?

651
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,336
-What?
-What is he doing?

652
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,423
-Kill me.
-Jong-u.

653
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,425
Goodness, Jong-u.

654
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,051
Hey, kill me.

655
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:16,012
-Jong-u, stop.
-Jong-u, hey, stop.

656
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,223
Jong-u, this is unnecessary.
You need to stop.

657
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:21,768
-Goodness, Jong-u.
-Hey, hey, man.

658
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,605
Man, this is disgusting.

659
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,358
Hey, are you a kid or what?

660
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,445
You're old enough to have gone
to the army and know not to pick a fight.

661
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,488
You might end up dying one of these days.

662
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,824
See? I knew what he was like.

663
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,868
He... He's a lunatic.

664
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,036
-Don't say that.
-Put that on him.

665
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,664
-Jong-u. Jong-u?
-Hey, wake up!

666
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,583
Jong-u. Get up.

667
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,001
I didn't think he was like this.

668
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:49,087
-Hey, your address.
-One, two, three. Move.

669
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:52,466
-Taxi! The address. The residence address.
-Let's go home.

670
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:56,219
-Jong-u, the address. Your home address.
-Mr. Park, do you know?

671
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,765
Ji-eun, Jong-u got completely wasted.

672
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,225
-Do you how his residence address?
-Jong-u!

673
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:06,271
Just tell him that
it's Eden Residence in Eunhye-dong.

674
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,648
Okay. Okay, I got it.

675
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,108
-I don't want to...
-Don't worry.

676
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,152
-Goodness, watch it.
-We'll get him home.

677
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,321
Jong-u, get in.

678
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,572
Eden Residence.

679
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,658
Hey, get in the taxi. Okay, sorry.

680
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,910
You can do it.

681
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,956
Jae-ho. May I...

682
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,708
What are you saying?

683
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,878
Jae-ho. How about...

684
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,047
just

685
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,382
for one day...

686
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,134
Can I crash at your place?

687
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,053
You're completely wasted.

688
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:43,225
You'll wake up and realize
how big of a mess you were tonight. Go!

689
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,727
-Yes, hurry up and go home.
-Here.

690
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:48,772
Jong-u, watch your head.

691
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,192
UNOCCUPIED

692
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,277
-Please take him home.
-Yes.

693
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,327
Okay, Iden Residence.

694
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:06,873
Hey, wait. Excuse me, sir?

695
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,086
I can't find anything on my navigator.

696
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,046
Wait, wait.

697
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,966
-What?
-Is it Iden Residence, sir?

698
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:20,595
Sir, wake...
Man, this is driving me insane.

699
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:24,182
-One second. Is it Iden Residence?
-Sir.

700
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,477
You can let me off here.

701
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,524
I'm not going home.

702
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,862
-Hey, Jae-ho.
-Hey, Ji-eun.

703
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,656
I sent Jong-u home safely.

704
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,285
May I...

705
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,079
see you right now?

706
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,247
What?

707
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,126
Where are you?

708
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:54,546
I'm on my way to see you.

709
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:01,011
Sir, can you make a U-turn over there?

710
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,313
Excuse me, sir. Sir?

711
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:15,400
Is he drooling?
Why is he drooling so much?

712
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,694
Sir, wake up. Sir?

713
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,488
Excuse me, sir? Sir?

714
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,198
I'm going to Ji-eun's place.

715
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:25,285
What is he saying? He's driving me insane.

716
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,913
Goodness, look at this guy.

717
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:32,208
Sir, your taxi fare is 10,000 won.

718
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,045
-I'll take some money from--
-I'm not going back there.

719
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,547
What? Really? Okay.
But you still have to pay.

720
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,341
I'm doing it.

721
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,844
Excuse me, sir. You're home. Sir?

722
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,429
Sir, wake up.

723
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,723
What? What? No, you're home.

724
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,267
Watch your feet. Look. Here.

725
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,146
-You're here.
-I'll stay at Ji-eun's place.

726
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:56,316
What? I don't know what you're saying.
You need to go. Sir, come.

727
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,068
Let's go. Sir!

728
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,612
-Be careful.
-I got him.

729
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,573
Sir, what's going on?

730
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:08,078
What did he say again?
I got the wrong address, so I asked him.

731
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,873
Then he kept trying to jump out,
saying he can't go home.

732
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,709
And he drooled so much
all over my back seat.

733
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,295
-That's why I brought him here.
-I see.

734
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:21,216
I know him well, so I'll take him home.
Thank you.

735
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:24,511
-He must do this often.
-Well, yes.

736
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,680
-His backpack.
-This is my peak hour, so I must go.

737
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,806
-Sure.
-Take care of him.

738
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,057
-Thank you.
-Sure.

739
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,141
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

740
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,060
I'm not going home.

741
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:35,814
I'm not...

742
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,233
going there.

743
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,655
When did this all begin?

744
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,994
When did it all go wrong?

745
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,002
If I hadn't come to this hell...

746
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,423
If I hadn't...

747
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,188
I can't go home.

748
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,402
Would I have had a heaven?

749
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:30,785
JI-EUN

750
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,219
Why isn't he picking up?

751
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,222
Hey, Jae-ho.

752
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,431
May I...

753
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,351
see you right now?

754
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:37,435
What?

755
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,439
Where are you?

756
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,734
I'm on my way to see you.

757
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:48,488
I'm sorry. I have to go see Jong-u.

758
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,909
Sir, can you make a U-turn over there?

759
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,468
EDEN RESIDENCE

760
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,681
Jeong-hwa, wake him up.

761
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:23,940
Jong-u.

762
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:29,195
Jong-u.

763
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:31,614
Are you okay?

764
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,620
Eden Residence.

765
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,167
What's going on in that place?

766
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,594
EUNHYE PATROL DIVISION

767
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,769
I'm so frightened.

768
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,398
I'm really...

769
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,194
I'm so scared.

770
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,868
Everyone who lives

771
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,164
in that residence is weird.

772
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,802
JONG-U, I'M IN FRONT OF YOUR RESIDENCE
I'M COMING UP TO SEE YOU

773
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,554
Ji-eun.

774
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,600
May I help you?

775
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,521
Who are you?

776
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,234
You must be here to see Jong-u.

777
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,157
-We keep getting flies here.
-Ji-eun!

778
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,577
Shouldn't we wrap this up
and leave this area?

779
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,161
Something isn't right about that woman.

780
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,956
And I'm sure there's a leader among them.

781
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:45,999
-"A leader"?
- Hey.

782
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,667
We have more people.

783
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,211
You, me, and your brother.

784
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,255
Who are you?

785
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,716
Hi, I'm the new guy across the hall.

786
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:58,636
Do you think I'm joking
because I've been nice all along?

787
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,391
Is anybody there?

788
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,062
