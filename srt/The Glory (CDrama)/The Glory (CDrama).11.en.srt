00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,620
(Light, Fu Residence)

4
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,030
Aunt Kou.

5
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
Hurry up. Don't get in the way.

6
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,910
Aunt Kou.

7
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,040
My goodness.

8
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,510
Why did you bring the sheep here?

9
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,380
Why not go through the backyard?

10
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,100
Where are your manners?

11
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,460
It's too high. Lower it a bit.

12
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,580
Stop. Why wipe it?

13
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,900
It's freshly painted.

14
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,180
Let it dry.

15
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,300
Go help in the kitchen if you're idle.

16
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,140
Yes.

17
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,060
The branches and leaves now
are poisonous.

18
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,900
Last year, the Qin family's grandson

19
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,500
died because of this flower.

20
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,820
Take it away.

21
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,860
Yes.

22
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,420
(Aunt Kou, Fu Yunxi's aunt)
How unreliable.

23
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,980
(Sincerity and Noble)
Look.

24
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,820
You've raised your daughters so well.

25
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,380
How enviable.

26
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,780
You flatter me.

27
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,380
They are just empty shells

28
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,780
who can't uphold a family.

29
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,180
You're being too modest.

30
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,220
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

31
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,580
How about

32
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,620
a celebratory wine today?

33
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,140
Come, everyone, please.

34
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,740
Shall we wait for Yunxi?

35
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,500
Once he gets busy with official matters,

36
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,460
who knows how long it will take?

37
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,740
No need to wait for him. Let's eat.

38
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,780
Come on.

39
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,460
Hold on.

40
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,460
Don't move yet.

41
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,300
Sorry, everyone.

42
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,860
The kitchen is busy today,

43
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,000
so I forgot about the important matters.

44
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,140
It'll be over soon.

45
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,100
Sorry about that.

46
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,740
It's okay.

47
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,980
Hanyan,

48
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,020
this is my maternal cousin.

49
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,740
You can call her Aunt Kou.

50
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,380
I've been weak since childhood.

51
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,900
My entire family has relied on her

52
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,420
to manage things over the years.

53
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,020
This is my first visit.

54
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,980
Greetings, Aunt Kou.

55
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,340
I believe you must be

56
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,060
Miss Hanyan.

57
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,780
Sit, sit, sit.

58
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,260
Eat more later.

59
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,860
Cousin, you flatter me.

60
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,770
I'm just

61
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,340
a rough woman

62
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,900
who doesn't know proper etiquette.

63
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,020
I've been fortunate enough

64
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,660
to have you tolerate me by your side

65
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,380
and show off my authority

66
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,500
in your family.

67
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,420
Sorry for offending

68
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,900
everyone earlier.

69
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,180
(Light, Fu Residence)

70
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,340
30 days?

71
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,700
The Emperor said this case
has dragged on too long.

72
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,140
If there are no leads

73
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,300
on Pei's adopted son within 30 days,

74
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,460
he'll hold me accountable.

75
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,820
(Informed but Curious)

76
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,700
Yunxi, in my opinion,

77
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,740
you should resign

78
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,700
from the Judicial Review asap.

79
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,180
Mother.

80
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,860
Back then,

81
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,900
your family died in the chaos of war,

82
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,940
and your father and I took you in.

83
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,540
All these years,

84
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,660
you've never gone against our will.

85
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,340
Even when we asked you
to marry Miss Zhuang Yuqin

86
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,820
to honor that marriage contract,

87
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,460
you obediently agreed.

88
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,100
But now,

89
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,060
your father passed away early,

90
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,100
and the entire family

91
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,940
depends on you to survive.

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,300
I don't ask for wealth
or status for you.

93
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,100
I just hope you and Lingzhi

94
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,140
can live a peaceful life.

95
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,260
But this position in the Judicial Review

96
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,820
has brought you too many troubles.

97
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,660
Your wife passed away,
the house caught fire,

98
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,460
and not to mention
the several assassination attempts.

99
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,980
If you anger the Emperor again,

100
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,180
I'm afraid...

101
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,300
Mother,

102
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,500
you don't have to worry

103
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,460
about the case of Pei's adopted son.

104
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,580
I've made plans in my heart.

105
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,980
Why not take advantage of this holiday

106
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,780
and go back to your hometown in Yinan

107
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,260
with Lingzhi and Aunt Kou
to visit relatives?

108
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,980
Yunxi,

109
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,460
is something about to happen?

110
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,780
Mother, you're overthinking.

111
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,220
It's just a suggestion.

112
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,060
(The 30th day of the 12th month,
Chinese New Year's Eve)

113
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,500
(Light, Fu Residence)

114
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,220
- Slow down.
- I'll fly!

115
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,860
I'll fly!

116
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,700
Slow down!

117
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,660
I'll fly!

118
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,820
Lingzhi.

119
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,620
Aunt Hanyan.

120
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,780
It's freezing cold.

121
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,180
Lingzhi, why are you here?

122
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,940
Father sent me here
for the evil-warding money.

123
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,940
I haven't married yet,

124
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,740
so I can't give you evil-warding money,

125
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,660
but I prepared a gift for you.

126
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,980
It's a silver hairpin.

127
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,540
Why are you giving me this?

128
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,660
Lingzhi,

129
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,580
Aunt Hanyan hopes

130
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,860
that you'll grow up to have

131
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,700
the courage and ability
to protect yourself.

132
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,580
Yes.

133
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,220
Aunt Hanyan,

134
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,660
this is a New Year gift
from Father to you.

135
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,540
Lingzhi,

136
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,420
your grandfather prepared
evil-warding money.

137
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,260
Go then.

138
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,060
This is a kite without a string.

139
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,620
What does it mean?

140
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,060
What do you think?

141
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,140
However high the kite flies,

142
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,580
it'll be controlled
by the string holder.

143
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,660
Mr. Fu, what do you need from me?

144
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,540
You misunderstood.

145
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,620
I need to find my mother.

146
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,020
Mr. Fu, make yourself at home.

147
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,100
I came tonight

148
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
because I believe
there's one more family member

149
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,020
you want to see on this day of reunion.

150
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,420
Shall we go?

151
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,180
Can you take me out of the city?

152
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,460
Of course.

153
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,940
But we must return soon.

154
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,620
Thank you.

155
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,640
Bravo! Well done!

156
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,630
Good!

157
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,850
Good!

158
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,380
They jumped so high!

159
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,230
Good!

160
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,330
Trinkets!

161
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,720
Little ornament!

162
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,680
Take a look!

163
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,740
Think of a way.

164
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,900
Let's play it by ear.

165
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,780
Fine jewelry!

166
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,620
Yunxi.

167
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,780
Beautiful jewelry!

168
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,980
Look at this one.

169
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,260
How about this one

170
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,940
as a New Year gift for Aunt?

171
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,380
You decide.

172
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,700
Miss, you have a good taste.

173
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,820
These are top-quality green coral beads.

174
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,540
It's perfect for a young lady like you.

175
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,940
Let me put it on for you.

176
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,260
Yunxi, she says this is good
for young ladies.

177
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,300
Why not give it to me as a gift?

178
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,460
Let's pick something else for Aunt.

179
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,500
It truly suits you.

180
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,720
I'll give you three sets.
Pick the best one.

181
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,820
Three sets.

182
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,260
Thank you, Yunxi.

183
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,260
Yunxi...

184
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,860
Alright, she won't catch up with us.

185
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,700
Let's get out of the city.

186
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,860
Shall we climb this high wall?

187
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,900
This way.

188
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,620
We'll have to crawl through a dog hole?

189
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,100
If you can fly over the eaves,

190
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,460
go over the wall yourself.

191
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,660
Fu Yunxi, hurry and look.

192
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,380
Chai Jing.

193
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,780
Are you feeling better?

194
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,520
Have you been taking
your medicine on time?

195
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,500
How is the woman who cooks for you?

196
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,500
I'm fine.

197
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,500
I can walk now.

198
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,860
No need to worry.

199
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,860
It's New Year's Eve tonight.

200
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,580
You've sent food and snacks.

201
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,180
Why come here?

202
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,220
The city gates are closed at night.

203
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,380
I thought I couldn't come to see you.

204
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,860
Luckily, Mr. Fu is resourceful.

205
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,820
There's a path out.

206
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,540
What path?

207
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,020
A dog hole.

208
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,260
When we were in Danzhou,

209
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,620
we made dumplings on New Year's Eve.

210
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,420
Today, I've brought the ingredients

211
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,100
so you can eat some hot food.

212
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,440
Good, I'll help you.

213
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,860
Your hands can't touch water.

214
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,380
I brought help with me.

215
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,660
My hands can kill

216
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,740
but can't cook.

217
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,420
Do you remember?

218
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,220
One year, I wanted to put a coin

219
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,100
in the dumplings for good luck,

220
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,950
but we didn't even have a coin.

221
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,620
You told me

222
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,580
a stone would do.

223
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,620
I believed you.

224
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,110
In the end, I bit
the stone-filled dumpling,

225
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,020
and it cut my gums.

226
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,540
You thought I had been poisoned.

227
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,140
Of course, I remember.

228
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,620
The next year,

229
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,300
you refused to put anything
in the dumplings.

230
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,700
It's New Year's Eve tonight.

231
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,500
I'll go fetch a jug of wine.

232
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,700
You can't drink.

233
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,620
I'll do it.

234
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,020
Fu Yunxi.

235
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,580
What?

236
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,940
Let me ask you.

237
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,780
What's the most important thing

238
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,660
to you?

239
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,460
Family.

240
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,740
For me,

241
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,300
the most important thing

242
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,180
is only her.

243
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,840
What are you trying to say?

244
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,740
What do you think

245
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,380
she is like?

246
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,980
A lonely goose.

247
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,060
When all the other geese are afraid

248
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,860
of the cold winter and fly south,

249
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,700
she flies alone to the north,

250
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,860
gathering weeds and twigs

251
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,140
to build a nest.

252
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,140
Do you know

253
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,740
what she really wants?

254
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,660
Forget it.

255
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,100
No need to say more.

256
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,500
Since she entered the Capital,

257
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,620
she's told countless lies.

258
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,780
Except for one time.

259
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,660
When I asked her what she really wanted,

260
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,940
she answered with only sincerity
and bitterness in her eyes.

261
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,100
She said

262
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,780
she just wanted a home.

263
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,860
Now,

264
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,440
the only thing I don't understand is

265
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,860
why you returned to the Capital

266
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,580
from Danzhou.

267
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,060
I've lived in other's home
since childhood.

268
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,400
This time, I returned to the Capital

269
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,140
only to find my home.

270
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,020
Thank you tonight.

271
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,580
Only tonight?

272
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,540
Thank you for saving Chai Jing.

273
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,580
I will always remember this kindness.

274
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,620
If I have a chance to repay you,

275
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,740
I won't hesitate to help.

276
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,060
There's plenty of time,

277
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,540
and there will be opportunities.

278
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,780
Sit down.

279
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,900
Come, Mother.

280
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,180
Come on.

281
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,860
Sit down.

282
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,860
Sit.

283
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,340
The hot dishes are all served.

284
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,780
Once everyone's here, we'll start.

285
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,020
Have you invited Xiwen?

286
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,780
I've invited her three times.

287
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,340
Nanny Chen said
we should start without her.

288
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,260
Nanny Sun, go invite her again.

289
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,660
After all,

290
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,260
this is Hanyan's first Spring Festival
at home.

291
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,540
Where is Hanyan?

292
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,180
She eloped with Fu Yunxi.

293
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,780
What nonsense are you saying?

294
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,100
Hanyan.

295
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,780
Grandmother, Father.

296
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,500
This is my first time spending
the festival in the Capital.

297
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,820
I got caught up in the play.

298
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,100
Forgive me, Father.

299
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,060
It's fine.

300
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,940
Sit down.

301
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,500
By the way,

302
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,020
where's Mother?

303
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,740
Nanny Sun has gone to invite her.

304
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,820
Come on, sit.

305
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,380
Try this.

306
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,600
In my earlier years,

307
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,300
I exchanged letters with Youchang

308
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,780
and learned that you loved
mung bean cakes the most

309
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,620
so I found a secret recipe

310
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,980
made some in the kitchen
when I had time,

311
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,710
and sent them to Danzhou.

312
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,470
I've been sending them for many years

313
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,820
but never asked you

314
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,820
whether you liked them.

315
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,660
So,

316
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,450
all these years,

317
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,700
the mung bean cakes
I received in Danzhou

318
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,870
were made by you, Father.

319
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,500
They don't look great,

320
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,650
but they should taste good.

321
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,900
It's a pity I can't eat them now.

322
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,820
Back then, I kept eating them

323
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,620
for several days to perfect the taste,

324
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,540
and it made me sick.

325
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,860
Try it.

326
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,940
Thank you, Father.

327
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,260
(On New Year's Eve,)

328
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,380
(it seemed suddenly)

329
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,060
(that my life had found its place)

330
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,540
(like a beautiful, fleeting dream.)

331
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,380
(This was the first time in my life)

332
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,780
(I felt the warmth of home.)

333
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,380
(But my mother was absent.)

334
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,300
(This is my first New Year
after returning home.)

335
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,100
(How I wish)

336
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,940
(that my mother could spend it with me.)

337
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,060
(She did finally appear,)

338
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,740
(but...)

339
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,980
Let's eat.

340
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,300
On New Year's Eve this year,

341
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,740
it's rare for the whole family
to gather here.

342
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,020
Hanyan is back,

343
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,620
and Xiwen is with us...

344
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,940
Xiwen, is there anything wrong
with the food?

345
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,500
Tell me what you want to eat.

346
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,340
I'll go make it in the kitchen.

347
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,860
Madam, please try this.

348
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,620
Nanny Chen,

349
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,780
distribute the New Year's gifts

350
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,160
I've prepared for everyone.

351
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,940
Xiwen, you're so thoughtful.

352
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,140
Madam, you must've spent a lot.

353
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,120
It's empty.

354
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,740
All your efforts are in vain.

355
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,180
You'll only end up with empty hands.

356
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,420
I'm just an old woman who's bald

357
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,900
with chipped teeth.

358
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,460
Why would I need a mirror?

359
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,460
Mother, you should use it.

360
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,100
This copper mirror is not ordinary.

361
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,300
What's so special about it?

362
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,460
An ordinary mirror
only reflects appearance.

363
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,900
But my mirror

364
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,580
can reflect your heart.

365
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,860
Yunni pastry.

366
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,940
Xiwen,

367
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,720
I remember you once made this for me

368
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,260
the first two years after we married.

369
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,340
Why are you giving me this?

370
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,340
Try it.

371
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,700
Xiwen,

372
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,620
you try it too.

373
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,540
Don't worry.

374
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,660
It's not poisoned.

375
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,620
Xiwen, you're joking.

376
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,020
Why is it bitter?

377
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,300
All things in this world
have their causes and effects.

378
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,920
Whether sweet or bitter,

379
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,740
it's what you've sown.

380
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,010
You used to accuse me
of missing the New Year's dinner

381
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,300
and not giving out gifts.

382
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,190
Today, I've done both.

383
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,940
Let's end it here.

384
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,820
Nanny Chen,

385
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,140
let's go back.

386
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,620
Yes.

387
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,820
(This dinner is filled
with hidden emotions.)

388
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,780
(Mother's actions)

389
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,580
(made me feel)

390
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,120
(that something serious
was about to happen.)

391
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:05,860
(Insightful and Peaceful)

392
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,700
Ms. Zhou.

393
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,860
Ms. Zhou, Ms. Zhou.

394
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,020
Has the master returned?

395
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,940
The master

396
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,100
was detained in the Palace.

397
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,900
Who detained him?

398
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,860
How should I know?

399
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,540
It seems that several
high-ranking officials

400
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,660
also couldn't get out.

401
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,620
It's said that they are
in huge trouble.

402
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,540
Hurry.

403
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,100
Go tell the madam.

404
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,260
She is a lineal noble lady
in the Capital.

405
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,060
She can surely find something out.

406
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,380
- Yes.
- Hurry!

407
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,620
What's wrong? Tell me.

408
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,340
I heard on my way here

409
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,020
that the madam took all the maids'

410
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,980
and servants' deeds,

411
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,100
saying she was going to cast them out.

412
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,860
What's she up to this time?

413
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,380
The madam is merciful.

414
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,100
Take your deed and go.

415
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,260
Thank you, Madam.

416
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,260
Get up.

417
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,980
My son is detained in the Palace,

418
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,260
yet you're dismantling our family

419
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,820
instead of trying to save him.

420
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,500
Ma'am, you jest.

421
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,780
The madam is just a crippled woman.

422
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,860
However capable she is,

423
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,700
she couldn't reach the Palace.

424
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,660
But we spent money on their deeds.

425
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,940
Why send them all out?

426
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,460
Isn't this obvious?

427
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,940
The master is in trouble,

428
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,460
so the madam is sending them out

429
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,940
to protect the innocent

430
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,340
from dying with our family.

431
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,420
Even if the family collapses,

432
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,180
an old nanny like you

433
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,440
can never talk to me like this.

434
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,340
Ma'am, you've been pretending
to be foolish for years,

435
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,740
turning a blind eye
to the filth in the house.

436
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,180
Why are you suddenly acting

437
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,060
so crazy today?

438
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,940
Perhaps she used my copper mirror

439
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,340
and revealed her true form.

440
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,260
You...

441
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,300
The household keys are with Ms. Zhou.

442
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,900
I'll go talk to her.

443
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,100
(Composure)

444
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,860
Ruyin, what are you doing?

445
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,140
The family is in trouble,
but I'm powerless.

446
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,620
Madam, please take charge.

447
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,300
As you wish.

448
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,100
Thank you, Madam.

449
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,180
Nanny Chen,

450
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,620
lock up Ms. Zhou and her kids
in Gongtong Chamber.

451
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,660
They mustn't leave without order.

452
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,180
Madam, my kids and I

453
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,900
are like birds without a nest.

454
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,580
Even if we fly out,
we'll have nowhere to land.

455
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,020
Why must you lock us up?

456
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,460
Just now, you knelt and asked me
to take charge.

457
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,740
How dare you defy my order?

458
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,340
(Gongtong Chamber)

459
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,620
Mom.

460
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,460
Mom, are you out of your mind?

461
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,890
Why are you handing over
the household keys?

462
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,620
I dare not make
any more mistakes recently.

463
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,140
Why does that lame woman
want to lock us up?

464
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,620
When Father returns, I will...

465
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,780
What will you do?

466
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,900
I'll definitely...

467
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,900
I'll definitely ask Father

468
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,580
to beat her to death.

469
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,980
What if your father

470
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,740
doesn't return?

471
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,420
What will you do then?

472
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,380
He won't return?

473
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,420
Mom, Father...

474
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,140
Remember one thing:

475
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,900
Your father

476
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,100
is the sky of this family.

477
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,980
If the sky falls,

478
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,300
none of us will survive.

479
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,260
What do you want?

480
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,660
Mother, congratulations.

481
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,620
Why congratulate me?

482
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,100
Mother, do you dare say

483
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,180
that the crisis befalling
the Zhuangs today

484
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,340
has nothing to do with you?

485
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,300
Whether it does or not doesn't matter.

486
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,740
Things have come to this.

487
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,740
What use is there in speaking of it now?

488
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,900
It certainly matters.

489
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,220
If it has nothing to do with you,

490
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,020
then it is merely my suspicion.

491
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,780
Whatever punishment
is imposed upon the Zhuangs today,

492
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,420
I am willing to stand with you.

493
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,220
What if it does concern me?

494
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,460
Mother, as the madam of the family,

495
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,980
your fate is tied to theirs.

496
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,700
Why would you risk your life

497
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,280
and throw the entire family into danger?

498
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,260
When you were plotting with Mr. Yuwen,

499
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,220
I questioned you repeatedly,
but you evaded every time.

500
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,940
Were you planning
to drag the entire family

501
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,020
into ruin?

502
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,100
Zhuang Hanyan,

503
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,940
what I do and what I should do

504
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,500
are not for you to question.

505
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,140
Then please tell me, Mother.

506
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,340
What crime has Father committed

507
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
that has caused him to be detained
in the Palace?

508
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,820
Madam,

509
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,260
the officers have broken in.

510
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,140
Got it.

511
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,500
(Deng Mansion)

512
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,180
(Light, Fu Residence)

513
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,700
(Light, Fu Residence)

514
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,900
(Composure)

515
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,980
My goodness.

516
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,260
What crime has my son committed?

517
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,100
Sirs, can you tell us?

518
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,220
My master...

519
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,820
Where is my master?

520
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,660
Move.

521
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,460
Everyone, sorry about this.

522
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,540
I'm Yuwen Chang'an, Left Imperial Censor
of the Department of Supervision.

523
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,980
Today, I am carrying the Imperial Sword

524
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,180
to investigate the Zuohang Gang case.

525
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,380
Upon investigation,

526
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,180
Pei Dafu's adopted son

527
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,880
is hiding among the officials

528
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,540
who are detained in the Palace today.

529
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,140
Once evidence is gathered,

530
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,380
we can arrest the Pei remnants.

531
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,020
If Mr. Zhuang is innocent,

532
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,940
you'll be released without charge.

533
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,300
But before that,

534
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,500
please go to the Yinan Guild Hall

535
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,020
to cooperate with my investigation.

536
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,420
How could my son be Pei's adopted son?

537
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,140
My father is an honest official.

538
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,300
He'd never associate
with corrupt officials.

539
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,420
Mr. Yuwen,

540
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,420
what will happen

541
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,740
if you find Pei's adopted son?

542
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,020
According to His Majesty's decree,

543
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,740
any family taking in Pei's adopted son

544
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,260
will be executed.

545
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,820
(Act with Caution)

546
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,100
(Dutiful and Blessed)

547
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,060
They say the Emperor needs
to discuss things with us.

548
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,100
It's already late.

549
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,380
Why is there no news?

550
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,500
Yes.

551
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,980
There are guards outside the door

552
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,220
and so many bathtubs set up inside.

553
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,740
It doesn't look
as if they're for discussions.

554
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,740
Mr. Han, what do you think

555
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,760
has happened?

556
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,780
Mr. Deng,

557
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,460
haven't you figured it out?

558
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,900
The 11 people in the hall

559
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,700
are all from Yinan.

560
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,380
Why is that?

561
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,900
Mr. Yuwen,

562
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,740
why are you here?

563
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,620
All of you are our talented officials.

564
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,820
This past year, you've worked hard
and offered valuable advice,

565
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,660
so on the first day of the New Year,

566
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,300
I've prepared baths for everyone

567
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,940
to wash away your hardships
of the past year.

568
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,380
- Please.
- Baths?

569
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,740
Did the Emperor

570
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,820
order this?

571
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,100
The Emperor gave me

572
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,580
the Imperial Sword

573
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,620
to take over the Zuohang Gang
from the Judicial Review.

574
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,140
This is

575
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,180
my arrangement.

576
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,340
Mr. Yuwen,

577
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,700
I don't understand

578
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,260
what you mean by this.

579
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,420
It's said that the high-ranking members
of the Pei faction

580
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,860
were forced by Pei Dafu

581
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,220
to be castrated as proof of loyalty.

582
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,420
Mr. Yuwen,

583
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,380
are you trying to check
if we're mutilated?

584
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,220
Mr. Yuwen is suspecting us.

585
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,260
We have conclusive evidence

586
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,340
that Pei's adopted son

587
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,140
is hiding

588
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,980
among the officials here.

589
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,660
How could this be?

590
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,980
What is this nonsense?

591
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,340
How could we be like those eunuchs?

592
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,340
- Exactly.
- What a joke.

593
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,260
Unfortunately,

594
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,060
we're from Yinan,
just like that eunuch.

595
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,300
But Mr. Fu, my in-law,

596
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,220
passed away last year,

597
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,460
so he avoided today's disaster.

598
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,420
Fortune and misfortune are inseparable.

599
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,380
Yes.

600
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,340
He is also from Yinan.

601
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,460
Mr. Yuwen.

602
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,820
Everyone,

603
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,780
I will investigate the situation

604
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,460
about Fu Pingsheng.

605
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,180
If you want to leave the Palace sooner

606
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,660
and have a peaceful holiday,

607
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,060
please cooperate.

608
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,780
Dear officials,

609
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,300
please.

610
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,660
(Act with Caution)

611
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,060
Mr. Yuwen.

612
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,100
How is it going?

613
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,460
There might be a mistake.

614
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,260
None of them are mutilated.

615
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,300
That adopted son

616
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,540
carries Pei Dafu's personal fortune.

617
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,700
Perhaps

618
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,540
to help him hide,

619
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,900
he was not forced to be castrated.

620
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,860
What is your next plan?

621
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,860
In that case,

622
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,460
we can only start with their families.

623
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,700
Hurry up.

624
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,180
Why are we being detained here?

625
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,420
- Will we be tortured?
- Move!

626
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,180
- Don't worry.
- Move!

627
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,980
The master is always dutiful.

628
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,500
I'm sure this has nothing to do with us.

629
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,540
Once this is settled,

630
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,100
we can go back.

631
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,180
Why are you alone?

632
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,500
This morning,

633
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,380
my mother took the family
back to Yinan to visit relatives.

634
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,940
You were in charge of the Pei case.

635
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,660
Why did this suddenly go wrong?

636
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,180
Do you know anything about it?

637
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,060
You shameless rats.

638
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,840
The guild hall has over ten guest rooms.

639
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,520
Even if we need to be questioned,

640
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,140
why do we have to be locked

641
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,620
in this cold, dark place?

642
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,060
- Exactly.
- Yes.

643
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,860
(Zhang Wanjun, daughter-in-law)
Quiet.

644
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,780
Yes. How is this case related to us?

645
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,660
Let's wait and see.

646
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,640
(Deng Zaiye, Mr. Deng's grandson)
If it turns out

647
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,700
that this has nothing to do
with my family,

648
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,300
I will go find Yuwen Chang'an

649
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,580
and demand an explanation.

650
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,900
