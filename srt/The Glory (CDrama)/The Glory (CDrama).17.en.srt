1
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:41,220
=The Glory=

2
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,280
It's rare for Yunxi
to have a meal at home.

3
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,120
Yunxi, try this.

4
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,280
Your aunt specially made these

5
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,770
(Six years ago)
for you.

6
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,760
Eat more.

7
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,350
You must've been too busy with work

8
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,560
to have regular meals.

9
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,050
Look at you. You've lost weight.

10
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,790
Sorry for worrying you, Mother.

11
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,110
If you don't want us to worry,

12
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,840
you should find someone

13
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,150
who cares for you.

14
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,230
I know that your mind

15
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,950
is set on your work,

16
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,410
and you have no interest in romance.

17
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,910
But a man must marry.

18
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,230
You should start a family
and then work on your career.

19
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,430
Besides, your marriage
with a Zhuang girl

20
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,550
was arranged long ago.

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,950
If you continue to delay the wedding,

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,880
others may think

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,390
we are intentionally rejecting them,

24
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,080
which would be improper.

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,030
Exactly.

26
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,790
Yuqin, their eldest daughter,

27
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,950
though born of a concubine,

28
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,420
was raised by her grandmother

29
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,200
from a young age.

30
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,360
She is truly gentle

31
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,040
and refined.

32
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,360
You two look perfect together.

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,360
You would make a fine match.

34
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,390
Your aunt is right.

35
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,880
Yunxi,

36
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,670
I don't mean to lecture you,

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,400
but you should consider

38
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,670
your parents' feelings.

39
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,870
Back then, your parents

40
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,320
took you in as their own,

41
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,300
not only because of their kindness

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,550
and compassion

43
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,990
but also because they had no children

44
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,790
and hoped you'd continue
the family line.

45
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,640
Now that they are growing old,

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,320
if not you,

47
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,360
then who can they rely on?

48
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,080
I am ashamed.

49
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,860
I did not think things through.

50
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,480
Don't listen to your aunt's nonsense.

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,440
Your father and I did have
such thoughts back then,

52
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,790
but at most, that accounted for 20%.

53
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,760
As for the other 80%,

54
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,550
we only wished for you

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,390
to live a life of peace and joy,

56
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,360
to find someone who understands you,

57
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,950
and to have children to care for you.

58
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,960
Otherwise, when your father
and I are gone,

59
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,670
how could I rest in peace
knowing you'd be

60
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,480
left alone in this world?

61
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,230
I only fear

62
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,320
that I will wrong Miss Zhuang Yuqin.

63
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,390
Don't worry.

64
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,080
Yuqin has already agreed.

65
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,830
We're only waiting for you to say yes.

66
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,300
(Happiness)

67
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,900
(A year later)

68
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,240
Don't drink it, Yuqin.

69
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,470
Someone!

70
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,560
(Spirit Table of Zhuang Yuqin)
Yuqin, if your spirit lingers,

71
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,640
please bless Yunxi

72
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,640
so he can find the one who poisoned you.

73
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,910
The one who killed Yuqin

74
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,270
was me.

75
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,440
That poisoned wine

76
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,000
was meant for me.

77
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,990
Yunxi...

78
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,510
Yuqin was pure and kind

79
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,350
and grew up at her home.

80
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,680
But I served in the Judicial Review,

81
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,150
judging cases of the damned,

82
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,200
stained by the blood of demons,

83
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,030
and surrounded by conspiracies

84
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,150
and deceit.

85
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,200
I should've foreseen this day.

86
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,590
You've spent your life
hunting criminals,

87
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,120
enduring hardship and danger,

88
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,310
yet in the end,

89
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,470
can't you even have the simple happiness

90
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,470
of a peaceful family life?

91
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,760
A peaceful family life...

92
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,740
=Episode 17=

93
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,030
You become my wife,

94
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,320
and I will be your strategist.

95
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,510
Within one year,

96
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,680
I will make you the noblest lady
in the Capital.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,920
What do you think?

98
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,270
Why did you

99
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,760
choose me?

100
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,390
On the first day
you entered the Capital,

101
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,000
the moment we met,

102
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,360
I could sense a special scent

103
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,800
in you.

104
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,240
It did not belong
to a delicate young lady

105
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,590
or a sheltered noblewoman.

106
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,440
However fragile and innocent
you pretend to be,

107
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,390
and however many people you deceive,

108
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,240
you can't fool me.

109
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,280
With just one glance,

110
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,880
I knew

111
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,830
that perhaps

112
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,450
you were the one I had been looking for.

113
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,040
Your family's old grievances
are tangled,

114
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,800
and the relationships
in the inner chambers

115
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,840
are even more intricate.

116
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,000
Yet you move within them
like a fish in water,

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,590
handling everything with ease.

118
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,910
That note was instructed by me
to be hidden in a candle.

119
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,320
Vague as it was,

120
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,070
(Arms tattooed with "Thief")
you still knew

121
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,310
what it meant immediately.

122
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,910
You are truly sharp.

123
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,590
Again and again, I approached you,

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,920
tempted you,

125
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,830
hoping to extract the truth

126
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,880
about the Danzhou case from you.

127
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,000
Yet you never trusted me.

128
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,800
Your caution

129
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,200
is indeed rare.

130
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,150
When Chai Jing took the blame
and was arrested,

131
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,830
I observed you once more.

132
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,640
You are ruthless when you need to be,

133
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,320
but you also value loyalty
above all else.

134
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,350
When your family fell into peril,

135
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,230
you remained calm and turned the tide

136
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,990
by carrying the corpse
to save your family.

137
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
To achieve your goals,

138
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,390
you even tried to kill me.

139
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,440
Each and every one of these moments

140
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,360
can prove that you're capable

141
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,150
of protecting your family.

142
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,200
Mr. Fu, you don't need

143
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,350
a gentle and virtuous wife.

144
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,910
Instead, you want
someone presumptuous like me

145
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,510
who has blood on their hands?

146
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,830
What a rare choice.

147
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,080
What I am doing

148
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,150
is not to seek a wife

149
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,290
but to find an ally.

150
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,860
Mr. Fu, thank you for your recognition.

151
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,950
But you have far-reaching power.

152
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,830
Why go to such lengths

153
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,390
to seek a weak woman
like me as your ally?

154
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,000
Over the years,

155
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,780
due to my duties in the Judicial Review,

156
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,680
I've made many enemies in the Capital.

157
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,630
Countless people want to take my life.

158
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,030
In such a perilous environment

159
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,520
where dangers lurk,

160
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,440
when I fall asleep every night,

161
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,950
I don't know if I'll see
the morning sun again.

162
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,710
However,

163
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,280
my mother is old, and Lingzhi is young.

164
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,400
I can't neglect their future.

165
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,560
You want to sacrifice a woman's life

166
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,160
to protect your family?

167
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,990
What I have just told you

168
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,520
is not a request

169
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,080
but a deal.

170
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,500
I've been planning this for a long time,

171
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,440
but it was your words
at the Lantern Festival

172
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,080
that made me decide

173
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,870
to bring this matter up to you.

174
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,030
If you want to marry someone else,

175
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,830
support your husband,
and raise children,

176
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,400
the marriage contract
will no longer matter.

177
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,120
From now on,

178
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,510
I will not make things hard for you.

179
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,200
You and I will have no further ties.

180
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,320
But if you are willing to marry me

181
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,840
and become my wife,

182
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,470
I will not take your chastity,

183
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,110
but I can be your stepping stone

184
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,350
and your ladder to the clouds.

185
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,710
With my power and ability,

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,480
I'll help you get everything you want

187
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,710
and elevate you to a high position.

188
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,060
Zhuang Hanyan,

189
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,500
this is a deal.

190
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,220
We'll both take what we need.

191
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,660
Whether you agree or not
is entirely up to you.

192
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,540
I will never force you.

193
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,020
If you remain silent,

194
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,340
I will take it as a refusal.

195
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,820
So, you have a clear purpose

196
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,460
for everything you've done.

197
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,180
Indeed.

198
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,340
This is in line with your usual style.

199
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,540
It's getting late.

200
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,740
Mr. Fu, you should go back.

201
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,100
(I can feel his sincerity.)

202
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,300
(But this sincerity)

203
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,700
(contradicts my expectations.)

204
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,460
(Are all his schemes)

205
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,180
(solely because of my abilities?)

206
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,500
(Hasn't he had any feelings for me?)

207
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,100
(If we were to become allies,)

208
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,980
(could I truly)

209
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,180
(trust you?)

210
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,300
(Flying Swan on Snow)

211
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,420
Miss.

212
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,860
Miss?

213
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,340
What's on your mind?

214
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,540
It's nothing.

215
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,620
Ms. Tan, let me walk you out.

216
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,300
Miss Hanyan,

217
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,100
I just noticed Mrs. Zhuang's bruises
all over her body.

218
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,980
There's almost no place
to apply acupuncture.

219
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,420
It must be due to her daily practice
of walking.

220
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,780
Miss Hanyan, please take extra care,

221
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,260
and don't let her push herself too hard.

222
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,980
Thank you for the reminder, Ms. Tan.

223
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,660
I should've prescribed some corydalis

224
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,520
to help invigorate the blood,
dispel the bruises, and relieve pain,

225
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,140
but the medicine has been out of stock
in the Capital recently.

226
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,740
Miss Hanyan, please check the pharmacies

227
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,090
to see if there are any left.

228
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,100
Yes, I will look into it.

229
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,020
If you can't find any,

230
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,460
go to Mr. Fu and ask for some.

231
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,550
He took all of it

232
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,380
from the Imperial Hospital.

233
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,540
Fu Yunxi?

234
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,540
Was he injured?

235
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,700
It was due to the case of Duke Shunping.

236
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,200
Mr. Fu failed to conduct
the interrogation properly

237
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,700
and mistakenly killed a Duke.

238
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,400
Not only was he dismissed from his post,

239
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,420
but he was also canned at Yongding Gate.

240
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,020
If he hadn't fainted on the spot

241
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,720
and been carried
to the Imperial Hospital,

242
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,420
I wouldn't have had the time
to notice that.

243
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,300
When did this happen?

244
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,780
It was probably

245
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,660
around the Lantern Festival.

246
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,780
You...

247
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,660
Did you get hurt on your back?

248
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,300
It's a small wound. It's nothing.

249
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,060
What's wrong?

250
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,540
Do you know where he's being treated?

251
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,500
Nanshan Clinic.

252
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,180
(Nanshan Clinic)

253
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,860
This wound is deep to the bone.

254
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,940
If it's not treated properly,

255
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,620
it could turn into an ulcer.

256
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,660
Physician Wu,

257
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,820
please advise him to take care of this.

258
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,000
He's been running around all day

259
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,920
and not treating the injury seriously.

260
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,260
Mr. Fu,

261
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,220
if you receive more canes,

262
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,540
your life could be in danger.

263
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,900
You have a mother and a daughter.

264
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,540
For their sake,

265
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,180
you should

266
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,100
take better care of yourself.

267
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,740
Thank you for your kindness,
Physician Wu.

268
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,980
My pleasure.

269
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,580
The gauze is running out.

270
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,140
I'll go fetch some more.

271
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,900
Please wait, Mr. Fu.

272
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,820
Sure.

273
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,820
My Lord,

274
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,380
there's a draught here.

275
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,960
Be careful not to catch a cold.

276
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,660
Please, sit here.

277
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,260
Come on.

278
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,820
This is too serious.

279
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,380
Here.

280
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,620
In the past, the most important things

281
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,300
in your eyes

282
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,160
were only Lingzhi and your mother.

283
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,660
But now,

284
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,020
to save Miss Hanyan
who values her mother,

285
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,860
you've left your own family behind.

286
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,580
It's a matter of priorities.

287
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,460
Because I cherish my loved ones,

288
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,420
I can understand how she must've felt.

289
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,820
Why don't you tell her?

290
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,900
You secretly helped her

291
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,900
remove her name
from her family register, right?

292
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,500
Stop talking nonsense.

293
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,220
Her mother did that.

294
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,540
I was a step too late.

295
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,680
What difference does it make?

296
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,980
Anyway,

297
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,700
you never intended to harm her.

298
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,060
You even left her a way out.

299
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,540
What's more,

300
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,740
you knew that once Wu Youzhi's body
was discovered,

301
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,700
you'd be dismissed

302
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,980
and canned,

303
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,140
yet you still hid in the bamboo forest,

304
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,940
watching Miss Hanyan take the body

305
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,020
and bring it to the Capital,

306
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,700
while you

307
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,020
silently took all the blame.

308
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,460
My Lord,

309
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,180
how affectionate of you.

310
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,740
If you keep spouting nonsense,

311
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,500
I'll cut out your tongue.

312
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,600
What nonsense have I said?

313
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,740
You've done so much for her,

314
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,760
yet you've never

315
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,220
let Miss Hanyan know.

316
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,020
You even said you proposed to her

317
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,140
because you wanted her
to protect your family.

318
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,980
Of course, she'd reject you.

319
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,220
She probably even thought

320
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,800
you had ulterior motives.

321
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,040
To investigate the case
of the adopted son,

322
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,060
I nearly harmed her family before.

323
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,860
She has every right
to hate and suspect me.

324
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,980
If I had told her about it,

325
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,220
it would have felt

326
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,940
like I was forcing her to repay me.

327
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,060
That's not what I wanted.

328
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,860
She should follow her heart

329
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,500
to decide whether to marry me.

330
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,340
Moreover,

331
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,300
I do want something from her.

332
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,100
That's the reason why I proposed.

333
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,020
I don't believe it.

334
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,860
You've risked your life and tried
every possible way to protect her.

335
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,840
Is that really just part of your plan?

336
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,100
Is there no real feeling involved?

337
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,420
I'll assume you have feelings for her.

338
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,200
You were married before.

339
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,660
What's there to be embarrassed about?

340
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,580
Get out.

341
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,120
You're flustered because I hit the mark.

342
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,400
My Lord, don't be upset.

343
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,140
I'll head back to the Judicial Review.

I can stand up now.

- Why can't it move?
- Mother.

Why does it feel like it's dead?

371
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,420
Mother.

00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,380
Mother.

375
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Don't be angry.

376
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,060
You were able to stand for a moment
after losing your cane,

377
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,900
which is already a great improvement.

378
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,660
With such a chronic illness,

379
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,660
you must give yourself more time.

380
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,460
Hanyan,

381
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,260
if my legs

382
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,140
can't be cured...

Mother, have you thought about this?

387
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,140
Maybe your disease is not

388
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,180
the only reason
that your legs can't move.

389
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,420
It may partly be because your legs

390
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,700
carry too much anger and hatred.

391
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,680

00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,460

Ms. Tan ordered me

00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,140
to let go of my anger.

477
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,220
Mr. Yuwen invited me to leave
and live in seclusion.

479
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,300
if my legs heal,

480
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,580
it would be like living a second life.

481
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,780
There's also my youthful romance.

485
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,020
If I miss the second one today,

486
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,980
it would be like he's ruined my life.

487
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,940
Perhaps it's time to let go

488
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,940
of those old grievances from the past.

489
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,800
Mother, have you decided to leave?

490
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,620
20 years ago,

491
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,060
I married Zhuang Shiyang openly

492
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,860
through the main gate.

493
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,620
Now, if I want to leave,

494
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,900
I don't want to sneak away unnoticed.

495
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,700
I want to leave openly too.

496
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,780
I want to divorce him.

497
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,940
I don't think Father

498
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,860
will sign the divorce letter.

499
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,500
If I can't get the divorce letter,

500
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,820
even if I leave the residence,

501
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,820
I'll still be Zhuang Shiyang's wife
for this life.

502
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,580
I despise this disgusting title.

503
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,300
I want to sever all ties with him

504
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,340
completely and thoroughly.

505
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,380
Mother,

506
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,140
leave this to me.

507
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,780
I'll talk to him.

508
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,080
You don't have to intervene.

509
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,660
Let me try.

510
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,620
For now, just focus
on recovering your health.

511
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,660
That's your top priority.

512
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,900
Do you have a way?

513
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,360
One should strike the enemy
on their weakness.

514
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,780
Mother, have you forgotten

515
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,260
what Father is most afraid of?

516
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,140
Only the matter of the adopted son.

517
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,060
- You...
- Mother, don't worry.

518
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,940
I won't act rashly.

519
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,460
After discussing with Fu Yunxi,

520
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,860
I'll plan accordingly.

521
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,860
Actually, I've been meaning to ask you.

522
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,620
Since Fu Yunxi
has made his feelings clear,

523
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,660
what are your plans?

524
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,300
What if I say

525
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,180
I want to stay?

526
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,460
Do you intend to marry him?

527
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,580
For me,

528
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,980
he's at least a good ally.

529
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,060
Hanyan,

530
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,100
what do you think is
the most precious feeling

531
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,900
between people?

532
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,460
Love?

533
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,380
Cherishing?

534
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,580
No.

535
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,700
It's trust.

536
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,220
Life is full of hardships and setbacks.

537
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,860
Before marriage,

538
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,260
your life ally is your parents.

539
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,820
After marriage,

540
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,500
your life ally becomes your husband.

541
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,740
Is Fu Yunxi

542
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,500
someone you can truly trust?

543
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,260
I am willing

544
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,380
to trust him once.

545
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,900
Hanyan,

546
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,220
before, I encouraged you to pursue love,

547
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,060
but today, I must remind you

548
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,900
that in the eyes of the world,

549
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,660
a virtuous wife and good mother

550
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,900
are the highest praises for women.

551
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,900
But you must love yourself

552
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,940
and choose to be yourself

553
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,220
before becoming a good wife

554
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,620
and a good mother.

555
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,980
I have worked tirelessly to heal my legs

556
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,500
in order to pursue my own life.

557
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,540
Whoever you marry in the future,

558
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,940
I hope you will not rely
on others to live

559
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,700
or live for others.

560
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,500
I shall remember your teachings.

561
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,860
(Chaling Tavern)

562
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,020
Miss Hanyan,

563
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,420
why did you change your mind so quickly?

564
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,340
Fu Yunxi,

565
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,180
can I trust you?

566
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,460
I just want to tell you

567
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,660
I've never wanted to harm you.

568
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,940
But you

569
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,620
still have secrets.

570
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,860
Everyone has secrets.

571
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,940
Even ordinary couples

572
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,220
rarely have complete honesty.

573
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,340
If I agree to marry you,

574
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,340
can you agree to two conditions?

575
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,020
What are they?

576
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,180
The first condition is

577
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,580
that from now on,

578
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,420
I won't ask you to be completely open,

579
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,540
but no matter when I have doubts

580
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,940
and ask you,

581
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,980
you can't hide anything from me,

582
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,860
and you must answer truthfully.

583
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,860
Can you do that?

584
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,140
I promise you.

585
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,660
The second condition is

586
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,500
a divorce letter.

587
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,420
My mother has decided
to let go of old grudges

588
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,460
and will leave here
to live in seclusion,

589
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,060
but before that,

590
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,660
I must get Zhuang Shiyang

591
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,140
to sign the divorce letter.

592
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,940
What do you want me to do?

593
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,860
You were so certain before

594
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,060
that Zhuang Shiyang
is Pei's adopted son.

595
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,700
I need the evidence of this asap.

596
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,820
Your father hides his cleverness
in simplicity.

597
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,540
If it were so easy to get evidence,

598
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,060
I would've already imprisoned him.

599
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,740
I know this won't be easy,

600
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,860
so I need you

601
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,860
to work with me on this.

602
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,020
Though it's hard to obtain evidence,

603
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,460
if we can make him admit it in person,

604
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,460
perhaps that could be
leverage to force him

605
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,060
to sign the divorce letter.

606
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,340
Do you have a way?

607
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,500
Do you know why I was so sure

608
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,580
that Zhuang Shiyang is likely
Pei's adopted son?

609
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,180
I asked you before,

610
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,980
but you didn't tell me the truth.

611
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,420
The head of the Danzhou
Chamber of Commerce

612
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,420
testified that in June two years ago,

613
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,340
he met Pei's adopted son in Danzhou.

614
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,380
When I returned to the Capital,

615
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,980
I investigated the whereabouts

616
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,860
of the 12 officials
from Yinan two years ago,

617
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,660
including my late father.

618
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,260
11 of them never left the Capital.

619
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,460
Only Zhuang Shiyang
claimed to be ill at home,

620
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,540
so his whereabouts were uncertain.

621
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,500
Since it was uncertain,

622
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,540
it means

623
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,500
there is no definitive proof.

624
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,020
There's one more thing.

625
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,940
Years ago,

626
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,500
Pei Dafu once invited me

627
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,620
to a banquet at his house.

628
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,820
At the banquet,

629
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,660
there was a famous dish from Yinan

630
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,180
called Blessings and Longevity.

631
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,180
(Pei Dafu, Seal-holding Director)
It combines all sorts of delicacies,

632
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,980
and its preparation is very complex.

633
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,700
The taste is naturally
delicious and unique.

634
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,020
In early autumn of last year,

635
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,960
at a family banquet at your home,

636
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,980
I was surprised to taste the same thing.

637
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,940
Based on my vague memory,

638
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,140
I felt

639
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,740
that it tasted exactly like the one

640
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,740
at Pei Dafu's longevity banquet.

641
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,140
At that time, I was just suspicious.

642
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,440
I thought maybe Zhuang Shiyang
who seemed to long for peace

643
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,500
had secret ties with Pei Dafu.

644
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,220
But my trip to Danzhou made me certain

645
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,820
that Pei's adopted son
hiding in the mist

646
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,420
was Zhuang Shiyang.

647
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,300
I see.

648
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,820
That dish is very complicated
to prepare.

649
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,120
Only those deeply interested
in cooking can handle it.

650
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,440
I also worried about wrongly accusing
someone innocent,

651
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,040
so I later tasted dishes
at various restaurants in the Capital,

652
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,640
but even if someone
could replicate the dish,

653
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,500
the taste was different each time.

654
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,020
Have you ever

655
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,580
drunk Jinhua wine?

656
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,140
Of course, I have.

657
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,220
Did that dish

658
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,900
have a hint of Jinhua wine flavor?

659
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,260
Since you mentioned it,
it did taste like that.

660
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,700
How do you know?

661
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,380
When I was in Danzhou, I heard

662
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,820
that the key to that dish

663
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,660
lies in using aged wine for flavoring.

664
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,820
Since I returned home,

665
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,860
I noticed that my father used
homemade Jinhua wine in his cooking.

666
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,580
I suppose that's why

667
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,700
the taste was so unique,

668
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,300
and that's how you noticed the clue.

669
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,100
It seems indeed so.

670
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,340
So, you want to use this dish

671
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,500
to lure him out?

672
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,780
It won't be easy,

673
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,220
but if you and I work together,

674
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,380
we may succeed.

675
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,940
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

676
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,420
Master.

677
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,180
Ruyin,

678
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,740
where did this dish come from?

679
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,940
Master, isn't this your signature dish?

680
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,300
But I

681
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,580
didn't cook today.

682
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,100
Father.

683
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,460
Everyone, leave.

684
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,660
Master?

685
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,580
Leave.

686
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,860
Yes.

687
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,340
(Visit the old place to meet
with the Director at the Zi hour.)

688
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,100
Master,

689
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,540
how come you got up by yourself?

690
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,940
Let me help you dress.

691
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,940
No need.

692
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,300
You rest for now.

693
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,660
Master, this...

694
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,580
What's wrong?

695
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,860
This...

696
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,280
Where did these eunuch clothes
come from?

697
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,220
Master, forgive me.

698
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,820
I don't know either.

699
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,060
This...

700
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,380
Visit the old place

701
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,660
to meet with the Director

702
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,620
at the Zi hour.

703
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,140
Master, what does this mean?

704
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,340
Don't touch it.

705
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,540
Master, forgive me.

706
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,780
I was just dividing the dishes,

707
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,540
but I didn't expect...

708
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,820
Leave. Leave.

709
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,740
Yes, yes.

710
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,540
On such a cold night,

711
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,620
I have to feed this beast.

712
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,580
It's really more precious than humans.

713
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,540
Eat, eat.

714
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,620
Who's there?

715
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,420
Help! There's an assassin!

716
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,260
- Shut up.
- Please spare me.

717
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,180
I'm just a servant,

718
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,460
not the master.

719
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,940
Go tell Zhuang Shiyang

720
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,780
that an old friend wants to meet him.

721
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,620
An old friend?

722
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,860
This is a secret. Don't let anyone know.

723
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,140
Go now.

724
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,260
Mr. Zhuang,

725
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,060
long time no see.

726
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,580
May I ask who you are?

727
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,540
Consultant Huang?

728
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,220
Don't be afraid.

729
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,780
I'm not a ghost.

730
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,060
Weren't you killed by Fu Yunxi?

731
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,580
Many people saw it.

732
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,020
Seeing isn't necessarily believing.

733
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,580
What's going on?

734
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,660
I only found out today

735
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,060
that Director Pei's secret, elusive,

736
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,740
and mysterious adopted son

737
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,260
was actually you, Mr. Zhuang.

738
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,300
You old fox.

739
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,740
You've hidden yourself well.

740
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,220
What are you talking about?

741
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,340
There's no need for the act anymore.

742
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,940
I'm here tonight

743
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,260
on Mr. Pei's orders

744
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,060
to ask you to meet him at the old place.

745
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,940
What old place?

746
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,340
Are you human or a ghost?

747
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,580
Stop spouting nonsense.

748
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,590
It seems

749
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,220
you've underestimated Mr. Pei.

750
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,940
He didn't commit suicide out
of guilt in prison.

751
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,420
It's a trick to fool others

752
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,260
so he could escape.

753
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,420
Moreover,

754
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,940
Mr. Pei is destined to live long.

755
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,060
Even if both of us are buried,

756
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,940
he can still live on.

757
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,620
You're a remnant of the Pei faction.

758
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,740
Don't speak nonsense here.

759
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,780
In three days,

760
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,740
Mr. Pei will head to the South Seas
to retreat from the world.

761
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,460
Tonight's meeting is to collect

762
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,860
the wealth you manage on his behalf.

763
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,100
I've delivered the message.

764
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,940
If you don't believe it,

765
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,180
Mr. Pei himself will come to see you.

766
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,180
Mr. Zhuang,

767
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,780
take care of yourself.

768
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,340
Goodbye.

769
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,180
Three quarters past the Zi hour,

770
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,060
there should be no trouble.

771
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,980
The weather is dry.

772
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,820
Be careful with the fire.

773
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,940
(Temple of Guan Yu)

774
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,500
Mr. Zhuang.

775
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,780
Yunxi.

776
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,700
Hanyan.

777
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,600
I'm here on a case as the Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review.

778
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,060
It is not about blood ties

779
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,620
but about right and wrong.

780
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,700
Father,

781
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,100
I've never fully believed

782
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,980
Mother and Mr. Fu's accusations

783
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,580
against you.

784
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,660
If you hadn't shown up tonight,

785
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,900
you'd have fooled me completely.

786
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,300
With your acting skills,

787
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,220
you could have made a great career

788
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,700
in the theater.

789
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,900
Come home with me.

790
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,700
I have something important to tell you.

791
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,420
What huge lie

792
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,500
can't you tell me here?

793
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,220
Mr. Zhuang,

794
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,260
at this point,

795
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,780
you should stop acting.

796
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,220
Don't let him manipulate you,

797
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,540
or our family will truly be
in great danger.

798
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,420
Don't you care about your mother?

799
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,020
It's precisely for my mother's sake

800
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,620
that I've carefully set this trap.

801
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,900
Father, you've fallen into the trap.

802
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,060
It's time to confess.

803
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,780
Is Pei's adopted son

804
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,380
really you?

805
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,860
Mr. Huang only said

806
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,620
you should go to the old place tonight,

807
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:40,460
yet you managed to find
this remote, broken temple.

808
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,220
If you're not the adopted son,

809
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,620
who else could be?

810
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,380
I did find this temple,

811
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:50,100
but you were also waiting here.

812
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,780
It was you who invited Mr. Huang, right?

813
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,740
He said with confidence

814
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,620
that Mr. Pei would go to the South Seas
in three days

815
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,860
and that Mr. Pei would come
to take the money.

816
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,580
He lied.

817
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,220
Mr. Pei is already dead.

818
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,220
Why are you so sure

819
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,220
that Pei Dafu is certainly dead

820
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,700
and could never return?

821
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,520
Pei Dafu was arrogant
and valued his life greatly.

822
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,420
His suicide out of guilt
in the imperial prison

823
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,060
was just the story for the public.

824
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,660
The real cause of death

825
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,540
was the long-term ingestion
of chronic poison,

826
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,460
which had corroded his body,

827
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,000
leading to his sudden death in prison.

828
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,420
This is highly secret,

829
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,740
and few know of it.

830
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,420
Mr. Zhuang, did you

831
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,260
also poison him yourself?

832
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,460
Since you know

833
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,140
that Pei Dafu could never be alive,

834
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,900
why are you here tonight?

835
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,940
Hanyan,

836
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,420
I came for you.

837
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:43,980
Come back with me.

838
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,140
I can tell you everything.

839
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,620
Don't help this man
with ulterior motives.

840
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,380
It will harm us,

841
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,340
your mother,

842
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,380
and the entire family.

843
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,300
Come back with me.

844
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,180
Mr. Fu, you keep pressuring me.

845
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,660
What good does it to you?

846
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,300
Though I am temporarily suspended,

847
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,500
I am still the Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review,

848
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,820
responsible for arresting

849
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,260
the remnants of the Pei faction.

850
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:11,260
You are trying
to seize Mr. Pei's wealth.

851
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,580
So, you admit at last

852
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,540
that you're Pei Dafu's adopted son.

853
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,140
Seizing his wealth?

854
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,460
What else?

855
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,380
Mr. Fu,

856
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,260
why do you have to harm me?

857
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,940
Please spare Hanyan.

858
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,260
Why make her take such risks?

859
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,860
I've come tonight, taking the bait
and risking everything,

860
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,900
just to save my daughter.

861
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,580
Please stop turning
my daughter against me.

862
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,060
Mr. Zhuang, you're truly a master

863
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,780
at manipulating people's minds.

864
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,660
Mr. Fu, don't be so stubborn.

865
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,460
Mr. Pei is dead.

866
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,580
Both of us used to be helpless.

867
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,860
Why make things hard for me?

868
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,060
Tonight, I'm here

869
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,980
to seek peace.

870
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:57,300
As long as you agree to stop,

871
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,860
we can live in peace.

872
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,940
We don't have
to fight each other to death.

873
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,740
Fight each other to death?

874
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,740
What does that mean?

875
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,340
Fu Yunxi,

876
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,380
is there something
you're hiding from me?

877
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,820
Silly girl,

878
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,660
he's hiding many things from you.

879
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,180
There's a rumor in the Capital

880
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,860
that Mr. Fu is full of schemes.

881
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,860
He's lived up to his reputation.

882
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,540
He's using you

883
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,900
to get close to our family
and investigate me in secret.

884
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,020
His goal

885
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,200
is to seize the wealth.

886
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,660
After the fall of the Zuohang Gang,

887
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,080
the Emperor ordered to clear
the remnants of the Pei faction.

888
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,880
I'm sure you've been living in fear

889
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,020
and unable to sleep at night.

890
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,180
You keep saying

891
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,740
you want to root out the adopted son,

892
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,620
but you're actually trying
to protect your own life.

893
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,500
Could it be

894
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,940
you're also involved with Pei Dafu?

895
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,620
Not just that.

896
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,540
This mess in the Capital

897
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,340
is Mr. Fu's way of covering for himself.

898
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,580
I've made it clear.

899
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,060
I am indeed Pei Dafu's adopted son.

900
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,500
Though I've helped him
manage his wealth,

901
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,380
I have never harmed anyone.

902
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,660
You...

903
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,980
If you hadn't pushed me so hard,

904
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,900
I wouldn't have guessed who you are.

905
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,820
Is there any law

906
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,220
that says Pei Dafu

907
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,420
can only have one adopted son?

908
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,380
So,

909
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,140
you, Fu Yunxi,

910
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,840
are also a remnant of the Zuohang Gang

911
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,820
and an adopted son of Pei?

912
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,100
You promised me

913
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,900
that whenever I asked you,
you'd tell me the truth.

914
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,660
So, tell me.

915
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,380
Is Pei's adopted son

916
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,420
really you?

917
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,780
Yes.
