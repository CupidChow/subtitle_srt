00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,100
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,860
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,220
(Wedding Procession, Duke Qi)

5
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,420
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

6
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,560
On this auspicious day, we welcome the bride.

7
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,080
As the gate opens, prosperity follows.

8
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,030
Raise the sedan chair.

9
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,640
You,

10
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,640
what is your name?

11
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,400
Your Highness,

12
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,150
my name's

13
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,520
- Pei Yingyue.
- Wrong.

14
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,680
You should call me

15
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,590
honey.

16
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,830
Yes, honey.

17
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,840
Mrs. Fu.

18
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,780
(Groom Duke Qi, Bride Zhuang Yushan)

19
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,070
Zhuang Yushan?

20
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,800
She married Duke Qi?

21
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,150
Absolutely true.

22
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,040
This is the invitation from the Zhuangs.

23
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,270
Getting married so hastily.

24
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,240
Why was she so foolish

25
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,950
to jump into that fire pit?

26
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,800
It must be Zhuang Shiyang, still scheming,

27
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,700
trying to cling to Duke Qi for protection.

28
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,390
Should we go take a look?

29
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,310
It's too late now.

30
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,160
Besides, what could we do there?

31
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,600
If I try to dissuade her,

32
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,560
Zhuang Yushan would just think

33
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,390
I'm afraid of her marrying up.

34
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,040
Zhuang Yushan is marrying Duke Qi.

35
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,950
Did you know about it?

36
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,030
Just found out.

37
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,630
The ten-day deadline is near.

38
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,310
What scheme does Zhuang Shiyang have?

39
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,750
What has he been doing at home lately?

40
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,480
I'm investigating
the Precepts for Women case.

41
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,000
No time to check Zhuang Shiyang.

42
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,630
And I have no say in whom Duke Qi chooses.

43
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,630
(Informed but Curious)

44
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,630
Any progress on Mr. Yuwen's case?

45
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,110
No.

46
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,430
I need detailed information.

47
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,800
When Yuwen Chang'an was suspended,

48
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,620
his documents in the Department

49
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,240
were sealed in the central archives.

50
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,120
Mu Feng, Mu Yan, and I
checked multiple times,

51
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,680
but found nothing useful.

52
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,750
What about other offices?

53
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,000
We checked them all.

54
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,870
No results so far.

55
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,830
And people are starting to suspect now.

56
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,320
Are you done asking?

57
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,640
Zhuang Hanyan.

58
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,920
Since you agreed to be Lingzhi's mother,

59
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,070
I hope you can act as a proper mother.

60
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,040
What makes a proper mother?

61
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,370
I don't ask you to love her or protect her.

62
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,560
Just promise not to hurt her.

63
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,580
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

64
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,340
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

65
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,070
Sir, it's our honor that you've

66
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,830
personally escorted Yushan home.

67
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,920
I fear our hospitality may fall short.

68
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,120
Why isn't my father-in-law here?

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,910
Apologies for my delay.

70
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,030
Please forgive me.

71
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,360
Why do you look so troubled?

72
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,000
Is there a problem at home?

73
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,870
Just some family matters.

74
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,190
No need to worry, sir.

75
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,790
Father,

76
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,270
is Zhuang Hanyan causing you trouble?

77
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,080
Mind your words.

78
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,070
She used Fu Yunxi's influence

79
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,190
to confine you at home for days.

80
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,950
Why do you still cover for her?

81
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,640
Yushan.

82
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
All I know is

83
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,390
Zhuang Hanyan is your good daughter.

84
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,360
How could that happen?

85
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,750
Since I married the Duke,

86
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,120
we're all one family now.

87
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,870
Might as well tell everything.

88
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,240
Because she was sent to Danzhou as a child,

89
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,320
she holds resentment toward the Zhuangs.

90
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,320
Since returning to the Capital,

91
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,630
she's caused constant turmoil at home.

92
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,440
Zhuang Hanyan cannot get away

93
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,480
even for the death of my brother Yuchi.

94
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,390
Yuchi was our family's only hope.

95
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,150
Is the hatred truly so deep?

96
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,360
My apologies, Your Highness,

97
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,200
for airing our family's disgrace.

98
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,320
Now, we have the honor
of this noble marriage,

99
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,480
if Hanyan were to meet Your Highness again,

100
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,550
she would have to pay you respect.

101
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,440
Please go easy on Hanyan

102
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,960
and stay out of Noble Consort Miao's affairs.

103
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,940
Father,

104
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,790
why speak for her now?

105
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,080
- Zhuang Hanyan is…
- Enough.

106
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,200
Stop arguing.

107
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,200
This is pointless.

108
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,360
It's too late for that now.

109
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,350
Master.

110
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,730
Where is Zhuang Hanyan?

111
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,240
Mrs. Fu ordered the carriage.

112
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,280
She's heading to the palace
to see Her Highness.

113
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,390
Master, hold on.

114
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,630
What is it?

115
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,960
I…

116
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,150
I have something.

117
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,000
I've hesitated for days,

118
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,030
now I wish to hand it over.

119
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,580
(Writ of Divorce)

120
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:13,380
(Written by Fu Yunxi)

121
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,860
(Zhuang Hanyan)

122
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,920
Where did you get the writ of divorce?

123
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,150
On your wedding night,

124
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,200
Madam called me into her chamber

125
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,240
and handed me this letter.

126
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,440
She said she wanted to take a risk,

127
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,240
even if it meant risking many lives.

128
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,510
But she remembered

129
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,120
when trapped at Yinan Guild Hall,

130
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,370
she escaped because
her registration was removed.

131
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,750
So she prepared the writ of divorce.

132
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,230
If one day,

133
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,320
she commits an unforgivable crime,

134
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,390
the Fu Family won't be implicated.

135
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,630
Master,

136
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,600
you've been at odds lately.

137
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,550
I see it and worry deeply.

138
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,600
But Madam refused to explain to you

139
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,310
and ordered me not to say a word.

140
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,270
She's just upset with you.

141
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,960
You deceived her before.

142
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,670
So she's set on revenge.

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,030
But she never intended

144
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,870
to hurt Lady Qiu or Miss Lingzhi.

145
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,240
All I ask is for you and Madam

146
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,200
to unite and achieve great things together.

147
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,600
Shuhong, thank you.

148
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,240
I'll go find her now.

149
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,280
Stop the carriage.

150
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,470
Master.

151
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,870
What brings you here?

152
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,700
Going to the palace?

153
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,000
Once the Zi hour passes,

154
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,080
the ten-day period ends.

155
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,240
At such a crucial time,

156
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,360
Zhuang Shiyang and Duke Qi
must be scheming.

157
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,500
I need to discuss it
with Her Highness.

158
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,270
Today, Duke Qi visited the Zhuangs again.

159
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,390
I've sent Mu Feng to eavesdrop.

160
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,350
Zhuang Shiyang lured Duke Qi into action

161
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,750
to take her down.

162
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,130
What's their plan?

163
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,660
Duke Qi said he's already acted

164
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,600
and told Zhuang Shiyang
to wait for results.

165
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,790
Lady Wu, oh sorrowed day.

166
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
She sold the family home away.

167
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,150
Her little one, held so tight.

168
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,120
Yet Yulang's vanished from her sight.

169
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,320
From her sight.

170
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,030
Who taught you to sing this rhyme?

171
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,080
Yu means moon. Four Symbols as limbs.

172
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,030
Missing one limb, three remain.

173
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,630
The toad erodes the full moon's glow.

174
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,770
Bright night wanes, its brilliance fades.

175
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,840
So, Lady Wu refers to Empress Wu?

176
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,240
It's about Noble Consort Miao.

177
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,500
It suggests like Wu's rise to the throne,

178
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,000
Noble Consort Miao may one day

179
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,440
rule behind the curtain,

180
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,030
or even aspire to seize power.

181
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,710
Sir.

182
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,680
What is it?

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,200
I've just received news.

184
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,000
The Director of Imperial Observatory

185
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,330
met His Majesty last night.

186
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,480
Her Highness might be in trouble.

187
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,060
(Yongkun Palace)

188
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,040
Your Highness.

189
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,320
How's it going?

190
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,080
Your Highness,

191
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,600
the Director met His Majesty in secret.

192
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,960
My apprentice overheard
the Director saying…

193
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,230
What?

194
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,750
The Director said,

195
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,550
we're now between winter and spring,

196
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,050
the Azure Dragon fades
and the Flirting Star appears,

197
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,830
with ominous stars accompanying the moon.

198
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,400
This is an ill omen for the nation.

199
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,600
If the ominous don't get suppressed soon,

200
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,870
maybe...

201
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,590
Maybe what?

202
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,360
The ominous in. Chaos reigns.

203
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,470
Glory will fade with the departing emperor,

204
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,000
and suddenly…

205
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,750
Suddenly, a woman shall take the throne.

206
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,600
That calamitous star.

207
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,790
Who does it refer to?

208
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,320
He said…

209
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,230
Wait.

210
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,960
Go on.

211
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,840
It aligns with the Dipper's constellation.

212
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,750
Its element is Kun.

213
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:44,540
(Bloom and Bounty)

214
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,270
Finally.

215
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:05,540
(Yongkun Palace)

216
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,960
Children's street rhymes.

217
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,570
The Director's audience with the Emperor.

218
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,670
Duke Qi isn't shrewd in schemes.

219
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,320
Such roundabout methods

220
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,750
must be Zhuang Shiyang's orchestration.

221
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,750
Duke Qi and the Director go way back.

222
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,630
Their bond runs deep.

223
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,240
Do you think His Majesty will believe it?

224
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,830
Just like when you were called
the barefoot ghost.

225
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,750
Women in the palace
fear ill omens more.

226
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,120
Once the Observatory's involved,

227
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,120
the odds are against her.

228
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,280
Moreover,

229
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,000
it concerns the foundation of our nation.

230
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,550
The palace is likely on the brink of chaos.

231
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,630
Given such circumstances,

232
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,600
do you insist on entering the palace?

233
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,470
I must go.

234
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,110
I'll go with you.

235
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,240
The visit letter has been delivered.

236
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,910
Why is there still no reply?

237
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,510
The palace might be already in chaos.

238
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,930
Could a word
from the Imperial Observatory

239
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,000
truly condemn a Noble Consort?

240
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,440
It seems

241
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,200
I couldn't save her life after all.

242
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,570
It's reached the Emperor's ears.

243
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,960
Too difficult.

244
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,670
Noble Consort Miao's parents.

245
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,910
Were you summoned by Her Highness?

246
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,120
(Upholding Respect)
Lady Miao, born of meritorious lineage.

247
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,630
Gentle in youth, virtuous in age.

248
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,200
Chosen for the inner palace for her grace.

249
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,960
Harmonious among consorts,

250
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,440
humble within the harem.

251
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,630
Yet one misstep,

252
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,240
actions deviated from decorum.

253
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,160
Secretly allying with the Pei faction,
causing chaos.

254
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,880
Seized lands and appropriated state funds.

255
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,480
Employed cruel officials,
scourged the realm.

256
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,920
Deceived the Throne,
sowed dissent in court.

257
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,200
Like Empress Lü, she shook
the nation's foundation.

258
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,750
With profound sorrow,

259
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,160
I grant a silken cord in royal mercy.

260
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,160
After your demise, harm shall not
befall your family.

261
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,510
Thus decreed.

262
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,020
(Yongkun Palace)

263
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,480
(Under heaven,)

264
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,200
(everyone seeks to be a noble lady.)

265
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,510
- (But if a woman's status and power)
- My girl.

266
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,860
(dependent on men,)
- My girl.

267
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,510
(they are fragile,)

268
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,510
(and ready to crumble anytime.)

269
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,920
(Behind a life of grandeur and favor,)

270
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,960
- (lies disaster and danger.)
- My poor daughter.

271
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,920
(Perhaps from the very day
I entered the palace,)

272
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,790
(I was destined)

273
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,110
(to perish under the title of noble lady)

274
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,000
(But by the time I saw through it all,)

275
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,510
(it was far, far too late.)

276
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,350
You would stop me again?

277
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,870
It's the writ of divorce you wrote.

278
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,750
Since we're married,

279
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,270
you're my wife, my family.

280
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,350
I won't let you make a mistake again.

281
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,960
This isn't my home.

282
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,830
I've done all I can.

283
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,590
It's your own choice.

284
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,400
Whether it's Lady Qiu,

285
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,640
Lingzhi,

286
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,510
or Fu Family's fate,

287
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,790
has nothing to do with me.

288
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,640
Step aside!

289
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,310
Who do you aim to kill now?

290
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,240
Zhuang Shiyang, Duke Qi, or His Majesty?

291
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,480
Let go.

292
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,630
Let go.

293
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,440
Don't push me.

294
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,400
Do you know why you lost this game?

295
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,000
I was wrong.

296
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,480
There's power beyond power.

297
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,320
I shouldn't have sided
with Noble Consort Miao.

298
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,070
Nor should I've listened to your nonsense.

299
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,640
I should've killed Zhuang Shiyang
from the start.

300
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,160
Even if the soldiers withdraw today,

301
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,900
if you go to the Zhuang's like this,

302
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,130
will you make it out alive?

303
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,030
I never planned to leave alive.

304
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,400
The day my mother died unjustly,

305
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,590
this world became an endless hell for me.

306
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,950
Let go of me!

307
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,590
I'll make Zhuang Shiyang pay today!

308
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,200
You should feel grateful right now.

309
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,310
That Imperial Edict says,

310
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,480
"Harm shall not befall the family."

311
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,000
Otherwise,

312
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,720
you'd be a corpse by now.

313
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,680
Who's hiding there? Come out!

314
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,790
Who is it?

315
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,150
Show yourself!

316
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,750
Mother.

317
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,200
Mother, don't hurt me!

318
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,480
Mother was only joking with you.

319
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,400
Lingzhi, it's okay.

321
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,560
Don't cry.

322
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,350
I'm here for you.

323
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,590
Mother was just teasing you.

324
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,480
Lingzhi.

325
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,510
Mother, please don't go.

326
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,480
I'm begging you.

327
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,070
Mother, don't go.

328
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,550
Lingzhi,

329
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,030
I never raised you.

330
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,270
I'm not your mother.

331
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,240
I don't deserve to be called mother.

332
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,680
All of this

333
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,750
is fake.

334
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,680
It's not fake.

335
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,510
Mother promised me.

336
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,510
You don't understand grown-up matters.

337
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
Today,

338
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,110
I'm avenging my mother.

339
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,920
I don't want you to die.

340
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,350
Mother, wait until I grow up.

341
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,590
I'll help you get revenge,

342
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,550
alright?

343
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,030
I just wants to be like other kids,

344
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,680
having a mother

345
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,480
and a real home.

346
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,510
I just want to be like other daughters,

347
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,350
having a mother

348
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,750
and a home.

349
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll show you,

350
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,590
I'm not just your daughter.

351
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,960
I can be your support.

352
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,790
I've endured this living hell,

353
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,920
dragging my broken body

354
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,030
through years of torment.

355
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,000
Why return to walk the same path?

356
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,790
Why, Hanyan?

357
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,030
Mother,

358
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,590
I don't ask you to let go of hatred.

359
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,200
But if you're consumed by vengeance,

360
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,030
living only for those who wronged you,

361
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,350
isn't that just another way to suffer?

362
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,160
Please give me a chance.

363
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,310
Let me help you find something

364
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,000
in this world worth cherishing.

365
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,560
Alright?

366
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,680
As mother and daughter,

367
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,200
our bond is destined to be shallow.

368
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,830
This is where we part.

369
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,590
My only regret in this life

370
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,830
is not watching you grow up.

371
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,290
♪I want you to be carefree forever♪

372
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,460
♪I will be carefree♪

373
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,890

On your first day back to the Capital,

380
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,250
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)
the first person you met

381
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,400
was me.

382
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,480
Actually, since that day,

383
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,750
I've found my mother.

384
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,590
I don't want to lose you again.

Even though you didn't raise me,

386

we have a future together.

387

389
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,070
didn't we agree?

390
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,240
We are both

391
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,110
children without mothers.

392
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,350

402
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:24,030
I ran into Grandmother's yard,

403
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,240

Is Lingzhi sleeping?

434
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,240
Yes.

435
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,960
Mrs. Fu, I need

436
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,070
to apologize to you.

437
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,070
For what?

438
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,520
Just not long ago,

439
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,070
at the Nanshan Clinic.

440
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,880
I did see you there.

441
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,160
That's why I spoke so much.

442
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,110
But Mr. Fu truly didn't see you.

443
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,590
His words were heartfelt.

444
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,000
It's all my fault.

445
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,550
I messed things up.

446
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,550
He really didn't know?

447
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,640
Hasn't he explained it to you yet?

448
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,550
He was demoted and punished

449
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,400
for your sake.

450
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,000
Zhuang Shiyang told me

451
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,720
Fu Yunxi was forced by him.

452
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,830
You believe Zhuang Shiyang's words?

453
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,480
I saw it with my own eyes.

454
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
After you fainted,

455
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,920
Mr. Fu carried you inside.

456
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,200
He sat by your side for a long time

457
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,720
before deciding to abandon

458
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,750
all his previous plans for you.

459
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,370
Later that night,

460
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,160
Zhuang Shiyang used this against him.

461
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,200
He mentioned it,

462
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,070
but I didn't believe it then.

463
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,480
I, Mu Feng, swear to the heavens,

464
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,070
though Mr. Fu is a bit

465
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,560
ruthless and cunning,

466
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,430
using any means to achieve goals,

467
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,000
his feelings for you are genuine.

468
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,430
If I'm lying,

469
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,030
may I never marry

470
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,560
and be single forever.

471
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,510
I knew all along.

472
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,960
I was using his sincerity

473
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,070
to my advantage.

474
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,190
Does it hurt?

475
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,110
Why don't you try?

476
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,310
Zhuang Shiyang.

477
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,350
I'll never let this go.

478
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,680
Now there's another blood feud.

479
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,200
All these matters

480
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,110
stem from Zhuang Shiyang.

481
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,030
I will never let him go.

482
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,960
His crimes are countless,
and he deserves to die.

483
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,680
But no matter how he dies,

484
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,290
I don't want it to be you,

485
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,030
sneaking in under the cover of night

486
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,680
and assassinating him.

487
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,760
Why?

488
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,910
Don't forget,

489
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,750
our marriage is a deal.

490
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,310
My help comes with conditions.

491
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,270
You promised me

492
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,270
to care for the Fu Family.

493
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,390
I don't get it.

494
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,920
Why insist on this?

495
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,880
You can protect them yourself.

496
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,000
Just remember,

497
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,070
a deal is a deal.

498
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,750
We must keep our word.

499
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,240
Fine. I promise you.

500
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,720
You deceived me,

501
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,110
and I deceived you.

502
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,240
But this time, I swear,

503
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm being sincere.

504
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,640
You always say

505
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,350
you want a home.

506
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,550
What do you think a home is?

507
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,520
At least,

508
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,270
a home must

509
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,070
have blood relatives.

510
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,270
Like you with Lady Qiu and Aunt Kou.

511
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,640
You don't know this,

512
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,240
but I have no blood ties to them.

513
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,960
I'm their adopted son.

514
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,510
My parents died in war.

515
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,240
I'm just an orphan.

516
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,000
Yet with love and care,

517
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,830
this is my home.

518
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,590
And it can

519
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,030
be your home, too.

520
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,070
Yunxi.

521
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,350
- Hanyan.
- Mother.

522
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,480
- Yunxi.
- Mother.

523
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,960
Have you heard

524
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,350
Noble Consort Miao was executed?

525
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,000
We've been close to her lately.

526
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,720
Could this bring us trouble?

527
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,160
Don't worry, Mother.

528
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,680
Though we were acquainted with her,

529
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,110
we won't be implicated.

530
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,160
Besides, His Majesty has decreed

531
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,590
that the matter will not

532
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,710
be pursued any further.

533
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,220
That's good.

534
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,830
I worry about you.

535
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,430
Yunxi,

536
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,390
Hanyan,

537
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,030
being together as a family

538
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,270
is our true blessing.

539
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,110
I'm afraid

540
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,480
of any harm befalling you.

541
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,110
I…

542
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,840
Rest assured.

543
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,270
We'll be fine.

544
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,270
But you and Aunt Kou

545
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,350
should stay home these days.

546
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,880
Try not to go out.

547
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,110
I understand.

548
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,240
We were once admired,

549
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,240
but now feared by all.

550
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,240
You're worried about us being shunned.

551
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,800
I know.

552
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,110
It's getting late.

553
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
Let me take you to rest, Mother.

554
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,630
Alright.

555
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,110
Mother.

556
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,560
Let's go.

557
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
You're still injured.

558
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,720
Go get some rest.

559
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,520
It's alright.

560
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,830
They were once the Capital's belles.

561
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,030
One married into an officials,

562
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,790
the other into the palace.

563
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,350
Yet in the end, they both met the same fate.

564
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,920
History will record

565
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,630
another treacherous consort,

566
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,110
eternally condemned for ruining the nation.

567
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,030
A life so fragile

568
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,840
vanishes without a trace.

569
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,550
The so-called noble lady…

570
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,150
How pathetic.

571
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,960
Just now, Mu Feng told me

572
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,320
Mu Yan has made some progress

573
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,060
on Yuwen Chang'an's sandalwood box.

574
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,000
What progress?

575
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,000
Noble Consort Miao's matter was sudden.

576
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,190
I haven't met with Mu Yan yet.

577
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,280
I'll go to the Judicial Review tomorrow.

578
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,880
Wait at home for my message.

579
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,920
I hope Mr. Yuwen

580
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,760
won't let us down.

581
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,320
(Hanlin Academy)
Congratulations, Mr. Zhuang.

582
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,480
After all these years
at the Hanlin Academy,

583
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,030
you have finally made it.

584
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,350
Indeed.

585
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,400
Mr. Zhuang has been hardworking.

586
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,000
(Endless Learning)
Now he's achieved great success.

587
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,120
Promoted from a seventh-rank
junior compiler

588
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,670
to a fifth-rank academician.

589
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,840
Granted personally by His Majesty.

590
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,070
This grand honor should be recorded

591
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,510
in the family genealogy.

592
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,420
Yes, indeed.

593
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,000
Perhaps in a few years,

594
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:24,280
Mr. Zhuang might join the Grand Secretariat.

595
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,640
Please.

596
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,760
Congratulations.

597
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,800
- Please.
- Congrats.

598
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,680
That's flattering.

599
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,550
I possess no special skills,

600
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,280
just some simple craftsmanship.

601
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,760
Today's promotion

602
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,800
is a blessing.

603
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,320
I dare not compare myself to you

604
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,480
esteemed scholars.

605
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,590
Mr. Zhuang, you're too modest.

606
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,840
- Too humble.
- Too modest.

607
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,920
Truly too humble.

608
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,590
Even though Consort Miao has fallen,

609
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Fu Yunxi and Zhuang Hanyan

610
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,230
managed to escape.

611
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,190
So frustrating.

612
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,070
Sir,

613
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,030
I have a plan.

614
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,280
A woman should know her place.

615
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,070
This is not your concern.

616
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,550
Yingyue would never overstep her bounds.

617
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,030
You're right.

618
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,280
I will remember this.

619
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,280
My grandmother's 60th birthday
is in two days.

620
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,070
Could you join our celebration?

621
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,910
I don't have time.

622
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,230
Go on your own.

623
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,960
Just four hours allowed.

624
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,940
(Judicial Review)

625
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,360
Mu Feng mentioned progress here.

626
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,640
Yes.

627
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,840
And it's at the Department of Supervision.

628
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,560
Department of Supervision?

629
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,920
It's been searched twice before,

630
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,400
but found no trace.

631
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,590
Last time we were there,

632
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,270
we focused on the offices and archives,

633
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,840
where documents are storage.

634
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,880
But we overlooked

635
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,280
Mr. Yuwen's connections.

636
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,840
Where's the clue?

637
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,800
The morgue.

638
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,590
(Morgue)
We reek of corpses.

639
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,030
(Serving Justice)
We're the least welcomed.

640
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,120
In the Department of Supervision,

641
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,550
only Mr. Yuwen treats me well.

642
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,400
We share the same plight.

643
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,630
Neither of us ever married.

644
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,670
Over time, we grew closer.

645
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,880
About five or six years ago,

646
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,590
he entrusted this box to me.

647
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,840
He said it's quiet here,

648
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,510
more dead than living,

649
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,670
which makes it safer.

650
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,400
Sometimes he would take it for days

651
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,920
(Coroner Sun)
and soon return it.

652
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,510
He never told me

653
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,920
what was inside.

654
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,630
Yet, every time he returned it,

655
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,670
it felt heavier.

656
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,590
When Mr. Yuwen left the Capital,

657
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,320
why didn't he take it?

658
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,000
He left in a hurry,

659
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,030
and had someone send me a message.

660
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,590
It was poetic,

661
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,880
saying it was a box of sorrowful tears,

662
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,590
unfit for the land of bliss.

663
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,110
He asked me to keep it safe,

664
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,510
as it might be useful someday.

665
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:28,910
Mr. Fu, you...

666
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,980
(Archived Documents)

667
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,300
(Zhuang's Ancestral Hall in Danzhou)

668
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,970
(Zhuang Shiyang looks terrified)
These are

669
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,480
Mr. Yuwen's manuscripts.

670
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,190
According to what he wrote,

671
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,550
three years ago,

672
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,190
he entrusted you
with something very important.

673
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,640
Mr. Fu,

674
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,670
did Mr. Yuwen truly

675
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,320
send you to retrieve it?

676
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,360
Mr. Yuwen has passed away.

677
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,510
Perhaps these items

678
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,510
are his chance for justice.

679
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,230
You mean, Mr. Yuwen is…

680
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,160
Mrs. Fu.

681
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,950
Did he find it?

682
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,100
Mr. Fu didn't explain much.

683
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,760
He asked you to go to the Department.

684
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,230
Alright. Let's go.

685
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:35,220

(Serving Justice)

688
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,760
It's poisonous.

689
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,030
Whose remains

690
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,280
are these?

691
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,150
