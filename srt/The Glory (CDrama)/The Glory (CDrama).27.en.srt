00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,060
(Court of Judicial Review)

3
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,660
=Episode 27=

4
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,710
Are you admitting to everything?

5
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,920
What if I say

6
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
it was Zhuang Shiyang

7
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,880
who secretly framed me?

8
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,040
Mr. Yan,

9
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,640
would you believe that?

10
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,080
Do you have any solid proof?

11
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,590
Previously, Zhuang Shiyang
wrote a statement

12
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,270
regarding the case of the adopted son.

13
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,390
I've had it verified by the scribe.

14
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,360
The fingerprints on it
are completely different

15
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,670
from those on the IOUs.

16
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,440
Then I admit it.

17
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,650
The day you and Zhuang Hanyan
left the Capital,

18
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,080
the Judicial Review received
an anonymous tip,

19
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,280
accusing you

20
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,950
of being Pei's adopted son

21
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,880
and of secretly laundering money
for them over the years.

22
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,310
Later,

23
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,550
you even involved Zhuang Hanyan

24
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,870
and committed crimes together.

25
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,370
(Calligraphy and Painting)
I led people to your home

26
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,020
and indeed found a large number of IOUs

27
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,670
in your study,

28
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,200
totaling over ten million taels
of silver.

29
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,600
The debtors were spread
across the country,

30
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,270
and the creditors
were Zhuang Hanyan alone.

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,920
Now,

32
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,440
it might not be enough for you

33
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,370
to confess to all the crimes.

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,080
Have you ever

35
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,510
calculated how old Zhuang Hanyan was

36
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,110
at that time based on the loan dates?

37
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,750
She was a poor orphan,

38
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,830
raised in a destitute place.

39
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,880
How could she

40
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,390
possibly have so much money?

41
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,400
How could she have the means

42
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,950
to lend the money across the nation?

43
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,390
She's just my scapegoat.

44
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,670
I used her to do everything.

45
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,470
Based on the loan dates,

46
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,150
you and Zhuang Hanyan
were thousands of miles apart,

47
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,150
and you weren't even married.

48
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,430
How did you

49
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,710
put this ten million taels of silver

50
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,240
under her name?

51
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,390
I had a marriage contract with her.

52
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,950
Using her name

53
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,190
could fool the public.

54
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,320
Nonsense.

55
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,070
If you had decided from the beginning

56
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,350
to make her the scapegoat,

57
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,830
why are you now willing
to risk your life

58
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,390
to save hers?

59
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Mr. Yan,

60
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,830
you have a wife and a daughter.

61
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,030
Are you really going to pursue this
so relentlessly?

62
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,320
You all may leave.

63
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,400
Yes.

64
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,750
Fu Yunxi,

65
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,790
we're alone now.

66
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,270
Tell me honestly.

67
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,120
Did you do this?

68
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,060
Mr. Yan, you've always been meticulous

69
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,000
in handling cases,

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,390
seeing through every detail.

71
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,270
Can't you really see

72
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,880
the oddities in this case?

73
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,640
The adopted son case
has dragged on for so long

74
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,030
and is unable to be solved.

75
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,640
The Emperor is already dissatisfied.

76
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,430
I've been long investigating it,

77
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,320
but I still haven't found
any concrete evidence.

78
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,200
I'm inevitably guilty.

79
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,590
Now, with all this forged evidence,

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,200
my wife and I are
about to be wrongfully executed.

81
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,270
I can't catch the real culprit,

82
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,190
but I can't let

83
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,190
my wife

84
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,590
lose her life as well.

85
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,200
Let's put aside the oddities
of this case for now.

86
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,760
Based on our years as colleagues,

87
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,640
I know you well.

88
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,150
You couldn't have

89
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,240
committed such a heinous crime.

90
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,830
I...

91
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,240
I have one request.

92
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,790
What is it?

93
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,150
Now that the money has been found

94
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,510
and I've been caught as a criminal,

95
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,080
this case will be handled well.

96
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,470
The Emperor will certainly be pleased.

97
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,560
Now, let me trade my life

98
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,240
for you to achieve merit and promotion.

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,760
For the sake of our years of friendship,

100
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,880
please protect my family.

101
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,790
Is that okay?

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,920
Fine.

103
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,510
I promise you.

104
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,500
(Creditor: Zhuang Hanyan)

105
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,500
(Creditor: Zhuang Hanyan)

106
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,190
My Lord,

107
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,400
Zhuang Hanyan is here.

108
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,050
- Let her in.
- Yes.

109
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,340
(Justice Without Mercy)

110
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,440
Greetings, Mr. Yan. I...

111
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,100
Mrs. Fu, please don't stand on ceremony.

112
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,560
Please press your fingerprints first

113
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,200
before we discuss other matters.

114
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,560
My Lord,

115
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,920
the fingerprints on this IOU

116
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,830
aren't the same as Zhuang Hanyan's.

117
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,160
This case

118
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,390
was indeed all done by Fu Yunxi alone.

119
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,190
You may leave.

120
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

121
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,310
Mr. Yan, Fu Yunxi...

122
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,550
Fu Yunxi has taken full responsibility
for everything.

123
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,200
With the evidence I currently have,

124
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,610
I can't prove any direct connection

125
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,300
between you and this case.

126
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,830
For now, you may leave.

127
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,880
Later,

128
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
if the Three Judicial Offices
investigate again,

129
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,200
just claim you know nothing,

130
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,470
and you'll be fine.

131
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,830
Mr. Yan,

132
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,440
this case is indeed related to me,

133
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,590
and I know the truth.

134
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,630
Fu Yunxi is innocent.

135
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,160
Please let me meet him.

136
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,280
Now, he's determined to die.

137
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,560
Even if you go,

138
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,240
he won't meet you.

139
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,160
It's impossible.

140
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,590
He's not someone
who would easily seek death.

141
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,620
Moreover, he has a widowed mother
and a young daughter.

142
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,280
How could he willingly die like this?

143
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,680
Even if he's willing to die,

144
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,600
why won't he meet me?

145
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,200
This case is highly complex.

146
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,400
It's already a great fortune

147
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,750
for him to clear you.

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
Don't waste any more time.

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,320
Mrs. Fu, please leave.

150
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,440
My Lord,

151
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,670
Fu Yunxi's barely breathing.

152
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,630
He has fainted again.

153
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,960
Summon the physician.

154
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,810
Yes.

155
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,710
Mr. Yan.

156
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,550
(Quiet Wave)

157
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,470
Mr. Yan.

158
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,950
Mrs. Fu, please don't act rashly.

159
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,870
We can think of a way back at home.

160
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,840
Mr. Yan,

161
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,550
Fu Yunxi is not Pei's adopted son

162
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,430
but has infiltrated
the Pei faction as a spy.

163
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,280
The former Chief Minister,
Wen Mingchang,

164
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,120
ordered Fu Yunxi

165
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,650
to infiltrate the Pei faction as a spy.

166
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,790
Over the years,

167
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,040
Fu Yunxi has indeed been
involved with the Pei faction,

168
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,120
but his goal was to eliminate

169
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,140
these treacherous eunuchs.

170
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,480
Do you have any evidence

171
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,830
of what you say?

172
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,920
I don't have evidence,

173
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,040
and neither does Fu Yunxi.

174
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,840
But I still ask you

175
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,230
to report this to the Emperor

176
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,590
and seek the Emperor's judgment

177
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,830
to grant Fu Yunxi

178
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,320
a chance to live.

179
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,480
You must not speak recklessly

180
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,710
just to save your husband.

181
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,830
What I've said isn't a lie.

182
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,040
No.

183
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,350
You have no proof.

184
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,080
If we rashly go to the Palace,

185
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,520
the risks are immense.

186
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,750
Fu Yunxi certainly knows
the gravity of this,

187
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,560
or he would've told me long ago.

188
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,150
If there's anyone to be blamed,

189
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,540
I'll take the blame for everything.

190
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,550
Mr. Yan,

191
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,910
please allow me to meet Fu Yunxi.

192
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,320
Send Mrs. Fu home.

193
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,430
Mr. Yan.

194
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,590
Mr. Yan.

195
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:55,260
(Light, Fu Residence)

196
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,920
Madam.

197
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,080
Madam, you're finally back.

198
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,400
Yunxi.

199
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,760
Hanyan.

200
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,360
Hanyan.

201
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,830
Where's Yunxi?

202
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,560
Why hasn't he come back?

203
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,830
He's still
in the Judicial Review, right?

204
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,590
Didn't you go

205
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,450
on a spring outing to the outskirts?

206
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,750
How could he end up becoming

207
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,870
Eunuch Pei's adopted son

208
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,280
after this journey?

209
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,240
Mother,

210
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,080
Grandmother said
you went to fetch Father,

211
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,950
but why didn't Father return with you?

212
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,760
Lingzhi, my dear.

213
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,080
Your father went to work.

214
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,950
He'll return once he finishes it.

215
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,670
Hanyan,

216
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,120
is it right?

217
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,880
Yunxi

218
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,590
is still alive, right?

219
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,760
Mother,

220
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,440
sorry for my incompetence.

221
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,670
Yunxi

222
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,400
is trapped in the prison

223
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,520
and is determined to die.

224
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,040
He doesn't want to see me.

225
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,920
Ma'am...

226
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,830
Hanyan.

227
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,830
Madam.

228
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,480
It's all my fault.

229
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,470
- Aunt Kou.
- I'm useless.

230
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,990
I used to make things hard for you.

231
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,320
I'm sorry. I'll kowtow to you.

232
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,200
Aunt Kou.

233
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,060
Aunt Kou, please rise.

234
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,630
- I apologize.
- Please get up.

235
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,280
- Get up.
- Save Yunxi.

236
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,590
- Aunt Kou.
- Hanyan,

237
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,150
I know you are more capable than I am.

238
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,270
You know many noble ladies.

239
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,320
You must have a way to save Yunxi,

240
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,240
right?

241
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,440
The entire family

242
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,350
is depending on you, Madam.

243
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,750
I promise you.

244
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,280
Once you save Yunxi,

245
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,470
I will leave.

246
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,080
I'll return to my hometown;
I won't bother you anymore.

247
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,120
- Aunt Kou.
- I beg you.

248
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,470
Aunt Kou, Aunt Kou.

249
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,080
Fu Yunxi is my husband.

250
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,280
I'll think of every possible way
to bring him back.

251
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,630
- Really?
- Really?

252
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,590
Mother,

253
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,520
Aunt Kou,

254
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,040
Lingzhi,

255
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,400
I swear here

256
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,200
that I will bring

257
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,000
Fu Yunxi back.

258
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,160
Hanyan.

259
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
- Madam.
- Madam.

260
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,760
Where are we going?

261
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,150
Let's go to the Deng Mansion first.

262
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,420
(Deng Mansion)
Open the door.

263
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,630
Is anyone there?

264
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,400
It's Zhuang Hanyan.

265
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,560
Open up.

266
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,990
Mr. Deng.

267
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,760
Mr. Deng.

268
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,820
(Yu Pavilion, Yao Residence)

269
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,420
(Currency)

270
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,710
Mr. Li.

271
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,780
(Li Mansion)
Mr. Li.

272
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,190
Move.

273
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:01,260
(Duke Qi's Mansion)

274
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,240
Madam,

275
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,360
we're at Duke Qi's Mansion.

276
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,160
Madam,

277
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,160
you'd better not visit.

278
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,260
(Zhuiyue Pavilion)

279
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,520
Greetings, Your Highness.
I'm Zhuang Hanyan.

280
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,280
I heard that you know the art of tea.

281
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,280
As your elder sister,

282
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,630
I wonder if you mind
brewing a pot for me.

283
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,560
Yushan, you're too polite.

284
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,680
I wouldn't dare to refuse.

285
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,320
You don't think
I still have lingering feelings

286
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,630
for Fu Yunxi, do you?

287
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,680
I only ask you

288
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,440
to kindly pass a message

289
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,440
so that I may meet Duke Qi.

290
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,080
What will you do after that?

291
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,970
I only want to resolve
past misunderstandings.

292
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,230
He doesn't have to save him.

293
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,350
I just want him to pull some strings
with the Judicial Review

294
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,200
and let me meet Fu Yunxi.

295
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,280
Yushan, please have some tea.

296
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,660
Your Highness, please have some tea.

297
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,430
What if

298
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,350
I refuse?

299
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,190
Yushan,

300
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,350
your mother

301
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,000
was almost killed by Zhuang Shiyang.

302
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,560
Fu Yunxi and I saved her.

303
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,270
- What?
- Don't worry.

304
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,910
We've sheltered her.

305
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,040
Zhuang Shiyang is no good.

306
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,880
Over the years, you and your mother

307
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,320
have been deeply deceived by him.

308
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,190
Your mother has finally woken up.

309
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,280
Are you still going to be
the foolish daughter

310
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,040
of Pei's adopted son?

311
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,920
Zhuang Hanyan,

312
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,070
stop spouting nonsense

313
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,040
and twisting the truth.

314
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,350
I know better than you

315
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,110
what a man Father is

316
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,070
after all these years in the family.

317
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,120
Besides,

318
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,870
no one is willing to help you now.

319
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,720
Without a man,

320
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,280
you are nothing.

321
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,710
Let her go.

322
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,780
(Zhuiyue Pavilion)

323
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,680
(I don't have the ability to protect
your family as you expect.)

324
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,600
(Perhaps)

325
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,430
(you chose the wrong woman
from the start.)

326
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,870
Hanyan.

327
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,600
You...

328
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,390
Why...?

329
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,040
Hanyan,

330
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,590
I finally found you.

331
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,880
We...

332
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,830
We are here to help you.

333
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,810
You once helped me before,

334
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,110
but I couldn't disobey my father,

335
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,350
so I was late.

336
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,280
Please don't blame me.

337
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,350
Though we're just acquaintances,

338
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,760
just consider me here for the fun of it.

339
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,670
Thank you.

340
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,080
Thank you.

341
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,210
Someone in the Judicial Review said

342
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,160
that Fu Yunxi may have been ordered

343
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,450
to be a spy in the Pei faction.

344
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,620
Didn't this leave any evidence?

345
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,400
Time has passed;

346
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,480
evidence is hard to find.

347
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,430
But if I could meet Fu Yunxi

348
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,080
and get more info,

349
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,830
perhaps we could find more evidence.

350
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,080
Unfortunately,
the prison is heavily guarded,

351
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,310
and Mr. Yan won't even let me

352
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,000
step inside the Judicial Review.

353
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,480
I have a cousin

354
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,110
who was imprisoned
last year for a fight.

355
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,910
Perhaps you could use my name

356
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,640
to visit him in prison.

357
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,680
That would be great.

358
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,480
I'll send someone
to bribe the prison guards

359
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,310
and arrange for you

360
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,960
to meet Fu Yunxi after you enter.

361
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,040
This is a major case.

362
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,910
Any misstep could lead to trouble.

363
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,830
Are you really

364
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,230
going to help me?

365
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,630
Duke Qi holds immense power.

366
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,430
If you hadn't helped me back then,

367
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,830
I might have

368
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,590
already died.

369
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,830
Now that you're in trouble,

370
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,590
how could I just stand by and watch?

371
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,430
Throughout history, men's friendships
have always been praised.

372
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,160
Why can't I be warm-hearted

373
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,540
and ready to help today?

374
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,930
Women's friendship is also valuable.

375
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,830
I'm determined

376
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,240
to help you.

377
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,830
I am incompetent and foolish,

378
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,030
so all I can do

379
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,520
is pray

380
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,960
for all of you.

381
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,590
Please

382
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,430
accept my gratitude here.

383
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,800
- Hanyan.
- Please rise.

385
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,590
Who are you?

386
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,630
I'm Yao Wangshu, daughter
of Yao Zhidong, Grand Secretary.

387
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,950
I'm here to visit a prisoner.

388
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,500
(One member is allowed to visit)

389
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,430
Pass.

390
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:05,500
(Court of Judicial Review)

391
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,030
Behave yourself.

392
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,550
I'm innocent.

393
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,520
You have only
half an incense stick of time.

394
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,320
Thank you, sir.

395
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,920
It's fine.

396
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,840
Fu Yunxi.

397
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,120
Fu Yunxi.

398
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,110
Fu Yunxi.

399
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,760
Fu Yunxi.

400
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,910
Fu Yunxi.

401
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,110
You've confessed.

402
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,520
Why are you still tortured?

403
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,320
You shouldn't be here.

404
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,390
Go back.

405
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,190
I'll return,

406
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,960
and I'll bring you back

407
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,830
safe and sound.

408
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,800
Don't worry.

409
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,560
I've tried to pull some strings outside.

410
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,960
The powerful and noble in the Capital

411
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,760
are willing to help.

412
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,190
Your name will soon be cleared.

413
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,150
You must not give up.

414
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,480
No one knows you better than I do

415
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,720
when you lie.

416
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,720
Stop trying to save me.

417
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,520
Take care of yourself,

418
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,910
and take care of our family.

419
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,760
As long as you are safe and happy,

420
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,520
I will be content.

421
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,630
Though this is extremely hard,

422
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,870
it is not entirely without hope.

423
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,760
You aren't someone
who'd easily give up on your life.

424
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,350
What are you truly afraid of?

425
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,590
If you fear dragging me down,

426
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,240
you are wrong.

427
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,830
I do not want this kind
of self-righteous care for me.

428
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,590
Mother cared for me,

429
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,040
cutting off our ties for 17 years.

430
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,140
But she didn't know

431
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,360
that I'd rather be trapped
in Zhuang Residence with her

432
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,190
than be a child without a mother.

433
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,720
Chai Jing cared for me,

434
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,790
so she took the blame and went
to prison for me behind my back.

435
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,960
But she didn't know

436
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,720
that watching her never being able
to hold a saber again

437
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,960
was more painful
than if I had been killed.

438
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,350
Fu Yunxi,

439
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,040
do you want me

440
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,430
to endure this kind of pain again?

441
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,670
Zhuang Hanyan,

442
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,280
I am a despicable man,

443
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,830
unworthy

444
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,720
of your sincere feelings

445
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,240
and honest treatment.

446
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,040
You do have another secret.

447
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,830
I have long been poisoned,

448
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,350
and my life is nearly over.

449
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,110
You want to find a woman with the means

450
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:14,980
to protect your family

451
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,830
and you to secretly keep
the enormous fortune

452
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,110
of the Zuohang Gang...

453
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,520
Did something go wrong?

454
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,670
Poisoned?

455
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,720
It was five years ago.

456
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,240
On the day Yuqin was poisoned,

457
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,240
I also drank half a cup

458
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,630
of the poisoned wine on the table.

459
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,520
Yunxi.

460
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,110
Yunxi, Yunxi.

461
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,320
Yunxi, Yunxi.

462
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
What's wrong?

463
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,200
- Are you okay, Yunxi?
- Are you okay?

464
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,870
- Yunxi, open the door.
- Yunxi.

465
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,150
- I'm fine.
- Open the door.

466
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,270
I'm fine.

467
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,110
The poison is complex,

468
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,870
and it can't be cured.

469
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,720
I can only use rare herbs
to prolong my life,

470
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,720
but I don't know
how much longer I can last.

471
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,560
I've made too many enemies
because of my job.

472
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,910
If I die,

473
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,630
my entire family will be revenged.

474
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,960
That's why I decided

475
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,550
to find a strategist to protect

476
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,870
my family as my wife,

477
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,830
and you appeared

478
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,960
in my sight at that moment.

479
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,350
The day we met,

480
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,960
I knew in my heart

481
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
you were the one I was looking for.

482
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,080
I knew my time was short,

483
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,070
and I dared not fall in love,

484
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,000
nor could I stir your feelings.

485
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,280
But I underestimated you.

486
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,910
The more I restrained myself,

487
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,080
the harder it became to control myself.

488
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,080
I kept having improper thoughts
about you.

489
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,670
Your occasional tenderness in return

490
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,320
made me happy

491
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,590
but also guilty and regretful.

492
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,390
Perhaps

493
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,110
from the very first day we met,

494
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,590
I thought I was the one hunting the fox,

495
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,760
(Happiness)
but I'd been captured by you.

496
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,630
Later,

497
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,280
our marriage, protection, and alliances

498
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,430
were just excuses

499
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,240
to deceive you

500
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,180
(Divorce Letter)
and deceive me.

501
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,670
Now,

502
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,080
with my dying body,

503
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,150
I'll take on all the blame,

504
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,110
and everything will be resolved.

505
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,630
Don't worry.
I've negotiated with Mr. Yan.

506
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,970
The Emperor insists
on investigating the adopted son

507
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,390
because of that enormous fortune.

508
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,320
Now, I'll take all the blame,

509
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,630
and Mr. Yan will protect

510
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,960
my family from being implicated.

511
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,080
There's one more thing.

512
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,720
When I first went to Danzhou,

513
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,070
I found a large sum of money

514
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,830
Zhuang Shiyang had not yet moved.

515
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,110
The amount is considerable.

516
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,280
It's hidden in our secret compartment.

517
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,600
It can ensure that you

518
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,590
will no longer suffer

519
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,520
for the rest of your life.

520
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,910
Stop trying to save me.

521
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,110
Take this money

522
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,560
and our family

523
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,720
and leave for another place.

524
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,040
Fu Yunxi,

525
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,040
I've long known
that you had other plans,

526
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,110
and I've realized
you were hiding something.

527
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,430
But I didn't know you could be so cruel.

528
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,720
You deceived me

529
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,830
into marrying a dying man.

530
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:15,830

00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,070
♪The only flame
in your long winter night♪

564
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,980
♪The only goose♪

565
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:33,690
♪In my winter sky♪

566
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,830
It's true that I harmed you in the past,

567
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,430
but this time,

568
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,430
I truly want to help you.

569
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,760
Yet in the end,

570
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,430
I still messed it up.

571
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,320
Ms. Zhou,

572
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,630
have you ever longed
for a lifetime of happiness

573
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,110
with your beloved?

574
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,040
Falling in love

575
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,110
and exchanging true feelings

576
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,150
are a luxury to me.

577
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,390
I only want to live well.

578
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,350
Fu Yunxi once asked me this question,

579
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,870
and I answered in the same way.

580
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,320
What about now?

581
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,520
When it comes to love,

582
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,480
only those who have had it

583
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,720
and who have felt it

584
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,870
can know how precious it is,

585
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,190
and only then do they know

586
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,590
how terrifying it is.

587
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,630
It can make you lose your sense

588
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,390
and uncontrollably want more.

589
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,080
I once thought

590
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,870
love was not important to me,

591
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,280
but now, looking back,

592
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,670
all the schemes and tests

593
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,390
I had with him

594
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,910
were because

595
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,080
I had already fallen for him.

596
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,080
You still want to save him?

597
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,280
My mother and I

598
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,390
only had a hundred days together.

599
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,720
After she passed, I realized

600
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,350
how precious every day

601
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,560
I spent with her had been.

602
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,350
Such is the way of the world
and of human hearts.

603
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,190
Only after losing something

604
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,830
do you realize its value.

605
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
Only after losing it

606
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,240
do you regret it.

607
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,040
But this time,

608
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,000
I don't want to repeat that.

609
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,240
I've said something out of anger today,

610
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,390
but how could I abandon him?

611
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,560
How could I watch him
die unjustly in prison?

612
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,240
So, what are you

613
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,390
going to do next?

614
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,960
Now, to save him,

615
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,670
I must prove that he was ordered

616
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,320
to be a spy in the Pei faction.

617
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,040
Though there is no evidence,

618
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,670
I am the only one

619
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,880
who knows the truth.

620
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,000
I can be his witness.

621
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,510
However,

622
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,920
you are his wife.

623
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,590
How can such a testimony

624
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,190
be trusted by the Judicial Review?

625
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,020
The Appeal Drum is
just outside the Palace.

626
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,440
As long as I beat it,

627
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,710
I can enter the Palace

628
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,720
and present my plea before the Emperor.

629
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,590
How confident are you?

630
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,710
It doesn't matter.

631
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,480
This is the only path I have left.

632
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,710
I must try

633
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,960
everything in my power

634
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,590
and do whatever I can.

635
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,080
Even if it ends in failure,

636
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,440
and he still has to die,

637
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,230
at least

638
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,230
I can face Lingzhi in the future.

639
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,080
At least in my midnight dreams,

640
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,190
I won't regret and feel uneasy.

641
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,360
Do you think I'm foolish?

642
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,070
I actually envy you a little

643
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,480
for having encountered someone

644
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,320
who makes you take risks

645
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,710
and disregard everything.

646
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,280
Madam.

647
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,520
Who is this lady?

648
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,840
She's Mrs. Wen who went
to the house to see you,

649
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,230
so I brought her here.

650
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,880
I am the widow of Wen Mingchang.

651
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,040
Are you

652
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,200
Mrs. Wen?

653
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,320
Yes.

654
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,240
Mrs. Wen,

655
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,360
I once went

656
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,880
to search for Mr. Wen's family,

657
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,060
but I was told that after his passing,

658
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,750
his family moved away
from their old home,

659
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,230
and no one knows their whereabouts.

660
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,310
Do you know anything

661
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,000
about Fu Yunxi's being a spy
in the Pei faction?

662
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,510
Mrs. Fu,

663
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,880
if you enter the Palace

664
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,270
to meet the Emperor with this,

665
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,630
you'll be more likely to succeed.

666
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,230
What's this?

667
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,920
I heard you broke
into the Judicial Review

668
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,270
to save your husband,

669
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,280
claiming that Fu Yunxi was ordered
by my husband, Wen Mingchang

670
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,960
to be a spy in the Pei faction.

671
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,110
When I heard this,

672
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,110
I was relieved,

673
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,310
so I came to visit.

674
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,110
Please open this letter

675
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,270
and learn the truth.

676
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,960
The Pei faction is cruel,
persecuting those who oppose them.

677
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,670
Eunuch Pei may have suspected
my disloyalty.

678
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,350
Recently, I have been secretly followed,

679
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,590
and there have been attempts on my life.

680
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,670
You've managed to infiltrate the faction
and gained that eunuch's trust.

681
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,520
It must've been hard.

682
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,670
I hope one day to cleanse the court
and restore order.

683
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,630
I have written down
the details in a secret code

684
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,840
and hidden it in a memorial
for the Emperor.

685
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,880
- If something happens to me,
- Search.

686
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,630
- you can use this memorial
- Hurry.

687
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,150
- to prove your innocence.
- Guards!

688
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,200
There's an assassin!

689
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,590
Search every room.

690
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,510
Yes.

691
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,320
Hurry.

692
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,840
Search carefully.

693
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,920
Catch the assassin!

694
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,840
Madam, Mr. Wen is in the study.

695
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,280
Master.

696
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,070
Master.

697
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,480
Master.

698
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,670
Master, what's wrong?

699
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,710
Master.

700
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,550
What do you want?

701
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,480
Deliver the letter.

702
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,630
Since there is Mr. Wen's secret letter,

703
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,000
why not present it to the Palace

704
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,190
and let the Emperor decide?

705
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,400
Mr. Wen has passed away.

706
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,190
What if someone is framing him,

707
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,590
claiming that this letter is forged?

708
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,560
Could it result in the crime
of deceiving the Emperor?

709
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,270
This letter is not the key.

710
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,280
What can truly

711
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,270
save Fu Yunxi

712
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,880
is this.

713
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,030
(Memorial)

714
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,950
That's right.

715
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,470
Earlier,

716
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,630
I was so delighted

717
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,920
because I saw hope in this.

718
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,480
Imperial memorials

719
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,750
are always kept in the Palace.

720
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,560
It seems that we must first report it
to the Emperor.

721
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,160
But I'm afraid that if we hastily
present it to the Palace,

722
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,270
and this memorial can't be found,

723
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,620
we will be left with no way
to defend ourselves

724
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,550
and still be accused
of deceiving the Emperor.

725
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,520
I once heard Zhuang Shiyang mention

726
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,320
that copies of imperial memorials

727
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,000
are stored in the Office
of Transmission.

728
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,670
The Transmission?

729
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,830
The current Principal Graduate,

730
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,970
He Wenshen, was assigned
to the Transmission, right?

731
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,000
It's him.

732
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,920
I remember at the Lantern Festival,

733
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,840
he seemed to favor you.

734
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,230
His proposal

735
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,520
ended up awkward.

736
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,360
If he still harbors resentment

737
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,150
and learns of this secret,

738
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,400
he may

739
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,880
ruin the copy of the memorial first.

740
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,670
You only have

741
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,480
to ask him to let you
into the Transmission.

742
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,400
But we have to consider

743
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,360
whether he would be willing to meet me

744
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,310
and listen to my plea.

745
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,840
I have a way.

746
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,770
Mr. He once studied
at the Directorate of Education.

747
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,710
My grandfather taught him
for a few days.

748
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,710
Maybe he will help me because of it.

749
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,700
(Office of Transmission)

750
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,240
Mr. He,

751
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,960
this letter was sent from Mr. Deng
of the Directorate of Education.

752
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,940
(To Wenshen: I'll wait for you
at Hongyun Hall at the Xu hour.)

753
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,080
Mr. Deng?

754
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,800
Zhuang Hanyan.

755
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,680
Mr. He.

756
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,680
Why is it you?

757
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,270
Mr. He, forgive me.

758
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,960
I used

759
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,880
Mr. Deng's name

760
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,920
to meet with you.

761
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,470
Mr. He,

762
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,150
please have some tea.

763
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,750
You really are bold

764
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,880
to impersonate an official.

765
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,960
I am grateful for your favor

766
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,590
and for proposing to me
at Zhuang Residence.

767
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,960
Yet, it didn't end pleasantly,

768
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,840
which has left me uneasy.

769
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,110
Today, I have set a modest banquet

770
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,440
to seek your forgiveness.

771
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,880
Don't beat around the bush.

772
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,920
Now, Fu Yunxi is imprisoned.

773
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,760
Do you want me to save him?

774
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,320
Mr. He, you're a wise and honorable man.

775
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,590
I dare not hide it from you.

776
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,070
Today, to save my husband,

777
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,310
there is a request I must make.

778
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,590
What request?

779
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,000
I want to enter the Transmission

780
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,840
to find a copy of the memorial.

781
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,030
What?

782
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,920
I am not yet able to reveal

783
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,270
the details of this,

784
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,440
but I beg you to grant my request.

785
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,960
You refused my proposal before.

786
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,000
Have you ever thought it'd come to this?

787
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,480
It's my fault

788
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,140
for failing to see your potential.

789
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,360
We haven't met for so long.

790
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,840
Now, I'm an official,
while you're just a common woman.

791
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,400
But you didn't kneel and kowtow to me,

792
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,920
calling me "My Lord".

793
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,110
If there's nothing else,

794
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,360
I must take my leave.

795
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,510
My Lord, I'm Zhuang Hanyan.

796
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,840
I beg you for mercy.

797
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,560
You truly are a devoted woman.

798
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,800
Fine.

799
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,560
Come to the Transmission tomorrow night.

800
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,840
I will send someone to meet you.

801
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,960
Thank you, Mr. He.

802
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,040
What memorial copy do you need?

803
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,630
The memorials
from the Judicial Review last year.

804
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,030
They're all here.

805
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,200
There are date labels
on the bookshelves.

806
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,590
You can search slowly.

807
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,080
Be careful with the fire.

808
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,920
Thank you, Mr. He.

809
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,800
(Wen Mingchang, Chief Minister,
Month 3, Day 15, Year 3)

810
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,870
There's light at the central archives.

811
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,310
As expected, a thief has broken in.

812
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,420
(Respectfully, Wen Mingchang)

813
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,470
Where is the thief?

814
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:08,790
My Lord, the window.

815
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,550
Backyard. Chase her.

816
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,470
Yes.

817
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,240
- Madam.
- Madam.

818
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:44,110
The thief is here. Capture her.

819
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,780
(Office of Transmission)

820
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,960
Shameless thief.

821
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,750
How dare you break into the Transmission

822
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,480
and steal imperial memorials!

823
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,680
Seize her.

824
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,510
Stop.

825
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:18,480
I'm the granddaughter of Mr. Deng,
Chancellor of the Education.

826
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,110
Let me see who dares to touch me.

827
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:23,540
I'm the daughter of Mr. Yao,
Grand Secretary of the Secretariat.

828
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:24,870
Who is the shameless thief here?

829
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:28,000
I'm the daughter of Mr. Li,
Grand Councilor of the Right.

830
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,270
Retreat now.

831
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,760
How dare you protect the thief?

832
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,460
Don't you fear
the Three Judicial Offices?

833
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,310
The Reviewer
of the Judicial Review is here.

834
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,760
I'll ask you first about your crimes.

835
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,150
Mr. He, you let

836
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,920
a thief into the Transmission

837
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,560
and asked everyone to catch her.

838
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,190
What are you up to?

839
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:53,590
Kill them.

840
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,880
Protect them.

841
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,800
- Hanyan.
- Hanyan.

842
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,150
Everyone, you...

843
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:00,960
Don't worry about us. Hurry and leave.

844
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,590
Hanyan, don't worry.

845
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,840
Just go.

846
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,150
- Go.
- Go.

847
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,960
- Go.
- Go.

848
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,710
- My Lord.
- We must protect her.

849
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,440
Take the shortcut to chase her.

850
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,360
Yes.

851
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:17,510
Let's go.

852
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,420
(Shen)

853
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,000
(Lan)
- Who are you? - I...

854
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,920
Search here.

855
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,280
Sorry to bother you.

856
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,800
Don't go.

857
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,840
Come on. Hide here.

858
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:06,990
Here.

859
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,860
Just now,
a suspicious woman came this way

860
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:14,840
and suddenly disappeared.

861
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,760
Did any of you see her?

862
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,710
Someone did pass by,

863
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:18,950
but

864
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,670
it seemed she went north.

865
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,720
What do you want?

866
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,150
An indictment.

867
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,380
I am an indictment writer,

868
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:30,670
writing indictments for others,

869
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,840
seeking justice in court for the poor.

870
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,150
As officers and guards,

871
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,400
surely you know

872
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,070
this is breaking into private homes.

873
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,190
According to the law,

874
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,670
you should be taken
to the court and get canned.

875
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,720
Move aside.

876
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:04,190
The government is chasing a criminal.

877
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,190
How dare you stop me?

878
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,440
I've served in the government.

879
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,110
Let me see

880
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,190
which office you belong to.

881
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,880
Under the Emperor's watch,

882
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:14,670
how dare you be so rude
and disturb the people?

883
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,320
Let's go to the north.

884
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,560
She must be nearby.

885
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:40,150
It's fine now.

886
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,550
You two have helped me a lot.

887
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,270
I don't know how to repay you.

888
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:59,230
Yunxi is a spy?

889
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:09,820
(Yunxi is a spy in the Pei faction,
awaiting the Emperor's judgment.)

890
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,680
Thank you.

891
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,680
Thank you.

892
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:25,880
Do you have a grievance?

893
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,330
Why are they chasing you?

894
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,110
My family is imprisoned.

895
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,310
I must bring evidence to the Palace

896
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:33,690
and overturn the verdict.

897
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:35,590
Once you exit this alley,

898
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:36,840
keep heading east.

899
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,170
There's the Appeal Drum.

900
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:39,840
Once you strike it,

901
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:41,480
no one will dare to trouble you.

902
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,590
If this world is unfair,

903
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,150
you must carve your own path.

904
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,080
Thank you for your chivalry.

905
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,720
Hurry now.

906
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:15,340
(Court of Appeal Drum)

907
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,230
Stop.

908
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,700
She's going to strike the Appeal Drum.

909
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,070
Hurry.

910
