00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,180
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,370
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

4
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,150
Rise.

5
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Zhuang Hanyan,

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,480
I ordered you to kneel in punishment,

7
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,230
yet you saved my life.

8
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,360
Such kindness in return for grievance

9
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,360
makes me seem petty in comparison.

10
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,640
I wouldn't dare.

11
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,790
I was wrong, so I should
accept my punishment.

12
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,880
Mr. Fu, I've long heard
of your brilliance in solving cases.

13
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,230
Do you know why this horse went mad?

14
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,280
Your Highness,

15
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,360
tonight's chaos

16
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,630
was caused by this handkerchief

17
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,360
soaked in the juice of mad horse grass.

18
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,920
That wild horse is addicted
to mad horse grass.

19
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,360
With its keen sense of smell,

20
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,920
it became overexcited
upon detecting this scent.

21
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,710
Mad horse grass?

22
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,710
Are you saying

23
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,360
someone intended to harm me?

24
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,110
This handkerchief belonged to my mother.

25
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,440
Your Highness, you just noticed

26
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,590
that the stitches are crude,

27
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,630
proving that someone

28
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,390
secretly swapped her handkerchief

29
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,110
and released the mad horse
into the hall.

30
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,920
The true target was my mother,

31
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,710
but it nearly harmed you instead.

32
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,040
Mrs. Zhuang,

33
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,510
do you know who is responsible for this?

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,230
I do not.

35
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,830
This happened so suddenly.

36
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,800
Please allow me to investigate further

37
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,920
before reporting back to you.

38
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,990
There is no need to conceal the truth.

39
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,200
Since the handkerchief was switched,

40
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,480
it must be a struggle at your home.

41
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,350
Mrs. Zhuang,

42
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,980
shall I help you resolve this matter?

43
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,800
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

44
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,670
My family matters

45
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,950
nearly endangered you.

46
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,360
I dare not trouble you further.

47
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,520
Your Highness,
this is no trivial matter.

48
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,670
The culprit must be found,
and the Zhuangs must be punished

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,390
to uphold your imperial dignity.

50
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,270
Zhuang Hanyan,

51
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,950
step forward.

52
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,000
I asked you to step forward.

53
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,000
Kneel.

54
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,120
Give me your hand.

55
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,680
Your Highness, you...

56
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,510
Before we were married,

57
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,590
your mother and I once competed

58
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,200
in a polo match.

59
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,440
This jade bangle was the prize.

60
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,710
Though I won that day,

61
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,640
I always knew

62
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,240
she let me win on purpose.

63
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,000
Now, as an unmarried lady,

64
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,000
you risked your life
to tame a wild horse

65
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,470
and saved me from being trampled.

66
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,120
So, I shall reward you
with this jade bangle.

67
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,800
I believe I've returned it
to its rightful owner.

68
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,800
Take it.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,150
Thank you for your generous gift.

70
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,950
Even now,

71
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,630
do you still refuse
to tell me the secret

72
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,760
of your tea-making?

73
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,720
I have never lied to you.

74
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,150
I have no secret.

75
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,150
I simply brew it casually.

76
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,080
After all these years,

77
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,350
you still don't believe me?

78
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,950
Why did you give my daughter

79
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,080
the jade bangle?

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,150
What do you think?

81
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,510
A luxurious jade bangle

82
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,440
seems to be a reward,

83
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,350
but it actually is a curse.

84
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,440
In the polo match back then,

85
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,510
you deliberately lost,

86
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,950
allowing me to shine,

87
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,710
win that bangle,

88
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,640
and catch the Emperor's attention.

89
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,910
It was only later that I understood it.

90
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,200
With your pride and stubbornness,

91
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,760
how could you have let me win?

92
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,320
You had seen through it all.

93
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,910
The Imperial Palace

94
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,880
is nothing but a gilded cage.

95
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,910
You didn't want to be trapped within it.

96
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,000
Over the years, I seemed
to be endlessly favored,

97
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,200
but in reality, every step I took
was fraught with danger.

98
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,240
I've given up and sacrificed

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,270
many things

100
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,910
and have been plotted
against many times.

101
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,560
I was even forced

102
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,510
to remain childless for life.

103
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,440
Everything happened

104
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,110
because of you.

105
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,440
That match was held for the Emperor.

106
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,400
The jade bangle was never
the true prize.

107
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,040
The real prize was becoming
a consort in the Palace.

108
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,230
Everyone knew that.

109
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,350
I saw how desperately you wanted to win,

110
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,420
so I simply let you
have what you desired.

111
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,710
How can you blame me now?

112
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,160
I do blame you.

113
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,080
Why must I be trapped in the Palace,

114
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,920
even needing to kneel and beg

115
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,950
just to visit my family once a year?

116
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,440
While you...

117
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,710
I once thought

118
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,800
that though you lost the ability to walk

119
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,520
and your family declined,

120
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,110
at least you had a man

121
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,320
who cherished you above all else.

122
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,750
But even now,

123
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,710
despite your condition,

124
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,560
someone still seeks to take your life.

125
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,950
Ms. Ruan,

126
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,280
you still haven't escaped this cage.

127
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,440
Seeing me suffer brings you joy,
doesn't it?

128
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,750
It's a pity that I am crippled

129
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,230
and can't kneel before you,

130
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,320
or you'd no doubt be even more pleased

131
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,400
with yourself.

132
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,430
How dare you!

133
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,350
Your Highness, Ms. Tan is here.

134
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,360
Let her in.

135
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,080
(Tan Yunxian, imperial physician)
Greetings, Your Highness.

136
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,630
I wish you well.

137
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,710
Rise.

138
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

139
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,950
Ms. Tan,

140
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,280
I have heard
of your brilliant medical skills

141
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,470
and your extraordinary
acupuncture techniques

142
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,710
that can make someone
who once lost their hands write again.

143
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,160
Mrs. Zhuang

144
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,080
has been disabled for many years.

145
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,710
Please examine her

146
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,680
and see if it's due to illness

147
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,710
or some kind of curse.

148
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,660
Yes, Your Highness.

149
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,950
What are you doing?

150
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,040
Mrs. Zhuang, sorry about this.

151
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,070
You...

152
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,470
What are you doing?

153
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,590
Ms. Tan, no need for further tests.

154
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,830
My legs were crippled by a beating,

155
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,090
and my tendons and bones
have been broken for 17 years.

156
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,110
I received treatment
for a long time back then,

157
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,040
and those physicians said

158
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,080
I could never stand again.

159
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,630
Mrs. Zhuang, which physician

160
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,680
did you consult 17 years ago?

161
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,150
My husband found
famous physicians for me.

162
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,750
I fear these so-called famous physicians

163
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,320
can't be trusted.

164
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,880
What do you mean?

165
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,990
Your legs have old injuries
to the tendons and bones,

166
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,200
but once the wounds heal
with proper practice,

167
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,710
you won't be paralyzed to this day.

168
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,200
You mean

169
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,920
those physicians were lying to me?

170
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,870
They might be inept

171
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,040
or try to deceive you.

172
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,710
I dare not jump to conclusions.

173
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,990
It's a shame you were so clever

174
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,950
and yet failed to notice this plot
for half your life.

175
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,040
Mrs. Zhuang, please don't be angry.

176
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,160
When I took your pulse earlier,

177
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,440
I detected signs
of long-standing emotional strain.

178
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,280
I fear that over these years,

179
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,040
you've harbored
deep resentment and hatred,

180
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,200
which has further damaged your health

181
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,320
and prevented the paralysis

182
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,400
from healing.

183
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,280
Otherwise, even if you received
improper treatment,

184
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,870
at least you would've been able
to limp now.

185
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,360
So, with the current situation,

186
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,280
I...

187
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,080
Do I still have a chance...?

188
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,110
If you trust me,

189
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,040
from tomorrow on,

190
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,200
I will come to your home every day

191
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,870
to perform acupuncture on you.

192
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,480
However, you also need
to be relieved of your burdens.

193
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,540
How much I can help you

194
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,630
depends on whether you can
let go of your hatred,

195
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,230
restore balance to your energy,

196
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,440
and stop torturing yourself
with resentment

197
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,920
that harms your health.

198
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,040
So, you mean...

199
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,470
So, you mean I can still

200
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,200
stand again?

201
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,550
I can't guarantee that you will be

202
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,560
as agile as before,

203
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,460
but you should at least be able
to live independently.

204
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,990
Once your legs heal,

205
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,080
you will be free.

206
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,080
What you lost

207
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,230
can be regained.

208
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,920
Ruan Xiwen,

209
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,420
at the Lantern Festival next year,

210
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,790
I will see you

211
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,110
stand from your wheelchair

212
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,800
and kneel before me.

213
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,170
Only then

214
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,400
will this battle be settled.

215
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,800
I know

216
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,470
this whole incident

217
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,630
was caused by you.

218
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,480
Don't make baseless accusations.

219
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,750
This is punishable by death.

220
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,350
Do not panic.

221
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,950
I never intended to expose you,

222
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,800
or I wouldn't have covered
for you earlier

223
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,680
in front of the Noble Consort.

224
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,870
How can you be kind to me?

225
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
I never intended to help you,

226
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,470
but I also never meant to harm you.

227
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,710
From now on,

228
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,080
I have something

229
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,950
on you.

230
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,990
If you dare harm my mother again,

231
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,120
I will not

232
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,350
let you off lightly.

233
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,680
Don't think I will fear you.

234
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,080
I can die if I must.

235
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,310
Zhuang Yushan,

236
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,240
although we share blood,

237
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,830
there's no sisterhood between us.

238
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,440
But as women, let me offer you

239
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,550
one last piece of advice tonight.

240
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,470
In this life,

241
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,400
there are so many things worth pursuing.

242
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,560
You don't need to destroy yourself

243
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,560
for a man who doesn't love you.

244
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,630
Yes, tonight I have lost.

245
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,750
But you don't need to act so arrogantly.

246
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,280
You still don't understand.

247
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,590
I've never played against you,

248
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,280
so there's no winner.

249
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,760
You win by default.

250
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,440
I'm a fool to use tricks
in front of someone

251
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,670
scheming like you.

252
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,150
But let me tell you.

253
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,560
I will never admit defeat.

254
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,750
Madam, it's late now.

255
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,560
We should head home.

256
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,480
Leave me for now.

257
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,590
I want to be alone for a while.

258
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,630
I rarely come out.

259
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,190
Thinking of that grand residence,

260
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,430
I never want to step foot there again.

261
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,270
Xiwen.

262
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,910
Mr. Yuwen,

263
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,280
are you also here for the banquet?

264
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,480
Tonight at the Lantern Festival,

265
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,320
I saw the young people of the Capital

266
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,080
gathering in secret

267
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,150
with their affections entwined.

268
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,800
It reminds me

269
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,760
of an old item

270
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,320
that I never gave to you back then.

271
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,040
What is it?

272
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,580
(Gift List, Letter of Proposal)

273
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,210
A bolt of black silk,
a bolt of red silk,

274
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,280
two bolts of deerskin, two geese,

275
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,040
satin and jade ornaments,

276
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,080
horses with armor,

277
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,870
concave mirrors, and paintings.

278
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,540
(Gift List, Letter of Proposal)
Over these years,

279
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,000
every quiet night,

280
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,190
I look at this gift list

281
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,590
and letter of proposal.

282
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,520
It's a pity

283
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,800
that the one I promised to marry

284
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,910
never became

285
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,150
my partner in the end.

286
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,320
The banquet is over.

287
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,560
You're late.

288
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,670
The banquet is over,
but you are still here.

289
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,000
If you want,

290
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,870
we can always

291
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,560
drink again.

292
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,270
Xiwen,

293
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,320
since you don't want to go back there,

294
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,480
why torture yourself like this?

295
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,830
The world is vast.

296
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,150
There will always be a place for you.

297
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,830
Fine, I won't force you.

298
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,310
I'll just return this letter of proposal
and gift list

299
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,870
to its rightful owner.

300
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,110
I'll wait for your answer.

301
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,910
Why are you also here?

302
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,320
Noble Consort Miao
asked your mother to stay

303
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,670
and brought in the imperial physician.

304
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,430
Miss Hanyan,
you've predicted everything.

305
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,490
You managed to bring
the Noble Consort here

306
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,800
even without your official position.

307
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,590
How influential of you.

308
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,450
This didn't take much effort.

309
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,160
I simply passed on the news
about Mrs. Zhuang's appearance

310
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,100
at the Linjiang Pavilion
to Miao Mansion,

311
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,590
and she came uninvited.

312
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,820
At first, I thought
they were old friends,

313
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,430
and then I thought they were enemies.

314
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,150
But now,

315
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,120
perhaps they're just two women

316
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,260
who can sympathize with each other.

317
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,830
Sympathize with each other?

318
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,210
What's the source of their pain?

319
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,400
They both married

320
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,000
the wrong man.

321
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,470
What about you?

322
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,120
What?

323
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,560
What are your plans

324
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,000
for your marriage?

325
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,110
The world is tough.

326
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,350
Just being able to live is hard enough.

327
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,630
Finding love

328
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,930
and growing old together
is even harder to come by.

329
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,800
I never dared to wish for it,

330
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,390
nor have I made any plans for it.

331
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,040
Have you never longed

332
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,530
for a lifetime with one partner?

333
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,390
I've understood from a young age

334
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,970
that people's hearts are hard to read

335
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,450
and feelings can easily change.

336
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,040
I don't want to tie my hopes

337
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,830
to the whims of any man.

338
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,060
But you can't stay in the Zhuang family.

339
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,680
Do you really want to be stuck

340
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,130
in Zhuang Residence your whole life?

341
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,870
It's not that I don't want

342
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,910
to get married,

343
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,080
but for me,

344
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,540
marriage isn't about romance

345
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,320
or growing old together.

346
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,820
It's more about finding a place

347
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,180
where I can settle down

348
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,590
and live peacefully

349
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,800
without being humiliated or tortured

350
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,720
and suffering from wandering.

351
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,160
If I can achieve that,

352
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,720
it'd be the greatest happiness in life.

353
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,520
Do you truly think that way?

354
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,230
Of course.

355
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,080
I can give you

356
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,000
what you want.

It's cold at night.

366
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,190
Miss Hanyan, you'd better return
and rest early.

367
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,900
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

368
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,580
(Few days later)

369
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,110
Acupuncture these days
has shown results.

370
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,390
This is a sign that the meridians
are unblocked.

371
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,600
Mrs. Zhuang,

372
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,320
if the pain is too much to bear,

373
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,590
you can cry out.

374
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,720
It will ease the discomfort.

375
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,390
I've had no feeling in my legs
for over ten years.

376
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,720
I can bear

377
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,280
this little pain gladly.

378
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,630
From now on,

379
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,520
you must continue taking the medicine.

380
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,800
Also,

381
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,670
you can't sit in the wheelchair all day.

382
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,870
You need to get up
and walk around often.

383
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,190
It will be hard at first,

384
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,560
but as long as you stay determined,

385
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,350
it will gradually improve.

386
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,920
Thank you.

387
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,800
Ms. Tan,

388
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,640
how much longer will it take

389
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,670
for my mother to recover?

390
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,830
It's too hard for her to recover

391
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,080
from this long-standing disease.

392
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,480
I can't guarantee it.

393
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,760
But for small illnesses,
we treat the body;

394
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,340
for major ones, we treat the heart.

395
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,350
As long as the madam can relax

396
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,520
and follow my advice,

397
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,080
though it's hard to recover,

398
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,630
she'll get better in several months

399
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,630
or a few days.

400
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,950
Physician Tan,

401
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,280
all the servants here
are my trusted ones.

402
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,270
They will keep your treatment

403
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,760
a secret.

404
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,040
Please tell others only

405
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,000
that I am recuperating

406
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,870
to avoid trouble.

407
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,320
Rest assured, Madam.

408
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,520
I understand.

409
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,150
Madam, Madam.

410
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,400
Mother.

411
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,560
It's fine.

412
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,320
Let me do it.

413
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,560
At least, I have to stand up on my own.

414
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,000
Give me the cane.

415
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,920
Alright.

416
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,710
Here.

417
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,870
You both step aside.

418
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,430
I can do it.

419
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,450
- Mother.
- Madam, are you alright?

420
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,000
Rest for a while.

421
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,400
Alright.

422
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,470
It's fine.

423
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,720
Here, use this.

424
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,710
I'll do it.

425
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,400
Hanyan,

426
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,350
at the Lantern Festival,

427
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,480
Noble Consort Miao came uninvited,

428
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,190
and so did Yuwen Chang'an.

429
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,480
Did you arrange that?

430
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,910
That's not important.

431
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,480
What you want is what matters.

432
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,910
What do you mean?

433
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,000
If your legs can heal,

434
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,830
it will be like living a second life.

435
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,320
Are you willing to be trapped
in this mansion then?

436
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,960
You've put so much effort
into persuading me to leave,

437
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,390
and Ms. Tan also wants me
to let go of past grudges,

438
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,720
but this is so difficult.

439
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,670
Even if I am willing to leave,

440
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,080
can I leave you here alone
in this dangerous place?

441
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,150
Mother, do you want me
to leave with you?

442
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,630
Madam, we received
three visit letters today.

443
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,440
(Cao Fengxian)
Miss Hanyan tamed a fierce horse

444
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,790
and got a jade bangle
from Noble Consort Miao.

445
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,400
So, several influential families

446
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,430
have begun to seek her hand in marriage.

447
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,480
Yes.

448
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,640
There are several matchmakers

449
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,240
who want to visit as well.

450
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,610
There are indeed some good families
among them.

451
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,640
Hanyan,

452
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,670
we don't have to decide
to stay or leave now,

453
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,800
and these letters of birthdate can wait.

454
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,760
Tell me honestly.

455
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,760
What is going on

456
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,320
between you and Mr. Fu?

457
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,590
What do you mean, Mother?

458
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,080
Since your return,

459
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,910
he's helped you time and time again.

460
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,110
Has he developed feelings for you?

461
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,720
He has helped me many times,

462
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,720
but his mind is unpredictable.

463
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,670
I don't know

464
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,520
what he is thinking.

465
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,670
What about you?

466
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,760
Do you have feelings for him?

467
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,360
Hanyan,

468
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,110
love is beautiful.

469
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,910
To find someone who shares your mind

470
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,080
to weather the storms together

471
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,800
is a blessing in life.

472
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,000
As women,

473
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,520
it's not wrong to pursue love.

474
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,080
What's wrong is

475
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,000
to treat love as the only hope in life.

476
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,040
You asked me earlier

477
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,000
if I wanted to go with you.

478
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,670
My answer is no.

479
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,110
Though I'm your mother,

480
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,280
I can't accompany you through life.

481
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,080
I want you to have your own life

482
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,720
with your true friends
and loved ones by your side,

483
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,190
not to be an accessory to me.

484
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,240
Do you understand what I mean?

485
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,240
I understand.

486
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,960
I may have feelings

487
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,960
for Fu Yunxi,

488
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,040
but within that,

489
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,080
there is gratitude,

490
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,430
fear,

491
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,430
and even hatred.

492
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,870
I'm foolish

493
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,080
and can't differentiate my feelings.

494
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,430
But there may not be much time

495
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,080
left for you to reconsider.

496
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,080
What do you mean, Mother?

497
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,510
Your father has been busy

498
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,070
with the affairs of that foreign scholar
in the Hanlin Academy,

499
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,000
but he is still concerned
about your marriage.

500
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,760
I heard that he's accepted
many letters of birthdate

501
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,830
and plans to meet and assess them all.

502
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,800
Mother, do you know

503
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,430
why he is doing this?

504
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,870
I've been with him for 20 years.

505
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,320
There's no need to guess.

506
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,680
You and Fu Yunxi have had many dealings.

507
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,590
He must have noticed something.

508
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,030
Fu Yunxi is responsible for the case
of Pei's adopted son,

509
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,870
and that has made him wary.

510
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,630
So, he hopes to marry you off
to someone else asap

511
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,520
to reduce the connection
with the Fu family.

512
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,510
Moreover,

513
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,790
we've become closer recently.

514
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,970
He's guilty of what he's done,

515
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,690
so he's anxious over our relationship,

516
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,400
fearing that we will unite

517
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,430
and cause him trouble.

518
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,350
In that case,

519
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,800
these are like dry kindling,

520
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
and Zhuang Shiyang is the spark.

521
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,830
Let them burn.

522
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,800
What matters now

523
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,150
is to probe Fu Yunxi's true intentions.

524
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,190
Sure.

525
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,310
(Letter of Birthdate)

526
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,320
Mr. Zhuang, you're known
for your good parenting.

527
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,830
Sorry for my sudden visit

528
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,080
today.

529
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,040
I had to request many times

530
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,960
before Mother would agree to come.

531
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,040
This child is usually quite eloquent,

532
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,910
but today, upon arriving here,

533
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,000
he's lost his composure.

534
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,560
It's nothing.

535
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,880
I think that Mr. Xue

536
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,200
is a straightforward man.

537
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,830
If Miss Hanyan can be engaged to me

538
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,520
before the Spring Exam,

539
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,150
that would be a double joy.

540
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,720
Greetings, Mr. Zhuang.

541
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,950
Greetings, Mrs. Xue.

542
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,800
Yunxi, what brings you here?

543
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,240
I apologize for the intrusion,

544
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,850
but I'm worried about your secret ties

545
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,480
to the Pei faction.

546
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,030
Yunxi,

547
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,760
this matter has been settled.

548
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,670
Why are you bringing it up again?

549
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,110
(Fine and Leisure)
Wu Youzhi is dead.

550
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,330
There are still many doubts
in this case.

551
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,750
I've heard that the Judicial Review

552
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,400
is still secretly investigating you,

553
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,960
so I came to check on you.

554
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,790
Mr. Zhuang, how are you?

555
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,920
I haven't heard of this.

556
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,480
Who is investigating me?

557
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,400
Mr. Zhuang, forgive me.

558
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,630
Mr. Yang, Vice Director of War,

559
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,730
was secretly associated
with the Pei faction.

560
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,190
His entire family was executed;

561
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,960
his in-laws were also implicated.

562
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,880
Even his father-in-law and mother-in-law

563
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,480
were brought to the execution ground

564
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,960
and beheaded.

565
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,000
Now, the lives of my family are tied

566
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,630
to whether you're innocent or not.

567
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,150
I'm truly uneasy.

568
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,630
Mr. Zhuang,

569
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,540
since you have a guest,

570
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,230
we won't trouble you any further.

571
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,440
- We'll leave now.
- Mother, what are you afraid of?

572
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,670
Miss Hanyan carried
a corpse to save her family.

573
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,840
It's become a heroic tale
throughout the Capital.

574
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,080
The Zhuang family must be innocent.

575
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,110
What nonsense are you saying?

576
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,080
Let's go.

577
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,110
I'm terribly sorry.

578
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,200
- Hurry up.
- Mr. Zhuang.

579
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,220
- Our eight characters of birth match.
- Let's go.

580
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:16,860
We're perfect.

581
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,100
Don't allow others to marry her.

582
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,320
Mr. Zhuang!

583
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,190
Yunxi, what's going on?

584
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,150
Sorry

585
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,550
for disturbing your meeting.

586
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,360
I will take my leave now.

587
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,150
Yunxi,

588
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,400
why is the Judicial Review
investigating me?

589
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,040
I am innocent.

590
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,720
My Lord.

591
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,880
What's the matter?

592
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,190
Mr. Xue was spreading rumors
in the tavern,

593
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,410
saying that he came today
to propose to Miss Hanyan,

594
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,870
that she has taken a liking to him,

595
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,270
and that they'd get married soon.

596
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,310
Just teach him a lesson.

597
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,480
But

598
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,760
he's carrying a handkerchief,

599
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,110
showing it off everywhere,

600
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,630
claiming that it's a token of love

601
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,920
from Miss Hanyan.

602
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,400
You can't do this.

603
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,630
Please get up.

604
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,790
I can't accept this.

605
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,070
Mr. Zhuang.

606
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,590
Please spare

607
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,520
my silly son.

608
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,110
It's all his fault.

609
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,000
I've already beaten him.

610
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,190
If you are still unsatisfied,

611
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,190
take the whip and strike him again.

612
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,550
My wife and I won't complain.

613
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,080
- Yes.
- Please get up.

614
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,400
Hurry and ask Hanyan to come.

615
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Mr. Zhuang.

616
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,310
Mr. Zhuang, I beg you.

617
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,360
Hanyan.

618
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,710
Father, what's wrong?

619
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,790
Miss Hanyan,

620
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,920
my son has offended you today.

621
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,880
Please spare him.

622
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,310
Such disgraceful behavior from my son

623
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,080
is due to my failure as a father.

624
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,590
Miss Hanyan, you're wise and virtuous.

625
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,480
Please show mercy

626
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,630
and spare him.

627
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,560
Please tell me what happened.

628
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,590
You must ask

629
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,230
Mr. Fu

630
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,310
about this.

631
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,560
Fu Yunxi?

632
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,720
Yes.

633
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,000
Miss, Mr. Fu requests to see you.

634
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,400
He says he wants to return
something you lost.

635
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,520
Your handkerchief.

636
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,550
Mr. Xue stole it today

637
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,590
and almost ruined your reputation.

638
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,230
This is not mine.

639
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,070
I must've got it wrong.

640
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,990
Goodbye.

641
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,560
Stop.

642
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,880
Fu Yunxi, what do you mean by this?

643
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,630
Are you in such a hurry to get married?

644
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,230
So what?

645
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,880
In that case,

646
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,880
I shall help you choose today.

647
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,670
Zuo Yingshou,
son of the Director of Personnel,

648
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,080
is petty

649
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,440
and vengeful.

650
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,560
Chen Mo,
son of the Supervisor of Revenue,

651
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,150
is as timid as a mouse,

652
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,150
weak and incapable.

653
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,230
Cao Fengxian, son
of the Vice Commissioner of the Vault,

654
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,790
is accustomed to ingratiating others.

655
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,670
He is shameless and bold.

656
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,230
These men would indeed be
a good match for you.

657
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,440
Here are more.

658
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,840
Peng Guanyu, son of Junior Mentor
of the Heir Apparent,

659
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,520
is noble and refined,
elegant and cultured.

660
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,560
He is far from the kind of rough man

661
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,400
who resorts to violence and theft.

662
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,540
Luo Cheng, son of the Grand Secretary
of the East Hall,

663
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,280
is virtuous and wise,
honest and straightforward.

664
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,110
He's never a schemer

665
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,790
with malicious intentions.

666
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,560
Qiu Ming, son of the Vice Director
of the Central Secretariat,

667
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,840
has no extraordinary talents,

668
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,400
but he dares to ignore
the teasing of others,

669
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,880
declaring he will only marry one

670
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,670
and intends to remain pure for her.

671
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,630
Mr. Fu, I wonder
what you think of these men.

672
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,630
Miss Hanyan, if you want,

673
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,670
you can take them all as your husbands.

674
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,590
Goodbye.

675
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,400
My Lord.

676
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,070
Something's wrong.

677
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,960
What happened?

678
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,550
Miss Hanyan went to Fuyuan Temple today

679
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,750
to pray for her mother.

680
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,230
A man named He Wenshen

681
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,730
sent a visit letter to her home

682
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,150
and bribed the coachman

683
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,630
to get Miss Hanyan's itinerary.

684
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,020
He's followed her to Fuyuan Temple.

685
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:37,700
He Wenshen?

686
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,620
I've heard
that despite his humble background,

687
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,080
he is quite talented in literature.

688
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,330
He might be a top scorer
in the Spring Exam next month.

689
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,840
This man has some ability.

690
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,440
However, My Lord,

691
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,750
I have a brilliant plan.

692
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,000
Tell me.

693
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,920
Sure.

694
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,070
Yan and I will cover our faces

695
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,510
and ride quickly to rob them.

696
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,030
This scholar is weak and frail;

697
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,760
he will surely be scared
out of his wits.

698
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,630
Just as Yan and I

699
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,110
are about to disgrace Miss Hanyan,

700
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,880
you, riding a white horse,
can save the damsel in distress.

701
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,760
How does that sound?

702
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,680
That's a child's play.

703
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,440
I'm not so bored.

704
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,880
What's going on?

705
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,150
Miss Hanyan, forgive me.

706
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,800
This path is difficult to traverse,

707
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,270
and the wheel of the carriage broke.

708
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,440
What should we do?

709
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,040
Why didn't you check before we left?

710
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,110
Well...

711
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,880
I'm He Wenshen. Greetings, Miss Zhuang.

712
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,800
What's wrong?

713
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,020
Sorry about this, Mr. He.

714
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,960
Miss Zhuang, if you don't mind,

715
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,740
would you like to ride back
in my carriage?

716
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,960
A scholar and a beauty
are in the wilderness.

717
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,840
You must be having a good time.

718
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,400
What do you plan to do
in broad daylight?

719
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,110
Stop trying to act like a hero.

720
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,350
You look so poor.

721
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,620
You have nothing worth robbing.

722
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,230
Leave the woman and get lost.

723
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,920
I'm a current Juren.

724
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,280
If you dare to break the law,

725
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
the government won't spare you.

726
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
As bandits from the Heifeng Fort,

727
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,250
we're not afraid of the government.

728
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,000
- Get lost.
- Miss Zhuang, run!

729
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,920
Miss, let's go.

730
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:12,990
Did you hear that?

731
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,580
Miss.

732
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,750
Mr. He, do not worry.

733
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,990
Are you here

734
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,480
to rob wealth or to rob beauty?

735
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,920
Well...

736
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,310
Continue.

737
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,030
If you don't make a move,

738
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,110
how will your master show up?

739
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,560
What master?

740
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,230
Since you're here,

741
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,590
why not show yourself?

742
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,560
Has the drama come to an end

743
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,840
without a finale?

744
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,760
Miss...

745
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,440
- Let's go.
- Go.

746
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,920
Go, go, go.

747
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,960
What's this weasel doing here,

748
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,400
acting with ill intentions?

749
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,670
I'll smash you to pieces.

750
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,590
Miss.

751
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,100
(Informed but Curious)
My Lord, if there's nothing else,

752
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,270
we will take our leave.

753
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,400
Get lost.

754
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,030
Yes.

755
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,590
Let's go.

756
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,400
My Lord.

757
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,310
Is there anything else?

758
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,630
Miss Hanyan sent a maid

759
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,880
with a box of face powder,

760
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,950
saying it was to cover up
your blemishes.

761
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,550
Get lost.

762
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,040
What do you think of the recent actions

763
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,270
of Fu Yunxi?

764
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,770
Mother, what do you think?

765
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,700
He has feelings for you.

766
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,000
If he truly does,

767
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,360
it's time for him to tell me.

768
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:20,950
Madam.

769
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,550
Miss Hanyan,

770
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,080
you should go to the front hall.

771
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,320
What's going on?

772
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,670
He Wenshen has come again.

773
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,340
It seems he's here to propose.

774
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,370
The master has been talking to him
in the front yard for quite some time.

775
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,080
There was no reply to my visit letter,

776
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,310
so I thought

777
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,480
you had chosen someone else.

778
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,070
Mr. He, you're a rare talent
with a bright future ahead.

779
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,230
Besides, we're both from Yinan.

780
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:46,630
This will bring us much closer.

781
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,270
Who could be more suitable than you?

782
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,550
Miss Zhuang.

783
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,000
(Fine and Leisure)

784
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,310
Greetings, Mr. He.

785
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,230
There's no need for formalities.

786
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,360
You two are engaged now.

787
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,070
After the Spring Exam,

788
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,590
you can choose a lucky day
to get married.

789
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:07,110
I'm engaged?

790
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,200
Hanyan,

791
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,630
Mr. Zhuang made the decision just now,

792
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,310
and you're betrothed to me.

793
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,590
Father,

794
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,840
- I...
- Mr. He's family may be humble,

795
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,590
but he's a rare talent.

796
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:22,510
Even if he doesn't top

797
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,840
the Spring Exam next month,

798
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,670
he is sure to achieve great things.

799
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,040
This is my marriage.

800
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,110
Father, how can you decide so hastily?

801
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,710
Your marriage is up to your parents.

802
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,920
I have considered everything for you.

803
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:48,450
Mr. Zhuang.

804
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,920
Yunxi,

805
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,180
what brings you here

806
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
so late at night?

807
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,520
I heard that you plan to marry

808
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,960
Miss Hanyan to Mr. He.

809
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,150
That is true.

810
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,840
Once the wedding date is set,

811
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,440
I will invite you to join us
in celebration.

812
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,280
Greetings, Mr. Fu.

813
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,190
Mr. He and Miss Hanyan

814
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,190
are indeed a perfect match
made by heaven.

815
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,760
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

816
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,880
But how can one woman marry two men?

817
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,750
Mr. Zhuang, please enlighten me.

818
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,000
What do you mean by this?

819
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,030
Mr. Zhuang,

820
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,270
do you still

821
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:37,310
recognize this?

822
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,480
20 years ago,
our two families were close

823
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,300
and arranged this marriage agreement

824
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,980
(Marriage Agreement)
for the lineal kids.

825
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:49,920
May I ask if your lineal daughter
is Miss Zhuang Hanyan?

826
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,470
Yunxi,

827
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,630
you can't discuss this matter this way.

828
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,400
Our two families...

829
00:45:58,410 --> 00:45:59,280
You...

830
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,310
What are you doing?

831
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,230
Everything must be done in order.

832
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,270
She was betrothed to me first,

833
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,520
so your betrothal no longer counts.

834
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,150
Mr. He, you should leave.

835
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,670
Mr. Zhuang, what is going on?

836
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,920
Is this marriage agreement real?

837
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:16,590
Mr. He,

838
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:18,330
it is true that we once had

839
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,960
a marriage agreement, but...

840
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,920
You're not married,

841
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,300
so the woman has the right to annul it.

842
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,430
Miss Zhuang,

843
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,840
if you annul Mr. Fu's betrothal,

844
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,750
then mine will be valid.

845
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:50,070
Miss Zhuang,

846
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,670
though I'm not a noble,

847
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,430
my family is honorable,
and I've worked hard to better myself.

848
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:55,960
That day at the guild hall,

849
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,630
your brilliance shined

850
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,440
like a pearl of wisdom.

851
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:03,560
I have developed feelings
for you since then.

852
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,000
I believe that with your intelligence,

853
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,190
you can tell who is the better husband.

854
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,510
If you are willing to marry me,

855
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:13,000
I swear to the heavens

856
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,380
that I will become the top scholar
in the Spring Exam,

857
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:17,360
and I will cherish you like a goddess,

858
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,370
revere you,
and love you as my very life.

859
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,270
A goddess belongs only in the heavens.

860
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,040
I'm but an ordinary woman.

861
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,710
I fear I am unworthy of such devotion.

862
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,310
Mr. He, do not be upset.

863
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,440
Let us...

864
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,360
There's no need.

865
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:41,060
Though I come from a humble family,

866
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,030
I will not allow myself
to be toyed with in this manner.

867
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,960
Since Miss Zhuang has made a choice,

868
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,270
then I shall take my leave.

869
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:54,630
Mr. He...

870
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:55,560
Mr. He, wait.

871
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:57,880
Please hear my explanation.

872
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,800
Mr. He...

873
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,470
Mr. He.

874
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,030
Miss Hanyan, since that is the case,

875
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:04,310
I will take my leave as well.

876
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,150
Fu Yunxi.

877
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,070
Fu Yunxi.

878
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,000
You owe me an explanation.

879
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,710
Why have you done

880
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:22,960
all of this?

881
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,280
Zhuang Hanyan,

882
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,630
the one I have been planning

883
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:32,710
for all along is you.

884
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,310
Planning?

885
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,150
I have long known

886
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:40,400
that being a dutiful wife and mother
is not what you truly desire.

887
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,960
On the night of the Lantern Festival,
from the high pavilion,

888
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,590
you once confided in me.

889
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:47,230
Since you do not long for romantic love,

890
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,840
believe that emotions are fickle,

891
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,920
and see marriage as only a deal

892
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,110
to secure wealth, power, and status,

893
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:00,170
and to ensure that you are never bullied

894
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,460
or cast into the suffering
from wandering,

895
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,000
then I'll offer you a deal today.

896
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,800
What deal?

897
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,480
I can give you

898
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,080
everything you want.

899
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,200
How?

900
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,920
You become my wife,

901
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,150
and I will be your strategist.

902
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,190
Within one year,

903
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,190
I will make you the noblest lady
in the Capital.

904
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:23,630
What do you think?

905
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,920
Why did you

906
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:35,880
choose me?
