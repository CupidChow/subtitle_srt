=The Glory=

00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,140
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,960
(Mushrooms)

4
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,770
(Since childhood,)

5
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,800
(I've heard rumors)

6
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,050
(that my mother was a noble lady
of the Capital.)

7
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,710
(At that time, I was too young,)

8
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,680
(and noble ladies were beyond my reach.)

9
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,120
(I thought)

10
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,560
(that if I could be
well-versed in literature)

11
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,710
(like the refined ladies)

12
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,760
(in storybooks,)

13
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,500
(I could be considered a noble lady.)

14
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,630
(So, I gathered all kinds of books)

15
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,710
(from my uncle's study.)

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,520
(I believed)

17
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,630
(that noble ladies
had exquisite hairpins.)

18
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,120
(So for many years,)

19
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,560
(I dreamed)

20
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,630
(of owning one of my own.)

21
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,590
(Only then)

22
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,780
(would my mother see me as her kind)

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,960
(and love me)

24
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,560
(when I met her.)

25
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,920
(But...)

26
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:31,020
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

27
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,870
Master, hurry.

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,400
Ms. Zhou won't be able to protect
Miss Hanyan any longer.

29
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,500
(Zhuang Shiyang,
Head of the Zhuang family)

30
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,030
I just had a few drinks
at Vice Mr. Han's place.

31
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,360
How did things escalate like this?

32
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,480
Master, you're finally back.

33
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,960
Where is Ruyin? Where is Hanyan?

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,030
Where are they?

35
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,990
The madam...

36
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,440
Hurry.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,320
Wait.

38
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,110
This is...

39
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,320
This is Hanyan.

40
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,440
Miss Hanyan angered the madam,

41
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,190
so she ordered us to expel her.

42
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,110
Nonsense.

43
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,710
Let her go immediately.

44
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,440
What's going on?

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,110
How could she beat you like this?

46
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,600
Hanyan. I am your father.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,110
You have suffered.

48
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,440
Father.

49
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,710
Greetings, Father.

50
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,000
Come on.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,390
Take her inside.

52
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,440
Don't you dare.

53
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,710
Xiwen, Hanyan has wandered
outside for years

54
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,120
and has finally returned home.

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,360
Our family is finally reunited.

56
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,640
Why must you do this?

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,790
You've served at the Hanlin Academy
for years.

58
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,480
You may not be knowledgeable enough,

59
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,640
but everyone knows you have
a prodigious memory.

60
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,040
What?

61
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,920
Has your memory failed you today?

62
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,670
What do you mean by that?

63
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,200
What have I forgotten?

64
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,510
You've forgotten

65
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,710
that she is not our daughter.

66
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,200
She is a barefoot ghost.

67
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,040
Her grandfather, uncle,
and aunt died because of her.

68
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,880
Within one day of her return,

69
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,440
she ruined your son's engagement

70
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,760
and even attracted an assassin.

71
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,880
What Taoist Duan said was true.

72
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,880
Her fate clashes with our family.

73
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,880
If she stays,

74
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,270
our family will never know peace.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,870
That happened

76
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,890
a long time ago.

77
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,040
You can't take it seriously.

78
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,310
Let's not bring it up again.

79
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,230
Is that so?

80
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,470
Then why did Mr. Han insist
on canceling the betrothal?

81
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,150
You spent half the night at their place,

82
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,150
yet they didn't budge, right?

83
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,240
Master...

84
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,870
Father, you're finally back.

85
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,330
The madam beat me and my mother...

86
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,200
Master, don't be angry.

87
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,270
Yushan and I

88
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,360
violated the family rules

89
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,390
and deserved punishment.

90
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,390
The madam was not at fault in any way.

91
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,350
Xiwen, you...

92
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,680
If you feel sorry for them,

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
send me to the ancestral hall

94
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,470
and bring in the family penalty.

95
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,560
Why make such a spectacle of this?

96
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,760
What are you two waiting for?

97
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,440
Drag her out.

98
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,590
Drag her out!

99
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,000
Stop this.

100
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,430
Xiwen,

101
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,950
Hanyan is our daughter.

102
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,320
She's been outside for years.

103
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,710
Every year, I wanted to bring her back,

104
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,000
but you always stopped me.

105
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,680
Now that she is finally home,

106
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,470
how can we drive her out again?

107
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,680
I am the head of the family.

108
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,240
For my sake,

109
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,800
don't make things hard for her.

110
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,840
Okay?

111
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,350
Did you hear that?

112
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,120
Your father is right.

113
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,200
For all these years,

114
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,160
your suffering in Danzhou

115
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,480
was all because of me.

116
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,320
Do you now hate me to the core?

117
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,240
I wouldn't dare.

118
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,470
I was not miserable in Danzhou;

119
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,470
nor do I hold the slightest resentment.

120
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,680
I came to the Capital

121
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,080
only because I missed you.

122
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,710
Miss me?

123
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,680
Though I'm your mother,

124
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,910
you've never met me.

125
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,680
Why would you miss me?

126
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,910
Though I was far away in Danzhou,

127
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,880
I always heard

128
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,640
that my mother was
a noble lady of the Capital,

129
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,640
gentle and virtuous,

130
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,270
graceful and accomplished,

131
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,270
beautiful and knowledgeable.

132
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,320
I only wished that one day
I could reunite with you

133
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,470
and receive your protection.

134
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,000
A noble lady of the Capital?

135
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,640
Well said.

136
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,560
Even with an Imperial Token,

137
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,510
all my maiden family was beheaded

138
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,320
and lost.

139
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,900
You seek my protection,

140
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,420
yet I cannot even protect myself.

141
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,020
If not for giving birth to you,

142
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,900
a barefoot ghost,

143
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,660
I wouldn't have been crippled.

144
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,620
You ruined me,

145
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,860
and now you're asking for my shelter?

146
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,100
Xiwen,

147
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,820
do not speak such harsh words

148
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,980
to hurt her.

149
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,740
Shut up!

150
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,340
The Zhuangs may look kind,

151
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,940
but you all are cruel beasts

152
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,540
and reapers in hell.

153
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,460
I ought to set this house ablaze.

154
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,940
When I descend into hell

155
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,540
and stand before the Yama King,

156
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,340
I shall see how the judges
of the underworld

157
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,020
render their verdict!

158
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,940
You...

159
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,460
Close the gate at once.

160
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,540
Don't!

161
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,700
Are you afraid?

162
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,300
Has a venomous mistress

163
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,740
shamed you?

164
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,500
It was you who insisted on marrying me.

165
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,380
Do you regret it now?

166
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,700
It's too late.

167
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,940
It's too late!

168
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,140
It's too late!

169
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,860
Madam,

170
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,300
please calm down.

171
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,820
Push me back to Jianjia Chamber.

172
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,500
These hypocrites

173
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,700
disgust me.

174
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,540
(All my life,)

175
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,620
(I have heard countless rumors.)

176
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,900
(My mother, Ruan Xiwen,)

177
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,540
(was said to be peerless)

178
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,260
(in beauty and grace)

179
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,620
(as the noblest lady in the Capital.)

180
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,940
(But the woman I saw tonight)

181
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,420
(is a resentful woman
trapped in her chamber,)

182
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,420
(bitter in temperament,)

183
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,540
(and ghastly in appearance.)

184
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,900
(All these years,)

185
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,780
(what has she experienced?)

186
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,780
Mr. Fu, what question do you

187
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,260
have to ask me now?

188
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,140
Miss Hanyan, why not sit?

189
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,500
Thank you for your concern.

190
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,540
I prefer to stand.

191
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,220
I came late at night

192
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,500
to ask about the murder case in Danzhou.

193
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,340
Yet, meddling

194
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,340
only caused me

195
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,460
to be disdained.

196
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,460
There's no gratitude at all.

197
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,800
You are a Vice Minister
of the Court Judicial Review.

198
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,140
Why take such interest

199
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,180
in a mere homicide
so far away in Danzhou?

200
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,940
We are family, after all.

201
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,900
So, I wish to capture the culprit

202
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,500
as soon as possible.

203
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,660
Miss Hanyan,

204
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,820
did you get the answer you wanted?

205
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,420
I don't know what you're saying.

206
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,460
Then why did you
provoke Zhuang Yuchi,

207
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,020
forcing him to speak recklessly,

208
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,300
to admit his intent to harm you?

209
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,740
You're kidding.

210
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,900
How could I dare?

211
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,180
Then allow me to say it for you.

212
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,860
You stirred such an uproar

213
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,940
because, upon your return,

214
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,740
everyone here

215
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,860
was a stranger to you.

216
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,780
You knew nothing

217
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,220
of their temperaments,

218
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,540
their relationships,

219
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,380
and their status within the family.

220
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,180
They all kept their distance from you,

221
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,140
so you were desperate

222
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,380
to uncover their true natures,

223
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,500
their attitudes toward you,

224
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,980
and who among them

225
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,420
was willing to accept you.

226
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,380
You want to be sheltered.

227
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,740
Am I right?

228
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,860
I grew up in the countryside,

229
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,980
ignorant and slow-witted.

230
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,660
I do not understand your words.

231
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,220
You lured

232
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,740
that assassin here, didn't you?

233
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,580
There are proprieties
between men and women.

234
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,860
Please behave yourself.

235
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,340
To me,

236
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,560
a criminal is a criminal,
regardless of gender.

237
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,260
If you continue to speak so boldly,

238
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,940
I shall call for help.

239
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,300
Shall I call out for you?

240
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,060
So everyone can come and see

241
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,060
how a weak woman like you

242
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,820
traveled from Danzhou to the Capital,

243
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,380
crossing a thousand miles of peril.

244
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,660
What I fail to understand

245
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,820
is why you returned.

246
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,820
I've lived in other's home.

247
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,860
This time, I returned

248
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,700
only to find my home.

249
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,540
This is a secret medicine
from the Court Judicial Review.

250
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,820
Take it.

251
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,260
Rest assured. It's not toxic.

252
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,380
Zhuang Hanyan,

253
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,900
this is the Capital.

254
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,740
I hope you won't regret it.

255
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,700
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

256
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
Father, please sit.

257
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,140
Did Yunxi trouble you just now?

258
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,860
No.

259
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,220
He's concerned
about Uncle and Aunt's case

260
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,580
and wishes to help us
find the killer asap.

261
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,180
Life and death are unpredictable.

262
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,580
Youchang and his wife were unlucky.

263
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,180
He and I were once dear friends,

264
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,300
studying night and day together.

265
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,020
In Danzhou,

266
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,500
we've been neighbors
for three generations

267
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,300
and formed this bond.

268
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,140
They raised you,

269
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,660
and we owe them a great debt.

270
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,820
Yet, such a disaster has struck.

271
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,220
I've sent people to Danzhou
to handle the funeral.

272
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,340
In the spring of next year,

273
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,900
we'll go back

274
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,780
and give them

275
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,780
a grand memorial.

276
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,620
Father, please don't be too sad.

277
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,740
Take care of your health.

278
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,580
Don't hold a grudge against your mother.

279
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,020
She cares about you,

280
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,860
but she's a bit impatient.

281
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,580
In the future, you'll get along.

282
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,420
Over time,

283
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,260
these difficulties will pass.

284
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,780
Father, don't worry.

285
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,580
I've never blamed Mother.

286
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,140
Hanyan,

287
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,740
you're a good child.

288
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,340
In the past, we did treat you fairly,

289
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,900
but now you've come back.

290
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,460
My position is humble,

291
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,140
but your grandfather

292
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,300
left some family wealth.

293
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,060
Don't worry.

294
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,980
I won't treat you unfairly.

295
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,540
Father, everything is up to you.

296
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,020
Alright.

297
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,300
It's getting late.

298
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,300
You should rest.

299
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,620
I won't disturb you anymore.

300
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,820
I'll go check on Ms. Zhou.

301
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,780
Don't move.

302
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,740
Don't move. Don't.

303
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,140
I'm leaving.

304
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,700
I'm leaving.

305
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,620
Yes.

306
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,020
Father, take care.

307
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,820
This is a secret medicine
from the Judicial Review.

308
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,100
Rest assured. It's not toxic.

309
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,020
I didn't hurt you just now, did I?

310
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,020
Does it hurt?

311
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,820
Since the fish hides deep in the water,

312
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,380
let's

313
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,060
stir the water.

314
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,300
Tonight, you'll be the assassin.

315
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,820
I don't believe

316
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,700
they won't show up.

317
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,940
(Chai Jing, the assassin in Danzhou)
Your mother is not kind.

318
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,340
But at least,

319
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,580
she is not someone who can be bullied.

320
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,620
I'll go kill her.

321
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,540
No.

322
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,940
She's my mother.

323
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,060
Be careful.

324
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,460
Remember:

325
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,420
This is the Capital.

326
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,540
It's different from our days in Danzhou,

327
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,380
and even more different

328
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,100
from your days at sea,
living on the edge.

329
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,300
There are countless eyes watching

330
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,100
every move we make.

331
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,660
There's also power you can't reach.

332
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,540
We must not act recklessly.

333
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,500
Yes.

334
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,460
I understand.

335
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,100
My mother

336
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,220
really surprised me,

337
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,540
- but tonight's events
- Here.

338
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,140
might have more to it.

339
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,700
There's plenty of time.

340
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,100
You should hide for now.

341
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,860
If in the future,

342
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,540
I need you to do something for me,

343
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,060
I will tell you my request.

344
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,340
My life is yours.

345
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,860
You can do anything you want.

346
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,460
Don't always say that.

347
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,740
I didn't save you

348
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,140
for anything in return.

349
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,660
That's why

350
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,500
I'm willing to be at your command.

351
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,620
After the long night,

352
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,300
despite some physical pain,

353
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,580
I've more or less figured out

354
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,540
the basic nature

355
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,620
of the Zhuangs.

356
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,220
Ms. Zhou has been with Father for years.

357
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,140
She is gentle and obedient,

358
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,580
holding up the reputation
of the Zhuang women,

359
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,420
so Father likes her more.

360
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,540
Zhuang Yushan and Zhuang Yuchi

361
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,780
are obedient in front of Father,

362
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,860
but it's hard to hide
their arrogant nature.

363
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,620
They're very shallow.

364
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,500
Grandmother is just an elder.

365
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,500
When it comes to important matters,

366
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,860
she has no say.

367
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,820
She's also not interested in trifles.

368
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,840
But my mother, Ruan Xiwen,

369
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,780
(Jianjia Chamber)

370
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,060
is the true power holder
in the household

371
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,300
and is feared by everyone.

372
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,700
It seems that everyone

373
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,860
is hiding many secrets.

374
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,100
A kind face doesn't always
belong to a Bodhisattva,

375
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,380
and a demon with a fearsome face

376
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,380
isn't always an evil spirit.

377
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,180
I'm afraid the road ahead

378
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,860
might be even harder.

379
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,900
In places you can't see,

380
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,100
I will always be with you.

381
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,540
Chai Jing,

382
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,700
you are the only one I can trust.

383
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,380
If you protect yourself,

384
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,580
you are also protecting me.

385
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,220
I understand.

386
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,860
But what truly worries me

387
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,180
is not in this household.

388
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,260
Where is it?

389
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,280
The Court of Judicial Review.

390
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,340
(Court of Judicial Review)

391
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,780
Sir, the night roads are dangerous.

392
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,460
Why not set off tomorrow morning?

393
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,180
Stop talking. Get on the horse.

394
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,620
Where exactly are we going?

395
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,900
Danzhou.

396
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,820
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

397
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,700
(Gongtong Main Room)

398
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,180
Miss Hanyan, we'll help you
get up and change.

399
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,860
Cong, here. Eat.

400
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,380
Yushan,

401
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,940
you should let them
make a scene last night.

402
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,340
I don't know why Mom and you joined in.

403
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,380
You both ended up getting a beating.

404
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,460
You fool.

405
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,380
You still don't know what Mom wants.

406
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,380
If it weren't for our commotion,

407
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,300
I'm afraid I'd still be

408
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,940
locked up in Jianjia Chamber today.

409
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,420
I see.

410
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,020
Yushan, you and Mom are truly scheming.

411
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,740
And you can never say nice things.

412
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,220
How is it?

413
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,020
I asked around.

414
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,580
They said Ms. Wei had invited everyone
to Yongshou Chamber.

415
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,220
I understand.

416
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,020
Miss Hanyan,

417
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,780
I'm afraid none of the masters
will come.

418
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,420
Why don't you eat first?

419
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,620
Sure.

420
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,380
Father, are you abandoning my future?

421
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,380
Do you have to protect
that barefoot ghost?

422
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,860
If you want to keep her,

423
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,980
then it means you want
to drive me away.

424
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,820
Yushan, shut up.

425
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,980
And you.

426
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,740
Mr. Fu will look

427
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,700
into the assassination.

428
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,540
Your father named you Yuchi,

429
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,700
hoping you'd think twice before acting.

430
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,500
Yet you speak without restraint.

431
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,420
Why don't you ever learn?

432
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,540
Then let Grandmother decide.

433
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,930
Who in our family can tolerate her?

434
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:47,820
Yes.

435
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,740
I'm just a woman
with limited experience.

436
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,780
How could I offer any sensible opinion?

437
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,220
Shiyang is the head of the family.

438
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,860
Shiyang, I'll listen to you.

439
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,440
I'm a Junior Compiler
at the Hanlin Academy.

440
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,060
Though my position is small,

441
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,220
I've served in the court for years.

442
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,540
All the noble families in the city
are watching us.

443
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,220
If I turn away my daughter who returned,

444
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,620
how will I live with dignity?

445
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,180
Moreover,

446
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,660
Hanyan is well-behaved

447
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,820
and has done no wrong.

448
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,940
Can't you just tolerate her?

449
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,540
Master, please don't rush.

450
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,540
Did Mr. Han relent last night?

451
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,620
Yes.

452
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,060
Before the 1st day of the 1st month,

453
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,940
we need to expel Hanyan,

454
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,430
so he'll agree to let his daughter

455
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,260
marry into our family.

456
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,420
Then expel her.

457
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,780
That's right.

458
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,300
I have no power or influence
in the court.

459
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,380
Han Wenzheng

460
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,020
looks down on our family's status.

461
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,700
He's seized this opportunity

462
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,100
and won't let go.

463
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,060
Why don't we just

464
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,100
forget it?

465
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,900
Father,

466
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,260
if Tan can't marry me,

467
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,220
I'll go up the mountain
to become a monk.

468
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,260
- What are you saying?
- You...

469
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,940
You're driving me crazy.

470
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,700
You are my only son

471
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,340
and the only hope

472
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,180
of your mom and me.

473
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,420
How can you say such nonsense?

474
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,820
Master,

475
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,220
I have a foolish idea.

476
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,180
I don't know if I should say it.

477
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,620
Say it.

478
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,700
People get married
at a marriageable age.

479
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,180
Miss Hanyan is an adult now.

480
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,660
She can get married.

481
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,580
Please stay.

482
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,180
I'm not finished.

483
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,980
Here's the thing. Listen.

484
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,140
Here's the thing.

485
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,740
This is what I think.

486
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,610
If the Zhous refused us,

487
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,820
we can consider the Suns.

488
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,460
We can always discuss it.

489
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,320
Madam,

490
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,420
I really can't help with this.

491
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,340
No, no, no.

492
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,860
You can charge as much as you want.

493
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,380
We are willing to pay a high price.

494
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,340
How about it?

495
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,340
This is the sixth matchmaker.

496
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,660
But she's escaped.

497
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,820
Please go and take another look.

498
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,180
Yes.

499
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,180
Still no news

500
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,440
about the Vice Minister Fu?

501
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,260
He left the city and hasn't returned.

502
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,820
Where do you think he went?

503
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,340
It looks like he's heading south.

504
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,860
Danzhou.

505
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,060
I was worried about you,

506
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,780
so I didn't follow too far.

507
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,660
The Zhuang family

508
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,620
is arranging a marriage for you?

509
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,460
The name "barefoot ghost"

510
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,800
has spread throughout the Capital.

511
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,730
Matchmakers don't want
to take on this cursed job.

512
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,780
Which respectable family would want me?

513
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,200
Do you want to get married?

514
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,420
Of course not.

515
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,380
But now that I've returned
to the Capital,

516
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,220
I can't keep being so controlled.

517
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,340
I can't carry the stigma

518
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,860
of the barefoot ghost anymore.

519
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,860
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

520
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,380
(Two days later)

521
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,340
Mr. Zheng kept saying

522
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,220
he wanted to eat ginger duck.

523
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,820
It must be made
with ginger from Yinan

524
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,380
for the proper taste.

525
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,380
Here.

526
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,660
There's also

527
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,860
the Mati pastry that Mr. Deng
has been thinking about.

528
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,260
There's also

529
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,900
the bamboo shoot jelly.

530
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,260
By the way, Ruyin,

531
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,420
later, you go to the cellar

532
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,780
and bring out some
of my Yongchun vinegar.

533
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,900
I'm also craving it.

534
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,980
Sure.

535
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,460
At the end of every year,

536
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,060
they always trouble you

537
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,820
to prepare this Yinan Banquet.

538
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,620
We're from Yinan

539
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,020
and colleagues in the Capital.

540
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,700
Since they appreciate my cooking,

541
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,620
how could I refuse to do it?

542
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,400
It's about maintaining relationships.

543
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,060
It's good that our house is lively.

544
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,660
This time,
we've finally invited Mr. Han,

545
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,540
and we can discuss Yuchi's marriage.

546
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,220
What about Hanyan's marriage?

547
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,700
Sorry for my incompetence.

548
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,940
This is truly difficult.

549
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,020
It's not your fault.

550
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,780
When Taoist Duan spoke
of the barefoot ghost,

551
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,740
I thought it was just a coincidence.

552
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,940
Our children

553
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,220
couldn't have done anything evil.

554
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,940
Oh, no. Something's wrong.

555
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,020
Something's wrong.

556
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,940
Master, Ms. Wei...

557
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,620
She's seen a ghost.

558
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,620
Don't come here.

559
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,140
Don't come near me.

560
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,460
Don't come here.

561
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,940
Mother.

562
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,020
Master, Ms. Wei just fell asleep.

563
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,580
What's going on?

564
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,540
She fell ill early this morning

565
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,540
with a high fever
and incoherent muttering.

566
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,620
She said...

567
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,060
She said...

568
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,020
What did she say?

569
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,420
She said that a ghost came at night,

570
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,540
with a green face and fangs,

571
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,780
and was barefoot.

572
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,140
She said it wanted to take her life.

573
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,500
Master, based on those symptoms,

574
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,900
will she follow in the footsteps
of the late master?

575
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,820
I've worked for years in the house.

576
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,740
These young maids don't know

577
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,140
the situation back then,

578
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,420
but I remember it clearly.

579
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,460
Master, tomorrow is the Yinan Banquet.

580
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,620
Should we postpone it?

581
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,300
The invitations have been sent out.

582
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,220
How can we postpone it?

583
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,180
Tonight, we'll stay here.

584
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,020
Invite more physicians to take a look.

585
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,180
Tomorrow, guard Yongshou Chamber.

586
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,300
Don't let Mother be disturbed.

587
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,100
We'll hold the banquet
in the front yard,

588
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,820
and it'll end in the afternoon.

589
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

590
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,420
I understand.

591
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,300
The whole mansion is in chaos,

592
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,300
saying that Ms. Wei's disease

593
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,820
is exactly like the late master's,

594
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,180
and it's all because of you.

595
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,340
Have any Taoists

596
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,220
visited recently?

597
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,780
Taoists?

598
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,260
I don't think so.

599
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,140
(Is it the same old trick?)

600
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,500
Greetings, Yushan.

601
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,460
Why is the charcoal fire
in your room so smokey?

602
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,260
It must be the maids' fault.

603
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,380
Go open the window
and let some fresh air in.

604
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,420
Also, bring some good Yingu charcoal
to Miss Hanyan.

605
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,340
(Masterful and Confident)

606
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,420
This blanket is too thin.

607
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,420
Miss Hanyan grew up in the south.

608
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,740
She can't endure the winter
in the Capital.

609
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,740
Go get some thicker blankets.

610
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,620
Yushan,

611
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,620
I've only been in the mansion
for a few days.

612
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,140
I don't think I've offended you.

613
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,020
Hanyan, what are you saying?

614
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,580
Father and Mom are staying
at Yongshou Chamber.

615
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,740
They can't leave.

616
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,140
So, as your elder sister,

617
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,460
I'm here to take care
of your daily needs.

618
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,180
Why aren't you grateful?

619
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,700
I wouldn't dare.

620
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,660
Thank you, Yushan.

621
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,460
I'm glad you appreciate it.

622
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,340
Let's go.

623
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,020
Miss Hanyan.

624
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,220
I'm afraid the blankets and charcoal

625
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,420
won't be sent here.

626
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,820
Go close the window.

627
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,140
Yes.

628
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,940
Yushan.

629
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,860
How clever of you.

630
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,000
I don't think she'll survive the night.

631
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,100
You need to learn to be more careful.

632
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,700
Don't act so violently.

633
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,020
You might get slandered over it.

634
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,700
Father and Mom are unwilling
to stand up for me.

635
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,300
Now, only you and I
are on the same side.

636
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,500
Yushan,

637
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,900
do you think my marriage

638
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,260
with Tan is hopeless?

639
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,140
Don't worry.

640
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,700
Tomorrow, Father will host a banquet.

641
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,220
When you see Uncle Han,

642
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,380
be respectful and serve him tea.

643
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,500
Don't act stubborn like a mule.

644
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,700
I'll help you plan the rest.

645
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,900
You really care for me.

646
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,300
Once Father gives me the yasui qian,

647
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,960
I'll go to the saddle shop

648
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,260
and buy the gilded cypress saddle

649
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,020
you liked last time.

650
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,660
It will look very heroic with Cong.

651
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,740
Really?

652
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,980
You know how to cheer me up.

653
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,260
Once I marry Tan,

654
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,020
Uncle Han will help me
become an official.

655
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,900
When I'm the head of the family,

656
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,340
I'll make sure no one bullies you.

657
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,220
Enough.

658
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,060
Just please your future
father-in-law tomorrow.

659
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,660
What are you doing here?

660
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,900
Isn't here chaotic enough?

661
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,440
I came to see the master.

662
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,140
What a joke.

663
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,980
Ms. Wei is seriously ill,

664
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,460
and the master is fulfilling his duties.

665
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,420
What trouble do you have

666
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,780
to come here to bother them?

667
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,700
Please help me notify him.

668
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,340
It's about Miss Hanyan.

669
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,500
Go, go, go.

670
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,220
If you upset the master,

671
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,500
you'll be punished.

672
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,780
Go.

673
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,020
How is it?

674
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,740
Lang is guarding the entrance
of Yongshou Chamber

675
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,940
to avoid us.

676
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,700
Not a single word can get through.

677
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,780
My dear sister is really meticulous

678
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,620
in everything she does.

679
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,300
Miss, maybe you should go
to another chamber.

680
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,140
No need.

681
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,660
With this cloak on, I can keep warm.

682
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,900
Miss...

683
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,220
You should go back.

684
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,620
I need to rest now.

685
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,940
Yes.

686
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,140
What is this?

687
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,920
Have you found out

688
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,060
what really happened?

689
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,980
Yes.

690
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,740
The barefoot ghost incident

691
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,260
was caused by a man
who claimed to be Taoist Duan.

692
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,500
He's come to the Capital, right?

693
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,220
Yes.

694
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,440
He entered the city yesterday.

695
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,440
Grandmother's illness
is indeed suspicious.

696
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,220
It seems

697
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,300
that someone
doesn't want me to stay here,

698
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,820
and they plan to reenact
the barefoot ghost incident

699
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,580
from 17 years ago.

700
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,500
If that's the case,

701
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,340
you should make other plans.

702
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,860
There isn't much time left.

703
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,860
I'm afraid tomorrow,

704
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,060
Taoist Duan will come to the door.

705
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,740
Now,

706
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,420
what's your chance of success?

707
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,540
The enemy is hidden.

708
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,340
Besides, I don't know

709
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,460
what kind of trap

710
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,540
the culprit has set.

711
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,980
But with this tonight,

712
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,580
perhaps

713
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,140
we can cut the root of the problem.

714
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,020
(Arms tattooed with thieves' marks)

715
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,900
(I'm still very young,)

716
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,500
(but the words "barefoot ghost")

717
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,380
(have always hung over me,)

718
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,060
(like an inescapable shadow.)

719
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,580
(The moment I learned
that Grandmother was ill,)

720
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,780
(I already guessed)

721
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,140
(it would happen today.)

722
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,980
(Deng Shoujie)

723
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,820
(Zheng Shichang)

724
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,060
(Han Wenzheng)

725
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,340
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)
(The Spiritual Bell)

726
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,380
(is like the Monkey King's circlet.)

727
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,380
(I already knew)

728
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,100
(this day would come.)

729
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,740
(Though I wasn't prepared,)

730
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,580
(the villains)

731
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,740
(must confess their crimes this time,)

732
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,540
(and the truth will come to light.)

733
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,040
(As the lineal daughter of the family,)

734
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,980
(Taoist Duan)
(I must establish myself here.)

735
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,380
(I must)

736
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,020
(first rid myself
of the 17-year-old stigma.)
