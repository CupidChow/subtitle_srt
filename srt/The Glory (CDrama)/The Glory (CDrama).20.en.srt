3
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,180
(Light, Fu Residence)

4
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,790
First bow to Heaven and Earth.

5
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,350
A perfect match is made.

6
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,280
Second bow to the elders.

7
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,280
May love last eternally.

8
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,870
Spousal bow to each other.

9
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,680
Health and happiness abound.

10
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,870
(If only I had grown up with the Zhuangs,)

11
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,000
(perhaps, Yuchi and I)

12
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,430
(would be as close as)

13
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,240
(him and Yushan once were.)

14
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,750
(Things wouldn't)

15
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,430
(have come to this.)

16
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,750
Aunt Hanyan, it's really you.

17
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,750
Lingzhi.

18
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,400
Aunt Hanyan.

19
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,030
You married my father, didn't you?

20
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,710
Does that mean I have a mother now?

21
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,030
I'm just afraid

22
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,430
that I won't be a good mother.

23
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,420
Ever since I could remember,

24
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,630
other mothers cherished their daughters.

25
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,840
But my mother

26
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,120
was just a wooden memorial tablet.

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,190
I called her a hundred times,

28
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,120
a thousand times, ten thousand times,

29
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,080
but she never responded to me.

30
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,080
Aunt Hanyan,

31
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,700
you don't want to be my mother, either?

32
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,400
Lingzhi.

33
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,030
Father.

34
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,070
Alright, stop crying, okay?

35
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,830
Aunt Hanyan does care for you.

36
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,630
It's just that we just got married.

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,120
You need to be patient

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,190
and give her some time, alright?

39
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,950
Okay.

40
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,270
Alright, stop crying now.

41
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,390
It's getting late.

42
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,630
You should go to bed.

43
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,070
I never meant to upset her.

44
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,480
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,070
It's alright. Take your time.

46
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,950
After what happened today,

47
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,490
we all need time to recover.

48
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,070
I believe everything you just said.

49
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,360
Zhuang Yuchi's death

50
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,560
was not your fault.

51
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,950
Another disaster has struck.

52
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,000
Zhou Ruyin

53
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,830
will never believe me.

54
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,120
Did you send a letter to Chai Jing today?

55
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,480
I only told her

56
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,430
I plan to stay here.

57
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,240
All the recent matters,

58
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,600
I've kept hidden from her.

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,600
I don't want her to worry.

60
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,000
This was given to me by a servant earlier.

61
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,950
From his words,

62
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,040
it should be Chai Jing's reply to you.

63
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
Hanyan,

64
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,860
I hope this letter finds you well.

65
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,560
It has been over three years

66
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,090
since we met in Danzhou.

67
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,160
I have often imagined,

68
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,350
perhaps one day,

69
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,330
(Chai Jing)
we could set sail together,

70
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,390
leaving the world behind,
living side by side.

71
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,240
But lately, I keep wondering

72
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,720
should I leave instead.

73
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,190
With this broken body of mine,

74
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,750
I can no longer protect you.

75
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,600
I don't want to be your burden.

76
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,200
Yet,

77
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,630
(Light, Fu Residence)
I couldn't make the decision.

78
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,950
Now, you have someone

79
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,800
who can protect you in my stead.

80
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,390
I can finally be at peace.

81
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,190
In the past,

82
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,190
and in the future,

83
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,000
you will never be alone.

84
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,830
Whether you need me or not,

85
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,560
I will take your secrets with me

86
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,830
and return to the sea.

87
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,920
For that is where I truly belong.

88
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,680
Drifting is my fate.

89
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,680
Would you ever leave me in this life?

90
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,370
Never.

91
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,630
And if one day,

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,360
I find my own home?

93
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,680
Then I…

94
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,040
will cling to you forever.

95
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,720
I often think,

96
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,120
the world is full of dangers and hardships.

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,190
When I grow up,

98
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,720
I want to become someone

99
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,600
who can protect myself.

100
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,630
Even if one day you cannot defend yourself,

101
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,920
don't be afraid.

102
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,950
Because I'll be there for you.

103
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,680
Chai Jing.

It's beautiful.

116
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,120
Even prettier than fireworks.

117
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,960
You've never seen breathtaking fireworks.

118
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,280
Have you?

119
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,720
I saw them while at sea.

120
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,790
Fireworks at sea?

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,080
I suppose

122
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,080
they must be more dazzling.

123
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,320
In the future,

124
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,480
if you marry and settle down,

125
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,080
I promise you

126
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,790
a sky full of radiant fireworks to celebrate.

127
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,550
Marriage?

128
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,270
I've never thought about it.

129
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,870
Partings are inevitable.

130
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,750
But after today, I don't know

131
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,320
if we will ever meet again in this life.

132
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,440
May you live without worries,

133
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,670
without fear,

134
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,270
and find peace and joy all your life.

135
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,240
Don't dwell.

136
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,960
It's chilly. Keep warm.

137
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,630
(Partings are inevitable.)

138
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,750
(Chai Jing,)

139
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,390
(you must look after yourself.)

140
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,390
(I hope we will meet again someday.)

141

(Seclusion, Memorial)

142
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,710
Ms. Zhou.

143
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,470
Ms. Zhou.

144
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,120
The funeral hall is ready.

145
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,150
Please go and take a look.

146
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,600
Yuchi is not dead.

147
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,960
Yuchi is not dead.

148
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Yuchi is not dead.

149
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,320
He is not dead.

150
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,030
- Ms. Zhou.
- He is not dead.

151
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,750
It's better to send Yuchi off early.

152
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,910
Don't miss the timing.

153
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,320
No.

154
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,960
Yuchi.

155
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,120
My Yuchi.

156
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,670
Heavens cold, the distance lies.
Windswept with mournful cries.

157
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,360
Do not fear, my son.

158
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,480
Mother has come to guide you.

159
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,630
Do not fear, my son.

160
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,040
Yuchi.

161
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,910
I failed to protect you.

162
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,780
(Beloved son, Zhuang Yuchi)

163
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,870
In the next life,
let us be father and son again.

164
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,260
(Spirit Tablet of Beloved Son, Zhuang Yuchi)

165
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,840
Zhuang Shiyang,

166
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,440
the son I raised for over ten years

167
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,150
died for no reason.

168
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,870
How will you make this up to me?

169
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,150
Yuchi was my only son.

170
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,440
Before I could savor a day of his comfort,

171
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,270
he passed away.

172
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,670
I raised him.

173
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,600
Who will make this up to me?

174
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,030
It wasn't you who raised him,

175
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,200
I raised him with my own hands.

176
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,440
It was me.

177
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,160
And also,

178
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,390
also my Yushan.

179
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,960
I worked hard to raise them both.

180
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,600
And now, my son is gone.

181
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,960
My daughter has ended up like this.

182
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,540
If you won't take responsibility,

183
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,000
who else will?

184
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,960
Let go of me!

185
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,150
Everyone here

186
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,120
knows what you're after.

187
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,870
Stop using me as your excuse.

188
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,150
Ruyin,

189
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,630
you've always been gentle and proper.

190
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,440
Don't make a scene.

191
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,360
Don't disturb Yuchi's spirit.

192
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Gentle and proper?

193
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,670
I've wasted half my life with the Zhuangs.

194
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,960
Always enduring, lowering myself.

195
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,120
But what was the result?

196
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,000
My son is gone.

197
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
And now,

198
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,030
even my daughter has turned against me.

199
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,270
Do you think I don't feel the pain?

200
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,270
Do you think my heart doesn't ache?

201
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,080
You take a viper as your father
and shelter among schemers.

202
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,550
Living in fear your crimes will be exposed,

203
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,320
naturally, it's unbearable suffering.

204
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,960
Master,

205
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,390
do you truly believe

206
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,480
I know nothing of your deeds?

207
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,510
Your grief has clouded your mind.

208
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,630
Please stop speaking nonsense.

209
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,510
Nonsense?

210
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,200
I clearly remember,

211
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,960
after Pei Dafu of Zuohang Gang died,

212
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:41,270
you often rambled in dreams.

213
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,910
Master,

214
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,150
if you want to kill me,

215
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,670
it'd be as easy as turning your hand.

216
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,670
But I am just a woman,

217
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,120
living under your roof.

218
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,270
If your crimes are ever exposed

219
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,320
and you die,

220
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,270
well,

221
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,870
how would I survive?

222
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,910
So, even if

223
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,510
there are thousands who wish to kill you,

224
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,960
I'd never be one of them.

225
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,910
I am willing to bury everything

226
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,750
deep inside me forever.

227
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,000
From this day forward,

228
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,240
you and I shall be allies.

229
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,990
Master,

230
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,320
will you trust me?

231
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,020
(Spirit Tablet of Beloved Son, Zhuang Yuchi)

232
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,720
Say no more.

233
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,680
I know what you want.

234
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,740
(Memorial)

235
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,680
Greetings, Madam.

236
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,170
Alright. Go about your tasks.

237
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,030
Yes, ma'am.

238
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,960
Yushan, come over here.

239
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,920
Come here, Miss Yushan.

240
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,270
Everyone, stay sharp and efficient.

241
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,880
Yushan, from this day forward,

242
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,270
you are the lineal daughter of the Zhuangs.

243
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,960
Go and change into something beautiful.

244
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,960
No one in this household

245
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,110
will dare to belittle us.

246
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,440
Beautiful clothes?

247
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,110
Mom, you're in high spirits.

248
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,510
It seems my brother's death wasn't in vain.

249
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,350
At least it helped you
fulfill your long-held wish.

250
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,920
You finally claim the position of Madam.

251
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,110
Yushan,

252
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,480
wasn't I doing all this for you, too?

253
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,240
From now on, you're no longer non-lineal.

254
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,830
And I am no longer just a concubine.

255
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,640
You can now

256
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
call me Mother rightfully.

257
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,790
Lineal or non-lineal, does it matter?

258
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,750
Since childhood,

259
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,270
if not for your constant manipulations,

260
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,890
I wouldn't have cared
about such things at all.

261
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,480
You're the one

262
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,920
who cares about these things all along.

263
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,240
Yuchi's death was caused by me

264
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,350
and by you as well.

265
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,480
You hit me rightly so, Mom.

266
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,550
I deserve it.

267
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,920
I told you

268
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,590
to stop calling me that!

269
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,400
Remember this well.

270
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,720
Yuchi

271
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,960
was not killed by you or me.

272
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,030
The one who caused his death

273
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,270
was Zhuang Hanyan.

274
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,560
Now,

275
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,680
she's married into the Fu family,

276
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,750
gaining Fu Yunxi's support.

277
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,920
She will only grow stronger.

278
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,560
But as of now,

279
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,270
I am the Madam of the Zhuangs,

280
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,790
and you are the lineal daughter.

281
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,400
We are esteemed.

282
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,610
If you marry into a noble family,

283
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,550
those two will no longer be a threat to us.

284
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,510
Mother, whom do you want me to marry?

285
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,590
The Capital is filled

286
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,790
with nobles and royals.

287
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,440
With your beauty,

288
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,510
it won't be hard to find a good husband.

289
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,960
Why must I marry into nobility?

290
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,680
You were raised under my teachings,

291
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,590
how can you even ask such a question?

292
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,590
I've told you many times before,

293
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,070
we women are like rootless duckweed.

294
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,590
Our foundation in life

295
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,270
rests solely on our father and husband.

296
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,720
Your father holds a humble position,

297
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,920
with no power or influence.

298
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,880
Your future

299
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,200
depends on your husband.

300
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,030
So, now that my brother is gone,

301
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,880
Mother is pinning all your hopes

302
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,480
on me instead?

303
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,840
Yushan,

304
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,790
do you want to be trampled

305
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,440
under Zhuang Hanyan's feet forever?

306
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,160
I don't.

307
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,440
But I also don't want my life

308
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,030
to be your tool for power struggles.

309
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,200
You've achieved your dreams.

310
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,720
In the future,

311
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,200
just enjoy being Madam of the house.

312
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,340
(Light, Fu Residence)

313
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,220
(Happiness)

314
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,660
The medicine for the cold.

315
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,160
It will make you feel better.

316
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,000
No need.

317
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,070
Since we're married,

318
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,960
we should act like a couple.

319
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,270
With Mother and Aunt,

320
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,030
please handle them with care.

321
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,510
Try not to let them notice anything.

322
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,680
Otherwise, it will cause trouble later.

323
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,720
I will handle what's within my duty.

324
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,510
But there's one more thing.

325
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,000
I need your help with it.

326
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,520
What is it?

327
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,540
The night before Mother and I
left the Capital,

328
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,880
I had a meeting with Yuwen Chang'an.

329
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,670
Hanyan.

330
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,350
Mr. Yuwen.

331
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,880
Did your mother send you?

332
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,240
My mother obtained the divorce letter.

333
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,000
She plans to leave the Capital

334
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,000
tomorrow morning.

335
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,830
Xiwen has finally agreed?

336
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,720
Yes.

337
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,040
Good.

338
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,790
That's truly wonderful news.

339
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,100
Hanyan,

340
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,000
I should thank you for it.

341
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,070
I did all this

342
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,400
so my mother could escape her suffering

343
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,400
and fulfill her lifelong wish.

344
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,350
Although you didn't grow up beside Xiwen,

345
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,160
you truly are a wonderful daughter.

346
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Let's set out at dawn tomorrow.

347
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,350
Now that we're free,

348
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,750
we should depart early in the morning.

349
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,590
It's a pity

350
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,200
that we failed to bring Zhuang to justice.

351
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,920
Years of effort

352
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,920
all wasted in vain.

353
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,400
Have you done anything else?

354
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,100
Actually, over these years,

355
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,550
I was never idle.

356
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,200
Faced with Zhuang Shiyang's crimes,

357
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,550
I've been gathering evidence,

358
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,720
hoping to have him arrested.

359
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,480
Did you find any clues?

360
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,000
I did find some.

361
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,590
But I hit a wall at key points.

362
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,480
I've compiled the evidence I found.

363
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,480
It's stored in a sandalwood box

364
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,000
at the Department of Supervision.

365
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,440
Actually,

366
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,030
I've long made up my mind.

367
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,110
If Xiwen refused to leave the Capital,

368
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,720
I'd spend my life

369
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,590
fighting with Zhuang Shiyang.

370
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,270
I'd break through every obstacle,

371
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,090
uncover the evidence,

372
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,110
and see him convicted and imprisoned.

373
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,110
Now Xiwen has let go,

374
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,310
why should I hold on?

375
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,240
We should leave the Capital,

376
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,110
find a serene place to live out our days

377
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,440
away from all this treachery.

378
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,960
The evidence is still
at the Department of Supervision?

379
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,920
The day I reached Shili Stop,

380
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,480
Mr. Yuwen had already passed away.

381
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,680
If we can find the evidence he's gathered

382
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,440
over the past decade,

383
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,680
it would surely aid our cause.

384
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,310
But for this matter,

385
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,880
I'll need your help to investigate.

386
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,960
What? You can't do it?

387
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,790
Though I've regained my position,

388
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,920
entering the Department of Supervision

389
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,530
for a search is no simple task.

390
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,070
If it were easy,

391
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,200
why would I need you?

392
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,000
I'll give it my best shot.

393
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,070
Take your medicine.

394
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,510
Is Hanyan's cold getting better?

395
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,860
Mrs. Fu has rested for days

396
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,790
and is much better.

397
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,440
She even said she'd come
to serve you tea today.

398
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,440
Cousin.

399
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,870
Cousin.

400
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,400
Something terrible has happened.

401
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,720
Why are you so flustered?

402
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,680
Someone just sent a gift.

403
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,880
I opened it, and…

404
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,030
And what?

405
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,910
It's...

406
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,520
Cousin.

407
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,680
Don't look.

408
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,680
Don't let it taint your eyes.

409
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,240
It's alright.

410
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,400
Cousin, are you alright?

411
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,160
Quick, bring some tea.

412
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,030
Have some tea.

413
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,110
What's going on here?

414
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,030
There's something

415
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,240
I've been wanting to say for a long time.

416
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,640
Everyone in the Capital knows

417
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,750
when Miss Hanyan was born,

418
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,720
a Taoist master called her a barefoot ghost.

419
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,200
- You know she...
- Enough.

420
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,870
Let's not speak of it.

421
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,880
The Fu family is a house of virtue.

422
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,480
We do not indulge

423
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,070
in such superstitions.

424
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,270
I didn't believe it at first either.

425
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,750
But think about it.

426
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,270
She's only been here a few days,

427
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,000
and they sent such a disgusting gift.

428
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,750
And the Taoist master…

429
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,070
Hanyan.

430
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,920
Greetings, Mother.

431
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,070
You're still recovering. No need for that.

432
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,240
I heard from the servants just now

433
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,400
that a gift has arrived.

434
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,080
Uh…

435
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,270
Hanyan, don't.

436
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,680
So disgusting.

437
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,030
Take it away.

438
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,280
Hurry up.

439
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,720
Miss Zhuang grew up in the countryside.

440
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,030
You're not fazed at all by this skinned

441
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,830
and gutted swan goose.

442
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,720
Why fear a dead swan goose?

443
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,480
I only know

444
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,240
a swan goose can be prepared in four ways.

445
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,830
Its heart, blood, skin, and meat

446
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,400
can each be made into a dish.

447
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,310
Since someone brought this rare treat

448
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,920
and even prepared it,

449
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,750
why let it go to waste?

450
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,720
Alright.

451
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,160
We'll do as you say.

452
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,270
Having such a fearless wife,

453
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,830
Yunxi is truly blessed.

454
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,270
This room

455
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,880
still carries a strong odor.

456
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,950
Qiuyue,

457
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,790
help Madam back to her room.

458
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,760
Cousin,

459
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,070
the smell here is strong.

460
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,240
Go have some rest for now.

461
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,310
Mrs. Fu,

462
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,270
you truly have courage.

463
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,310
Even if Lord Guan were here,

464
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,720
he wouldn't surpass you.

465
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,790
In the future, this household

466
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,720
will rely on you to manage.

467
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,160
Aunt, you flatter me.

468
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,960
I've heard Yunxi mention before,

469
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,610
when it comes to household management,

470
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,480
you're unmatched in the Capital.

471
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,830
I grew up in the countryside,

472
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,000
unrefined and ignorant.

473
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,790
I'm unfit for such responsibilities.

474
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,750
Though handling affairs may seem easy,

475
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,070
the household matters are quite complex.

476
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,400
As the young madam,

477
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,960
it's your duty to oversee them.

478
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,110
It's best to start learning soon.

479
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,550
Must you teach me?

480
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,920
What? You don't want to learn?

481
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,920
Since you offered guidance,

482
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,270
I wouldn't dare refuse.

483
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,790
I'll follow your every instruction.

484
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,110
Good.

485
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,400
(Happiness)

486
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,200
The rules I mentioned earlier,

487
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,680
did you remember them all?

488
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,870
Yes, I did.

489
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,680
Alright, let's practice them now.

490
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,550
Let's see if you truly remembered

491
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,680
or if you're just trying to fool me.

492
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,440
The wine rinse.

493
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,720
- Let go.
- Aunt, why hit me?

494
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,310
You just said earlier,

495
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,000
after Madam finishes her meal,
wine rinse is served.

496
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,440
She had put down the chopsticks,

497
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,820
but hadn't finished the soup yet.

498
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,000
You rushed her off the table.

499
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,310
Shouldn't you be punished?

500
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,260
Over such mistakes?

501
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,160
Did I marry into the depths of hell?

502
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,150
How dare you?

503
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,350
If Madam were here

504
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,550
and saw you behaving so,

505
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,800
she wouldn't tolerate it at all.

506
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,370
You'd have been kicked out already.

507
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,160
Aunt, don't judge others by yourself.

508
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,880
Mother is always generous and kind.

509
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,920
She wouldn't be so petty.

510
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,350
You think I'm petty?

511
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,960
Come with me to the accounting room.

512
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,000
Our household isn't large,

513
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,110
but there are still twenty to thirty people.

514
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,310
Just the monthly allowances alone

515
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,000
cost a fortune.

516
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,750
Add to that the daily purchases,

517
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,350
for food, drink, and supplies.

518
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,480
Everything is recorded in these ledgers.

519
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,720
It must be checked daily
and balanced monthly.

520
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
Not a single mistake is allowed.

521
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,120
Do you know how to use it?

522
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,110
I've learned a bit.

523
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,510
Don't underestimate these 91 beads.

524
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,480
They aren't just for household expenses.

525
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,400
Even the rise and fall of a nation

526
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,240
is within this frame.

527
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,910
Since you claim to know how to use it,

528
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,960
let me see your skill

529
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,200
with the abacus.

530
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
Starting with

531
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
the costs of your wedding banquet.

532
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,430
Let's begin.

533
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,720
The embroidery, brocade,
and plain silk from Suxingfang.

534
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
One piece of each, valued at eight taels.

535
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,720
The yellow robes and fabric
from Luo Cheng Shop.

536
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,510
A total of five bolts, valued at four taels.

537
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,680
Two cotton quilts from Songjiang
valued at three taels.

538
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,960
Two trays of lamb, wine, and fruits,
five taels and seven maces.

539
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,790
Twenty catties of top-grade pork,
three taels and four maces.

540
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,790
Ten catties of beef,
six taels and five maces.

541
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,880
Danyang yellow wine and Renhuai baijiu,

542
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,480
seven taels and two maces.

543
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,160
Pillows, two taels and four maces.

544
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,720
Glutinous rice, one tael and nine maces.

545
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,030
Love knots, nine maces.

546
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,680
A gold hairpin, two taels and eight maces.

547
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,350
A cuspidor, three maces.
Feathers, two taels and eight maces.

548
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,310
Candle stands, one tael and two maces.
Longan, two maces.

549
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,830
Lotus seeds, three maces.
Red dates, six maces.

550
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,530
Medallions, one tael.
Red silk, five maces.

551
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,840
What's that for?

552
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,070
I'm afraid you might bite your tongue,

553
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,910
reading too fast.

554
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,630
Again.

555
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,880
Scared already?

556
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,270
You're not teaching me management.

557
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,720
You're just afraid the new bride

558
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,720
may take your rights. Am I right?

559
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,750
Stop talking nonsense.

560
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:22,030
I've worked hard here for most of my life.

561
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,350
You've just arrived

562
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,240
and don't even know the household well.

563
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,960
Why would I be afraid of you?

564
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,550
You've spent most of your life here.

565
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,040
Yet, in the end, you're still an outsider.

566
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,390
You…

567
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,560
Stop right there!

568
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,310
Zhuang Hanyan, stop right there.

569
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,880
What did you mean?

570
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,000
Aunt, don't worry.

571
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,400
I have no interest

572
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,570
in managing.

573
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,430
Fine.

574
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,480
If you don't want to learn,

575
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,720
I'll have Yunxi take a concubine.

576
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,240
Someone will be willing to learn.

577
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,270
If there's another woman I can talk to,

578
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,550
I'd surely be delighted.

579
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,720
Really?

580
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,720
Really.

581
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,840
Alright.

582
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,000
I think

583
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,880
Madam's maid, Qiuyue, is quite suitable.

584
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,350
She's of age now

585
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,680
and looks presentable.

586
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,390
- I think she's…
- I disagree.

587
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,630
Yunxi,

588
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,680
if you don't like Qiuyue,

589
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,000
I'll find you someone else.

590
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,840
Aunt,

591
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
you've always been blunt,

592
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,960
but why are you being so tactless now?

593
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,960
I'm only thinking of you.

594
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,720
How can you speak to me like this?

595
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,400
Hanyan just arrived,

596
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,240
and you're arranging a concubine for me.

597
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,790
Do you have any respect for her?

598
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,830
She agreed herself earlier.

599
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,400
What does it have to do with me?

600
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,830
You two are quite something.

601
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,350
Now you're teaming up,

602
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,270
playing good cop and bad cop,

603
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,240
putting on a show, right?

604
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,200
Aunt, mark my words.

605
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,030
I will never take a concubine

606
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,270
or keep a chambermaid.

607
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,480
Only Hanyan is my wife.

608
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,160
From now on,

609
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,510
you are not to interfere

610
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,880
in our matters.

611
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,040
Yunxi,

612
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,790
I raised you since childhood,

613
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,400
now that you're married,

614
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,550
you won't let me intervene, right?

615
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,760
From now on, with Fu Family matters,

616
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,440
don't come to me anymore.

617
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,760
I'll pack up and return to the countryside.

618
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,320
Don't try to stop me.

619
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,150
I had no intention to argue with her,

620
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,670
but she just won't let it go.

621
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,280
Do you truly want me to take a concubine?

622
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,360
Our marriage was built on mutual benefit.

623
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,030
In this household,

624
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,670
I only play the role of a dutiful wife.

625
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:17,910
As for other matters,

626
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,670
I have neither the right

627
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,990
nor the intention to interfere.

628
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,960
Have you visited there?

629
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,280
I have.

630
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,000
It's heavily guarded there,

631
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,550
making every move difficult.

632
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,260
We can't search openly.

633
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,710
So far, there's no progress.

634
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,280
What about Mr. Yuwen's place?

635
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,960
Last night, with Mu Feng and Mu Yan,

636
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,400
we searched thoroughly.

637
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,150
But found no trace of the sandalwood box.

638
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,710
Given the situation,

639
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,190
we must proceed indirectly.

640
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,710
What do you have in mind?

641
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,960
The night my mother passed,

642
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,190
I realized one thing.

643
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,190
To become a noble lady in the Capital,

644
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,400
one must befriend high officials and dukes,

645
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,230
and scholars of great repute.

646
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,150
Do you know

647
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,510
who is the top noble lady

648
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,070
in the Capital now?

649
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,710
Noble Consort Miao?

650
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,990
Indeed.

651
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,880
If I can join her circle

652
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,150
and establish ties with her,

653
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,030
my influence in the Capital

654
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,480
would be immense.

655
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,880
Whether it's Zhuang Shiyang,

656
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,820
or the Department of Supervision,

657
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,280
everything will be within my grasp.

658
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,630
Don't burn yourself.

659
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,400
She was an old rival to your mother,

660
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,880
and yet you still wish to rise with her help?

661
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,550
What of old rivals?

662
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,400
In this world,

663
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,190
there are no eternal enemies.

664
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,000
With mutual interests,

665
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,880
enemies can become allies.

666
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,360
After the lantern banquet,

667
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,590
there were rumors from the palace.

668
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,360
Noble Consort Miao seems troubled.

669
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,550
I want you to investigate this matter.

670
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,510
Do you really want to get involved?

671
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,190
Even if it's treacherous,

672
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,920
I'll still wade through it.

673
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,110
Mrs. Fu.

674
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,350
What is it?

675
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,440
There are unpleasant rumors about you

676
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,550
spreading in the household.

677
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,110
Even the Madam might have heard.

678
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,760
What rumors?

679
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,510
Is it true?

680
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,880
The other morning,

681
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,880
I changed the bedding in Mrs. Fu's room

682
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,090
and saw it with my own eyes.

683
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,510
She seems a proper lady.

684
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,940
Could it be that you were mistaken?

685
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,920
I'm not blind.

686
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,030
I can see whether there was a bloodstain

687
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,190
on that white silk sheet.

688
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,710
Believe it or not.

689
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,710
Is what you said true?

690
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,590
(Sincerity and Noble)
Everyone's gossiping.

691
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,150
If I hadn't overheard it

692
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,480
and scolded them,

693
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,480
it would have spread far and wide.

694
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,630
Calm down.

695
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,760
When Hanyan comes,

696
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,880
I'll ask her myself.

697
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,510
- Mother.
- Hanyan.

698
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,480
Have a seat.

699
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,070
You're kind and can't be harsh.

700
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
I'll ask her.

701
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,800
Hanyan,

702
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,360
I'm asking you on Madam's behalf.

703
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,280
Before you married into the Fu Family,

704
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,150
were you still a maiden?

705
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,760
I don't know what I've done wrong

706
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,280
to deserve such a humiliating question.

707
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,400
Please tell me, Mother.

708
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,440
Don't use Madam as a shield.

709
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,550
I'm asking you.

710
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
Just answer me.

711
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,430
I have never

712
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,960
acted improperly.

713
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,230
Naturally, I am pure.

714
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,430
Good.

715
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,840
Let me ask you again.

716
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,400
Since you claim to be pure,

717
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,840
why was there no blood

718
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,400
on the wedding night?

719
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,070
Enough.

720
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,880
Since Hanyan says she is pure,

721
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,280
I trust she would not lie.

722
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,400
Cousin, you're being naive.

723
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,800
Who admits to such things?

724
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,960
It concerns our reputation.

725
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,000
Why not have a female physician check?

726
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,280
Then the truth will be clear.

727
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,550
That's inappropriate.

728
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,110
What's inappropriate about it?

729
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,280
Madam.

730
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,550
This is…

731
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,760
Ms. Tan.

732
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,510
Mother,

733
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,450
she's the imperial physician from the palace,

734
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,590
Ms. Tan Yunxian.

735
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,840
Greetings, Madam.

736
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,840
Ms. Tan.

737
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,710
Please have a seat.

738
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,650
- Serve tea.
- Ms. Tan, please.

739
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,550
We've heard of your medical expertise.

740
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:59,150
May I ask why you've come today?

741
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,360
Mother,

742
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,110
I've heard the rumors, too.

743
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,760
So I invited Ms. Tan here.

744
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,110
The servants lack discipline

745
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,510
and speak nonsense.

746
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,630
Apologies, Ms. Tan.

747
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,550
Mrs. Fu, what do you have to say?

748
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,960
I'm not highly educated,

749
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,830
but regarding propriety,

750
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,360
I've never overstepped.

751
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,130
Cousin,

752
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,110
Ms. Tan is an imperial physician

753
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,510
with exceptional skills.

754
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,400
Why not have Ms. Tan examine her?

755
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,230
If she is innocent,

756
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,070
others will have nothing more to say.

757
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,110
I was invited by Mrs. Fu,

758
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,000
and if I declare her innocent,

759
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,880
you might say we conspired together,

760
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,840
making her innocence hard to prove

761
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,630
and still facing gossip at home.

762
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,670
If I declare she's unclean,

763
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,880
it would be just what you want.

764
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,150
You could then expel her from the house.

765
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,760
Am I right?

766
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,280
Ms. Tan,

767
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,110
you misunderstood me.

768
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,800
You are an imperial physician,

769
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,110
surely upright in your duties.

770
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,480
If I doubted you,

771
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,070
wouldn't I be doubting the palace too?

772
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,190
Rest assured

773
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,400
and examine her.

774
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,880
Whatever the result,

775
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,710
I will not object.

776
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,230
May I ask,

777
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,230
is Mrs. Fu a foolish person?

778
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,590
Certainly not.

779
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,590
She is clever and wise.

780
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,480
How could she be foolish?

781
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,230
Even common folks know,

782
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,440
to fake purity,

783
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,000
one uses a blood-stained white cloth

784
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,510
and swaps it discreetly overnight.

785
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,400
With Mrs. Fu wisdom,

786
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,030
she surely understands this trick.

787
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,440
Since she didn't resort to it,

788
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,230
it clearly proves

789
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,110
she is honest

790
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,230
and virtuous.

791
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,590
Ms. Tan makes a valid point.

792
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,510
People are often foolish,

793
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,510
making baseless judgments.

794
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,760
But have you ever considered,

795
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,000
even the leaves in the forest

796
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,590
are never exactly alike?

797
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,960
Moreover,

798
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,460
there are countless women,

799
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,000
each unique.

800
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,550
Judging purity by a first-night mark,

801
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,000
these are mere superstitions.

802
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,670
From ancient times until now,

803
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:34,630
many women have suffered unjustly.

804
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,960
Your family is upright and honorable.

805
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:42,320
Don't follow baseless rumors

806
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,000
and create wrongful accusations.

807
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,320
Ms. Tan speaks the truth.

808
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,320
I was misguided.

809
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,480
I've wronged Hanyan.

810
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,320
Mother, don't blame yourself.

811
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:59,590
I didn't take it to heart.

812
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,030
That's good.

813
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,800
Good to hear.

814
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,590
The matter is resolved.

815
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,190
I won't disturb you further.

816
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,880
I shall take my leave.

817
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,480
Please, Ms. Tan.

818
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,030
Ms. Tan, let me see you out.

819
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,760
(Light, Fu Residence)

820
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,230
Sorry to trouble you, Ms. Tan.

821
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,480
It's alright.

822
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,400
How are your mother's legs lately?

823
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,070
Has she been taking her medicine?

824
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,880
Mother is doing well.

825
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,710
Thank you for your concern.

826
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,590
Also, thank you

827
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,840
for helping her stand up again.

828
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,800
To her,

829
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,480
this is like a new life.

830
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,280
Just a small effort.

831
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,670
No need to worry.

832
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,320
By the way,

833
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,110
has the Noble Consort

834
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,110
been troubled lately?

835
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,190
It's a complex matter.

836
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,590
I dare not speak lightly.

837
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,920
Take care.

838
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,480
Ms. Tan, take care.

839
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,220
(Light, Fu Residence)

840
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,200
Any progress?

841
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,550
Take a look at this first.

842
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,200
What is this?

843
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,880
(Breeze Under Moonlight)
Written by the late Empress Dexiao.

844
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,070
It's a guide for the conduct
of palace consorts.

845
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,550
Recently, dozens of copies have been made.

846
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,460
They're being circulated
all over the Capital.

847
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,280
All aimed at criticizing Noble Consort Miao.

848
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,670
But why?

849
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,230
The Crown Prince is very young.

850
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,760
The Empress passed away due to illness.

851
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,760
After the lantern banquet,
Noble Consort Miao

852
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,590
insisted on adopting the Crown Prince,

853
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,500
hinting at ambitions of becoming Empress.

854
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,670
The ministers report to His Majesty.

855
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,670
Some demand her execution.

856
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,670
His Majesty is hesitant due to old ties.

857
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,190
So a minister suggested this plan.

858
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:57,440
To use the guide
to mock Noble Consort Miao's

859
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,360
malicious intent.

860
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:02,190
They fear that as His Majesty grows older,

861
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:04,480
should he one day pass,
and the young emperor ascends,

862
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,150
Noble Consort Miao might
seize control of the court.

863
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,840
Yes.

864
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,360
Lately, there's talk at court

865
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,920
that five powerful ministers
plan a joint memorial.

866
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,230
If it reaches the palace,

867
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:16,510
it may

868
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,510
be the final blow for Noble Consort Miao.

869
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,320
Noble Consort Miao is already
in a precarious position.

870
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,690
She can't even protect herself.

871
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,440
And you still want to rely on her?

872
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,640
No.

873
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,840
If she remains secure in the palace,

874
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,550
how could I ever gain her favor?

875
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,670
To Noble Consort Miao,

876
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,550
the ministers

877
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,880
are like a sharp blade overhead.

878
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:40,840
But to us,

879
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,840
they're the key to turning the tide.

880
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,000
We just need to break them down one by one

881
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,510
to save Noble Consort Miao.

882
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,550
If she regains her position,

883
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,510
and her power is restored,

884
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,030
just a single decree

885
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,920
can strip Zhuang Shiyang's protection.

886
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,110
Then we can continue investigating

887
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,360
and bring him to justice.

888
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,550
Even if you save her,

889
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,880
are you sure

890
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:13,030
she will help you?

891
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,110
Just let me enter the palace,

892
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,590
and it will surely succeed.

893
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,030
This involves national affairs,

894
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,630
one wrong move could ruin everything.

895
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:35,990
Fu Yunxi,

896
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,360
when did you become so cautious?

897
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,440
When Zhuang Shiyang burned
the encyclopedia,

898
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,000
did he worry about failure?

899
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,840
Now that we're at the gambling table,

900
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,190
he wants to be the banker.

901
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:51,360
I want to be the banker, too.

902
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:54,170
Then it's time for a big gamble.

903
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,760
Otherwise,

904
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,360
how can we succeed?

905
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,550
I knew I didn't misjudge you.

906
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,360
What do you mean?

907
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,670
The carriage is ready.

908
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,440
Will you join me for a trip?

909
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,190
(A Virtuous Legacy)
Lady Zhang was betrothed to Deng.

910
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,710
When Deng was alive,

911
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,760
she managed the household diligently.

912
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,230
After Deng passed away,

913
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,190
she mourned and tended his grave for life.

914
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,190
Marriage is the foundation of society.

915
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:28,630
Deng's only son died young.

916
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,630
Lady Zhang remained faithful for years.

917
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,280
She was finally honored by the court.

918
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,490
She earned the title
of Virtuous and Faithful Widow.

919
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:38,880
This is a joyous event for the family.

920
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,510
Tonight, the Dengs will host a banquet.

921
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,230
This is a decree.

922
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:44,760
The entire Deng family

923
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,230
thanks His Majesty's grace.

924
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,840
So?

925
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,030
The five ministers
accusing Noble Consort Miao,

926
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,190
remain hidden and unknown.

927
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,880
I can only find out one of them.

928
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,030
He has old ties with the Zhuangs.

929
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,440
It's Mr. Deng.

930
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,320
You plan to visit tonight?

931
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:06,480
During the visit,

932
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:07,920
I'll obtain a confidential letter.

933
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:08,920
What letter?

934
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,150
To shoot an arrow,

935
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:12,000
you need a target.

936
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:13,710
According to the informant,

937
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,190
someone will

938
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,230
deliver the joint memorial
to Deng Mansion

939
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,030
for Mr. Deng to sign and seal.

940
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,800
For us, the joint memorial

941
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,150
is a list

942
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,200
and a target.

943
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,950
You've planned everything already?

944
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,830
Since I promised

945
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,960
to be my steppingstone

946
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,030
and ladder to ascend,

947
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:31,480
I have to fulfill it.

948
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:35,190
But they are no ordinary figures.

949
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,320
Once we confirm their identities,

950
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,840
we must use every possible means.

951
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:40,030
Whether persuasion

952
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,320
or coercion,

953
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,510
until they withdraw the memorial.

954
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,920
Going against high-ranking officials

955
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,330
right under the Emperor's nose.

956
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,020
Are you willing to do this?

957
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,590
Why wouldn't I?
