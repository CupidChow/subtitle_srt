1
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:41,220
=The Glory=

2
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,280
I did it.

3
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,270
Don't be afraid.

4
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,310
Come with me.

5
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,990
No.

6
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,870
I'm heading to the Capital.

7
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,960
Why?

8
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,840
Because...

9
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,750
that's my home.

10
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,980
=Episode 3=

11
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,240
Who are you?

12
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,870
Taoist Duan,
I've long heard of your name.

13
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,240
I, Zhuang Hanyan,
have been waiting for you.

14
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,960
Taoist Duan.

15
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,120
Taoist Master Duan.

16
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,030
Mr. Zhuang, it's been a while.

17
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,030
How have you been, Taoist Duan?

18
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,310
I heard you went to
Yingtian Prefecture recently.

19
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,120
When did you come back?

20
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,310
I didn't know you had time to visit us.

21
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,910
Why didn't you inform me

22
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,400
so that I could make preparations?

23
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,630
Mr. Zhuang, no need for formalities.

24
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,310
I observed the stars

25
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,600
and found that you might be in trouble,

26
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,310
so I came here to help you.

27
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,240
Hanyan, you can return to
Gongtong Chamber first.

28
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
I will take care of this.

29
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,240
Wait a moment.

30
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,040
This must be Miss Hanyan, right?

31
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,800
Yes.

32
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,760
Mr. Zhuang,

33
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,750
has anyone in your residence
been unwell or troubled lately?

34
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,430
I don't think so.

35
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,240
Father, you don't need to cover for me.

36
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,160
Grandmother is gravely ill
and has been lying in bed.

37
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,270
Taoist Duan, with your great abilities,

38
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,520
you must've known this.

39
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
If that's the case,

40
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,510
Mr. Zhuang, would you allow me

41
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,190
to check on your mother?

42
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,190
Master, have you found anything?

43
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,120
It's just like 17 years ago.

44
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,190
The evil spirit in your family
has remained

45
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,190
and shocked your mother's spirit.

46
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,720
Now the evil is going to take her life.

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,310
Master, you're powerful.

48
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,510
Please save Mother!

49
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,190
How could there be an evil spirit?

50
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,920
Master, the Taoist master
is referring to

51
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,270
the barefoot ghost
from 17 years ago, right?

52
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,720
Nanny Sun, stop talking nonsense!

53
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,040
(Live as Long as the Moon)
It's still unclear.

54
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,360
Although I can master Taoist arts,

55
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,800
I'm still a mortal

56
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,240
and need to perform rituals
to seek divine aid

57
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,480
so that I can see through
the current mystery.

58
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,430
Mr. Zhuang, if you really want
to save your mother,

59
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,190
quickly set up a ritual site
in the courtyard.

60
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,190
Taoist Duan.

61
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,190
I heard you're from
the Liangguang Region.

62
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,750
Does it really matter?

63
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,040
The roads are slippery.

64
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,800
Master, please be careful.

65
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,830
Witnessed by the clear sky and
blessed land, we burn incense and pray.

66
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,760
Father!

67
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,830
Mr. Zhuang, what is this about?

68
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,560
Taoist Duan came here

69
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,800
to pray for my mother's well-being.

70
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,870
Brothers, what brings you here?

71
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,950
Yuchi told us
your mother was seriously ill,

72
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,920
and you left the banquet in a hurry
and didn't return.

73
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,920
We were worried
that something went wrong,

74
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,750
so we came here to check on you.

75
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,360
Be quick to obey my command!

76
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,030
How about this?

77
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,310
Why don't you go home first?

78
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,000
As for the ritual offerings,

79
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,480
we can discuss it another day, okay?

80
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,950
Okay, then.

81
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,120
My Lords, let's...

82
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,950
How can we stand by
while the Zhuang family faces trouble?

83
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,390
Besides, Mr. Zhuang has been telling us

84
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
that Zhuang Residence is peaceful

85
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,390
and has no ghosts or monsters.

86
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,920
Today, I really want to see

87
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,510
how that Taoist master
will solve the case.

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't want this

89
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,360
to affect

90
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,190
the good marriages
between the Zhuang and Han families.

91
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,510
Mr. Zhuang.

92
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,920
Master, how's it going?

93
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,230
Mom.

94
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,360
This is serious.

95
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,390
I'm afraid you have to
make sacrifices, My Lord.

96
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,160
Make sacrifices?

97
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
With the help of the gods,

98
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,310
I already know the evil
spirit's eight characters of birth.

99
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,120
If you want to save your mother,

100
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,120
we need to eliminate this evil spirit
in exchange for her life.

101
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,190
However, according to my calculation,

102
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,190
this evil spirit

103
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,600
is your blood relative.

104
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,560
Master, this...

105
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,750
Taoist Duan,

106
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,750
although we're not
high-ranking officials or nobles,

107
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,750
we're a family of scholars.

108
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,120
How could we bear such an evil spirit?

109
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,270
Here are the eight characters.

110
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,550
Mr. Zhuang, please check it out
and handle it yourself.

111
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,120
How... How's that possible?

112
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,390
How's that possible?

113
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,960
It's impossible!

114
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,600
You're talking nonsense.

115
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,200
Why are you slandering my sister?

116
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,360
How could it be Yushan?

117
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,670
These are Yushan's eight characters.

118
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,200
- Taoist Duan, 17 years ago,
- Yushan's eight characters.

119
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,150
you said Hanyan was

120
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,550
the barefoot ghost.

121
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,120
And now,

122
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,960
you're saying Yushan is the evil spirit.

123
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,240
We're an innocent official family.

124
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,550
How can you say our family is filled with
evil spirits and monsters?

125
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,630
Mr. Zhuang, calm down.

126
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,790
I do have to apologize to Miss Hanyan

127
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,910
for an old matter.

128
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,750
As for the barefoot ghost
from 17 years ago,

129
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,840
I was deceived and blinded
by that evil spirit

130
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,480
because I wasn't powerful enough.

131
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,870
That's why I wronged Miss Hanyan.

132
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,390
Your family's hardships over the years

133
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,240
have nothing to do with you.

134
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,440
Furthermore, I've kept Miss Hanyan's

135
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,120
eight characters of birth in mind.

136
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,750
Now it seems

137
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,440
you are the auspicious reincarnation
with true blessings.

138
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,720
You are indeed a treasure
of the Zhuang family.

139
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Taoist Duan, in that case...

140
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,360
Hanyan...

141
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,720
is not the barefoot ghost, right?

142
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,200
Miss Hanyan has endured
hardships over the years,

143
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,120
and she unjustly took the blame
for Miss Yushan.

144
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,120
I've raised Yushan
since she was a child.

145
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,790
She's always been
obedient and courteous.

146
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,240
How could she be an ill-omened person?

147
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,960
Whether you believe it or not
is not up to me.

148
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,960
However, if the evil spirit remains,

149
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,790
your mother's life will be at risk.

150
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,960
If you want to be a filial son,

151
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,320
Mr. Zhuang, please be decisive.

152
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,600
Don't listen to his nonsense, Father.

153
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,750
Capture this evil Taoist!

154
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,510
What... What are you doing?

155
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,630
What are you doing?

156
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,600
Yushan, don't be rude.

157
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Father, this Taoist is misleading you.

158
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,390
I already have evidence.

159
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,360
Please report it.

160
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,030
What evidence?

161
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,960
Lang, tell them.

162
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Master, last night, I saw

163
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,150
Miss Hanyan sneak out of
the Gongtong Chamber

164
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,150
to secretly meet Taoist Duan
at the back door.

165
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,000
Although I didn't hear what they said,

166
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,750
I saw Miss Hanyan

167
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,840
give Taoist Duan a large bundle.

168
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,670
When did I meet Miss Hanyan?

169
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,600
Evil Spirit, you want to harm
others again!

170
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,360
Lang, don't be scared. Go ahead.

171
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,800
Yes.

172
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,510
I thought it was strange,

173
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,320
so I quietly followed Taoist Duan.

174
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,910
Then I saw him go to Yu's Pawnshop

175
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,060
to sell many gold and silver jewels.

176
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,790
After he left.

177
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,270
I asked the shopkeeper what happened

178
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,750
only to find out
the gold and silver items

179
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,360
were all given by

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,670
Ms. Zhou to Miss Hanyan.

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,840
So I...

182
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,270
hurried back to report to Miss Yushan.

183
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,910
Hanyan, you were accused of
being the barefoot ghost

184
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,270
and lived in Danzhou for years.

185
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,910
As your sister, I felt sorry for you.

186
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,510
However, I didn't know
you were so vicious

187
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,870
that you would bribe the Taoist master

188
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,840
to frame me to win my family's favor.

189
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,360
Hanyan, are they telling the truth?

190
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,230
Father.

191
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,750
Let's listen to Taoist Duan first.

192
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,750
Humble Maid, you're speaking nonsense.

193
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,960
How dare you slander a Taoist master?

194
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,120
Taoist Duan.

195
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,960
Why don't we go to Yu's Pawnshop?

196
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,030
We'll know if it is slander.

197
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,120
Taoist Duan, tell me the truth.

198
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,510
Did you really meet Hanyan last night?

199
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,480
Hit him!

200
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,850
Hit him until he speaks.

201
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,240
- How dare you?
- Hurry!

202
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,200
Hit him.

203
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,960
Stop!

204
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,160
How dare you?

205
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,270
Madam, Yongshou Chamber is in chaos.

206
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,600
(Meal Record)
Take them there.

207
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,440
Yes.

208
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,960
Stop!

209
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,360
Stop!

210
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,260
Stop it.

211
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,960
I'll tell the truth.

212
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,030
Mr. Zhuang, I had no choice.

213
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,120
What do you mean?

214
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,320
Miss Hanyan, she...

215
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,150
she threatened me.

216
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,630
I did everything as she told me.

217
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,630
I had no choice but to comply.

218
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,720
Furthermore, she is the reincarnation
of the barefoot ghost.

219
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,480
Now that she's grown up,

220
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,670
she's fiercer than in her childhood.

221
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,550
I dare not offend her!

222
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,870
(It turns out)

223
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,600
(all this mess)

224
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,390
(is to set me up.)

225
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,240
(Zhuang Yushan and her brother
couldn't have done it.)

226
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,150
(The real mastermind)

227
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,960
(must be someone else.)

228
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,510
(Even the false charge 17 years ago)

229
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,000
(might also be the work
of the same person.)

230
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
(But I won't let you succeed again.)

231
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,000
Father, I did met
Taoist Duan last night,

232
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,790
and I was the one

233
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,670
who told him to do this.

234
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,320
Hanyan, you're so foolish!

235
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,150
Master, don't be angry.

236
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,750
Miss Hanyan must have her own reasons.

237
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,440
Ms. Zhou, you're right.

238
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,750
I do have my own reasons.

239
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,910
What reasons do you have?

240
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,600
How could you use an evil Taoist
to force Father to kill me?

241
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,510
Sister, calm down.

242
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,390
Even if you didn't expose it,

243
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,440
I'd eventually reveal the truth.

244
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,150
I'd never let you end up

245
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,030
like me, the barefoot ghost.

246
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,510
Hanyan, you...

247
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,240
You're making me so confused.

248
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,350
Father.

249
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,120
I didn't mean to cause a scene

250
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,150
but to prove to the world

251
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,270
that this liar is adept at
deceiving others with fate.

252
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,030
Taoist Duan's words and deeds

253
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,240
are blind superstition
of gods and ghosts.

254
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,080
He's never trustworthy.

255
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,190
Taoist Duan, I have a question.

256
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,480
If I was the one
who bought you off today,

257
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,060
who was the person who bought you off

258
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,910
to frame me 17 years ago?

259
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,080
- You...
- You're a fortune-teller

260
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,600
who can decide

261
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,030
someone's fate with just one word.

262
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,790
With gold and silver,

263
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,910
you dare to falsely accuse anyone.

264
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,320
Don't you fear retribution?

265
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,280
All these years,

266
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,320
I have endured

267
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,870
hardships and calamities

268
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,840
only because of your false word.

269
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,910
Do you want me
to recount them all with you?

270
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,790
You'd better admit it.

271
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,870
You've plagued the Capital for years.

272
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,870
How many bribes have you accepted?

273
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,750
How many innocents have you framed?

274
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,440
That's nonsense.

275
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,440
When did I frame you?

276
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,840
You are an utterly wicked
barefoot ghost.

277
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,670
If it weren't for
the fear of your power,

278
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,630
how could I have been controlled by you?

279
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,550
If I were a malicious ghost,

280
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,870
how dare you accuse me in public?

281
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,080
Aren't you afraid
that I'd take your life?

282
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,670
Zhuang Hanyan, stop pretending.

283
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,120
If Yushan hadn't uncovered

284
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,840
your nasty plot,

285
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,960
you would've wronged her to death.

286
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,360
Sister, I believe you though.

287
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,270
If you planned the whole thing,

288
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,030
why would Grandmother be seriously ill?

289
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,440
Sister, please explain this.

290
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Miss Hanyan shouldn't answer this.

291
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,510
Nanny Chen, what are you doing?

292
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,960
Master,

293
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,310
this is the cook Ms. Zhou hired

294
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,750
from Yinan for Ma'am.

295
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,310
These days,

296
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,480
he's prepared every meal for Ma'am.

297
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,720
Tell us, what have you done

298
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,750
to her meals?

299
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,550
Nanny Chen, you...

300
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,830
What are you talking about?

301
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,670
Master, mercy!

302
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,160
I am innocent! I am innocent!

303
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,310
I checked the meals but only found

304
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,550
a type of wild mushroom.

305
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,350
It's said that if someone eats it
when it's not cooked well,

306
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,350
it can open the third eye.

307
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,680
But it will pass naturally
after a while!

308
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
It can't endanger anyone's life, Master!

309
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,830
What third eye?

310
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,240
Some wild mushrooms
can cause hallucinations.

311
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,270
Mother saw ghosts from hell

312
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,510
all because she ate this.

313
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,270
No conspiracy.

314
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,000
No conspiracy!

315
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,510
Master, it can't be that simple.

316
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,350
What secrets do you have to
discuss right here?

317
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,680
This is Yongshou Chamber's
daily meal record.

318
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,160
The cook knew Ma'am's medicinal soup

319
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,440
has tulips,

320
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,440
which conflict with cloves,

321
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,350
but he made sweet clove cakes

322
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,920
and asked Ma'am to eat more.

323
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,640
That's why she fell gravely ill.

324
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,800
Master.

325
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,310
Master, please investigate it!

326
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,510
Please investigate it!

327
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,000
I did review the prescription

328
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,750
on the day I came here,

329
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,110
(Sweet Clove Cakes)
but I'm just a cook

330
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,030
who doesn't know medicine.

331
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,960
How could I have done this?

332
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,480
You don't know medicine,

333
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:55,240
but there's a lady in our mansion

334
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,510
whose family owns a pharmacy.

335
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,240
Master!

336
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,790
It's my fault for using
the wrong person.

337
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,240
I failed to take care of Mother.

338
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,160
Please punish me!

339
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,480
Father, the soups and pastries
were sent to Grandmother's room,

340
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,110
but it was she who decided to eat them.

341
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,160
It's all because of

342
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,000
the cook's stupidity and carelessness.

343
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,070
Mom has nothing to do with it.

344
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,910
Yes, Father.

345
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,720
It was Grandmother who asked

346
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,960
Mom to hire a cook from her hometown.

347
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,920
She only meant to
take care of Grandmother.

348
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,310
Enough.

349
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,110
Ruyin, get up.

350
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,440
Maybe it's a coincidence.
It must be a coincidence.

351
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,310
Coincidence?

352
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,110
Master, it concerns Ma'am's health.

353
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,920
Declaring it's a coincidence
may lead to future problems.

354
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,790
Nanny Chen, what else do you want?

355
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,790
Master, Nanny Chen has a point.

356
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,350
Sweet clove cakes aren't common,

357
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,110
but Cook Sun still made it.

358
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,270
It's indeed suspicious.

359
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,440
No!

360
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,830
I saw several jars of cloves

361
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,070
in the kitchen,

362
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,440
and they might spoil if not used,

363
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
so I thought of making
sweet clove cakes.

364
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,750
Grandmother's medicine
conflicts with cloves.

365
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,400
Why did they suddenly buy
so many cloves?

366
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,160
The purchase of ingredients and herbs

367
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,590
must be approved by Madam.

368
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,640
How could you blame it on
Gongtong Chamber?

369
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,480
Exactly.

370
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,720
Miss Yushan,
you're good at shifting blame.

371
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,310
Madam bought cloves

372
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,880
for perfuming clothes.

373
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,480
They were never sent to the kitchen.

374
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,680
Is that so?

375
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,920
Do we need to argue about this again?

376
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,270
Miss Yushan, you…

377
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,590
Enough, enough!

378
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Stop talking!

379
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,840
All of you!

380
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,830
Do you really want to ruin

381
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,750
our family's reputation?

382
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,800
Father.

383
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Your colleagues in court are here.

384
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,000
It's actually a good thing to clarify

385
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,000
the complicated matter in our family.

386
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,160
Hanyan, why are you also...?

387
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,440
Father, calm down. Listen to me.

388
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,110
As recorded in Mushrooms,

389
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,310
if one eats poisonous mushrooms,

390
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,160
they can drink bitter tea
with alum to recover.

391
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,240
Grandmother is still ill.
We should focus on this.

392
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,160
Nanny Sun,

393
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,590
please go to the kitchen
and prepare the antidote.

394
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,000
Then feed it to Grandmother.

395
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,560
Yes, yes.

396
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,160
Miss Hanyan, you're right.
I'll prepare it now.

397
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
As for her persistent high fever,

398
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,440
the cloves must've
conflicted with the medicine.

399
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,680
When the effect of medicine is gone,
she'll recover.

400
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,070
Father, don't worry.

401
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,480
Hanyan,

402
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,350
how do you know these things?

403
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,720
Today's chaos in the Zhuang family

404
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,000
is all because of Taoist Duan's
unexpected visit.

405
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,960
Both the barefoot ghost
and the evil spirit

406
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,640
are baseless slanders.

407
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,480
He only wanted to use
your superstition to deceive you

408
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,110
and cause a scene for his own profit.

409
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,960
Today's turmoil

410
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,680
is not because
our family has ill intentions.

411
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,920
On the contrary, everyone here

412
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,400
is kind and virtuous with pure hearts.

413
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,350
That's why an evil-doer could harm us.

414
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,750
Uncles, you three
are all prominent court officials.

415
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,960
I believe you can figure out
the truth behind it.

416
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,550
Please don't be fooled by the wicked.

417
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,400
Anyone can say nice words.

418
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,270
However, you haven't explained

419
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,030
why you colluded with Taoist Duan

420
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,000
to frame Yushan.

421
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,590
Shut up, idiot!

422
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,240
Yuchi has a point.

423
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,640
Taoist Duan has long been renowned
in the Capital.

424
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Miss Hanyan keeps accusing him
of being an evil-doer

425
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,550
and wants us to stop suspecting her.

426
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,270
I'm afraid there's no proof.

427
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,150
Hey, stop.

428
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,400
Come here.

429
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,110
According to the laws,

430
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,270
thieves must be tattooed

431
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,830
with "Thief" on their bodies.

432
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,780
Right arm for first-time offenders.

433
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,270
Left arm for repeat offenders.

434
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,920
Uncles, you must know this, right?

435
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,400
I'm a busy person.

436
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,830
This is your family affair.

437
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,030
Don't get me involved in this.

438
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,560
- Bye.
- Stop him.

439
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,680
Mr. Zhuang, even if
I'm not a noble guest,

440
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,550
I'm a Taoist priest.

441
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,350
How could you humiliate me like this?

442
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,640
Taoist Duan, do you want to admit it yourself

443
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,400
or let me strip off your Taoist robe

444
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,210
and show everyone

445
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,480
who you really are?

446
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,680
How... How dare you?

447
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,240
Zhuang Hanyan.

448
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,310
You Barefoot Ghost,
how dare you slander me?

449
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,780
Mr. Zhuang,

450
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,030
free me now.

451
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,550
Han...

452
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,160
Hanyan, what do you mean?

453
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,590
Father, this man is a fraud.

454
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,980
He pretends to be a Taoist master,
but he's a thief.

455
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,740
We just need to strip off his clothes,

456
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,300
and everything will be clear.

457
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,460
Zhuang Shiyang!

458
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,900
I still need to go to the palace
to pray for the nobles today.

459
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,540
If I'm late,

460
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,700
you cannot afford the consequences!

461
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,300
Master, Taoist Duan
is telling the truth.

462
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,540
I've also heard

463
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,820
that he has ties with the concubines.

464
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,940
Ms. Zhou, if we allow him

465
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,620
to go to the palace
and deceive the nobles

466
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,340
while we already know he's a fraud,

467
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,700
I'm afraid we'll be punished

468
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,820
when they discover the truth.

469
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,260
What... What are you doing?

470
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,540
Even if the emperor blames us,

471
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,820
I will take all the blame!

472
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,820
It's been 17 years.

473
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,940
Your true colors must be revealed!

474
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,980
(Thief)

475
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,980
(Thief)

476
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,260
Fugitive Cui Aniu,

477
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,340
from the Liangguang Region,

478
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,820
arms tattooed with thieves' marks.

479
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,540
Thief?

480
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,260
(Thief)

481
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,220
Fraud, you're really a thief!

482
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,980
So what if I'm a thief?

483
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,780
A hero's past doesn't matter.

484
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,460
Although my history is not decent,

485
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,820
but I was enlightened by an immortal

486
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,220
and has been devoted to
Taoism for years.

487
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,300
Well,

488
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,500
do you want to punish me?

489
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,300
Devotion to Taoism

490
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,380
cannot resolve worldly sins.

491
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,060
The theft is minor and in the past.

492
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,140
However,

493
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,580
Taoist Duan, I heard you've been wanted
by the authorities for many years.

494
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,740
Taoist Duan,

495
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,620
I can help you hide your name.

496
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,300
But you owe me a name.

497
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,540
What do you mean?

498
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,380
Who ordered you to harm me 17 years ago

499
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,780
and today?

500
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,340
If you tell the truth,

501
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,500
I'll go easy on you.

502
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,780
If you insist on staying silent,

503
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,220
I'll have to send you
to the authorities.

504
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,140
I've heard the prison in the Capital

505
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,140
has countless methods

506
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,700
for silent prisoners.

507
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,940
I'll tell the truth!

508
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,220
You, you...

509
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,860
Why are you looking at Mom?

510
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,220
Master, I didn't!

511
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,340
Ms. Zhou, Miss Hanyan and you

512
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,940
both used this to threaten me.

513
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,820
Now that the truth is exposed,

514
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,420
I have nothing to fear.

515
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,900
Just admit it.

516
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,780
Shut up!

517
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,220
Taoist Master Duan!

518
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,060
Why are you slandering me?

519
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,220
Father, don't believe his lies.

520
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,020
Lang saw it
with her own eyes last night.

521
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,220
Hanyan met with Taoist Duan secretly

522
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,780
and gave him many valuable things.

523
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,260
I didn't reclaim
those gold and silver jewels.

524
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,780
They're still at Yu's Pawnshop.
We can check it out!

525
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,860
Yushan, since you're so convinced,

526
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,340
we don't need to go.

527
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,820
You're admitting it, right?

528
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,310
Lang.

529
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,220
When did you see me
meet with Taoist Duan last night?

530
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,460
Around the Hai hour.

531
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,860
Well, then tell me.

532
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,460
What did I look like at that time?

533
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,220
I...

534
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,500
So, you never saw her face.

535
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,940
Ms. Zhou made this fur cloak

536
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,220
for Miss Hanyan.

537
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,700
Only she has this.

538
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,940
Ms. Zhou, at this point,

539
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,740
we don't need to go to Yu's Pawnshop.

540
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,380
I'm afraid of the jewels you gave me

541
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,260
are already in that pawnshop,

542
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,820
but we can ask the tailor

543
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,820
whether you made only one piece

544
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,580
or two identical ones.

545
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,580
Miss Hanyan.

546
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,540
Although I'm Master's concubine,

547
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,900
but in fact, I'm just a servant
of this mansion.

548
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,820
You returned home
as the lineal daughter.

549
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,500
If you really dislike me,

550
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,740
I won't complain at all!

551
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,740
I'm tongue-tied, unable to argue!

552
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,980
If that's the case,

553
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,580
only death can prove my innocence!

554
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,540
Master!

555
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,780
I can't accompany you anymore!

556
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,220
- Mom!
- Ruyin!

557
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,060
Ms. Zhou!

558
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,820
- Mom!
- Mom!

559
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,660
Ruyin!

560
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,180
- Mom!
- Ruyin!

561
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,540
Mom! Mom!

562
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,430
Ruyin!

563
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,350
Doctor!

564
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,520
Summon the doctor!

565
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,300
Mom!

566
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,660
Mom, are you okay?

567
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,780
Miss Hanyan,

568
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,780
you promised to let me go.

569
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,980
Cui Aniu.

570
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,580
Over the past 17 years,

571
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,220
I've wanted to kill you
every day and night.

572
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,980
Let you go?

573
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,500
You are too naive.

574
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,740
Get up!

575
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,860
Go, go, go.

576
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,300
(That day,)

577
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,380
(the rumor about the barefoot ghost
that has harmed me for years)

578
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,860
(was finally clarified.)

579
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,900
(And I finally)

580
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,300
(walked out of this mire.)

581
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,980
(Barefoot ghosts)

582
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,100
(are just common people
who have nothing)

583
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,140
(and have to walk barefoot since born.)

584
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,460
(And that is exactly)

585
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,060
(what makes us even more fearless.)

586
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,220
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)
(Yuchi's marriage is gone.)

587
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,060
(Vice Minister Han ruined)

588
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,780
(this marriage at last,)

589
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,980
(claiming the Zhuang family
lacks discipline.)

590
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,100
(Grandmother slept for two days)

591
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,900
(and finally came back alive.)

592
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,700
(Ms. Zhou was fined
half a year's salary)

593
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,300
(and was confined for a few days,)

594
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,740
(and this matter was over.)

595
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,860
(Father said)

596
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,100
(Taoist Duan's words)

597
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,220
(are all suspicious)

598
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,940
(and cannot be believed.)

599
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,020
(He'll hand him to the authorities.)

600
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,740
(With all the twists and turns,)

601
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,340
(in the end,)

602
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,140
(a poor maid)

603
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,500
(shouldered all the blame.)

604
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,580
(Nanny Chen suddenly appeared,)

605
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,660
(clearly well prepared,)

606
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,100
(which made me more confused about)

607
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,660
(Mother's actions.)

608
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,660
(And the mysterious informant)

609
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,020
(also made me uneasy.)

610
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,820
(They wanted to help secretly)

611
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,940
(but were unclear about the truth.)

612
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,660
(It seems like)

613
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,500
(a riddle game.)

614
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,460
(No matter what,)

615
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,580
(I have won this battle)

616
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,820
(for vindication.)

617
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,020
(But more importantly,)

618
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,380
(the path ahead)

619
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,100
(must be more arduous.)

620
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,940
(Pure Heart)

621
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,460
It's all Taoist Master Duan's fault.

622
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,500
(Yongshou Chamber)
He deceived and harmed us all.

623
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,300
You've really suffered all these years.

624
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,660
It's in the past.

625
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,860
Grandmother,
please don't feel sorry for me.

626
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,740
However, you've grown up.

627
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,260
It's time to get married.

628
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,860
I've waited for 17 years

629
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,700
and finally returned home.

630
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,980
I really want to take care of you
for a longer period of time.

631
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,220
Hanyan, listen to me.

632
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,700
A woman can't afford delays.

633
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,380
In the blind of an eye,

634
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,780
you'll become a middle-aged woman.

635
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,420
You should find someone now.

636
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,100
Grandmother, I'll listen to you.

637
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,780
Baoyue, what day is it today?

638
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,860
Ma'am, it's the 1st day
of the last month.

639
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,060
What a coincidence.

640
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,420
It's time to seek plum blossoms
in the snow.

641
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,300
Seek plum blossoms in the snow?

642
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,380
The plum blossoms are not just flowers,

643
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,340
they also represent good matches.

644
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,220
There are matchmakers in the Capital.

645
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,340
Every last month of the year,

646
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,820
they'll hold an event called
Seek Plum Blossoms in the Snow

647
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,260
to set up dates for young men and women.

648
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,980
If they find someone they like,

649
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,500
by the Lantern Festival
after the new year,

650
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,100
they'll date each other
under the beautiful moonlight.

651
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,260
Miss Hanyan, are you still blaming me?

652
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,780
Ms. Zhou, of course not.

653
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,740
Father has said
it was a misunderstanding.

654
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,540
These days,

655
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,660
I've been so troubled.

656
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,220
I'm just worried you're overthinking it.

657
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,940
But I don't know
how to apologize to you.

658
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,260
Ms. Zhou, what mistakes
do you think you made?

659
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,220
Lang is a maid at Gongtong Chamber

660
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,500
who grew up with Yushan.

661
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,820
I failed to control the servant.

662
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,700
I never expected she'd betray us

663
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,740
and slander you with baseless clues.

664
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,380
I don't blame Lang though.

665
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,820
She just wanted to protect her master.

666
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,540
Miss Hanyan, you're so compassionate.

667
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,260
Ms. Zhou, I'm flattered.

668
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,860
I was born in the Capital
but raised in the countryside.

669
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,140
I'm just a penny-pinching vulgar.

670
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,820
I don't understand compassion.

671
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:36,740
I only know an eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth.

672
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,460
Miss Hanyan, no wonder
you're Madam's real daughter.

673
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,020
With a touch of makeup,
you're as pretty as a fairy.

674
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:49,260
Today, all the single gentlemen
in the Capital

675
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,100
will be so lucky.

676
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,420
Ms. Zhou, thank you.

677
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,580
You've made me look so...

678
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,860
radiant.

679
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,700
Why are you still dressing up?

680
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,740
Are you going or not?

681
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,460
What are you doing?

682
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,580
Yushan is still unmarried
and older than me.

683
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,500
How can I steal your thunder

684
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,900
at Qiumei Garden?

685
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,780
You should definitely wear these jewels.

686
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,020
Hope you find a good match.

687
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,540
Oh, no.

688
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,740
When have I ever worn
such flashy things?

689
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,100
You're trying to embarrass me,
aren't you?

690
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,460
Embarrass you?

691
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,460
Ms. Zhou prepared all these for me.

692
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,500
Yushan, are you saying

693
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,980
Ms. Zhou wants to embarrass me?

694
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,910
I...

695
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,340
Miss Hanyan, you're so funny.

696
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,260
Yushan never liked these hair ornaments.

697
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,500
She simply doesn't know how to dress up.

698
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,900
Mom, I need to ride a horse later.

699
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,420
How can I wear these things?

700
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,420
It's Hanyan's kindness.

701
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,890
Just accept it.

702
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,860
Will you blame me
for giving them to her?

703
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,340
Of course not.

704
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,340
That's good.

705
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,300
Yushan.

706
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,300
Yushan, you look great today.

707
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,700
You're like a village girl in the town.

708
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,700
Close your mouth!

709
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,700
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

710
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,260
Did you see her? Did you see her?

711
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,220
Why did it stop?

712
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,860
Miss Hanyan.

713
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,900
Nature calls. I'll be right back.

714
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,260
There must be something.

715
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,580
Which family are you from, Miss?

716
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,100
I'm from the Zhuang family, Sir.

717
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,060
(Yuwen Chang'an, Department of Supervision,
Left Imperial Censor)

718
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,460
Are you going to Qiumei Garden?

719
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,140
Yes.

720
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,860
Where's the coachman?

721
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,980
He was here moments ago
but suddenly vanished.

722
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,300
Miss Zhuang, if you don't mind,

723
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,700
you can get in,

724
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,380
and I'll give you a ride.

725
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,060
This...

726
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,700
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

727
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,060
I'm Yuwen Chang'an,

728
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,220
the Left Imperial Censor.

729
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,220
Your father and I are old friends.

730
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,500
Speaking of which,

731
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,100
you should call me Uncle Yuwen.

732
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,820
Get in.

733
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,900
I heard you returned from Danzhou.

734
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,820
Well, in the blink of an eye,

735
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,020
you've grown up.

736
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,580
Uncle Yuwen, thanks for your concern.

737
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,460
Have you seen your mother?

738
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,300
Your features do remind me

739
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,300
of your mother's grace and spirit...

740
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,820
in her youth.

741
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,460
Uncle Yuwen, are you old acquaintances
with my mother?

742
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,740
Not just that.

743
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:03,140
Your grandfather was a grand scholar
at Hanlin Academy,

744
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,860
and Shiyang and I
were both his students.

745
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,900
Xiwen was beautiful, talented,
and gentle.

746
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,540
She was a star in the Capital.

747
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,700
At least half of the young talents
of Hanlin Academy

748
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,460
admired her back then.

749
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,660
Sorry about that.

750
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,460
I've heard a lot about my mother's past.

751
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,900
It's a pity I can't see
her youthful days.

752
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,780
It's your family affair,

753
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,100
and I shouldn't meddle in it,

754
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,620
but I still want to tell you this.

755
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,340
Your mother also had her reasons.

756
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,220
Don't hold a grudge against her.

757
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,380
Of course not.

758
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,020
I have no reason to resent my mother.

759
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,740
That's good.

760
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,620
We're almost at Qiumei Garden.

761
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,020
You can get off and walk there

762
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,300
in case of unnecessary rumors.

763
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,260
Okay.

764
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,060
Uncle Yuwen, thanks for your concern.

765
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,460
Stop.

766
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,340
(Qiumei Garden)

767
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,140
Miss Hanyan.

768
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,580
It's been a while,
and you look even better.

769
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,260
Mr. Fu, thanks for your kindness.

770
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,140
On the way here,

771
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,980
I found an old belonging of you.

772
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,980
