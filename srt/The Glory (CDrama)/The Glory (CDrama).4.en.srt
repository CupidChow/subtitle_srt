=Episode 4=

3
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,920
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

4
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,510
I've never seen this hairpin before.

5
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,120
Is that so?

6
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,760
This hairpin is simple and elegant.

7
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,950
It resembles a swan goose.

8
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,240
But it matches

9
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,870
your innocent face

10
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,750
perfectly.

11
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,840
Or perhaps

12
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,800
a noble lady of the Capital

13
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,240
no longer fancy

14
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,470
such simple things?

15
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,960
Since it's lost by someone else,

16
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,520
I dare not claim it.

17
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,680
I'm afraid

18
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,680
it might cause trouble

19
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,590
and make me falsely accused.

20
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Please go easy on me.

21
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,520
What if

22
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,870
I won't?

23
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,870
I don't think I've offended you.

24
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,740
As the Vice Minister of the Judicial Review,

25
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,590
it is my duty to root out evil

26
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,750
and uphold justice.

27
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,680
I work according to the law,

28
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,800
but have offended

29
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,350
all the powerful figures in the city.

30
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,200
Miss Hanyan,

31
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,280
are you here at Qiumei Garden

32
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,150
in search of a suitor?

33
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,310
I am here by my parents' command.

34
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,960
When it comes to marriage,

35
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,000
I shall abide by the wishes of my elders.

36
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,360
Then I'll leave you be.

37
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,400
As for this hairpin,

38
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,430
if Miss Hanyan insists on not accepting it,

39
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,400
I'll have to take it back

40
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,630
and submit it.

41
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,640
Wait.

42
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,630
Have you changed your mind?

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,120
Given your kind gesture,

44
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,190
it would be impolite of me to refuse.

45
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,630
What if I decide not to give it away?

46
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,190
Wish you find a good match soon.

47
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
I'll take my leave.

48
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,780
(Qiumei Garden)

49
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,920
Hanyan,

50
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,830
truly brave, aren't you?

51
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,160
You dare to provoke Fu Yunxi?

52
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,540
Indeed.

53
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,480
I'll return home to inform father.

54
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,120
Let's see how he reprimands you.

55
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,000
What do you want to report, Yuchi?

56
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,390
Fu Yunxi

57
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,270
is now at the center of the storm.

58
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,270
The Zuohang Gang case

59
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,040
claimed the lives of numerous officials,

60
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,360
and no one dares go near him.

61
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,250
How dare you get involved with him?

62
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,830
Don't say I didn't warn you.

63
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,750
Now, officials, merchants,

64
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,640
and outlaws in the Capital all want him dead.

65
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,750
He's survived many assassination attempts.

66
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,310
If it weren't for his skills,

67
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,360
he would've met his demise long ago.

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,800
If you don't want to be a widow,

69
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,190
you'd better stop thinking about him.

70
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,070
Assassination?

71
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,040
Figure it out yourself.

72
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,350
Go.

73
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,040
Think it through carefully.

74
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,870
(Fu Yunxi has been missing for days.)

75
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,680
(He unexpectedly went to Danzhou.)

76
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,120
(I don't know how he found this hairpin.)

77
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,600
(Nor do I understand)

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,430
(why he's so invested in this case,)

79
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,160
(traveling miles to reinvestigate it.)

80
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,120
(He never mentioned the case,)

81
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
(but his gaze is as sharp as a blade.)

82
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,360
(Not sure what he's plotting.)

83
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,300
(Masterful and Confident)

84
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,430
(After returning,)

85
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,630
(I waited for a long time.)

86
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,000
(But he never responded again.)

87
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,270
(Also because of this,)

88
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,920
(I felt even more uneasy.)

89
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,110
How's it going?

90
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,750
He has held office for years.

91
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,830
Before the Zuohang Gang Case,

92
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,480
he was already notorious.

93
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,100
He navigates the light and the dark,

94
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,240
wielding the hidden scandals

95
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,070
of aristocrats and officials.

96
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
He used these hidden secrets

97
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,480
to bind and balance others

98
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,950
and to protect himself.

99
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,190
Has he faced assassination attempts?

100
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,470
Six times.

101
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,310
Kill him.

102
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,190
Don't act rashly.

103
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,790
I know what to do.

104
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,560
Wait.

105
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,320
Don't hesitate.

106
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,100
(The Court of Judicial Review)

107
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,760
- Go.
- Go.

108
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,510
- While he's alive,
- I'm innocent.

109
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,800
finalize his confession,

110
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,950
- get his fingerprint and submit it.
- Sir.

111
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,790
Yes, sir.

112
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,160
- Send the case file of the Danzhou
- Sir, I'm innocent.

113
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,360
bandit case to my office.

114
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,470
Sir.

115
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,160
Why are you so concerned

116
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,560
about the Danzhou bandit case?

117
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,950
Just took a casual look.

118
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,950
In the Zuohang Gang case,

119
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,990
though we already know

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,430
Pei Dafu has an adopted son

121
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,310
who hid a large sum in the Capital.

122
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,720
We have no leads or clues to trace it.

123
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,000
If you have time,

124
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,800
why don't you think more about this?

125
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,230
Fine.

126
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,560
It's getting late.

127
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,480
Let's rest for today

128
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,440
and discuss it tomorrow.

129
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,790
Yes, sir.

130
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Please wait.

131
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,600
Sir, would you like some tanghulu?

132
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,920
I'll take two, please.

133
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,790
Alright.

134
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,350
Sorry.

135
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,360
Thank you, sir.

136
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,550
Who is there?

137
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,750
Why are you hiding?

138
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,300
(Fu Residence)

139
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,270
Hanyan, are you awake?

140
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,550
Father.

141
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,870
It's cold outside. Please come in.

142
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,750
Don't bother.

143
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,510
Hanyan,

144
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,320
I just came to ask

145
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,080
how was your visit to Qiumei Garden?

146
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,120
Did Yushan and Yuchi tell you anything?

147
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,510
They are just in fear

148
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,550
that you may have been mistreated.

149
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,200
Father, rest assured.

150
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,080
Mr. Fu was out on official business,

151
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,320
passing through Qiumei Garden

152
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,200
when he happened to find my hairpin.

153
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,510
That was the only reason we spoke.

154
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,550
You understand proper etiquette.

155
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,630
I'm reassured.

156
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,120
But…

157
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,750
Please tell me what's on your mind.

158
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,910
I'm listening, Father.

159
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,320
You are my unmarried, legitimate daughter.

160
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,750
I won't have your reputation ruined

161
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,790
by rumors.

162
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,440
What rumors?

163
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,270
Some gossipers say

164
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,390
Miss Hanyan of the Zhuang family

165
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,750
wants to help her sister

166
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,030
to be Fu's successor wife.

167
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,870
Bunch of nonsense.

168
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,480
Don't take it to heart.

169
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,000
Successor wife?

170
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,080
You have a child betrothal
with the Fu Family.

171
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,670
Are you aware of this?

172
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,030
I've heard a little.

173
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,440
Fu Pingsheng, Fu Yunxi's father,

174
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,960
worked at the Ministry of Personnel.

175
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,000
We are somewhat of fellow townsmen

176
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,670
and have been close for long.

177
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,070
So, we arranged a child betrothal.

178
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,390
But,

179
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,840
Pingsheng died young from illness.

180
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,670
He has already passed away?

181
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,320
It was last year.

182
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,600
I went to Danzhou.

183
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,390
So my sister married Fu instead.

184
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,320
In the second year after marrying,

185
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,550
your sister

186
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,080
passed away in the Fu Family.

187
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,270
This is a sorrow for both our families.

188
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,910
I ordered it never be mentioned again.

189
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,270
However,

190
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,910
I should've told you earlier.

191
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,360
I know about this.

192
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,790
Why did Yuqin pass away?

193
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,790
Poisoned.

194
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,480
Still an unsolved case.

195
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,510
It's just pitiful for Lingzhi.

196
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,630
Who is Lingzhi?

197
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,550
Yuqin and Yunxi have a daughter.

198
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,840
Her name is Fu Lingzhi.

199
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,200
She is already five this year.

200
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,360
When you returned from Danzhou and fainted,

201
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,000
the first to find you was Lingzhi.

202
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,080
Ma'am, are you cold?

203
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,200
That was her?

204
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,320
She is Fu Yunxi's daughter?

205
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,270
Lingzhi lost her mother since young,

206
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,790
and Fu Yunxi never remarried.

207
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,270
Now, the entire Fu Family

208
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,600
relies solely on Yunxi.

209
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,080
Hanyan, what's wrong?

210
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,320
I may have caught a chill

211
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,670
while out today.

212
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,670
You should get some rest.

213
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,120
I'll ask Shuhong
to prepare some herbal medicine.

214
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,960
Father, I appreciate it.

215
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:19,810
It's quite alright.

216
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,720
I just came

217
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,080
to remind you of a few things.

218
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,670
I'm glad you understand.

219
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,030
It's snowing outside. Don't catch a chill.

220
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,550
Get some rest.

221
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,680
Yes.

222
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,280
You…

223
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,440
You didn't succeed, did you?

224
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,510
His arm is injured.

225
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,000
He hid in his family residence.

226
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,790
So,

227
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,600
I secretly entered his mansion,

228
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,390
locked his room door.

229
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,440
And set a fire.

230
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,390
What?

231
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,360
You don't need to worry.

232
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,510
Tonight, the Fu Family will burn.

233
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,790
Tomorrow, the authority
will see it as an accident.

234
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,840
Where are you going?

235
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,580
(Fu Residence)
Hurry up!

236
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,440
Keep up.

237
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,040
Quick.

238
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,390
Move aside.

239
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,150
- Fetch more water.
- Hurry!

240
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,110
Take this.

241
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,380
(Xu's Stir-Fried Liver)

242
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,870
Hurry.

243
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,470
Place it here.

244
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,110
Come inside.

245
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,180
(Fu Residence)

246
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,040
Hurry.

247
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,770
This way. There's more inside.

248
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,830
Quickly. Move this.

249
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,670
Faster.

250
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,250
Madam, please be careful.

251
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,830
- Madam.
- Be careful.

252
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,830
- Madam.
- Sister.

253
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,030
(Lady Qiu, Head of the Fu Household)
My painting

254
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,200
is still inside.

255
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,920
We almost got killed.
Forget the painting.

256
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,670
- Madam, hear me out.
- I have to go get it.

257
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,960
(Aunt Kou, Fu's Aunt)
My ledger.

258
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,480
I forgot my ledger.

259
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,590
Hurry! Put it out! Quick!

260
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,740
(Fu Residence)

261
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,590
More water.

262
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,830
Father

263
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,680
- My wooden horse is gone.
- More water.

264
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,350
- I'll make you a new one.
- Hurry up.

265
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,190
Is that okay?

266
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,750
A deal's a deal.

267
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,960
And my tanghulu, too.

268
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,280
I promise.

269
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,350
Water.

270
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,080
Coming.

271
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,010
I need water here.

272
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,870
- Quick!
- This way.

273
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,760
More.

274
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,550
Fu Yunxi's wife passed away,

275
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,270
leaving a daughter behind.

276
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,550
You didn't find this?

277
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,720
I did.

278
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,920
Why didn't you tell me?

279
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,070
It's a family matter.

280
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,020
What does it have to do with killing him?

281
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,480
Of course, it does.

282
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,440
Did I do something wrong?

283
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,880
You did nothing wrong.

284
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,640
It's my fault.

285
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,280
Why?

286
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,960
Sister, light some fireworks.

287
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,790
- So beautiful.
- Sister.

288
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,200
Save this for Mother later.

289
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,640
Sister, wait for me.

290
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,760
Chai Jing,

291
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,750
you are an orphan.

292
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,640
Although I have both parents,

293
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,960
I consider myself half an orphan.

294
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,030
The child is innocent.

295
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,590
No matter what,

296
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,350
we must not let the world

297
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,640
have one more unfortunate girl.

298
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,920
However,

299
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,680
we have angered him,

300
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,590
I'm afraid
you cannot stay in the Capital long.

301
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,960
At dawn, once the gates open,

302
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,400
leave the capital and hide.

303
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,100
(Seclusion Zhuang Residence)

304
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,920
These are all of my possessions.

305
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,070
Keep them safe.

306
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,950
What about you?

307
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,200
You leave the city to stay low.

308
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,040
Don't worry about me.

309
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,830
Zhuang Hanyan.

310
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,800
Father wants you to go have breakfast.

311
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,800
Let's go.

312
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,550
I caught a cold yesterday.

313
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,160
I'll pass,

314
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,440
so I won't spread it to others.

315
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,880
You're always floppy.

316
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,920
Mr. Fu is here

317
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,440
and he wants to see you.

318
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,550
He said, "Why isn't Miss Hanyan here?"

319
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,400
If you don't go,

320
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,200
he'd assume we're mistreating you

321
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,070
and making you starve.

322
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,200
Why did he come?

323
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,150
No idea.

324
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,400
Come on.

325
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,440
Stop dawdling. Hurry.

326
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,790
Wealth is not everything.

327
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,550
Safety is our greatest fortune.

328
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,590
You're right, Father-in-law.

329
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,750
Father, she's here.

330
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
Hanyan,

331
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,480
sit down.

332
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,000
Greetings, Father.

333
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,920
Greetings, Mr. Fu.

334
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,400
No need to be so formal.

335
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,880
You probably slept soundly last night

336
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,830
and haven't heard

337
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,400
my residence caught fire.

338
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,200
The whole place was burned down.

339
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,270
Are you alright?

340
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,160
Thankfully, everyone in the family is safe.

341
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,310
Only the houses were burned.

342
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,270
Repairs will take some time.

343
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,590
You are blessed.

344
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,160
Let's eat.

345
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,440
I came unannounced today

346
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,750
because I have a favor to ask,

347
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,510
Father-in-law.

348
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,400
Certainly.

349
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,720
If there's anything you need,

350
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,160
we will do our utmost to help.

351
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,790
This morning,

352
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,790
my mother moved to my official residence.

353
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,070
But Lingzhi is still young,

354
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,920
and living outside would be inconvenient.

355
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,790
With no relatives in the Capital,

356
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,750
we hope to stay at your side courtyard briefly.

357
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,590
You don't have to agree

358
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,550
if it's inconvenient.

359
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,310
Not at all.

360
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,880
The year-end is approaching.

361
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,880
Wouldn't it be nice for our families

362
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,140
to celebrate New Year together?

363
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,720
What do you think?

364
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,680
That's right.

365
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,880
As a grandfather,

366
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,790
I often think about Lingzhi.

367
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,600
Even if you decide to stay permanently,

368
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,270
I would be more than delighted.

369
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,440
From today, I'll have to trouble you.

370
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,270
What are you talking about?

371
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,110
Make yourself at home.

372
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,640
I am busy with official duties,

373
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,160
and the Mu brothers

374
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,510
will come frequently.

375
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,160
Please understand, Father-in-law.

376
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,590
Of course.

377
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,070
Make yourselves comfortable.

378
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,750
Our family has none of those formalities.

379
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,830
Yunxi,

380
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,510
I'll go tidy up Yuzhu Manor.

381
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,400
If you need something,

382
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,640
just let me know.

383
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,590
By the way,

384
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,640
where is Miss Hanyan staying now?

385
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,560
I…

386
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,350
I live at Ms. Zhou's Gongtong Chamber.

387
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,440
How far is it from Yuzhu Manor?

388
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,160
It's just across a wall.

389
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,160
That's good.

390
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,640
Mr. Fu, what are you…

391
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,830
The truth behind
the Danzhou case remains unclear.

392
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,310
Living closer to Miss Hanyan

393
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,590
makes it easier for me to inquire.

394
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,750
Thank you for your concern.

395
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,440
Youchang and his wife
have had a hard life.

396
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,750
And they were killed by the wicked.

397
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,960
I implore you to catch the real culprit.

398
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,820
Of course.

399
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,030
Once the culprit is caught,

400
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,880
we will sentence them to hanging.

401
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,310
I'll invite you all

402
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,270
to come and watch.

403
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,400
I'm done. Enjoy.

404
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,590
Yushan.

405
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,440
Wait, Yushan.

406
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,830
Go check her out.

407
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,000
Master, no need to worry.

408
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,510
It seems that Mr. Fu

409
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,070
truly cares for his daughter,

410
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,030
which is why he's here for help.

411
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,880
Our son-in-law is no ordinary man.

412
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,000
He's now making his move.

413
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,550
He's thought through every step.

414
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,640
Known for his cunning.

415
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,110
Today,

416
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,720
he does seem a bit odd.

417
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,880
Yushan is not giving us peace.

418
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,550
Her marriage has been delayed for years.

419
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,920
She's determined to marry Fu

420
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
to be his successor wife.

421
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,200
Fu is her brother-in-law,

422
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,550
yet she has set her sights on him.

423
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,510
Look at her appearance today.

424
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,510
Arrogant, rude, and jealous.

425
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,750
How ridiculous.

426
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,310
You're right.

427
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,790
I will discipline Yushan.

428
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,340
But,

429
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,400
the way Mr. Fu look at Hanyan

430
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,680
is indeed somewhat strange.

431
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,920
The Capital is filled
with tension these days.

432
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,310
Now, we have them living here.

433
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,090
I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse.

434
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,030
What have you done?

435
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,880
I asked you to add some charcoal.

436
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,580
Are you trying to burn down the house?

437
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,080
- I'm sorry.
- Get out.

438
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,440
Go out and find a cooler spot.

439
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Kneel there.

440
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,850
I was too slow, only realizing

441
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,350
why Yushan opposes my every move

442
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,400
and even threatened me

443
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,880
to stay away from Mr. Fu.

444
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,110
Turns out she feared
I'd take away what she loves.

445
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,030
Miss Yushan has admired Mr. Fu
since childhood.

446
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,750
That year, Master decided

447
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,680
to marry Miss Yuqin to the Fu Family.

448
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,070
She had not yet reached 15.

449
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,040
Yet she caused a great disturbance.

450
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,680
Then she should thank Father.

451
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,350
Or she'd die from poison

452
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,350
at the Fu's.

453
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,110
Miss, you know everything.

454
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,160
Father told me everything.

455
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,790
Yushan is determined to expel me.

456
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,510
Now it seems reasonable.

457
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,680
After all, this arranged marriage was mine.

458
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,680
Naturally, she can't tolerate me.

459
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,800
You can leave now.

460
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,160
I'll call you if needed.

461
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,910
Yes.

462
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,350
Should I still leave?

463
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,240
Though he threatened me a bit,

464
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,590
we didn't sever relations.

465
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,750
Now, I wonder

466
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,680
what he's after.

467
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,550
Now, it's within close reach.

468
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,920
I could go kill him again.

469
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,760
No.

470
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,160
He intentionally lives

471
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,960
in the side courtyard nearby.

472
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,110
Perhaps it's to warn me.

473
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,790
If he dies mysteriously here,

474
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,440
it must involve me.

475
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,110
So, what's the next step?

476
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,880
Wait and see.

477
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,030
He will act again.

478
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,880
Miss Hanyan, Mr. Fu wants to see you.

479
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,030
Find yourself a safe place to stay

480
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,070
and wait for my word.

481
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,110
Got it.

482
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,980
(Awareness and Restraint)

483
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,670
What does he want me to do?

484
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,510
I have no idea.

485
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,310
I can go by myself.

486
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,910
Yes.

487
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,680
Little Horse, look.

488
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,310
Father, you're awesome.

489
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,110
You can build a new
wooden horse with one hand.

490
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,030
I have official duties today.

491
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,680
We can only finish after returning tonight.

492
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,680
Take your time.

493
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,400
Go to catch criminals first.

494
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,590
Good girl.

495
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,510
Lingzhi, look who's here.

496
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,880
Greetings, ma'am.

497
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,110
Are you here to play with me?

498
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,440
Of course.

499
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,550
Come and take a look.

500
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,070
Father made me a new wooden horse.

501
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,310
Isn't it beautiful?

502
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,910
It is.

503
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,880
But not as beautiful as Lingzhi.

504
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,110
She ate too much Laba Porridge
for lunch.

505
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,920
She can eat less in the evening.

506
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,830
I attend the Judicial Review daily for work.

507
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,550
I've no time for her.

508
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,720
From today, you will take care of Lingzhi.

509
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,240
Why?

510
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,920
Don't you want to play with me?

511
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,080
I do.

512
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,880
I like you a lot.

513
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,440
Then Lingzhi can be at ease.

514
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,840
Lingzhi.

515
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,720
I have to go now.

516
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,790
Remember to listen to Aunt Hanyan.

517
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,350
I will come back tonight to get you.

518
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,240
I'll be good.

519
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,830
Goodbye, Father.

520
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,670
Go play now.

521
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,000
Little wooden horse.

522
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,590
Please take good care of her.

523
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,480
Otherwise, you know the consequences.

524
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,880
Why me?

525
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,400
You're gentle, virtuous, and obedient.

526
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,240
If not you, then who?

527
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,860
(Zhuang Residence)

528
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,550
Once the kite is ready,

529
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,880
let Father take us to fly kites together.

530
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,400
Is that okay, sister?

531
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,480
Sure.

532
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,720
Lingzhi.

533
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,240
Actually, you should call me aunt.

534
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,640
But I have an aunt.

535
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,510
Her name is Aunt Yushan.

536
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,750
I'm Aunt Hanyan.

537
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,030
Aunt Hanyan?

538
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,160
So you're also my mother's sister.

539
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,240
Yes.

540
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,750
Lingzhi is really smart.

541
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,590
Lingzhi,

542
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,160
why are you here?

543
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,030
Where's your father?

544
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,440
Aunt Yushan,

545
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,350
my father has gone to the Judicial Review.

546
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,840
Lingzhi,

547
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
would you like to go out and play with me?

548
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,270
I'll take you horse riding
and teach you archery

549
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,480
at the training ground.

550
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,330
No.

551
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,440
Father wants me with Sister Hanyan.

552
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,640
I can't just wander away.

553
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,150
Sister?

554
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,920
You're so cunning.

555
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,240
Even trying to be a stepmother.

556
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,670
Yushan,

557
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,310
Lingzhi is still here.

558
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,030
Please watch your words.

559
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,270
You're the one scolding me?

560
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,480
Lingzhi, let's go.

561
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,030
Such an ugly kite.

562
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,110
Lingzhi, I'll buy you some tanghulu.

563
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,480
- Go.
- I don't want to.

564
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,960
Aunt Yushan, I don't want to.

565
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,800
Come on, let's go.

566
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,200
- Come with me.
- No.

567
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,400
Aunt Yushan, I don't want to.

568
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,270
Come with Aunt Yushan.

569
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,120
Lingzhi.

570
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,510
What are you doing?

571
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,900
(Masterful and Confident)

572
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,000
Zhuang Hanyan,

573
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,070
you're even making a move now.

574
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,790
I'll go tell Father now.

575
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,510
Yushan, listen to me.

576
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,030
I've no intention of competing with you,

577
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,000
nor of raising his daughter.

578
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,070
I have no feelings for him whatsoever.

579
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,160
You don't need to make things hard for me.

580
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,390
I…

581
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,440
It has nothing to do with Yunxi.

582
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,190
We are both women.

583
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,840
No need to hide it like this.

584
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,550
What do I need to hide?

585
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,070
I simply can't stand you.

586
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,600
Cuiyun,

587
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,840
open the window in Miss Hanyan's room.

588
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,190
I really want to see

589
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,150
if Lingzhi's attentive and considerate.

590
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,280
Yes.

591
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,880
I'll remove the charcoal, too.

592
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,400
Miss Hanyan.

593
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,840
Yushan,

594
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,550
Lingzhi was personally entrusted
to me by Fu Yunxi.

595
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,030
He asked me to protect her.

596
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,400
If you insist on this,

597
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,030
I won't tolerate your recklessness

598
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,320
like I did last time.

599
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,070
Think about it yourself.

600
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,030
If Lingzhi catches a cold,

601
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:43,400
will Fu Yunxi blame you?

602
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,480
Don't think a few words can frighten me.

603
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,400
Please try to understand.

604
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,280
I don't intend to cause trouble.

605
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,440
But today, I can't entrust Lingzhi to you.

606
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,760
Wait until Fu Yunxi returns,

607
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,280
feel free to come

608
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,480
and say you wish to take care for Lingzhi.

609
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,880
I'd actually appreciate the peace.

610
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,280
Is that acceptable?

611
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,710
Let go of her.

612
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
A bunch of losers.

613
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,360
Lingzhi, don't be sad.

614
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,280
We can make a more beautiful one.

615
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,400
Alright.

616
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,510
Adults are strange.

617
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:42,070
Good things, yet you destroy them.

618
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,800
What's that supposed to mean?

619
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,880
Aunt Yushan doesn't like this kite,

620
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,670
so she crushes it.

621
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,280
Father dislikes our house.

622
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,630
He wants to burn them all down.

623
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,550
Your house was burned by your father?

624
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,320
Not exactly.

625
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,070
Father said a candle fell.

626
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,670
That's how it started.

627
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,440
But when a room first caught fire,

628
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,630
Grandmother wanted
to call the Firefighting Team.

629
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,230
She said a few buckets of water
could extinguish it.

630
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,880
But Father stopped Grandmother.

631
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,510
Why is your father stopping her?

632
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,630
I have no idea about that.

633
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,110
I was half asleep.

634
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,800
I only heard my father say,

635
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,070
"Since it started burning,

636
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,280
might as well burn it down completely."

637
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,670
He even added more fuel.

638
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,150
Aunt Hanyan,

639
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,480
what's wrong with you?

640
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
Aunt Hanyan?

641
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,010
Your father truly deserves his position

642
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,590
at such a young age.

643
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,230
Are you praising my father?

644
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,400
I'm not just praising him.

645
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,670
I'm also admiring him.

646
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,980
(The Court of Judicial Review)

647
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,900
(Mu Yan, Reviewer of the Judicial Review)

648
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,160
Sir.

649
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,060
(Study Room)

650
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,000
Why aren't you working?

651
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,400
What are you thinking about?

652
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,040
On our way back days ago,

653
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,630
we passed by Qiumei Garden.

654
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,030
When My Lord saw Zhuang's carriage
at the entrance,

655
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,550
he rushed inside in a hurry

656
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,410
and wouldn't let us take a look.

657
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,530
Once the Zuohang Gang case is resolved,

658
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,510
I will find a good wife for you.

659
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,630
Really?

660
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,320
Where do you plan to find her?

661
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,360
Do you know what I like?

662
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,470
I don't.

663
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,920
I will find someone for you
based on my standards.

664
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,270
What are your standards, Sir?

665
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,070
Diligent and frugal?

666
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,320
Virtuous and obedient?

667
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,960
Rather than being all that,

668
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,510
it's better

669
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,400
to be clear in grudges and bold in strategy.

670
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,960
Sir, have you lost your mind?

671
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,510
The Capital

672
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,480
devours the good and the kind.

673
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:19,670
If you don't want to be treated as prey,

674
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,110
be the one in control.

675
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,150
A virtuous woman
knows how to manage.

676
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,470
But a strong woman
can safeguard the family.

677
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,230
So it is in choosing a wife,

678
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,000
and so it is for men

679
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,280
navigating the court.

680
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,030
It's getting late.

681
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,440
Go home and think about it.

682
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,000
He made a fair point.

683
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,000
It's clearly a twisted one.

684
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,400
Think for yourself.

685
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,150
How did his former wife meet her end?

686
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,840
You…

687
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:18,920
Where's Lingzhi?

688
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,280
I tucked her in.

689
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,800
Thank you for today.

690
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,510
I will trouble you again tomorrow.

691
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,200
Wait.

692
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,120
What?

693
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,920
Is there anything else to say?

694
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,190
Lingzhi's mother.

695
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,590
How did my eldest sister die?

696
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,720
Poisoning.

697
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,190
Who poisoned her?

698
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,760
I only know the poison was meant for me.

699
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,280
She was innocent and implicated.

700
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,280
By accident, she drank the poisoned wine.

701
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,150
Thus, she died unjustly at home.

702
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,630
Why do the Capital's people
all want to kill you?

703
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,160
Well,

704
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,360
Miss Hanyan should know this very well.

705
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,230
Because I've uncovered

706
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,320
the secrets you dare not expose.

707
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,320
Yunxi.

708
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,090
Greetings, Miss Yushan.

709
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,480
Yunxi,

710
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,670
I watched Lingzhi grow up.

711
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,000
Why must you give her to Zhuang Hanyan?

712
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,280
Besides, she and Lingzhi have only met once.

713
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,230
You're a bit impatient.

714
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,230
- I…
– Miss Hanyan is more patient.

715
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,630
Are you interested in her?

716
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,230
It's getting late. I should return.

717
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,230
Miss Hanyan, thanks for today.

718
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,360
I'll bring Lingzhi over tomorrow.

719
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,550
Miss Hanyan, good night.

720
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,200
Yunxi.

721
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,860
(Masterful and Confident)

722
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,670
Zhuang Hanyan, what exactly do you want?

723
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,480
What do you mean?

724
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,230
Stop pretending.

725
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,480
Tell me honestly.

726
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,040
How did you worm your way into his head?

727
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,070
Your arranged marriage
has long been nullified.

728
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,760
Do you really want to marry him?

729
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,320
I don't understand what you're saying.

730
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,920
Don't think just because
you have a pretty face

731
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,760
and read a few books

732
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,480
in the countryside in Danzhou,

733
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,230
you can call the shots in the Capital.

734
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,280
I'm telling you, we're childhood sweethearts.

735
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,190
We grew up together.

736
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,280
You don't stand a chance.

737
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,000
Yushan, stop your nonsense.

738
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,920
Good night.

739
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,590
Wait. I'm not done yet.

740
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,630
Father.

741
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,480
Lingzhi awakens.

742
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,110
Why are you so happy?

743
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,630
What are you laughing about?

744
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,510
I found out

745
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,960
who burnt your wooden horse.

746
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,230
I got revenge for Lingzhi.

747
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,190
Who did it?

748
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,430
A secret.

749
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,230
(I can't figure it out)

750
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,880
(what Fu Yunxi's real motive is?)

751
