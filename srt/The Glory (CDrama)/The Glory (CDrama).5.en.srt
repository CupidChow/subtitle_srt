(Time-Honored Literature)

5
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,230
It's your treasure.

6
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,950
I can't accept it.

7
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,560
It's too valuable.

8
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,680
Mr. Zhuang, please don't refuse it.

9
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,550
(Endless Learning)
Please save us.

10
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,400
Mr. Fu is your son-in-law.

11
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,590
You share the bond of in-laws.

12
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,040
You can deliver a few words for us.

13
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,150
When the Zuohang Gang was at its peak,

14
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,750
those in power at court

15
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,150
had all granted Pei Dafu favors

16
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,750
or benefited from him.

17
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,080
Now that his gang has been

18
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,150
eradicated by Mr. Fu.

19
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,590
We might become his next targets.

20
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,360
- Yes.
- I'm willing to help if I can,

21
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,870
but I cannot say that to him.

22
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,840
Mr. Zhuang!

23
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,870
No, no, no!

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,080
I have an old mother and young children.

25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,120
My family will be executed
if he comes at me.

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,840
I cannot afford to take this risk.

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,190
- Mr. Zhuang!
- Mr. Zhuang!

28
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,150
No, no, no!

29
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,400
Mr. Zhuang, please save me!

30
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,080
This is too much for me to bear.

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,680
Mr. Zhuang, please save me!

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,750
Save me, Mr. Zhuang!

33
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,400
Everyone, please spare me.

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,840
I also have accepted benefits

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,240
from Director Pei.

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,870
Now, I cannot live in peace.

37
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,280
I'm struggling to save myself now.

38
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,750
What did you accept from him?

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,640
Yes.

40
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,910
It's just a painting.

41
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,190
This is an authentic piece by Li Hang
from the previous dynasty.

42
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,680
It is worth more than a thousand gold.

43
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,000
So valuable?

44
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,910
Since Mr. Pei was imprisoned,

45
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,120
my son-in-law has stirred up

46
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,310
one storm after another in the Capital.

47
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,430
Every time he steps into my house,

48
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,630
I feel as though the god of death

49
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,810
has come to claim me.

50
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
And now, he's moved
into the side chamber.

51
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,470
My heart is even more unsettled.

52
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,240
But after all,
it is just an old painting.

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
Compared to the Zuohang Gang's

54
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,560
boundless schemes,

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,680
perhaps no one will pay it any heed.

56
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,360
I cannot take this risk.

57
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,750
Our entire family

58
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,750
must not perish over a painting.

59
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,910
It's getting late.

60
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,840
Master, perhaps you should rest for now.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We can think of a solution tomorrow.

62
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,680
Ruyin, you go rest first.

63
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,000
Leave me alone for a while.

64
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,070
Yes, Master.

65
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,750
Why did he give you this painting?

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,510
I was an examiner during the provincial
exams in Shuntian that year.

67
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,310
Pei Dafu had a distant nephew,

68
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,160
so he asked me...

69
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,390
To tamper with the exam?

70
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,230
Yunxi,

71
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,360
I know this is a grave crime,

72
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,680
but for the sake of the late Yuqin,

73
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,560
(Jade and Bamboo)
please spare me this time.

74
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,240
All these years,
this has weighed on my heart.

75
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,600
Pei Dafu wielded power beyond measure.

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,950
Once he set his sights on me,

77
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,510
how could I have dared to refuse?

78
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,750
Please get up.

79
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,930
A father-in-law can't kneel
before his son-in-law.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,680
The Zuohang Gang has wreaked havoc
in the Capital for years.

81
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,600
This is but a drop in the ocean.

82
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,510
If we were to pursue everything,

83
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,310
the imperial prison
would be overflowing,

84
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,050
and the court
would have no officials left.

85
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,950
Then the Capital
would be turned upside down.

86
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,120
So, what you mean is...

87
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,830
You will let it go?

88
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,800
The Judicial Review
has pressing matters at hand.

89
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,750
There is no time for such trivialities.

90
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,950
Pei's loyalists have been eradicated.

91
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,190
What's there left to be pursued?

92
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,800
Sorry for asking that.

93
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,350
It must be a state secret.

94
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,750
I can't make it hard for you.

95
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,590
No need to tell me.

96
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,160
It's nothing.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,510
Pei Dafu amassed wealth
for years in the Capital.

98
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,950
He should've had
an immeasurable fortune.

99
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,630
But when the Judicial Review
audited his assets,

100
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,240
he was found to be utterly destitute,

101
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,030
even poorer
than an incorruptible official.

102
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,880
There must be
something fishy about this.

103
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,920
We are now doing everything we can

104
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,200
to track down the vast fortune
he has hidden away.

105
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,040
Thank goodness.

106
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,120
I have served
in the Hanlin Academy for years.

107
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,870
I am but a Junior Compiler.

108
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,940
Such grand affairs

109
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,390
have nothing to do with me whatsoever.

110
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,000
Mr. Zhuang, keep the painting.

111
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,150
No, no, no!

112
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,120
This burns my hands by just holding it.

113
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,600
Yunxi, it'd be best
if you keep it for now.

114
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,160
If anything goes wrong in the future,

115
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,310
at least there will be room to maneuver.

116
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,480
Would that be all right?

117
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,790
Very well.

118
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,830
Thank you.

119
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,040
Then, I won't disturb you any further.

120
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,160
Mr. Zhuang, take care.

121
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,780
Yunxi, no need to see me out.

122
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,950
No need to see me out.

123
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,950
Will you come out on your own,

124
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,730
or shall I go and catch you myself?

125
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,520
Miss Hanyan.

126
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,680
Miss Hanyan, you visit so late at night.

127
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,750
Is there something urgent?

128
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,040
The Judicial Review is busy.

129
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,600
Why did you travel
all the way to Danzhou?

130
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,750
Why don't you take a guess?

131
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,190
I've heard that you're wise
and resourceful.

132
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,120
You'd never act without reason.

133
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,120
Unless in this trip to Danzhou,

134
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,270
the bandit murder case
was merely a cover.

135
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,270
You actually went to investigate
Pei Dafu's secret fortune.

136
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,430
You heard everything.

137
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,270
Then what?

138
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,240
As this was of great importance,

139
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,560
and you were watched in the Capital,

140
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,830
you chose to create a diversion.

141
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,190
What makes you think

142
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,480
Pei Dafu's hidden wealth
is connected to Danzhou?

143
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,600
Danzhou has many ports,

144
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,920
with abundant ships and merchants,

145
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,070
and it is far
from the Capital's supervision.

146
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,630
If I had

147
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,560
an enormous fortune of unclear origins,

148
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,390
circulating it around Danzhou

149
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,120
would be a good method.

150
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,510
Miss Hanyan, how insightful.

151
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,630
It must be thanks to the teachings

152
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,800
of your foster father in Danzhou.

153
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,600
I only want to know

154
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,000
what exactly you are up to.

155
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,270
The day we first met,

156
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,870
you told me a story

157
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,440
about how your foster parents in Danzhou
were kind and gentle,

158
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,480
how you grew up there,

159
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,200
and how carefree,
happy, and safe it was.

160
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,270
During my trip to Danzhou,

161
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,390
I did hear quite a few
interesting things.

162
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,870
Tonight,

163
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,790
why don't I tell you a story as well?

164
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,600
Don't beat around the bushes.

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,320
17 years ago, there was a carriage

166
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,670
that carried a baby girl

167
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,000
from the Capital to Danzhou.

168
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,840
(Zhuang)
She was born a lady in the Capital

169
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,240
but was branded a ghost and cast out,

170
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,150
and sent to a friend's home in Danzhou.

171
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,550
Cakes and money were sent
from the Capital from time to time,

172
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,360
but they never reached her hands.

173
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,530
Her foster mother was a crude
and vulgar woman,

174
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,240
constantly hurling insults,

175
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,440
beating and cursing her.

176
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,390
But compared to her,

177
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,440
the man of the house
was even more terrifying.

178
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,750
Her foster father was a deranged scholar,

179
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,720
who had repeatedly failed
in the imperial exams.

180
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,910
He studied day and night like a madman,

181
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,480
forcing the girl to memorize
his convoluted parallel prose

182
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,630
word for word.

183
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,840
If she got a word wrong,
she was not allowed to sleep

184
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,340
or eat.

185
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,360
She suffered endlessly in that home.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,310
In the small fishing village,

187
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,910
- she was also bullied.
- Let go of me!

188
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,720
Everyone called her the barefoot ghost.

189
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,480
The kids often played cruel pranks,

190
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,390
pushing her to the ground,

191
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,600
stealing her shoes and socks,

192
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,000
and forcing her to walk barefoot.

193
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,080
Over 17 years, she accumulated

194
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,150
deep hatred for that couple.

195
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,390
She grew up day by day

196
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,550
and finally

197
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
gained the strength to fight back,

198
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,120
so at last, she killed her tormentors

199
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,440
and fled from Danzhou
back to the Capital.

200
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,080
One story is
about the bandits' massacre.

201
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,270
One is about an adopted
daughter's revenge.

202
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,120
Miss Hanyan,

203
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,630
which story is true?

204
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,000
I wonder where you

205
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,200
heard such bizarre rumors.

206
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,670
How would I know which is true?

207
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,960
It's getting late.

208
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,200
You should rest early.

209
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,840
I take my leave.

210
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,960
Mr. Fu, please behave yourself.

211
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,700
Since you don't know the truth,

212
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,510
then where did these scars come from?

213
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,510
Miss Yushan.

214
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,320
- Step aside.
- Wait.

215
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,350
Let go of me.

216
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,360
Fu Yunxi,

217
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,060
what exactly are you trying to do?

218
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,440
Even if I have made countless mistakes,

219
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,640
you were the one who ruined your home
and moved into our residence.

220
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,170
You knew Zhuang Yushan
had admired you since childhood,

221
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,270
yet you still provoked her jealousy,

222
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,550
making her give me a hard time.

223
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,960
What exactly are you up to?

224
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,270
If you want to capture me,

225
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
then present all your suspicions

226
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,870
and evidence to the Judicial Review,

227
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,240
instead of toying with me
again and again.

228
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,150
What I want to tell you is

229
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,670
your lies are flimsy.

230
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,320
Anyone could verify them

231
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,630
and push you into a dead end.

232
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,080
I hope you remember

233
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,080
that a skillful deceiver

234
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,480
doesn't rely on lies.

235
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,160
My Lord,

236
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,440
before you left for Danzhou,

237
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,600
you instructed me

238
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,750
that if I saw the name
Taoist Master Duan

239
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,960
on the city entry records,

240
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,720
I was to place a note inside a candle

241
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,410
and deliver it to Miss Hanyan's chamber.

242
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,540
Do you remember this?

243
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,120
You handled it well.

244
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,000
Then why didn't you tell Miss Hanyan

245
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,080
that you went to such lengths for her?

246
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,630
If I said it outright,

247
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,750
it'd seem like I was seeking credit.

248
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,420
No need to mention it.

249
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,700
But how did you predict

250
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,420
that the Taoist
would come to the Capital?

251
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,390
Every scheme and strategy
follows human nature.

252
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,390
If someone wanted to harm her,

253
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,200
they would naturally target
her greatest weakness.

254
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,320
You wanted to help her,

255
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,080
yet you instructed me to do that.

256
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,120
Why not make the message clear?

257
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,910
If she is smart enough,

258
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,440
she will understand.

259
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,960
If she cannot decipher this little clue,

260
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,600
then there is no need to help her,

261
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,550
for she is doomed either way.

262
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,510
Miss Hanyan is truly extraordinary.

263
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,480
She even managed to deduce

264
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,000
your investigation into Pei Dafu's

265
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,720
hidden fortune in Danzhou.

266
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,670
I'm also a bit surprised

267
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,510
that she managed to think of that.

268
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,710
By the way, My Lord,

269
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,670
the news of Pei Dafu's adopted son
has spread in the Capital.

270
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,780
Should we report
the progress of the investigation

271
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,720
to the Judicial Review?

272
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,720
Do we have to report it?

273
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,670
What do you mean by that?

274
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,440
If we find that adopted son

275
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,240
and that fortune,

276
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,360
you and Mu Feng will each have 20%,

277
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,990
and the remaining 60% will be mine.

278
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,440
What do you think?

279
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,800
My Lord,

280
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,960
are you serious?

281
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,630
Of course.

282
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,280
My Lord,

283
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,630
I've followed you for years.

284
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,080
I know you are not one to covet wealth.

285
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,140
But I must make plans
for Lingzhi's future.

286
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,920
My Lord,

287
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,550
you want to find a woman with the means

288
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,380
to protect your family
and to secretly keep

289
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,670
the enormous fortune

290
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,480
of the Zuohang Gang...

291
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,110
Did something

292
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,910
go wrong?

293
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,440
Forget what I just said.

294
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,910
It's getting late. Go and rest.

295
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,600
Yes, My Lord.

296
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,120
How clever of her.

297
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,440
She keeps saying
she has no interest in Fu Yunxi

298
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,840
but secretly meets with him
in the dead of night,

299
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,320
and they're involved
in some intimate actions.

300
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,240
Miss Yushan, please rest early.

301
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,080
Cuiyun,

302
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,080
go to Nanshan Clinic
early tomorrow morning.

303
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,910
Nanshan Clinic?

304
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,120
I heard they've been treating

305
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,630
several smallpox patients,

306
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,910
and the clinic has been
sealed off for days.

307
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,120
Go to find a pillow for me,

308
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,510
one used by a smallpox patient.

309
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,590
This...

310
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,080
Miss Yushan, this...

311
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,870
Smallpox is very dangerous.

312
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,780
Once contracted,
it's difficult to treat.

313
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,200
Even if one recovers,

314
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,360
their skin and appearance
will be left scarred.

315
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,150
I don't believe

316
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,440
Fu Yunxi will still be interested
in her then.

317
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,480
Miss Yushan, this...

318
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,670
What? You're not willing to help me?

319
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,350
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

320
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What happened?

321
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,270
Your pillow has been tampered with.

322
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,960
I've checked.

323
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,790
That pillow was obtained
from Nanshan Clinic.

324
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,450
It was used by a smallpox patient.

325
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,750
Smallpox?

326
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,750
Was it Zhuang Yushan?

327
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,310
It was her personal maid.

328
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,400
Such a small trick.

329
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,270
What should we do?

330
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,200
Burn the bedding.

331
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,270
Then go to Nanshan Clinic

332
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,480
and bring back some scabs
from smallpox patients.

333
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,720
Scabs?

334
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,680
Go handle it. We'll talk later.

335
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,910
Sure.

336
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,150
(Yongshou Chamber)

337
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,640
May Grandmother's wishes be fulfilled

338
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,920
just like this jade bracelet.

339
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,550
Thank you, Yuchi.

340
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,560
How nice.

341
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,880
I'm glad you like it.

342
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,960
Of course, I do.

343
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,270
A while ago, I heard Baochan say

344
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,480
that Grandmother wanted
to make a fox fur cloak

345
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,270
but was afraid of wasting money.

346
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,680
I saved up for half a year

347
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,680
and chose high-quality leather

348
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,790
for you.

349
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,240
Please take a look, Grandmother.

350
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,480
How can I accept this?

351
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,270
I'm old now.

352
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,830
Something that can keep warm is fine.

353
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,750
Why would I need a fox fur cloak?

354
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,880
Baochan,

355
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,880
I just mentioned it casually.

356
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,640
How could you tell her?

357
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,960
Grandmother, please accept it.

358
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,070
It was custom-made to fit your size.

359
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,200
It can't be returned.

360
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,310
Look at her.

361
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,550
Please accept it, Grandmother.

362
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,050
- It's Yushan's kind gesture.
- Sure.

363
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,250
- I like it.
- Do you like it?

364
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,590
This leather is nice.

365
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,440
- Right?
- The craftsmanship is good.

366
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,110
The pattern suits you well.

367
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,200
Greetings, Grandmother.

368
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,950
Hanyan,

369
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,830
why are you empty-handed?

370
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,070
This is my first time home
for the Chinese New Year,

371
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,680
and I don't know the customs.

372
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,240
Are we supposed to present
a gift to Grandmother?

373
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,590
It's fine.

374
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,440
I know you wish me well.

375
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,750
Grandmother, please forgive me.

376
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,480
I'll prepare a gift

377
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,920
for you another day.

378
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,760
Sure.

379
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,590
You must've spent a lot.

380
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Yes, I've been saving for half a year.

381
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
It's really beautiful.

382
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,680
This leather is excellent.

383
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,630
Right.

384
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,750
I've never seen
such a beautiful cloak before.

385
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,270
Hanyan, what do you mean?

386
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,510
I don't have warm clothing for winter.

387
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,110
Grandmother,
why not give this cloak to me?

388
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,240
How shameless.

389
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,260
You came empty-handed
and asked for a reward?

390
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,340
Grandmother, look at her.

391
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,640
Zhuang Hanyan, have you lost your mind?

392
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,110
This cloak was custom-made
for Grandmother.

393
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,350
How can you compete for it?

394
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,190
Take it off.

395
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,320
Grandmother,

396
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,790
this is the first time
I asked for something from you.

397
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,680
Please just let me have it.

398
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,350
Stop pretending to be cute.

399
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,720
No one here will fall for that.

400
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,750
Take it off now.

401
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,350
Take it off!

402
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,920
- Please give me.
- Yushan saved up...

403
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,510
- Look at her.
- It's for Grandmother.

404
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,640
- Enough, stop arguing.
- Grandmother...

405
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,000
You're giving me a headache.

406
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,960
Since Hanyan likes it so much,

407
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,310
just give it to her.

408
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,640
Grandmother...

409
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,240
Alright, everyone go back.

410
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,720
Thank you, Grandmother.

411
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,160
Grandmother...

412
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,800
Go back now.

413
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,750
I saved up for half a year.

414
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,720
Alright, go back.

415
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,350
Thankfully, she didn't see the bracelet.

416
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,350
These are smallpox scabs?

417
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,840
What do you plan to do with it?

418
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,310
I've heard of a method

419
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,880
called "nasal inoculation",

420
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,510
where the smallpox scabs
are ground into powder

421
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,750
and blown into the nostrils.

422
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,720
This way, the infection is mild,

423
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,270
and it won't be life-threatening.

424
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,000
After inoculation,
one will become immune to smallpox.

425
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,840
Why?

426
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,550
Last night, someone said something to me

427
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,310
that made some sense.

428
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,680
He said that a skillful deceiver

429
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,070
didn't rely on lies.

430
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,310
You're going to play along?

431
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,790
Since she wants to harm me,

432
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,680
I'll let her succeed.

433
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,720
Please help me with one more thing.

434
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,560
Sure.

435
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,720
Go to Nanshan Clinic again.

436
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,640
Since the smallpox patients' pillows
can be taken away,

437
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,400
someone inside the clinic
must be helping her.

438
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,000
Since Yushan didn't leave me a way out,

439
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,680
I wouldn't hold back anymore.

440
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,270
Hanyan is always well-mannered.

441
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,590
How could she act like this?

442
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,790
She was raised in the countryside
of Danzhou.

443
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,350
I don't have to have the fox fur cloak.

444
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,240
But if a girl behaves like this,

445
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,880
she could be a laughingstock
after she gets married.

446
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,510
There's some time before the festival.

447
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,830
I'll make you another one.

448
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,480
Master, Ma'am,

449
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,750
it seems that Miss Hanyan is ill.

450
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
Again?

451
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,680
Did she catch a cold again?

452
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,110
I didn't dare approach,

453
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,930
but it looked like smallpox.

454
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,070
Master, Ma'am,

455
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,480
Physician Wu from Nanshan Clinic
requests an audience.

456
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,910
What does he want?

457
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,920
He insists that someone

458
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,830
in our household
has contracted smallpox.

459
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,590
He's here to examine and treat them.

460
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,790
I didn't dare let him in.

461
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,070
Did the Gongtong Chamber invite him?

462
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,350
I didn't know about this.

463
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,070
Never mind.

464
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,680
Invite Physician Wu in.

465
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,510
(Gongtong Chamber)

466
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:02,410
(Masterful and Confident)

467
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,960
Why is Miss Hanyan always sick?

468
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:13,450
(Awareness and Restraint)

469
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,240
Master, Physician Wu has arrived.

470
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,160
Physician Wu,

471
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,720
please hurry inside and take a look.

472
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,310
It's my daughter inside.

473
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,880
Mr. Zhuang, no need to worry.

474
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,350
I'll go in right now.

475
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,440
Thank you.

476
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,110
What illness do I have?

477
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,590
I'm afraid it's smallpox.

478
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,550
I haven't been out for many days.

479
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,240
How could I catch smallpox?

480
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,500
Has there been anything unusual
in your room lately?

481
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,240
Physician Wu, what do you mean?

482
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,550
Have you touched anything
from strangers?

483
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
For example, a pillow?

484
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,000
I recently got a new fox fur cloak.

485
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,000
Physician, it's this one.

486
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,160
Can I take it off to take a look?

487
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,880
Miss Hanyan, please rest.

488
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,000
I'll go prescribe medicine for you.

489
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,680
Thank you, Physician Wu.

490
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,910
Mom.

491
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,310
Yushan, did you do this?

492
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,590
Mom, what did Physician Wu say?

493
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,790
Why did he come uninvited?

494
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,070
It really was you.

495
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,920
Tell me the truth,

496
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,680
so I can help you think of a solution.

497
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,640
I...

498
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,280
I had Cuiyun go to Nanshan Clinic

499
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,880
to buy a pillow from a smallpox patient

500
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,200
and place it in her room.

501
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,200
You fool!

502
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,590
How dare you have your personal maid
do such a thing?

503
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
No, I...

504
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Mom, I know I was wrong.

505
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,310
I got so angry that I lost my mind.

506
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,310
Who would have thought
the clinic's insider

507
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,590
would betray me?

508
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,240
I just heard that Physician Wu

509
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,550
from Nanshan Clinic came.

510
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,750
I realized something was wrong

511
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,070
and sent Cuiyun out of the house.

512
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm afraid this is already exposed.

513
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,160
Where's Cuiyun?

514
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,550
Bring her back now.

515
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,590
Mom,

516
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,680
I instructed Cuiyun to do this.

517
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,880
Lang has been driven out of the house.

518
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,480
I'll bear the consequences alone

519
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,720
and won't let her take the blame.

520
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,680
Are you out of your mind?

521
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,270
She's just a servant.

522
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,350
What's more important,

523
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,830
her life or yours?

524
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
She's been with me since I was young.

525
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,270
Though she's a servant, she's loyal.

526
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,240
I've given her many jewels and money.

527
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,160
She's left the city.

528
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,680
You won't be able to find her.

529
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,110
Foolish girl.

530
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,000
How is it? Is it smallpox?

531
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,920
It's my fault.

532
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,790
Physician Wu, what do you mean?

533
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,110
Just now, a medicine boy from my clinic

534
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,110
came to apologize to me.

535
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,550
He said that one of your maids

536
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,200
bought a pillow that had been used

537
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,480
by a smallpox patient,

538
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,440
so I rushed here,

539
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,830
but I was still too late.

540
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,440
Are you saying someone
is trying to harm Hanyan?

541
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,920
Which maid would dare to harm the lady?

542
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,790
The maid's name is Cuiyun.

543
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,070
But I didn't find that pillow

544
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,160
in Miss Hanyan's room.

545
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,680
However, I did find smallpox scabs

546
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,400
on the collar of this cloak.

547
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,480
It seems to have come from our clinic.

548
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,790
This is the cloak that Yushan gave me.

549
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,200
This is due to my poor management.

550
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,480
If you want to report this
to the authorities,

551
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,640
I will not cover it up or condone it.

552
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,960
Physician Wu, no need for that.

553
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,670
Please

554
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,920
treat Hanyan first.

555
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,890
Rumors start easily in the Capital.

556
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,840
Please

557
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,510
keep this secret.

558
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,640
I understand.

559
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,510
I'll return to get the medicine.

560
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,880
Thank you, Physician Wu.

561
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,550
Shuhong, go with Physician Wu
to get the medicine.

562
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,670
Yes.

563
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,240
Where is Miss Yushan?

564
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,110
Master, I've brought her.

565
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,070
Yushan, kneel.

566
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,310
Speak for yourself.

567
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,070
Tell everything clearly,

568
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,920
and beg for forgiveness
from your father.

569
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,440
I did this.

570
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,270
There's no excuse.

571
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,920
Father, punish me as you see fit.

572
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,710
You...

573
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,440
Why are you not ashamed?

574
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,480
I've liked Mr. Fu since I was young,

575
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,070
but you insisted on letting Yuqin

576
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,110
marry him.

577
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,310
For all these years,
I've refused to marry.

578
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,070
You should know the reason why.

579
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,160
What does this have to do with anything?

580
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,750
Since Hanyan came home,

581
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,510
she's been entangled with Mr. Fu.

582
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,110
She's determined to fight me for him.

583
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,830
I just can't tolerate her.

584
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,760
Yushan,

585
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,550
I've never treated you unfairly.

586
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,480
Even if you can't stand Hanyan,

587
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,720
why harm me like this?

588
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,880
Grandmother, what do you mean?

589
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,640
I've never harmed you.

590
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,350
- You...
- Don't try to argue here.

591
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,310
Listen. Where did the smallpox scabs

592
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,160
on the cloak you gave
to your grandmother

593
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,240
come from?

594
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,790
Father,

595
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,350
what are you talking about?

596
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,590
I don't understand what he's saying.

597
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,720
Master,

598
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yushan chose the leather

599
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,110
- and hired the best tailor
- Yes.

600
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,720
for her grandmother.

601
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,510
How could it have smallpox scabs on it?

602
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,350
You should ask Physician Wu about this.

603
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,880
I can no longer manage
this household anymore.

604
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,400
Mom, Mom.

605
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,790
Master, Miss Hanyan has arrived.

606
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,480
Why is she here

607
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,160
instead of resting?

608
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,160
She insisted on coming.
I couldn't stop her.

609
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,880
(Awareness and Restraint)

610
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,720
Hanyan, what are you doing?

611
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,880
Father, I want to return to Danzhou.

612
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,070
I won't stay in the Capital any longer.

613
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

614
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,240
I've made up my mind.

615
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,640
I'm here to say goodbye
to Father and Grandmother.

616
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,550
I probably won't return to the Capital.

617
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,680
Father, if you miss me,

618
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,000
you can write a letter to Danzhou.

619
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,400
Nanny Sun,

620
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,070
go help Miss Hanyan.

621
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,480
Help her.

622
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,750
Come on.

623
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,030
You're seriously ill.
Stop fooling around

624
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,650
and go back to your room to rest.

625
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,070
Grandmother, no need to keep me here.

626
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,790
Ever since I came home,
the household has been in turmoil.

627
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,480
And today, such a disaster has occurred.

628
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,480
I can't stay here any longer.

629
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,830
How can this be blamed on you?

630
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,270
If you hadn't taken that cloak,

631
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,440
I might have suffered instead.

632
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,070
I'm glad you're healthy.

633
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,750
This is what I deserve.

634
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Nanny Sun,

635
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,200
no need to help me.

636
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,510
I can walk on my own.

637
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,110
Thank you, Miss Hanyan.

638
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,510
What do you mean?

639
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,720
What do you mean by "you deserve this"?

640
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,850
Grandmother, no need to ask further.

641
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,310
Zhuang Hanyan,

642
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,030
explain it.

643
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,680
Why were there smallpox scabs
on that cloak?

644
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,070
Did you put them on it?

645
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,200
Yes. I did it.

646
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,750
It has nothing to do with Yushan.

647
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,070
Miss Hanyan, you're making it

648
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,550
sound like Yushan forced you
to admit it.

649
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,470
Wait.

650
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,880
I found it strange earlier.

651
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,270
In the morning yesterday,

652
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,250
you insisted on taking that cloak.

653
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,440
Did you know there were smallpox scabs?

654
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,080
Grandmother, no need to ask further.

655
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,200
Everything is my fault.

656
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,260
Hanyan,

657
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,480
if you have any grievances, tell us.

658
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,830
Your elders will stand up for you.

659
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,750
I don't have grievances.

660
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,440
Though that Taoist has been punished,

661
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,160
I've been called barefoot ghost
for years.

662
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,640
I'm afraid that in the future,

663
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,870
if Grandmother's health worsens,

664
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,060
or if Father encounters
any difficulties in his work,

665
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,930
it will be blamed on me.

666
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,790
I don't want to bear
such a stain anymore.

667
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,310
Are you saying

668
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,000
someone wants to make me sick,

669
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,830
bring up
the barefoot ghost matter again,

670
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,680
and shift the blame onto you?

671
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,310
I just misspoke.

672
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,160
I did not mean that.

673
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,790
Grandmother, don't be deceived

674
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,820
by her pitiful appearance.

675
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,350
She just wants to cause trouble.

676
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,720
Yushan, don't worry.

677
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,670
After I leave,

678
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,320
I will never come back.

679
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,710
I hope you and Mr. Fu

680
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,480
get married soon

681
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,150
and grow old happily together.

682
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,800
Zhuang Hanyan,

683
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,710
you're so calculating.

684
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,150
You claim to speak for me,

685
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,400
but you're throwing
all the blame onto me.

686
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,670
Yushan.

687
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,670
Who would risk their life
to manipulate others?

688
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,360
I haven't accused you of anything today.

689
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,840
If you still have any sisterhood left,

690
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,630
please let me go.

691
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,510
You, stop!

692
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,920
Yushan.

693
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,910
Yushan!

694
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
How dare you!

695
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,670
Hanyan.

696
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,400
Someone, take Miss Yushan back

697
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,510
to her room and lock her up.

698
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,000
Mom, I didn't touch her!

699
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
She fell by herself!

700
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,440
Shut up!

701
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,230
- Nanny Sun.
- I didn't touch her!

702
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,800
Take Miss Yushan back to her room!

703
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,280
No, she fell on her own!

704
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,150
Miss Yushan, let's go.

705
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,800
Hanyan, did you hurt yourself?

706
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,480
Father, don't worry.

707
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,940
Father.

708
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,190
I'm fine. Please stay away from me.

709
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,030
Sure.

710
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,840
Why are you being so foolish?

711
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,800
If you had noticed something wrong
with that cloak,

712
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,440
why didn't you just say it earlier?

713
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,110
I never intended to cause trouble.

714
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,630
Nor did I want Grandmother to suffer.

715
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,400
It was my fault.

716
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,920
I'm sorry for the past.

717
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,510
Master, please send Miss Hanyan
back to her room.

718
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,400
She can't stay in Gongtong Chamber
any longer.

719
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,000
Yushan dislikes Hanyan so much.

720
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,710
I'm afraid she might cause more trouble.

721
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,640
Hanyan,

722
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,190
why not go to Yongshou Chamber?

723
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,070
From now on, your meals and daily care

724
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,590
will be looked after
by Baochan and Baoyue.

725
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,840
Shiyang, what do you think?

726
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,630
Hanyan hasn't recovered from smallpox.

727
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,480
It might not be suitable.

728
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,630
If I don't protect her,

729
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,880
where else can you send her?

730
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,070
She's my daughter.

731
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,070
Of course, I'll take care of her.

732
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,060
Xiwen, what are you doing?

733
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,510
From today on,

734
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,880
Miss Hanyan will stay with me
at Jianjia Chamber.

735
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,630
Does anyone have any objections?

736
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,190
(That was)

737
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,960
(only the second time I met Mother.)

738
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,760
(I didn't expect her to suddenly appear)

739
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,190
(when I was in trouble.)

740
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,680
(This time,)

741
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,960
(Jianjia Chamber)

742
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,150
(is finally open to me.)

743
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,190
(I finally have the chance)

744
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,320
(to live under the same roof
with Mother.)

745
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,070
(Jianjia Chamber)

746
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,920
(But after 17 years of separation,)

747
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,630
(how can I truly)

748
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,670
(get close to you?)

749
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,070
Miss Hanyan.

750
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,510
It's getting late.

751
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,360
Please light the candles in my room.

752
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,760
The madam has not given permission,

753
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,280
so I dare not act on my own.

754
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,230
It's just lighting a candle.

755
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,550
Do I really need permission?

756
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,910
Please forgive me, Miss Hanyan.

757
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,320
The madam has not given permission.

758
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,840
I dare not act on my own.

759
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,070
Fine, you can leave.

760
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,200
Yes.

761
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,880
Miss Jilan.

762
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,630
Miss Hanyan, the madam
requests your presence.

763
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,380
(Lingering Dew)

764
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,590
Madam, Miss Hanyan is here.

765
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,440
Greetings, Mother.

766
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,800
Thank you for rescuing me

767
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,320
and taking me in today.

768
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,510
Nanny Chen.

769
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,230
Miss Hanyan,

770
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,070
this is a special medicinal ointment

771
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,780
that Madam bought
from the Nanshan Clinic.

772
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,960
It can treat smallpox
without leaving new scars.

773
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,710
Please try it.

774
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,280
Mother, thanks for your concern.

775
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,720
I...

776
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,960
Mother, what do you mean?

777
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,920
These haven't been registered
in the family ledger.

778
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,320
It's worth over a hundred taels.

779
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,440
Find a physician to heal your illness.

780
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,590
The rest of it is enough

781
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,710
for an ordinary family
to live on for over ten years.

782
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,320
It's not enough?

783
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,320
The carriage is ready for you.

784
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,480
While it's not too late,
you should leave.

785
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,960
My life is not worth a hundred taels.

786
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,280
I don't understand.

787
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,030
Mother, where do you want me to go?

788
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,510
As long as you leave tonight,

789
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,320
and never appear in front of me again,

790
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,070
go wherever you like.

791
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,510
Why do you want me to leave home?

792
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,670
This is not your home!

793
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,630
I'm too frail to leave now.

794
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,590
Your little tricks

795
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,190
may fool them, but not me.

796
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,880
You can never win

797
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,000
in the family struggle.

798
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,760
If you're truly clever,

799
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,400
you would take the money and leave.

800
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,150
You can start a family

801
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,360
or travel and engage in business.

802
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,200
Anything would be better
than walking into this trap,

803
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,400
like a moth to the flame.

804
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,920
I never intended to fight with anyone.

805
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,230
I only wanted
a little bit of love from you.

806
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,030
I am gravely ill
in a critical condition now,

807
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,710
yet why are you still so heartless?

808
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,960
Even if you have no love for me,

809
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,400
aren't you afraid of the gossip?

810
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,510
You've developed

811
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,760
such a sharp tongue
even in the countryside.

812
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,610
Thank you for your compliment, Mother.

813
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,400
Blood ties are not determined
by distance.

814
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,710
Foster mother often said I resembled you

815
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,680
very much

816
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,800
when you were young.

817
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,070
Blood ties, huh?

818
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,550
Then I'll grant your wish.

819
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,480
Put it on her.

820
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,550
Since you insist on staying,

821
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,400
I'm curious to see

822
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,230
how long you can endure.
