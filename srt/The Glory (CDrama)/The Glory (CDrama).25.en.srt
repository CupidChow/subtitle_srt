00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:41,220
=The Glory=

2
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,070
(Prosperity and Longevity)

3
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,990
Ma'am.

4
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,840
(17 years ago)
Ma'am, it's bad.

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,230
What's wrong again?

6
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,670
Just now, for some reason,

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,350
the master got angry again

8
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,640
and gave the young master
quite a beating.

9
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,560
Please go and try to calm him down.

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,920
Master.

11
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,510
Master.

12
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,110
I...

13
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,880
Father, Director Pei
forced me to do this.

14
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,030
I'm still young; I don't want to die.

15
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,670
You caused this trouble,

16
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,390
so you must bear the consequences.

17
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,880
It has nothing to do with me.

18
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,950
I will give you a grand funeral.

19
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,860
(Spirit Tablet of Late Sister, Li Ruren)

20
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,160
Ruren, may your spirit in heaven

21
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,270
protect me from disaster

22
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,230
and grant me happiness and peace.

23
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,760
Ruren, please bless me.

24
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,880
Mother.

25
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,670
What are these for?

26
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,360
I heard you've been too sad

27
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,640
to eat anything,

28
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,950
so I cooked these dishes.

29
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,790
Mother, have a try.

30
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,110
I truly have no appetite.

31
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,640
I can no longer look
after Father anymore.

32
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,440
You're my only blood relative
in this world.

33
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,750
Unfortunately,
that old saying has come true.

34
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,760
What old saying?

35
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,580
It's too late for a son
to serve his parents

36
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,840
for they're no longer there for him.

37
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,950
Well, I'll eat.

38
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,040
Look.

39
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,390
Slow down.

40
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,350
I shouldn't disappoint

41
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,870
my son's kind intentions.

42
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,870
I'll eat.

43
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,880
Slow down.

44
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,390
If it's not enough, I'll make more.

45
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,550
Of course, it's enough.

46
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,520
It seems

47
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,440
you like the food I made.

48
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,950
Yes, I like it.

49
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,270
From now on,
I'll make a few dishes every day

50
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,760
and eat with you,

51
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,880
so I can fulfill my filial duty.

52
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,430
Shiyang,

53
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,830
your father has gone.

54
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,270
You don't need to fixate on that.

55
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,800
From today on,

56
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,760
how about you take charge of the family?

57
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,120
I'll listen to you completely.

58
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,040
Is that okay?

59
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Slow down.

60
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,480
Sure.

61
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,380
=Episode 25=

62
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,550
This...

63
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,240
Are these truly
my grandfather's remains?

64
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,040
(Serving Justice)

65
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,960
Yes, indeed.

66
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,310
There's more.

67
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,980
They're the records of Mr. Yuwen's
secret investigations

68
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,950
of Zhuang Shiyang's crimes

69
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,470
over the years.

70
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,190
On the summer solstice,
while inspecting in Quanzhou,

71
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,030
I used the badge
of the provincial government

72
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,420
and took three officials with me

73
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,950
to the Zhuang family's
ancestral hall in Danzhou

74
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,760
and secretly opened the coffin
to take Zhuang Hanliang's bones.

75
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,320
This body

76
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,950
was secretly taken by Mr. Yuwen.

77
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,830
The skull was bluish-green.

78
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,640
When tested with soap water
and a silver needle, nothing showed up.

79
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,950
But when tested with oil and vinegar,

80
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,590
black spots appeared on the bones,

81
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,430
indicating death by a deadly poison.

82
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,680
However, it was hard to identify

83
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,880
which poison it was
due to the passage of time.

84
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,680
This is the notes of Coroner Sun
from the Supervision.

85
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,710
It seems Mr. Yuwen had long suspected

86
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,040
that Zhuang Shiyang

87
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,470
poisoned my grandfather to death.

88
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,960
There's more.

89
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,090
Xiwen discovered

90
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,770
that after Zhuang Hanliang's
sudden death,

91
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,880
Ms. Wei claimed to be ill
and stayed in her chamber,

92
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,950
refusing to eat anything.

93
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,220
Yet she instructed servants
to go out at night for food.

94
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,710
She even wanted a kitchen
in Yongshou Chamber.

95
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,240
She seemed to be terrified
of Zhuang Shiyang.

96
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,970
All these suspicious signs

97
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,510
proved that she may know something.

98
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,040
Xiwen tried to test her three times,

99
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,190
but she refused to talk

100
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,830
and only made excuses.

101
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,350
Grandmother knew the truth?

102
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,240
Mr. Yuwen just briefly recorded this

103
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,590
but didn't explain it in detail.

104
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,830
Their investigation ended with Ms. Wei,

105
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,030
and they couldn't find
new evidence or witnesses.

106
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,590
If this had been concluded back then,

107
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,510
Mother wouldn't have wanted

108
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,830
to destroy everything.

109
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,240
Perhaps we can continue
the investigation

110
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,590
based on these clues.

111
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,000
But Ms. Wei...

112
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,220
Grandmother's birthday is in two days,

113
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,840
and I'll return to the Zhuang Residence.

114
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,270
As Mother failed three times,

115
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,320
I'll test her

116
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,440
the fourth time.

117
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,750
Do you have confidence?

118
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,710
I know very well
what my grandmother fears the most.

119
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,270
Knowing her weakness

120
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,200
will make it easier to handle.

121
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,720
Today's birthday banquet

122
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,810
is no less grand than the one
at Linjiang Pavilion.

123
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,120
Ms. Wei is so lucky to have
such a good daughter-in-law

124
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,390
like Mrs. Zhuang.

125
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,990
Pong.

126
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,160
In my opinion,

127
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,200
it's Mrs. Zhuang who's lucky

128
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,920
to raise a daughter

129
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,630
with the air of a natural Duchess.

130
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,550
Pong.

131
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,560
Yushan is fortunate

132
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,110
to marry the Duke

133
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,160
and live a peaceful
and respected life with him.

134
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,720
- You're all here.
- Everyone,

135
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,470
are you all familiar with Mrs. Fu?

136
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,440
Not really. She's unfamiliar to me.

137
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,280
I only spoke a few words with her.

138
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,830
Please forgive me.

139
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,710
Who is this lady?

140
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,320
She's a friend of the seductive consort.

141
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,200
She should be grateful to be alive.

142
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,800
How dare she disturb this joyous day?

143
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,950
You jest.

144
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,720
After all, she is our daughter

145
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,040
and must tend Ms. Wei.

146
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,160
Grandmother...

147
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,470
Your mother and elder sister are here.

148
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,720
Yet you entered
without greeting your mother

149
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,750
or curtsying.

150
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,320
Where are your manners?

151
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,520
Today is Grandmother's birthday.

152
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,710
Yushan,

153
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,710
you should be more kind.

154
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,800
Kind?

155
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,760
Fine.

156
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,280
I gave Grandmother a full set
of embroidered and jeweled jewelry.

157
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,480
She's been wearing it non-stop,

158
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,230
trying each piece on in her room.

159
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,240
Hanyan,

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,350
why don't you sit down

161
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,280
and have a cup of tea?

162
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,230
I remember

163
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,400
you like to drink
what others leave behind.

164
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,470
The food in my bowl

165
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,710
is nothing compared
to the one in front of you,

166
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,630
which has been touched
by four or five people.

167
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,470
But you still cherish it
like a treasure,

168
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,800
enjoying it sweetly.

169
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,200
Zhuang Hanyan,

170
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,750
how dare you

171
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,200
slander the Duke!

172
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,440
You...

173
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,800
Yushan, Yushan.

174
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,600
You're a Duchess now.

175
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,090
As an imperial family member,

176
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,550
you must be mindful of your demeanor.

177
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,710
Let go of me.

178
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,550
- Madam.
- Yushan.

179
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,920
How can you help her?

180
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,830
Zhuang Yushan,

181
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,800
we are sisters after all.

182
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,440
Let me ask you.

183
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,160
Did you willingly marry

184
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,950
Duke Qi,

185
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,630
or were you coerced?

186
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,630
What does she mean?

187
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,750
I married the Duke

188
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,440
and became the Duchess.

189
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,200
Of course, I did so willingly.

190
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,470
If you still have any sense,

191
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,590
you should visit Yao Mansion

192
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,320
and meet the former Duchess Qi.

193
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,710
Enough. Stop pretending to be nice here.

194
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,800
We are just competing for our future.

195
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,950
Zhuang Hanyan, let me tell you.

196
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,920
I will make you realize something.

197
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,150
As you can

198
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,870
become a noble lady in the Capital,

199
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,470
so can I.

200
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,440
Noble lady?

201
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,350
I used to be deceived by this term.

202
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,400
The so-called noble lady

203
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,520
is not about wealth

204
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,920
or a noble title.

205
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,200
It's about being in adversity

206
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,200
and never giving up.

207
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,870
It's about being a woman

208
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,350
who has the courage to break free

209
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,750
from the shackles of etiquette
and defy restrictions.

210
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,630
The former Duchess Qi
is named Yao Wangshu.

211
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,270
She would rather die than become

212
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,750
a plaything of Duke Qi.

213
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,870
She risked her life

214
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,790
to escape

215
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,200
and regain her freedom.

216
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,110
She could be called a noble lady,

217
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,560
but you are definitely not one.

218
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,320
Stop saying these useless words.

219
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,790
You must drink this tea,

220
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,830
or you won't leave here alive.

221
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,590
Fu Yunxi,

222
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,920
you should bow to me now.

223
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,520
Are you okay?

224
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,830
I'm fine.

225
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,710
Let's go.

226
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,950
Zhuang Hanyan, Fu Yunxi,

227
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,280
I will not let you off.

228
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,580
(Composure)

229
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,840
Grandmother, I wish you
happiness and longevity.

230
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,550
You were arguing outside just now,

231
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,960
and I was frightened.

232
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,680
Go bring me my Danshen pills.

233
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,150
Grandmother, if you want peace of mind,

234
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,710
you should remove
the root of this illness promptly

235
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,200
and never let it spread

236
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,900
and become a serious,
long-term condition.

237
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,350
If my guess is right,

238
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,950
the root of your illness

239
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,320
was planted when Grandfather
passed away, right?

240
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,670
Baochan, Baoyue,

241
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,520
you two can leave.

242
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,920
Hanyan, what do you mean?

243
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,320
Grandfather didn't die of illness.

244
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,680
The cause of his death
was something else, right?

245
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,030
What are you talking about?

246
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,230
Come on, let's go out.

247
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,720
Seeking help from the gods
is not as good as helping oneself.

248
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,640
If there's a chance

249
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,470
to reveal the truth now,

250
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,320
would you be willing to redeem yourself

251
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,420
and seek peace
for the rest of your life?

252
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,040
I'm an old, useless woman,

253
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,710
relying on my son.

254
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,920
I have barely lived these years.

255
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,230
Why must you trouble me?

256
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,630
Grandmother,
since you don't want to speak,

257
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,750
I won't

258
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,680
force you.

259
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,520
But in the future,

260
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,830
I will greet you every day

261
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,400
and ask about your health.

262
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,520
If we suddenly get along,

263
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,590
will Father, with his suspicious nature,

264
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,440
secretly doubt and suspect us,

265
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,800
and will he still continue to tend you?

266
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,230
Hanyan, you can't do that.

267
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,400
I've always kept a low profile
in the family.

268
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,110
I've been deaf and mute
for so many years

269
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,480
just to have a place to live.

270
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,560
For the sake of our bond,

271
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,590
please let me go.

272
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,870
I understand

273
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,950
your worries.

274
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,110
You've suffered too many

275
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,110
grievances and tortures

276
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,920
in this house.

277
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,400
Don't you want to live differently?

278
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,950
Are you willing

279
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,400
to keep suffering
for the rest of your life?

280
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,040
What else can my life be?

281
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,990
I'm your granddaughter.

282
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,110
I can provide you with food

283
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,120
and a peaceful life

284
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,280
and take care of you until the end.

285
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,200
Would you rather hide
behind a vicious tiger,

286
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,710
living in fear every day, aid a devil,

287
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,350
or would you choose to stand up

288
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,320
in the last years of your life,

289
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,600
not as a mute and deaf servant
on the ground,

290
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,750
but as a complete woman?

291
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,600
No, no.

292
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,590
Shiyang and I are kind to each other.

293
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,200
You can never turn me against him.

294
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,680
I'll go tell Shiyang right now.

295
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,680
If that's the case,

296
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,710
you won't live much longer.

297
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,950
What?

298
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,350
Will you kill me?

299
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,950
When I was organizing
my mother's belongings,

300
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,280
I found a letter

301
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,560
that clearly stated

302
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,800
that the culprit
who poisoned my grandfather

303
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,870
was

304
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,350
my grandmother.

305
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,630
Pah, pah.

306
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,400
What nonsense are you saying?

307
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,290
Be careful,
or you'll pay for this rumor.

308
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,520
I know that you're innocent.

309
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,660
My mother investigated this
secretly back then,

310
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,800
and she was completely wrong.

311
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,350
She even asked you about it
several times.

312
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,190
Yes.

313
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,400
She indeed asked me many times,
both openly and secretly.

314
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,870
So, Grandmother,

315
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,470
if I hand this letter
to the authorities,

316
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,040
what will happen?

317
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,670
This is unfounded.

318
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,520
It won't get me killed anyway.

319
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,240
Have you ever thought about it?

320
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,520
If this truly reaches the authorities,

321
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,320
will the real murderer of Grandfather

322
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,670
try everything to save you,

323
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,040
or

324
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,670
will they take the chance to frame you

325
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,000
and make you take the blame,

326
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,190
so they can live freely

327
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,240
without worry?

328
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,720
Hanyan, what exactly do you want?

329
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,830
Very simple.

330
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,800
I just want

331
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,870
the real murderer to face justice.

332
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,160
Grandmother,

333
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,190
you have three days.

334
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,280
I'll wait for your decision.

335
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,110
I've said everything,

336
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,080
but I'm not sure

337
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,320
how Grandmother will decide.

338
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,470
Let's wait and see.

339
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,960
Madam, Master,

340
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,630
Nanny Sun just appeared
at the back gate.

341
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,480
She was acting suspiciously

342
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,670
and handed this over to me

343
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,520
without saying a word before leaving.

344
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,160
This is

345
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,320
water celery.

346
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,350
It must be from Grandmother.

347
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,990
Madam,

348
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,680
your father seems to have planted this

349
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,640
in his kitchen for years.

350
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,560
Let go.

351
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,870
What are you doing?

352
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,390
This looks like ordinary water celery,

353
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,150
but its roots may contain
a deadly poison.

354
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,630
This is the evidence

355
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,830
Grandmother has been hiding for years.

356
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,340
(17 years ago)

357
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,680
- Grandmother.
- What happened?

358
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,310
My little rabbit ran inside.

359
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,510
Help me find it.

360
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,070
Alright, I'll help you find it.

361
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,110
We'll find it together.

362
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,320
Grandmother.

363
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,600
What's wrong?

364
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,800
Son, you're born timid.

365
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,190
Why did you do this cruel thing?

366
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,910
Since you've done it,

367
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,910
why not do it thoroughly?

368
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,240
Why did you make me see it?

369
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,240
Ma'am,

370
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,520
Ms. Hanyan is here to see you again.

371
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,150
Why is she here again?

372
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,100
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

373
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,420
(The next day)

374
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,070
Yunxi, what's wrong?

375
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,720
The Judicial Review is handling a case.

376
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,200
Mr. Zhuang,

377
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,960
please come with us
to the Judicial Review.

378
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,960
Why?

379
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,080
Did anyone in my family

380
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,030
cause trouble again?

381
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,560
You will find out
once you're in the courtroom.

382
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,990
Take him away.

383
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,320
I'll go myself.

384
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,670
The fish...

385
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,830
Bring the physician

386
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,280
to identify which is the cowbane.

387
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,030
Yes.

388
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,580
(Courtroom)

389
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,020
(Correction and Clarification)

390
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
Mr. Yan.

391
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,320
Mr. Yan,

392
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,240
what do you mean by this?

393
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,160
Zhuang Shiyang,

394
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,910
do you know your crime?

395
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,390
What crime have I committed?

396
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,040
Mr. Yan, please make it clear.

397
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,960
Summon Coroner Sun, the witness.

398
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,060
(Fair Trail)

399
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,350
Mr. Yan, Mr. Fu,

400
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,160
I am Sun Min from the Supervision.

401
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,280
Mr. Sun, please tell us
the whole thing again

402
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,160
right here in court.

403
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,080
Yes.

404
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,040
About three or four years ago,

405
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,870
Mr. Yuwen from the Supervision

406
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,960
gave me these remains to examine.

407
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,960
I found that the bones contained

408
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,390
an unknown, potent poison.

409
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,240
Later, Mr. Yuwen handed

410
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,480
these remains over to me

411
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,400
but never mentioned whose they were.

412
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,350
These bones belong
to Mr. Zhuang's father,

413
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,760
Zhuang Hanliang, former Supervising
Secretary of the Six Offices.

414
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,670
Mr. Yan, my father
was buried 17 years ago

415
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,280
in my family's ancestral tomb
in Danzhou.

416
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,190
Mr. Fu, what nonsense are you saying?

417
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,720
Yuwen Chang'an secretly investigated
this case for years.

418
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,640
Four years ago, he went to Danzhou,

419
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,270
found Zhuang Hanliang's grave,

420
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,350
secretly opened the coffin,
and took his remains.

421
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,790
This is the document kept

422
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,350
by the Danzhou government at that time.

423
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:06,460
(Archived Documents)

424
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,520
Mr. Zhuang, do you recognize this?

425
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,160
Mr. Yan,

426
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,870
this is just water celery.

427
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,990
Mr. Yan,

428
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,720
this was dug up from the kitchen

429
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,190
in Zhuang Shiyang's study.

430
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,280
Zhuang Shiyang planted this.

431
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,590
Its appearance resembles water celery,

432
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,590
but it is actually deadly cowbane.

433
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,080
After testing,

434
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,200
this poison is identical
to the one found

435
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,320
on Zhuang Hanliang's bones.

436
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,320
He died suddenly back then

437
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,430
because Zhuang Shiyang
poisoned him with it.

438
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,750
Zhuang Shiyang,

439
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,830
do you know your crime?

440
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,410
My Lord, I'm innocent.

441
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,310
Since childhood, I've been studying
the works of Confucius and Mencius.

442
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,720
How could I commit

443
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:57,190
such a heinous, immoral act?

444
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,240
Zhuang Hanliang died
from poisoning back then.

445
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,030
As his son, how could you not notice?

446
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,830
You planted the cowbane,

447
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,590
yet over the years,

448
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,870
no one in your family

449
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,430
has mistakenly consumed
and died from it.

450
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,590
How do you explain that?

451
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,560
I admit my crime.

452
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,830
I admit my crime.

453
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,800
So,

454
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,760
do you admit it?

455
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,950
I am guilty

456
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,630
of covering up the truth.

457
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,820
The mastermind behind this case

458
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,240
was Zhou Ruyin, the madam of my family.

459
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,880
Is this really poisonous?

460
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,400
The cowbane looks almost identical

461
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,590
to regular celery,

462
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,820
making it hard to distinguish.

463
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,280
Even a single bite could be fatal.

464
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,560
Come with me now.

465
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,070
We'll go to Duke Qi's Mansion
and discuss this with Yushan.

466
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,990
Sure.

467
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,460
(Composure)

468
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,400
Hurry up.

469
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,560
You...

470
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,110
Mrs. Zhuang, please come with us.

471
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,350
Where to?

472
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,320
To the Judicial Review.

473
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,970
Nanny Tao, hurry to Duke Qi's Mansion

474
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,720
and ask Yushan to go
to the Judicial Review.

475
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,710
Yes.

476
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,670
I'm Zhou Ruyin.

477
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,800
(Fair Trail)
Greetings, Mr. Yan.

478
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,670
Ruyin, I've covered
for you for 17 years,

479
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,040
but today, I can't do it any longer.

480
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,830
You should confess now.

481
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,640
Master,

482
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,000
what do you mean by that?

483
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,000
According to Zhuang Shiyang's testimony,

484
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,960
when Ruan Xiwen was about to give birth,

485
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,390
you secretly poisoned Zhuang Hanliang

486
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,430
and colluded with Taoist Master Duan
to play tricks,

487
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,270
trying to frame the unborn child

488
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,560
as an evil ghost.

489
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,640
Ruyin, please be sensible.

490
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,590
You can't escape now.

491
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,320
You'd better confess honestly

492
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,040
and ask for a lighter punishment.

493
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,190
My schemes back then

494
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,040
had many flaws,

495
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,150
but you ignored them all.

496
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,670
You even indulged me and pushed me

497
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,040
to escalate the situation.

498
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,590
So, you had planned it all along.

499
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,670
If things went wrong in the future
and you had no way out,

500
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,870
you'd throw me out as a scapegoat.

501
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,830
With our romance as a couple,

502
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,440
how could you frame me like this?

503
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,240
Stop pretending.

504
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,870
You've framed me as the murderer,

505
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,800
but what evidence do you have?

506
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,960
Mr. Yan,

507
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,040
there is another prisoner
in the Judicial Review.

508
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,590
Please summon him.

509
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,670
Who is it?

510
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,840
Taoist Master Duan,

511
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,320
Cui Aniu.

512
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,070
This...

513
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,480
Why is it the Zhuang family again?

514
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,000
I was wrong. I regret it.

515
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,830
Please let me go.

516
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,720
Cui Aniu, do you recognize this lady?

517
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,430
Ms. Zhou,

518
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,320
you're a madam now.

519
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,320
Congratulations.

520
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,270
You are graceful and virtuous.

521
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,400
Your beauty is unparalleled

522
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,270
like a fairy from the heavens.

523
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,040
Congrats on fulfilling your wish.

524
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,870
Cui Aniu, let me ask you.

525
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,630
17 years ago, you caused trouble
in the Zhuang family.

526
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,480
Did Zhou Ruyin instruct you

527
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,110
to do that?

528
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,350
Well...

529
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,190
Speak the truth,

530
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,240
or I'll imprison you
for another ten years.

531
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,630
It was her.

532
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,000
Zhou Ruyin is heartless
and full of evil.

533
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,240
She specializes in twisting the truth.

534
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,590
17 years ago,

535
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,400
she bribed me handsomely

536
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,640
and instructed me
to stir up trouble twice

537
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
in the Zhuang family.

538
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,040
My Lord, please believe me.

539
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,320
When you made up lies
about the barefoot ghost,

540
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,270
did Zhou Ruyin ever tell you

541
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,270
the real cause
of Zhuang Hanliang's death?

542
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,760
She never mentioned it,

543
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,880
but medicine and Taoism are inseparable.

544
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,110
I also know a bit about medicine.

545
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,430
When I was exorcising
for the old master,

546
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,110
I noticed that he had been poisoned.

547
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,800
He couldn't have died from illness.

548
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,350
In that case,

549
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,190
the poisoner

550
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,190
must have been Zhou Ruyin.

551
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,260
My Lord, please discern the truth.

552
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,680
Just now, everyone
in the court could see

553
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,750
this fraudster is good at changing sides

554
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,800
and deceiving others.

555
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,040
What he says can't be trusted.

556
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,920
Moreover, he's just speaking nonsense

557
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,190
and making wild guesses.

558
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,480
My Lord, Duchess Qi seeks an audience.

559
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,500
(Courtroom)

560
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,800
Greetings, Duchess Qi.

561
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,830
Mr. Yan, no need for formalities.

562
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,030
I've heard

563
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,800
everything just now.

564
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,350
Both of you, please rise.

565
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,760
Yushan, you're finally here.

566
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,670
Though you were young back then,

567
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,590
you knew a bit about this matter.

568
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,080
You can testify for me, right?

569
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,190
Does the Duchess

570
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,000
know the truth about this?

571
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,950
Look.

572
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,750
When you grow up,

573
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,790
you'll surely be a belle in the Capital.

574
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,680
Really?

575
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,280
You're so beautiful.

576
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,630
Ms. Zhou, something's wrong.

577
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,030
The old master has fallen ill.

578
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,240
It seems he's nearing death.

579
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,160
What?

580
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,320
The old master has always been
in good health.

581
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,750
How could he suddenly fall ill?

582
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,920
I don't know the details.

583
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,110
Ms. Zhou, please go and check.

584
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,400
Sure.

585
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,350
Don't panic. Don't panic.

586
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,830
The old master's illness

587
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,960
might be a good chance for us.

588
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,240
Mom, is Grandfather going to die?

589
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,630
Yushan, don't panic.

590
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,630
This concerns our future.

591
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,960
Let me think about it.

592
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,280
Yushan, have you forgotten?

593
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,240
When I learned that your grandfather
was seriously ill,

594
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,590
I was shocked

595
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,400
and hastily made plans in the room,

596
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,280
telling you not to panic.

597
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,310
If I had poisoned him,

598
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,800
how could I have reacted like that?

599
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,310
At the time, you were young,

600
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,590
so I didn't need to put on an act
in front of you.

601
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,110
So, your father must've been framing me,

602
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,160
right?

603
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,120
Yushan,

604
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:24,800
you know my nature better than anyone.

605
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,830
How could I do such a thing?

606
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,630
Yushan, don't listen to him anymore.

607
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,270
I've misjudged him all these years.

608
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,430
He has ruined our lives.

609
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,990
Fine.

610
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,390
I'm guilty.

611
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,760
I did all that.

612
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,630
Take me away and imprison me.

613
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,910
Mr. Yan,

614
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,800
though I was young back then,

615
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,590
I remember this very clearly.

616
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,480
Back then,

617
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,430
I witnessed it with my own eyes

618
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,360
that my mother

619
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,480
planted the cowbane in the kitchen.

620
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,560
It was she who poisoned Grandfather.

621
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,030
Madam,

622
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,320
in the end, your plot

623
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,960
failed once again.

624
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,320
No.

625
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,280
It was a plot

626
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,080
that finally succeeded.

627
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,080
Yushan,

628
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,590
what did you just say?

629
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,350
I saw it with my own eyes.

630
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,590
You pulled up the cowbane.

631
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,000
You poisoned Grandfather.

632
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,280
Yushan,

633
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,070
why have you suddenly lost your mind?

634
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,590
How dare you slander
your mother like this?

635
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,870
Wasn't it because of your sweet words

636
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,630
that I ended up like this?

637
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,110
Yushan,

638
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,760
don't say that.

639
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,630
Don't say such things about your mother.

640
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,830
She gave you life,

641
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,400
and she raised you.

642
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,960
It was my fault. I was wrong.

643
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,110
Fine.

644
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,520
I did it.

645
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,960
I did it all.

646
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,760
My own daughter

647
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,880
has openly accused me in the courtroom.

648
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,630
So, it must have been me.

649
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,920
Zhou Ruyin has confessed.

650
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,000
Zhou Ruyin has pled guilty.

651
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,320
Mr. Yan,

652
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,190
at the time of the incident,

653
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,110
Zhuang Yushan was still a child.

654
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,790
Her testimony is not reliable.

655
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,230
Moreover, Zhuang Shiyang
and his wife accused each other,

656
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,150
and then both confessed.

657
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,040
There must be something fishy.

658
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,630
Please give me a few more days

659
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,750
to investigate the truth,

660
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,250
and we can have a second trial.

661
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,670
The evidence
in this case is insufficient.

662
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,490
Take them back for a second trial.

663
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,510
Dismissed.

664
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,310
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

665
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,150
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

666
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,800
Yushan,

667
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,150
this ginger duck
is your father's specialty.

668
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,920
(17 years ago)
He just made it

669
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,750
and sent it to us.

670
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,150
You should try it.

671
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,670
Mom, I want to eat plum pastry.

672
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,040
I've told you many times.

673
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,590
I'm just a concubine after all.

674
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,960
You can never be as noble

675
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,670
as a lineal daughter.

676
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,560
So, in this family,

677
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,270
your father is the only one
we can rely on.

678
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,230
Whatever dish your father makes,

679
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,230
we must love to eat it.

680
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,150
You still don't understand it?

681
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,230
Alright, come.

682
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,840
Eat this ginger duck with big bites.

683
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,510
The more you eat,
the happier your father will be.

684
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,530
Hurry. Use the chopsticks.

685
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,270
(Since I can remember,)

686
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,310
(Mom has always reminded me)

687
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,840
(that everything we have)

688
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,270
(and enjoy)

689
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,520
(is thanks to Father.)

690
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,800
(So,)

691
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,590
(we must please him)

692
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,710
(and earn his affection.)

693
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,750
(The more affection we get,)

694
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,190
(the more favor we can receive.)

695
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,630
(Seclusion)
Miss Yushan, don't cry.

696
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,280
- Don't comfort her.
- It's alright.

697
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,480
Let her cry it out.

698
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,840
Crying and throwing tantrums

699
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,400
won't help you get what you want.

700
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,150
Do you remember

701
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,230
what I have taught you?

702
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,030
You told me to go beg Father

703
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,790
and make him happy.

704
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,190
How many days

705
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,880
has your father not come here?

706
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
Three days.

707
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,840
Did you upset Father

708
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,630
so he's stopped coming here?

709
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,560
I didn't.

710
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,270
Is Yushan throwing a tantrum again?

711
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,560
I miss you,

712
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,310
but you aren't always here,

713
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,190
so I'm crying.

714
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,790
I'm here, aren't I?

715
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,750
Stop crying now,

716
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,250
or you'll spoil your pretty face,

717
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,710
and no one will marry you.

718
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,750
(Mom taught me day and night)

719
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,000
(that no matter what,)

720
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,360
(Father is the sky of our family.)

721
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,840
(Only by pleasing him)

722
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,360
(can I get what we want.)

723
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,520
(I must submit to him
and be loyal to him.)

724
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,920
(Only in this way)

725
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,880
(can I secure a life
of wealth and honor,)

726
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,530
(and maybe one day escape the fate
of a concubine's daughter)

727
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,630
(to become a lineal daughter.)

728
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,960
Yushan, do you like this jewelry?

729
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,710
Yes.

730
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,310
Thank you, Father.

731
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,000
Father, I know

732
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,560
you love me the most.

733
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,480
(But)

734
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,710
(maybe Mother never expected)

735
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,040
(that her teachings would work)

736
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:22,480
(so well on me.)

737
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,150
Yushan,

738
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,710
it's too late now,

739
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,760
is it?

740
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,260
(Fair Trail)

741
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,880
Father, please get up.

742
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Please get up.

743
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,880
I'll return to Duke Qi's Mansion now.

744
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,030
Go ahead.

745
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:22,740
(Courtroom)

746
00:39:35,891 --> 00:39:38,701
