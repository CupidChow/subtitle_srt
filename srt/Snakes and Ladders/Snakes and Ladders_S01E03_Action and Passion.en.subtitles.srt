1
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:42,917
They say that sex and money
move the world.

2
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,420
I have neither of them.

3
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,759
But I'll do whatever it takes
to make my dream come true.

4
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:55,764
Become the headmistress
of Andes San Javier School.

5
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,356
SNAKES AND LADDERS

6
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,708
Oh no. No.

7
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,794
They know about Bernie.

8
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,758
-Good morning, prefect.
-Not so good, Rita.

9
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,927
I need something.

10
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,429
I need many things too.

11
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,557
Work has been a nightmare lately.

12
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,518
No, I mean it. I haven't slept.

13
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:27,730
I haven't slept a wink.
I have insomnia. I need to rest.

14
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,024
I can't give you anything
without a prescription.

15
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,442
Yes, you can, Rita.

16
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,444
You can. I need to sleep.

17
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,156
Oh God. Let's see. Hold on.

18
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,700
Here! I found it.

19
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,995
Now, take this. It's a muscle relaxer.

20
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:45,540
Here. It'll make you feel better.
Let me bring you some water.

21
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,209
Here you are.

22
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,839
What's wrong?
Is it a headache? Is it stress?

23
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,008
-What is it?
-It's everything.

24
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,385
Everything? My goodness. Wait a sec.

25
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,471
Let me find another pill. Wait.

26
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,389
Let's see.

27
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,308
Okay now, here.

28
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,767
Take this pill.

29
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,229
Don't mix it with anything.
Don't tell anyone I gave it to you.

30
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,606
Take it.

31
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,065
It'll make you feel better.

32
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,234
But don't take more than one at a time.

33
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,486
Wait. Excuse me.

34
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,699
URGENT MEETING
ELECTIONS

35
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,702
Confirmed.

36
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,661
Confirmed.

37
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,956
But Mr. Muriel, we don't earn a salary.

38
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,334
Plus, you don't pay us
for the extra hours.

39
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,960
We work from 12:00 to 12:00.

40
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,755
-We're done. You may leave.
-But--

41
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,465
-But Mr. Muriel--
-Go away.

42
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,967
Olmo, I need to tell you something.

43
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,636
It can't be over the phone.

44
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,639
I can't see you now.
I have to attend an urgent meeting.

45
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,556
Urgent?

46
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,101
Tamara wants to discuss the elections.
Don't worry. I've got this.

47
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,562
-I'll keep you in the loop.
-No, Olmo!

48
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,605
Shit!

49
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,190
He's so rude.

50
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,241
What's up?

51
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,374
You're so annoying!

52
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,167
-Good!
-What's wrong?

53
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,418
See that?

54
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,836
He threw his sweat at me.

55
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,297
He wants to exchange fluids with me.

56
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,590
Throw it in my face!

57
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,635
Martha Sánchez, don't be vulgar!
There are kids here.

58
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,304
-He can make me a baby.
-Keep it up!

59
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,514
Just look at him.

60
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,517
He left stripping,
but stripping didn't leave him.

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,893
Did he really quit?

62
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,187
He just said it to not get fired.

63
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,107
I don't understand
how you can like someone that basic.

64
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,735
I don't understand
how you don't like all that.

65
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,489
Miss Paula is Miss Josefina's
only possible successor.

66
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:46,160
She's been adored by many generations
of boys and girls in this school.

67
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,831
She is nice, caring, wise.

68
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,083
-She's such a role model.
-She is.

69
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,127
-Right?
-I agree with you, Tamara.

70
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,879
But Miss Paula is old.

71
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,299
She barely remembers the children's names.

72
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,760
-That's not true.
-However, Miss Dora was a teacher.

73
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,721
And now she's a prefect.

74
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,391
She has a 360-degree view of the school.

75
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,309
And more modern.

76
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,601
That's the thing.

77
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,729
We don't want to be more modern.

78
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,064
Exactly! We have enough of it already.

79
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,318
Miss Dora is like Leonardo DiCaprio
before he won the Oscar.

80
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,278
She's been waiting for years.

81
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,071
-Exactly!
-Thanks.

82
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,865
Fine, but this isn't a movie club.

83
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,866
-Right?
-Correct.

84
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,036
No one wants a prefect as headmistress.

85
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,705
-No.
-Children love teachers.

86
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,790
-Right.
-They're with them all the time.

87
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,292
They listen to them.

88
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,920
All Miss Dora does
is give orders, reprimand.

89
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,674
I just wanted to have
this constructive debate.

90
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,344
Thank you all for coming, mommies.

91
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,846
Just think about it. Oh, sorry.

92
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,139
And Daddy too.

93
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,265
Bye, Tamara.

94
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,642
-By the way--
-Excuse me.

95
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,771
Who thinks Leonardo DiCaprio
is the actor of the century?

96
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,855
Tamara!

97
00:05:56,981 --> 00:06:00,568
You must be happy
with your manipulation exercise.

98
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,737
I know why you defend Miss Dora.

99
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,948
She's your friend.
You invited her to a party at your house.

100
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,867
Jeez, what's wrong with that?

101
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,744
I don't think that's prudent.

102
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,663
A prefect being at that kind of party.

103
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,541
It's funny you're telling me this.

104
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,543
You used to love them.

105
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,170
Don't change the subject.

106
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,633
What's a prefect doing
at one of the fathers' private events?

107
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,634
It's embarrassing!

108
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,094
If that's what you have…

109
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,011
Don't touch me.

110
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,889
…against Dora to harm her,
then you have nothing.

111
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,851
What's embarrassing
is you speaking like that. Ridiculous!

112
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,856
Dad!

113
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,651
Eliseo, time to go.

114
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,277
-Hello!
-Hello, Mr. Olmo.

115
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,780
Olmo.

116
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,409
I'm sorry to inform you that

117
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,912
they don't like you.
You're not popular, Dora.

118
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,039
-I'm the most prepared.
-No.

119
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,959
So was the last presidential candidate,
but no one cared.

120
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,460
They don't care about that.

121
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,547
Children love teachers, not prefects.

122
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,090
Maybe.

123
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,885
But anyway,
that's the least of my problems right now.

124
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,721
By the way, my problems affect you too.

125
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,639
What is it?

126
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,350
Vicente

127
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,018
told me

128
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,647
that he knows
what happened at the party with Bernie.

129
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,109
I can't get that out of my head.

130
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,777
Get it out of your head.

131
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,738
They know nothing. I talked to Tamara.

132
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,741
All they know is you went to the party,
so relax.

133
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,743
-I'm paranoid!
-I can tell.

134
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,289
What are we gonna do with Tamara?
Leave it at that?

135
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,292
Nothing's enough for them.
All they do is screw me over.

136
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,335
I won't let them. You won't let them!

137
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,629
-We must stick together through this.
-Yes.

138
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,757
But we need to find information
against them.

139
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,009
I don't know.

140
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,470
What?

141
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,387
What is it?

142
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,348
Well, that woman is nothing but fire.

143
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,727
She was my teacher.
Everything I know, I learned from her.

144
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,605
I swear. She knows every inch of my body--

145
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,816
Enough, Olmo! Gross!
Why are you telling me this?

146
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,486
So what's the plan?

147
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,570
Well,

148
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,866
I don't like using misogyny
against my enemies.

149
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:12,783
Good.

150
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,410
Because

151
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,622
I'm all in favor
of women's sexual freedom.

152
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,373
You'd better be, Olmo.

153
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,583
But Tamara

154
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,836
has quite the bold tastes.

155
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,257
I'm sure the consul doesn't know
how sexual and passionate she is.

156
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,884
I don't know why she's with him.

157
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,553
Actually, I do.
For status and nothing else.

158
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,056
I'm sure

159
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,642
she's dying for some action.

160
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,018
Some real action.

161
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,353
So?

162
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,563
We'll hit them where it hurts.

163
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,482
Destroy them from inside.

164
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,275
Olmo!

165
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,611
You mean violating their privacy?

166
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,488
I have an idea.

167
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,698
-I know who could help us.
-Daddy!

168
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,825
Sweetie!

169
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,536
Let's go!

170
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,372
Oh my! What will you do
when she finds out who you are?

171
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,583
My little white chocolate! Let's go.

172
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,668
-Bye!
-See you.

173
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,545
-Bye!
-See you tomorrow.

174
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,671
Bye, professor.

175
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,674
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

176
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,133
We already have a gardener.

177
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,927
Jaime! This is embarrassing.

178
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,179
That's Toño, my new friend.

179
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,140
Sorry, miss, my mistake.

180
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,518
He's nothing like your other friends.

181
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,103
Don't be rude, Jaime.

182
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,855
We don't see color in this house,
only hearts.

183
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,692
Come. Forgive him, Toño.

184
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,652
Sorry, miss.

185
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,153
I love your golden tooth.

186
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,280
It's fake.

187
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,281
I still love it.

188
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,448
Where's the bathroom?

189
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,368
At the end of the corridor,
third door on the right.

190
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,620
-I'll be in the backyard.
-Okay.

191
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,258
Hey.

192
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,594
Hello.

193
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,929
-I'm going to--
-Of course, go.

194
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,309
By the way, I didn't tell you, but

195
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,228
I really like your art.
It's transgressive, irreverent.

196
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,397
Really?

197
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,857
-Yes.
-Cool.

198
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,569
Many people think I don't understand
that kind of art as a conservative.

199
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,195
But that's just a prejudice.

200
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,907
You can't judge a book by its cover.

201
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,331
So do you like hard,

202
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,957
brutish,

203
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,709
transgressive sex,

204
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,462
like in the drawings?

205
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,049
I love it.

206
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,801
Like in the drawings.

207
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,011
Yes.

208
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:37,928
Yeah.

209
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,724
-I'm going to pee.
-Of course.

210
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,870
-Hi there.
-Hi. What's up?

211
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,872
-How much is it?
-250.

212
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,377
Two hundred…

213
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,005
and fifty.

214
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,386
And now, tonight's strippers!

215
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,972
-The policeman, the baker.
-Enjoy.

216
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,434
The baseball player and the butcher!

217
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,255
Bravo, girls!

218
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,132
The guys!

219
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,174
Eat them up!

220
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,259
Oh, Roque.

221
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,402
Ma'am?

222
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,822
Need another one,
or maybe something stronger?

223
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:20,740
You know what?

224
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:27,204
Tell the dancer who ran away
that I want a private dance.

225
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,539
-Full service.
-Yes.

226
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:37,840
Hey.

227
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,593
We have to grab something
from a friend's house.

228
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,845
We won't take long. It'll be quick.

229
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,929
Wait here, okay?

230
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,259
Dora.

231
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,470
You got me.

232
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,849
Who knew, Roque?

233
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,227
There's no unworthy job
if it's done with honesty.

234
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,647
I can't make ends meet
just by being a PE teacher.

235
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,650
Did you follow me?
You're in love with me too?

236
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,653
-Do you want to meet the legend?
-Shut up! That's gross.

237
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,321
I'm not here for this.

238
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,323
You don't want to talk or touch.

239
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,950
What do you want?

240
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,161
Just don't say you saw me here.
The school will fire me.

241
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,290
So you want my silence, Roque?

242
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,544
All I need is a little favor.

243
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:02,091
LA SANTA DINER

244
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,441
Good morning.

245
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,122
So they like teachers more?

246
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,207
Then I'll give them a teacher.

247
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,959
Laura, baby.

248
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,007
-Hello!
-Good morning.

249
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,508
Hi.

250
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,863
Good morning, Miss Paula.

251
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,197
Hello.

252
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,117
It's great to see you.

253
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,244
There's something I want to ask you.

254
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,747
Gladly. What is it?

255
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,874
Well, I was thinking

256
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:22,212
that you might be considering retiring.

257
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,132
No, prefect.
Retiring would be the death of me.

258
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,555
Do you want more coffee?

259
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,223
Just half a cup. Thanks.

260
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,558
It'd be my pleasure.

261
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,131
-Here you are.
-Okay.

262
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,967
Delicious.

263
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,094
-I made it.
-Thanks.

264
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,307
It's so good.

265
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,188
-Let's get to the point.
-Right.

266
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,191
Do you need advice? How can I help you?

267
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,860
Well…

268
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,031
I mean, I think…

269
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,783
Well, that you

270
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,911
talk to kids so easily. Right?

271
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,579
You connect with them.

272
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,874
What matters is listening to the children.

273
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,461
Children not only speak with…

274
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,757
with words, but also with their eyes.

275
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,967
Are you okay?

276
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,680
I think my blood pressure's dropping.

277
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,016
That must be it. Have my hot cocoa.

278
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,350
Thanks, prefect.

279
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,439
Drink it.

280
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,774
It's delicious.

281
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,568
I'm kind of getting cold.

282
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,778
Everything's spinning.

283
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,822
What's going on?

284
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,407
Oh, the kids.

285
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,742
Relax.

286
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,124
Take a rest, Miss Old Lady.

287
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,334
Relax.

288
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,378
You won't be headmistress.

289
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,882
Excuse me, Miss Paula.

290
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,718
Help!

291
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,012
Help! Please!

292
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,806
I'm telling you, son.

293
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,351
Women's football is the future of betting.

294
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,479
You could win a lot of money.

295
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,939
But in order to start,

296
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,026
you must put in some money first.

297
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,739
I need some money
and don't know where to get it.

298
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,660
I can't ask my mom for more.

299
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,497
-I don't think so.
-What do you mean?

300
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,168
Are you sure?

301
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,262
What a coincidence!

302
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,848
-Do you come here often?
-Excuse me.

303
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,894
Aren't you the PE teacher at school?

304
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,395
-Yes.
-Wow!

305
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,898
-Shouldn't you be at school?
-I finished early.

306
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,025
I came straight here.

307
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:30,943
Oh really?

308
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,904
These muscles don't get fit by themselves.

309
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,074
What do you think?

310
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,117
Mrs…?

311
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,159
-Tamara.
-Tamara.

312
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,206
Give me some space or…

313
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,332
-Excuse me.
-All right.

314
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,084
See you around.

315
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,670
All right.

316
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,759
The ambulance is taking forever!

317
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,136
And they charge for it?

318
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,428
What a shame.

319
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,597
I know. They said 15 minutes.

320
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,058
-But it's been a while. Poor Miss Paula.
-Yes.

321
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,435
Here they are.

322
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,104
This way.

323
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,232
What happened?

324
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,568
She's diabetic.

325
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,987
I think her sugar levels dropped.

326
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,907
We gave her something sweet,
but she didn't recover.

327
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,660
Did you give her any medication?

328
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,911
Me? No.

329
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,622
Okay, we'll take her to the hospital.

330
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,707
Thanks.

331
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,418
-On your count.
-One, two, three.

332
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,462
I can go with her if you want.

333
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,006
-Just in case.
-Dora.

334
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,257
Yes, okay.

335
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,425
I love Dora.

336
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,677
Thanks, Martha.

337
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,557
What could've happened to Miss Paula?

338
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,852
It's weird.
She's a strong, vigorous person.

339
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,605
She always looks like
she has a long-lasting battery.

340
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,482
She may need a new battery.

341
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:56,528
I personally think
Miss Paula should take a rest.

342
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,489
At least take a vacation, a long holiday.

343
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,492
Excuse me, I have things to do.

344
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,452
Right.

345
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,041
What do you want?

346
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,588
I wanted to discuss
what you may have seen last night.

347
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,674
This isn't a good time, Nico.

348
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,426
-No.
-What happened to you?

349
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,762
Nothing.

350
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,767
Who did this to you?

351
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,103
It doesn't matter.

352
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,271
May I come in?

353
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,398
Sure.

354
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,609
Thanks.

355
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,908
So the mobsters

356
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,327
gave me some more time.

357
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,830
But they ran out of patience.

358
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,540
Why did you get involved in this, Toño?

359
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,171
Why do you and Juana steal?

360
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,009
I don't get it. You don't need to.

361
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,594
You're smart.

362
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,596
Handsome.

363
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,556
Rich.

364
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,184
White.

365
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,729
It makes no sense. Why do you steal?

366
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,735
We steal for the adrenaline.

367
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,490
It adds excitement to our relationship.

368
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,534
So it needs excitement?

369
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,576
-No.
-What?

370
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,621
Juana needs the adrenaline.
It's important to her.

371
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,956
Of course she needs it.

372
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,584
She needs to somehow compensate
for dating a gay guy.

373
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,378
-Right?
-I'm not gay.

374
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,462
Okay.

375
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,718
Neither am I.

376
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,475
I can lend you money
so you get through this.

377
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,436
TRANSFER

378
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,272
No, I don't take charity. Thanks.

379
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,065
I don't like seeing you like this.

380
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,409
Okay. Done. Check it.

381
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,126
It's done.

382
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,294
Thanks.

383
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,338
I'm home!

384
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,347
Damn it! Come on!

385
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,391
Fuck!

386
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,310
JOSEFINA
INCOMING CALL

387
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,022
What is it, Miss Josefina?

388
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,023
Miss Dora.

389
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,859
I have good news and bad news.

390
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,571
The good news is
Miss Paula is feeling way better.

391
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,574
Thank goodness!

392
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,827
The bad news is she wants to retire.

393
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:54,915
So I need you to cover for her.

394
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,920
But I wasn't thinking
of going back to teaching.

395
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:00,837
No…

396
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,090
But don't worry.

397
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,427
I'll make that sacrifice
for Andes San Javier School.

398
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,887
See you Monday.

399
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,680
Wear your teacher's uniform.

400
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,392
Of course. Count on it.

401
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,651
Mrs. Tamara. I don't want to bother you,
but my motorbike is out of gas.

402
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,736
-But--
-I'm soaked. Can you give me a ride?

403
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,530
The gas station is a few blocks away.

404
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,572
-Me?
-Yes.

405
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,075
All right. I don't understand why me.

406
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,284
Thanks.

407
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,369
I mean…

408
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,583
Thanks, Tamara.

409
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,379
Sorry.

410
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,841
I don't want to ruin your upholstery.

411
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,678
See. This climate change thing.

412
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,223
It gets unbearably hot
out of the blue, doesn't it?

413
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,184
-It's here, isn't it?
-Yes, right here.

414
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:58,979
Okay then.

415
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,064
Thank you so much.

416
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,734
At least you didn't have to pay
for an Uber.

417
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,410
Thanks.

418
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,931
Anything else, sir?

419
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:39,019
It smells wonderful, Cleo.

420
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:39,936
Hello.

421
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,397
Sorry, I'm soaking wet.

422
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,566
I'll take a shower. Will you wait for me?

423
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,151
Luckily, it stopped raining.

424
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,112
Did you leave the car windows open
for it to dry?

425
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,239
-I'll do it after I take a shower.
-Tamara!

426
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,574
I'll do it!

427
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,167
This car…

428
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,093
Shit!

429
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,057
I have to take care of everything.

430
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,161
It's time for you to see my world.

431
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,331
You might find the adrenaline you need.

432
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,832
-Hey!
-Hello.

433
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,671
You'll have the time of your lives.

434
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:55,762
Hi!

435
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,556
-What's up, handsome?
-Good. All good?

436
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,473
Cool.

437
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,225
Did you just kiss the waiter on the lips?

438
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,601
Yeah. So what?

439
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,103
Do you know him?

440
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,022
Toño, what is this place?

441
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,733
This is the first gay pulque bar
in Guadalajara.

442
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,026
Have you tried pulque?

443
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,653
No, but

444
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,321
I want to.

445
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,740
What if I get too intense?

446
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,117
Do you come here often?

447
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,371
Of course! My art is also exhibited here.

448
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,665
Cool, right?

449
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,209
I'd never been
to a place like this. I think

450
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,254
it's tacky, but

451
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:30,964
super cool.

452
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,048
I'm thrilled.

453
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,592
Right?

454
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,343
Yes?

455
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,138
Hi, Olmo. Guess what.

456
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,515
I got Miss Paula out of the fight.

457
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,975
Congratulations, Dora.

458
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,311
Thank you.

459
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,521
I mean it. Without you,

460
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,898
I don't know if I'd gone this far.

461
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,401
You're just leveraging your potential.

462
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:55,322
See? Now you're a teacher,
and children love teachers.

463
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,992
Today is a very special day.

464
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,703
Roque began the plan against Tamara.

465
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,413
I'll get all the parents' votes.

466
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,165
We must celebrate.

467
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,082
Where?

468
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,168
I know exactly where.

469
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,252
Perfect.

470
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,213
You're full of surprises, Dora!

471
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,549
Teacher by day, diva by night.

472
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,302
-Prefect by day, Olmo.
-All right, fine.

473
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,261
The diva part…

474
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,221
You'll see. I don't have to tell you.

475
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,266
There are many things you don't know
about me. This is my passion.

476
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,434
Singing.

477
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,436
Anyone can sing, Olmo.

478
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,521
Like Tania Libertad.

479
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,899
No, what I do is perform.

480
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,108
-All right.
-Uh-huh.

481
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,694
-I love it.
-Hi!

482
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,945
What's up?

483
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,990
Hey, Sandra!

484
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,033
I'm glad to see you!

485
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,826
Some mammee juice.

486
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,411
-Excuse me?
-Just joking.

487
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,830
Double whiskey on the rocks.
And make it quick.

488
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,541
Hey, I made it.

489
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,544
-What's up?
-Hello!

490
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,046
My two favorites!

491
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,507
-We were waiting for you.
-Thanks.

492
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,551
Keep an eye on this.
And take good care of my friend Olmo.

493
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,512
It's his first time here.

494
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,638
Show him around.

495
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,474
-I'll sit here.
-Hi. How are you?

496
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,476
-Fine.
-All right.

497
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,603
Let's see now.

498
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,565
Hello, Guadalajara!

499
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,027
Thanks.

500
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,327
What's wrong?

501
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,245
We should go back to Spain.

502
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,332
-Oh, Vicente, there you go again.
-Yes.

503
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,334
We were happy there.

504
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,128
We had peace.

505
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,882
Madrid's water is the best in the world.

506
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,259
And Olmo wasn't there.

507
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,053
Cleo wasn't there either.

508
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,180
That's enough.

509
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:10,391
Once we get the embassy, we'll be happy.

510
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,566
Hey!

511
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,401
What's up, guys?

512
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,112
Check out where I am.

513
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,533
I'm at the most

514
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,410
underground place in Guadalajara.

515
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,328
Like…

516
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,875
Check this out.

517
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,046
I swear.

518
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,673
I feel like I'm in New York.

519
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:45,176
I didn't know places like this
existed here in Guadalajara.

520
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,014
Hello! I'm recording for my channel.

521
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,224
I'm an influencer.

522
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,517
Can I have a free shot?

523
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,434
-Baby.
-Free?

524
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,728
Delete it.
We can't be seen in a place like this.

525
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,647
-Like what, asshole?
-Hey! Aldo, relax.

526
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,568
Calm down.
Just bring us all a round of pulque.

527
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:05,738
All kinds of people come here,
and everyone is respected.

528
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:10,201
Gay people come,
but also straight, non-binary, pansexual…

529
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,245
-From A to Z.
-Yes, the entire alphabet.

530
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,162
Yeah, well.

531
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,831
The best pulque in Guadalajara.

532
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,835
Drink it. Don't taste it, just drink.

533
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,633
Don't drink it all. It's an aphrodisiac.

534
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:28,970
Who would've known?

535
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,348
A few days ago, I was worried sick.

536
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:33,933
And now,

537
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,060
everything's just fine.

538
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,687
Perfect.

539
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,315
The pleasures of power, Dora.

540
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,941
We must trust in the future.

541
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,776
Big things are coming.

542
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,613
Starting with the consuls' defeat!

543
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,739
Olmo.

544
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:51,826
Miss Paula is moving to Vallarta.

545
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,246
A beachfront house, just in case!

546
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,915
Darn, Dora!

547
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,833
I like you.

548
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,753
-I like you too, dear little Olmo.
-Cheers!

549
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,342
Who would've known
a teacher as badly dressed as you

550
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,801
would really get me?

551
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,261
Who?

552
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,679
That's mean, Olmo.

553
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,847
One more pulque!

554
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:17,435
Drink it down!

555
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,173
-I gotta to puke.
-Are you okay, baby?

556
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,050
-Want us to go with you?
-No.

557
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,178
She doesn't look well.

558
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,013
She's not well. Let her go.

559
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,723
Yeah.

560
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,310
How are you?

561
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:00,770
Me?

562
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,605
Fine.

563
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:03,982
Just fine.

564
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,319
Are you gonna stare at me all night?

565
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,196
You have such beautiful eyes.

566
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,408
Under those two eyebrows.

567
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,457
