ACE OF CUPS

2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,930
THE EMPEROR

3
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,018
The process is simple.

4
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,270
You ask out loud.

5
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,648
The fortune teller places the cards.

6
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:28,278
But the main value
isn't in how the arcana are drawn,

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,864
but in how they are interpreted.

8
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,117
All I want to know

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,413
is if I'm going to be headmistress
of Andes San Javier School.

10
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,459

SNAKES AND LADDERS

12
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:52,737
I have to finish these report cards
and deliver them today.

Martha Sánchez.

17
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,876
-What?
-Come.

18
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,799
Hey. Martha Sánchez, please think clearly.

19
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,716
What?

20
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,344
Do you see any dark
in my night last night?

21
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,345
Last night?

22
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,765
You got laid!

23
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,060
-Stop it, Martha Sánchez!
-You got laid!

24
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,353
With whom?

25
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,354
Jeez!

26
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,231
See? All right.

27
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,358
Sometimes the cards are wrong too.

28
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,652
Yes, like with me.
I don't know why I keep asking you.

29
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,987
You never get things right.

30
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,572
-Well…
-Listen!

31
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:39,159
Guess who brought his granddaughter
and is talking to the headmistress.

32
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,952
-Who?
-The governor.

33
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,121
-Yes, look.
-The governor!

34
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,248
This is so exciting!

35
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,332
Hey.

36
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,959
He's so short.

37
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:51,254
He kind of looks taller on TV
and in the newspaper, doesn't he?

38
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,298
Though he does look sharp.

39
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,757
-It's true.
-The pleasure is mine.

40
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,260
-What could they be talking about?
-He's leaving.

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,179
-Teachers, attention.
-Yes.

42
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,138
By my order,

43
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,974
Vicentín stays in Miss Paula's classroom,

44
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,476
and Choquita goes
to Miss Vero's classroom.

45
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,562
Understood?

46
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,938
-Understood, ma'am.
-Yes.

47
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,317
That's a good class.

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,568
She kept Vicentín.

49
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,278
-How are you?
-Look.

50
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,910
WESTERN CHRONICLE

51
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,792
-Good morning, children.
-Hi, miss.

52
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,835
MR. CHOCO
INCOMING CALL

53
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,962
No, Olmo. Not now.

54
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,380
REJECT

55
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,801
Close the door so we can talk.

56
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,854
-You moved the girl to a different class?
-Yes.

57
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,524
Why? Is there a problem?

58
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,984
Well, actually, yes.

59
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,821
Because I don't understand,
considering yesterday and my position.

60
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,907
It seems like a trap.

61
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,660
Well, deliberate betrayal.

62
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,329
As obstacles to me becoming headmistress.

63
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,373
And frankly, I don't deserve it.

64
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,710
Keep your tone down when you address me.

65
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,463
In your opinion, what would be best
for Andes San Javier School?

66
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,300
Because thanks to your position,

67
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:06,472
I had to use all my skills
in the dark arts of diplomacy

68
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,517
to please the governor of Jalisco.

69
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,811
What would you have done in my place?

70
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,523
"The dark arts of diplomacy?"

71
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,984
Yeah, sure. She wants politics?

72
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,945
I'll give her politics.

73
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:25,491
Listen to me,
I'll do something she'll never forget.

74
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,451
Dora.

75
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,244
Dora, stop.

76
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,414
Why are you taking this any further?
It's a children's quarrel.

77
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,833
-They're kids.
-No, this isn't a children's quarrel.

78
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,461
What she wants
is to get me out of the way.

79
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,920
Yes, Martha.

80
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,549
She can't stand the fact
I am going to be headmistress.

81
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,759
There you go again.

82
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,554
May needles prick out her eyes.

83
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,847
Dora.

84
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,475
You know how resentment
gets into your body.

85
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,019
Yes, I know, Martha. And then it rots.

86
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,354
If it does, tough luck.

87
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,357
By the way,

88
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,400
I need to ask for a favor.

89
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,528
-What?
-I need to take some time off.

90
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,447
I know, it's during working hours.

91
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,491
But I won't be long.

92
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,077
-Could you cover for me?
-Fine.

93
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,037
-Thanks.
-Take your curse with you.

94
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,209
Good morning. May I?

95
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,461
Dora. Take a seat.

96
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,422
Thank you very much, Mr. Muriel.

97
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,674
-I'm sorry to bother you.
-No.

98
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,302
No, we can be informal.

99
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,639
We can't be so formal
after everything that happened.

100
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,265
Please don't remind me.

101
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,017
A Chocolmeca. Take it.

102
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,772
It's my new line
of sustainable white chocolate.

103
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:42,693
Made by ancestral Indigenous communities
with whom I have some business dealings.

104
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,861
I got dark.

105
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,279
It's on the inside.

106
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,824
-So? Great, isn't it?
-Yes, very good.

107
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,991
Let's get to the point.

108
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,159
I did see your calls.

109
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,246
But I didn't pick up because,
well, the phone.

110
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,499
But what do you know? What's going on?
Any news on the dead guy?

111
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,419
Don't even mention Bernie to me.
In fact, forget it.

112
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,795
-Forget it.
-I can't.

113
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,839
The calls were to thank you

114
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,092
because I know you did
everything you could to help.

115
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,595
And I know you had nothing to do
with what the headmistress did.

116
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,809
In the end,
we can't control the fate of our children.

117
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,894
And if they're happy--

118
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,898
No, I want to tell you something
that happened at school.

119
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,776
The governor interceded for Vicentín

120
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,778
because he and the consuls
know each other.

121
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:30,950
And because of that, Miss Josefina
authorized the change of classes.

122
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,412
Son of a bitch, the governor.

123
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,874
Sons of bitches! Motherfuckers!

124
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,211
Sucking the government dry
for personal favors is in very bad taste.

125
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,214
I get it from Tamara,
but from him, who's not Mexican?

126
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,593
I'll prepare some cold,
hard-hitting revenge for them.

127
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,760
Yes, Olmo.

128
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,181
Because what they're doing
is an injustice against Choquita.

129
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,348
And against us too.

130
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,727
Well, yes, against us too because,
if you look closely,

131
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,854
they haven't listened to us at all.

132
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,148
And to think this is

133
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,650
because Tamara
can't get over what happened.

134
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,361
-How hard is it to go to therapy?
-It's expensive.

135
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,739
-Is it?
-Well, how can I help you?

136
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,657
No.

137
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:16,037
Nothing. You've done enough for me already
with what happened at my house.

138
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:18,915
By the way,

139
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,043
about your son. What was his name?

140
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,378
-Toño.
-About Toño.

141
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,256
What was it? An emergency?
What happened to him?

142
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,967
It's a personal matter.

143
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,053
No, Dora. No.

144
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,679
I can tell you're worried.

145
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,349
And you can tell me anything.

146
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:40,895
Plus, you left that great party
because something was going on.

147
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,313
A deceased man between us?

148
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,399
Forget that already.
What happened with Toño?

149
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,070
Look, Toño is a good boy.

150
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,032
But since I'm a prefect,

151
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,701
I can't give him
the opportunities I'd like.

152
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,911
Obviously not.

153
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,371
He's an artist.

154
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,081
And a good one.

155
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,292
But, well, he's in a lot of trouble.

156
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,462
I'm even ashamed to tell you, but…

157
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,799
he owes money

158
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,717
to some gangsters.

159
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,637
And

160
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,223
they beat him up that day.

161
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,142
That's why I asked you for the money.

162
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,020
No way, Dora. Has he paid them?

163
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,065
Now they'll leave him alone?

164
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,570
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine. You'll see.

165
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,030
And if it doesn't work out,
we'll make it work out.

166
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,159
Now let's get to what matters to us.

167
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,869
The consuls.

168
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,706
How can we screw them?

169
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,135
Sorry, I'm a little late.
Everything all right?

170
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,386
Everything's fine.

171
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,637
So fine. Right?

172
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,308
-Goodbye, Vicentín.
-Bye.

173
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,892
Don't be disrespectful, Martha.

174
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,604
-Just look at his ass.
-I saw you.

175
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,106
-Everything okay at school today?
-No.

176
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,816
No? Why is that?

177
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,484
I miss Choquita.

178
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,777
You miss her?

179
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,488
-Why do you miss her?
-They moved her to another class.

180
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,906
"Classroom," Vicentín.

181
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,742
Please speak correctly.

182
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,537
Listen, Dad's glad
they moved her to another classroom.

183
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,538
She's my friend!

184
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,914
No.

185
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:24,957
No, son, no.

186
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,879
How can she be your friend
if she's a native?

187
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,424
But tell Dad
why they moved her to another classroom.

188
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,468
-The governor asked for it.
-The governor?

189
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,304
They're saying they moved her
because he's your friend.

190
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,600
-Hi, Vicente--
-Not now.

191
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,728
And what else are they saying, Vicentín?

192
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,563
I don't know, other stuff.

193
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,448
What's up, son?

194
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,242
Toño!

195
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,202
Jeez!

196
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,954
Turns out

197
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,043
Olmo told me that he'll tell
his daughter Juana to call you.

198
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,087
And I think it would be great…

199
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,755
Son, what's that?

200
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,507
-What?
-Go like this.

201
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,052
Jeez, you're missing a tooth.

202
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,553
It's nothing.

203
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,846
Sure, it is.

204
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,058
I'm short of money.
It's the last payment, I swear.

205
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,644
Yes, I'll lend it to you, sure.

206
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,937
I'll give it to you.

207
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,147
But on one condition, Toñito.

208
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,190
What?

209
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:35,903
That you agree to meet
Olmo Muriel's daughter, Juanita.

210
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:39,240
Why? Why would I become friends
with that stuck-up girl?

211
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,742
Your granddad,
my father, may he rest in peace,

212
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,455
always said that you must have a friend
who is a doctor

213
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,957
and a friend who is a lawyer.

214
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,583
But Olmo is a chocolatier.

215
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,419
What does Juana do?

216
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,421
It doesn't matter what she does, son.

217
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:58,008
The point is that you need
to have friends in the right places.

218
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,262
And nobody is in more of a better place
than Juana Muriel.

219
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,139
So I'll make it simple.

220
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,975
Either you become friends
with Juanita Muriel,

221
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,686
or I won't give you the money.

222
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,148
And then you can get to work
so you can pay the dentist.

223
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,150
No. I'll do it.

224
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,943
Of course you will.

225
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,654
-I'll take the deal, Mom.
-You'd be stupid not to.

226
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,742
White Chocolate.

227
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,661
What are you up to?

228
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,873
-What's up, Daddy?
-I have a mission for you.

229
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,793
I want to do my friend Dora a favor.

230
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,170
The prefect?

231
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,465
I freaked out when I saw her
at your birthday party the other day.

232
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,550
-Is she really your friend?
-BFFs.

233
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,470
She's both a father and a mother, like me.

234
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,472
We understand each other perfectly.

235
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,515
-Did you fuck?
-Of course not.

236
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,101
Friendship between
men and women exists, Juana.

237
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,729
Yeah, but you've never introduced me
to a friend before.

238
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:53,856
You're right.

239
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,317
Dora is the first.

240
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,068
Anyway,

241
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,405
the mission is with Toño, her son,
who's a boy your age

242
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,366
with weaknesses
typical of his wild origins.

243
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,994
-As an apprentice?
-Get to know him.

244
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,789
Befriend him. Help him become civilized.

245
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,832
Help him see
that there's much more to life

246
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,293
than just being a gang member. Get it?

247
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,754
If you spend some time together,

248
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:20,049
he'll discover a world full of values,

249
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,384
self-improvement, and success.

250
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,011
-Think you can do it?
-Yes.

251
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,889
I've always wanted to help poor people.

252
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:27,807
Sure.

253
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,519
Plus, I can talk about it on my TikTok
and raise awareness.

254
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,686
Sounds great.

255
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,024
I'll tell Dora to have him
get in touch with you. Thanks.

256
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,043
Yes!

257
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,170
They moved the brat to another class!

258
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,757
It was the least they could do. I mean--

259
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,717
Just like that, they changed their minds?

260
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,511
Well, yes. They came to their senses.

261
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,264
See? In Mexico, there is the rule of law.

262
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,890
And you want to go to Spain?

263
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,685
This is great news.
We should celebrate, huh?

264
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,646
What's with you?

265
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,024
Nothing. It's been a long time
since you've fucked me.

266
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:19,984
Shagged me.

267
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,361
Fine, shagged me.

268
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,154
And why don't you shag me?

269
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,573
Why don't you shag me?

270
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,366
You're so happy.

271
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,869
Yeah, can't someone be happy?

272
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,873
Did you talk to the governor
behind my back?

273
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,875
Of course not.

274
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,918
Tamara, don't lie.
Everyone at school knows.

275
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,087
Even Vicentín. I asked you not to.

276
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,256
It was just something very small.

277
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,924
It was to help our son.

278
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,342
That's corruption.

279
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,219
Again with the corruption thing!

280
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,638
Weren't we going to shag?

281
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,140
Yes, we were.

282
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,476
But that's corruption.

283
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,146
Third world corruption and trickery.

284
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,649
We're better than that, even if we live
in this third world republic.

285
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,193
That's power, Vicente.

286
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,739
It's using connections
when you need them. It's…

287
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,450
Oh, power is so good!

288
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,994
Power turns me on. Don't you like power?

289
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,955
Oh yes! Because nobody tramples on us.

290
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,957
No one ever again.

291
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,918
Imagine

292
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,463
the face of that son of a bitch Olmo!

293
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,132
Will you shut up? For fuck's sake!

294
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,593
-What is this?
-Nothing. Keep going.

295
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,820
LA SANTA DINER

296
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,202
Good day, Laura, baby.

297
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,583
I deserve to be headmistress.

298
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,505
Amen.

299
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,480
There you go.

300
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,108
Let it be the last time.
Please. Okay, son?

301
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,486
-Thanks.
-This is what having a dumb kid is like!

302
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,071
You're right.

303
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,829
Hi, miss.

304
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,915
Prefect, if you please.
Good morning, ma'am.

305
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,792
-Morning, Vicentín.
-Good morning.

306
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,210
-I love you.
-Hi, Vicentín.

307
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,880
It's good everything worked out, huh?

308
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,300
Oh yes. What matters
is that the kids are happy.

309
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,595
Yes, as important
as betting on the winning horse.

310
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,723
Just like me with Miss Paula.

311
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,810
There is no better candidate than her
to lead this school.

312
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,564
I just started a campaign for her

313
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,025
with my friends
to get everyone to vote for her.

314
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,568
Good day.

315
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,653
Sure, have a good day.

316
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,073
-Good day, Roberto.
-Hi.

317
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,366
-Hello, Marianita.
-Hi.

318
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,367
Hello.

319
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,703
Hi, Daddy. Good morning, Choquita.

320
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,871
-Morning, Dora.
-Baby.

321
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,247
Bye, Daddy.

322
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,125
Your ex isn't letting things go, Olmo.

323
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,669
-Hi, sweetie.
-Don't call her my ex.

324
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,172
She's still hooked.
I guess she's still into you.

325
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,007
Now she's against me

326
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,843
and says she'll campaign
to support Miss Paula.

327
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,344
What's up? Good morning.

328
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,056
That's how we were alike.
We're both spiteful.

329
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,432
Well, how ugly.

330
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,727
Hey, turn it to your advantage.
Have you thought about revenge?

331
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,562
I've been brainstorming.

332
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,355
I haven't decided yet. Why?

333
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,066
It's urgent, Olmo.

334
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,360
We need to end this fight
once and for all.

335
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,946
You have to find some weak point
in Tamara.

336
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,783
Yes. I'll give it
some more thought and tell you.

337
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,410
-But Dora--
-No, prefect.

338
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,412
-At school, I'm prefect.
-Prefect.

339
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,413
Good morning.

340
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,500
If she campaigns, I can campaign.

341
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:09,129
And you'll be… well, you will be
headmistress, I swear.

342
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,132
-Good morning, Daddy.
-We have a deal.

343
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,509
Bye, sweetie.

344
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,178
-Good morning, prefect.
-Good morning, Sandra.

345
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,308
-Good morning.
-Morning.

346
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,394
-Who are you delivering to?
-I'm not here to…

347
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,064
I'm a guest.

348
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,732
I'm here to see Juana.

349
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,901
You're here to see Juana?

350
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,571
-Yes.
-How do you know her?

351
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,990
Lopitos, let him in.
He's a friend of the family.

352
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,201
-Come on in.
-Excuse me, Lopitos.

353
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,202
-López.
-Hi.

354
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,288
I'm Juana, but everyone calls me Choco.

355
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,250
Excuse Lopitos.
He doesn't understand diversity.

356
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,502
He's a bit prejudiced
against humble people.

357
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,504
-López.
-Come on in.

358
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,007
Make yourself at home, okay? I mean…

359
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,884
You can touch stuff.

360
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,098
This is exciting. Isn't it?

361
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,434
I mean, it's like a cultural exchange.

362
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,855
I feel like we have
a lot to learn from each other.

363
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,357
-Yes.
-My dad told me that you like art.

364
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,609
-I love it--
-I love art.

365
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,445
Well, in this house we love art.

366
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,738
I'm a visual artist.

367
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,031
Where did you study?

368
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,161
Study? I haven't studied,
but you can learn without school.

369
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,289
Yes, but school
is where you make all your connections,

370
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,791
meet art dealers, and all that.

371
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,420
I mean, I'm not an expert,
but connections are everything.

372
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,213
I'm more into art for art's sake.

373
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,299
Oh no, that's communism.

374
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,384
That's what Dad says.

375
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,012
Wanna see his collection?

376
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:40,929
Come.

377
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,601
I've seen this one before.

378
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,521
Yes, you've seen imitations,
but this is the real deal.

379
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,899
I dig this artist.

380
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,776
I know almost all his work.

381
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,069
-Wow.
-Yeah.

382
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,906
Who taught you if you didn't go to school?

383
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,492
I'm self-taught.

384
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,411
I love your story.

385
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,707
It's like a story of self-improvement.
I wanna see your work.

386
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,543
Because if they're this good,
my dad can buy one from you.

387
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,878
Or several.

388
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,630
-For real?
-Yes, he always buys.

389
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,424
-To him, it's like an investment.
-I don't know.

390
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,593
I don't think your dad
would like what I do.

391
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,844
My work is more

392
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,430
transgressive.

393
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,015
He wouldn't hang it here.

394
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,769
I'm curious. Let's see.

395
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,854
-Is it like graffiti?
-It's a mix of--

396
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,064
I don't love graffiti.

397
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,234
I mean, the whole "tagging" walls
is hard for me. You know?

398
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,027
Not because they're grungy.

399
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,321
It's their way of leaving their mark
on the world.

400
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,073
Like cavemen.

401
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:44,660
Yeah, I don't know if it's his style,
your dad's style.

402
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,956
Transgressive.

403
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,124
Transgressive, yes.

404
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,005
There, I kind of…

405
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,091
I don't know if life
is always black and white.

406
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:03,053
That's why the ejaculation
is kind of pink, blue, purple,

407
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,429
different colors.

408
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,516
That's an homage
to Adam and Eve, but inclusive.

409
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,352
Instead of apple, Adam likes banana more.

410
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,353
Nice. Isn't it?

411
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,150
-Ready?
-Somewhat.

412
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,112
But someone has to stand up for Spain.

413
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,990
It's important
that the right-wing youth of Jalisco

414
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,325
know that they have an ally
in the motherland.

415
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:29,830
And that the governor gets to know you
so he feels comfortable with you.

416
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,792
I don't want you to be
just Tamara's husband.

417
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,087
I want them to see you
as a good Spanish man.

418
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,383
How will he see me as a good Spanish man
if you step over me to talk to him?

419
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,303
Men have codes,
which are that women shouldn't interfere.

420
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,346
I know. I won't interfere anymore.

421
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,308
You take care of getting that embassy,
and I won't get involved.

422
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,685
The embassy is assigned
by the Spanish government.

423
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,978
I know that. This one.

424
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,856
We've discussed this
a thousand times, Vicente.

425
00:21:56,356 --> 00:22:00,485
But Spain has interests here in Jalisco,
and that's where you come in.

426
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,572
With your friends
from the telephone company.

427
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,408
You help them fix their problems
with the government here,

428
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,951
and they get you the embassy.

429
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,163
-Corruption.
-Again with the corruption thing!

430
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,915
Fuck! That's how the world works.
With corruption.

431
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,544
That's how Mexico works
and how Spain works, like it or not.

432
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,380
But you'll do everything

433
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,966
to get that embassy. Right?

434
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,345
-Because you want your wife to be happy.
-Yes.

435
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,848
That's right. If you let me, we'll get it.

436
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:30,849
All right.

437
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,768
I'll stay out of it. I promise.

438
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,979
Just change your shoes. Okay?

439
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,702
Vicente. Welcome, man.

440
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,164
The Spanish right
is well represented, damn it!

441
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,124
Of course, Mr. Governor.

442
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,087
Although some wimps
would say "the ultra-right."

443
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,714
Let's have a drink and eat. Come on.

444
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:03,882
-Or talk.
-Yes.

445
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,218
Look, I want to make something clear.

446
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,680
I didn't agree
to Tamara's request about the school.

447
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,974
It's just kids' stuff.

448
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,351
Anyway,

449
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:18,397
I must thank you
for acting like a brother of Spain.

450
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,858
There's no need to thank me, man.

451
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,863
Life is nothing but a chain of favors.

452
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,408
And as Iberian brothers,

453
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,744
I have something
that I think you can help me with.

454
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,912
Anything.

455
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,582
Look, all my life,

456
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,293
I've wanted to be European.

457
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,837
I mean, I wasn't born there.

458
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,630
But I have ancestors.

459
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,884
And I need to get
my Sephardic certificate.

460
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,011
But are you Jewish or…?

461
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,054
No.

462
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,556
I normally

463
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:58,395
present myself to the Mexican voters
as 100% Guadalupian.

464
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,397
-Guadalupian?
-Yes.

465
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:02,941
Listen.

466
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,152
Here in Mexico,

467
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,197
there are two things you need to respect,
no matter who you are.

468
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,535
The Virgin of Guadalupe and Juan Gabriel.

469
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,745
You'd better keep that in mind.

470
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,500
So? Could you help me with my nationality?

471
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:24,004
You can count on it.

472
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,589
Plentiful.

473
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,967
In fact, I have some colleagues…

474
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,137
Well, they're partners
of one of the top telephone companies.

475
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,475
They can't install their antennas
here in Jalisco because Congress

476
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,060
hasn't made it easy for them.
You know what I mean?

477
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,856
You're making it
a little difficult for me, Vicente.

478
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,775
Because not everyone in Congress likes me.

479
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,028
But you're charming.

480
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,572
My precious governor.

481
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,825
Don't say that bullshit again.

482
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,453
At first, I thought of asking Olmo

483
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,372
to pull his strings

484
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,875
and make Josefina disappear.

485
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:06,171
But then I thought it'd be better
to ask him to help Toño

486
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,675
because, well,
if I'm gonna be headmistress,

487
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,304
I might as well do it
through my own means, with my own plan.

488
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,306
-Well, let's see.
-Start dealing.

489
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:20,852
Here goes.

490
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,189
THE SUN

491
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:27,984
What?

492
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,947
The sun and the tower
foretell darkness on your path.

493
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,241
No! That's not right, Martha Sánchez,

494
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,619
because I feel
I'll overcome any difficulty.

495
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,205
Even with Tamara
sticking her nose in everything.

496
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,999
Or maybe even making Josefina disappear.

497
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,125
Hey, wait.

498
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,336
Let's see.

499
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,339
DEATH

500
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:51,841
What?

501
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,718
It's not literal, my friend.

502
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,264
But, well, I do see a very thorny road.

503
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,058
Full of obstacles. Many obstacles.

504
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,726
Obstacles?

505
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,061
Well, I don't know.

506
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,438
A man.

507
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:10,110
It says he's like a man from your past.
I know there aren't many men in your past.

508
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,238
Nor in your present.
Maybe not even in your future.

509
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,364
That's just mean!

510
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,616
I don't know who it could be.

511
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,534
Well…

512
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,414
Are you sure
you didn't meet anyone at that party?

513
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,334
It says he's like a ghost.

514
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,545
No.

515
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,798
Don't scare me. Martha, please.

516
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,758
You're scaring me.

517
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,386
-Ready?
-Ready.

518
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,848
Is this okay for a political event?

519
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,600
Yes, it's perfect.

520
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,143
-Okay.
-What's that?

521
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,644
I've been meaning to tell you.

522
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,398
Wow.

523
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,649
It's cute, isn't it?

524
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,109
Did you steal it?

525
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,778
No, I commissioned it.
Remember the prefect?

526
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,405
-Yeah.
-Her son's name is Toño.

527
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,990
My dad asked me to help him.

528
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,200
So I commissioned a piece from him.

529
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,204
It was expensive, but I asked him,
"What's your best offer?"

530
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,831
And they always bring it down.

531
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,666
Are you really gonna help this guy?

532
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,003
Come on. I know it's a favor
for your dad and all, but

533
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,047
the prefect's son?

534
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,757
He's trendy, babe.

535
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,176
All right.

536
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,471
I invited him today. And besides,

537
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,349
he can help us steal.

538
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,684
He can be the lookout.

539
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,062
And he wants to help?

540
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,981
Does he have to know?

541
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,908
Mr. Governor.

542
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,242
My goodness!

543
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,494
Nicolás Patiño.

544
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,120
Of course I remember you, kid.

545
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,246
This is my girlfriend.

546
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,331
-Juana Muriel.
-Hello.

547
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,874
-A pleasure.
-Likewise.

548
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,000
Look, Chente.

549
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,462
This is Nicolás Patiño.

550
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:56,007
He's one of our youth group leaders.

551
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,676
He's giving a speech tonight.

552
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:02,389
It's an honor to be
on the right side of history.

553
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,558
Especially with the culture war
we find ourselves in.

554
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,893
A silver tongue.

555
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:07,811
I'm telling you.

556
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,730
This kid has a great, great future.

557
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:14,943
And that's what we need,
fresh ideas to revitalize the party.

558
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,278
And above all, to reach the new youth.

559
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,697
-Right?
-Yes.

560
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,031
-Welcome.
-Thanks.

561
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,158
-One more drink?
-Toño! I'm glad you're here!

562
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,993
-Come.
-You two finally meet.

563
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,707
Nicolás Patiño.

564
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,834
Toño Gómez López. How are you?

565
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,960
Nice to meet you.

566
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,504
Would you like a drink?

567
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,926
Are you sure you didn't meet anyone
at that party?

568
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,512
A man.

569
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,181
It says he's like a ghost.

570
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,476
Could it be that someone
found out about the dead guy?

571
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,146
What ghost does she mean?

572
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,565
-Juana told me that you're an artist.
-I am.

573
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:57,026
In fact, she haggled for the painting.
But you liked it, didn't you?

574
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,237
The earthquake alarm didn't go off.

575
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,739
I guess I had too much to drink.

576
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,283
We've had too much to drink, Vicente.

577
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,243
In fact, I know your mom.

578
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,079
-Prefect Dora.
-Really? Was she your teacher?

579
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,038
Yes.

580
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,082
She told me we played together as kids.

581
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,167
Dora…

582
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,169
-Miss Dora?
-Yes.

583
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,920
Dora is Toño's mom.

584
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:19,215
We ran into her a couple of nights ago
at my girlfriend's dad's party.

585
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,467
-Yes.
-Olmo Muriel.

586
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,220
Your girlfriend's dad's party?

587
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,221
Yes, my dad.

588
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,058
You're Choco?

589
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,436
Yes, nice to meet you.

590
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,232
That damn guy is a true Spaniard.

591
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,447
Hello, miss. Good morning.

592
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,080
Good morning.

593
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,166
Good morning.

594
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,421
I'll give us a little privacy.

595
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,465
If you don't mind, of course.

596
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,178
I don't want anyone to see or hear us.

597
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,347
Well, Mr. Consul,

598
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,016
I guess you got what you wanted,
didn't you?

599
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,476
Enough with the lies.

600
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,269
We know the truth.

601
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:15,980
About what?

602
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,611
We know what you and Olmo did
at that party.

603
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,822
What? What party?

604
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,742
We have witnesses
who saw you late at night.

605
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,412
I don't know what you're talking about.

606
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,960
You know damn well
what we're talking about.

607
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:45,009
I guess you thought
we weren't going to find out what you did.

608
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,344
Right, teacher?

609
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,555
I'm telling you,

610
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,140
there will be consequences.

611
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,936
If you'll excuse us.

612
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,327
The dead guy!

613
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,003
