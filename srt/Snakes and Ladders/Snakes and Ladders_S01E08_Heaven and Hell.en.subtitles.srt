1
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,239
Traitor!

2
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,533
Witch!

3
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,038
Traitor!

4
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:44,919
There's one thing worse
than our dreams becoming nightmares.

5
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,049
And that's our nightmares
becoming reality.

6
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,926
Traitor!

7
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,888
That's why we should be careful

8
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,682
about what we dream.

9
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,690
SNAKES AND LADDERS

10
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,200
Miss Josefina.

11
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,328
Didn't we have a deal?

12
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,705
We had two deals.

13
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,542
My new job in exchange for elections.
I did my part.

14
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,169
I can't change the parents' votes.

15
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,215
It also surprises me
that Martha Sánchez is so popular.

16
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,426
But if you'd like,
I can give up my seat on the board.

17
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,929
However, the shares

18
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,556
are in my name now.

19
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,017
It was a great pleasure
doing business with you, Mr. Olmo.

20
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,270
Or, better yet, partner.

21
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,692
Fucking hag.

22
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,321
Dora.

23
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,574
Don't worry.

24
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,120
The new headmistress
will be easier to manipulate.

25
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,748
What's the use?

26
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,585
Losing is not an option.

27
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,713
What happened with the consuls' video?

28
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,047
Nothing, Olmo.

29
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,174
Nothing happened.

30
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,385
You can't even see Roque's useless ass.

31
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,137
It was a total failure.

32
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,222
Yet another failure!

33
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,518
What?

34
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,812
UNKNOWN NUMBER
ACCEPT

35
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,980
Yes?

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,484
What?

37
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,486
No! I'm on my way.

38
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,530
I'm going. Thanks.

39
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,448
Thanks.

40
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,410
Toño was arrested.

41
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,370
For theft.

42
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,623
I'll do my best to get you out.

43
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,666
Someone framed me.

44
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,420
-Juana.
-Juana. Fucking shit.

45
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,588
Relax.

46
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,758
I have no choice
but to tell the police the truth.

47
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,885
No. Don't be naive, Nico.

48
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,055
No one would believe us.
No one. Don't get involved.

49
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,765
Don't get yourself in trouble.

50
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,144
I suspected Toño was up to no good.

51
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,189
I believed him when he denied it.
I'm so stupid.

52
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,399
Everything will be okay.
I'll make sure of it.

53
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,276
Go, Dora. I'll be right there.

54
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,452
SAN JAVIER MOMS

55
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,162
THE CAR

56
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,673
They offered me the embassy.

57
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,383
What?

58
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,884
The governor agreed.

59
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,719
My bosses are ecstatic.

60
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,720
What about you?

61
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,514
Is it what you want?

62
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,225
Isn't this what you wanted?

63
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,769
Yes, but I never asked you
what you wanted.

64
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,312
I'm not sure if I want to stay.

65
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,064
Look, Vicente.

66
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,526
Whatever you choose
will be the best for everyone.

67
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,040
-Why are you showing me that?
-It's your car, Juana.

68
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,292
Yeah, right.

69
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,376
Are you stealing?

70
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,462
Your friend Toño is in trouble.
What a coincidence.

71
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,757
Why would you say that, Daddy?
I have no need to steal.

72
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,634
This video is in every group chat!

73
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,138
The Orendains will report it,
and they'll come after you.

74
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,056
The bigger the problem,

75
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,600
the harder it'll be for me to solve,
damn it!

76
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,021
Okay, it was me.

77
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,817
But Nicolás and I did that sometimes
just for fun.

78
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,863
And Toño was our lookout.
It was the three of us, but…

79
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,494
Since he stole my boyfriend,
that's why it's just me in the video.

80
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,873
Because they both left me to rot.

81
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,711
And I hate being left to rot!

82
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,423
Okay, I understand.

83
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,925
But you gotta go to the police.

84
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,969
And do what? Tell them the truth?

85
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:50,141
That my boyfriend left me for my friend,
so I framed him?

86
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,356
I'm gonna lose all my followers.

87
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,444
They'll burn me. You don't get it, Dad!

88
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,989
You won't say
you broke into several houses.

89
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,492
Just the one in the video, to help Toño.

90
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,743
I mean, poor Dora.

91
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,538
I'll talk to the Orendains. We're friends.

92
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,040
They come to my parties.

93
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,251
No worries, I'll fix this. Okay?

94
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,802
Nicolás, there must be something
we can do.

95
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,303
I don't know.

96
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,389
How much do the police want?

97
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,681
No, Dora.

98
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,225
Not here.

99
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,267
Attention!

100
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,479
Attention! My daughter
has something to say.

101
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,610
I took the sculpture.

102
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,946
I mean, I framed Toño to get out of it,

103
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,697
but it was a mistake.

104
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,952
I want to say I'm really sorry
for all the pain I might've caused.

105
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,956
I grew up without a mom.

106
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,041
If you could understand that.

107
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,085
-I have no mother figure.
-Bullshit.

108
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,506
Toño is innocent. Let him go.

109
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,758
This is what Mexico needs.

110
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,427
Honest people

111
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,138
who look to the future
instead of the past.

112
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:15,852
I hope you can all learn
from this lovely example.

113
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,230
I spoke to the Orendain family.
This is all over.

114
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,149
Thank goodness we're privileged.

115
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,068
-Officer, come on!
-Out, little girl.

116
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,155
Thank you so much.

117
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,990
What are you looking at?

118
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,168
Welcome. How are you?

119
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,711
Welcome to school.

120
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,421
Good morning, Martha Sánchez.

121
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,256
Hi, headmistress!

122
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,384
-Hello, Martha Sánchez.
-Welcome, Martha.

123
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,844
Welcome, Martha.

124
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:16,996
Hello.

125
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,165
Tamara?

126
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,959
We owe you an apology
after what happened the other day.

127
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,545
We'd like to invite you over for tea.

128
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,672
We have a proposal that will interest you.

129
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,799
I mean, it's not a sexual encounter.

130
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,469
It's something cooler.

131
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,637
Are you coming?

132
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,680
Your daughter, Juana, sir.

133
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,434
She's huge on social media
after her ex's thing. It's bad.

134
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,685
It's hate.

135
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,104
She's being "canceled," as the kids say.

136
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,317
I want to counterattack the hate legally.

137
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,819
The thing is,
people have made the connection

138
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,489
that Juana is your daughter.
They're calling her a nepo baby.

139
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,867
That she was born
with a silver spoon in her mouth.

140
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,036
And what the hell is wrong with that?

141
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:57,954
Sir.

142
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,583
The top media outlets in Guadalajara
are revealing questionable aspects

143
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,544
about you and the company.

144
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,420
They just released your tax return,

145
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,965
and people are saying
that you haven't paid taxes in six years.

146
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,761
-They're comparing you to Salinas Pliego.
-All because of Juana's video?

147
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,846
Same thing happened to Mr. Hank.

148
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,098
My pal?

149
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,891
His daughter was canceled too.

150
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,059
Shit.

151
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,270
Nicolás Patiño.

152
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:26,065
Many forces in the party
are applauding what is happening to you.

153
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,275
Have a seat.

154
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,242
Look, I used to be one of those people
who thought that gay people

155
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,703
were better off in the closet.

156
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,122
But someone made me reconsider,

157
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,374
and now I'm convinced

158
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:47,837
that what our party needs
is people like you to stay relevant.

159
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,715
You mean I'm welcome back in the party?

160
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,924
Not just that.

161
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,761
I want to suggest

162
00:09:56,512 --> 00:10:00,182
that you be the new face
of the new right wing gay youth.

163
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,102
Look.

164
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,855
I would like you

165
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:11,110
to flood social media with speeches
in which you brag about belonging

166
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,363
to this new,
more inclusive right wing party.

167
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,325
Look, if the average Joe

168
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:21,829
realizes that a gay man
can be someone from a good family,

169
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,791
smart, elegant, sensitive, attractive,

170
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,252
it'll be easier for them
to vote for a gay man.

171
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,963
They'll even feel represented.

172
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,258
-I totally agree.
-Right?

173
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,052
Deal?

174
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,011
Deal.

175
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,807
Being gay. Being young. Being right wing.

176
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,476
It makes sense.

177
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,354
Being gay and right wing
is a contradiction.

178
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,231
It's a sham.
What's up with your son's boyfriend?

179
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,485
Just yesterday we were teaming up
to get your son out of jail,

180
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,111
and this is how he repays me?

181
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:59,158
I don't see how one thing
has anything to do with the other.

182
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,077
It's all connected, Dora.

183
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,205
If it weren't for my daughter,
he'd be in the closet.

184
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,833
Juana is the architect
of his rise in politics.

185
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,753
But as usual, since she's a woman,
they ignore her part.

186
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,463
-Yeah.
-They attack her!

187
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,674
-Right.
-That, Dora, is the patriarchy.

188
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,800
We can't let it happen.

189
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,095
I don't think Nico Patiño
is doing this to harm you.

190
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,429
Stop defending him.

191
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,265
Don't make me talk to the hand, Olmo.

192
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,225
Don't defend him.

193
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,060
-I don't like it.
-Fine.

194
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,316
-Nico Patiño.
-Hi, Dora.

195
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,859
What's up?

196
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,445
I'm waiting for Toño.
He's taking me to an interview.

197
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,322
I see.

198
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,952
-I heard you got back in the party.
-I did.

199
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,995
That's excellent news.

200
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,164
Take a seat. Make yourself at home.

201
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,458
Is Toño upstairs?

202
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:50,918
Yeah.

203
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:55,214
Well, I'll keep you company
for a while, huh?

204
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,008
Now that you're here…

205
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,679
Well, I've been meaning to talk to you.

206
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,140
Olmo is really worried about Juanita.

207
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,100
People on social media

208
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,769
are harassing her bad.

209
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,732
I was thinking
maybe you could help her out.

210
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,859
Help her? Me? How?

211
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:18,529
I mean, those people who harass her
do it to defend you.

212
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,449
I think if you spoke up
and told them to relax…

213
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,076
Like, "There's no beef between us."

214
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,411
There's not?

215
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:29,707
I mean, what I can see
is that Juanita made an effort

216
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,586
to put aside her pain, her bitterness,

217
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,337
to help Toño out.

218
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,340
Sounds like we'd be rewarding her
for doing what she was supposed to.

219
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,177
Besides, if I defend her,

220
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,262
they'll attack me too,

221
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,681
and it took a lot to get where I am.

222
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,434
But it's the right thing to do,
Nicolás Patiño.

223
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,020
You say that
because things didn't go your way.

224
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:55,065
Look. First, don't disrespect me.

225
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,942
I'm a Mrs.

226
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,153
Mrs. Dora.

227
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,488
Secondly,

228
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,032
it's simpler than that, Nicolás Patiño.

229
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:07,161
It's all about being okay
and being friends.

230
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,246
There are no friends in politics, Dora.

231
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,709
Oh, Roque.

232
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,630
You have no idea
how grateful we are to you.

233
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,216
I didn't do anything.

234
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,884
Don't sell yourself short.

235
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,970
You helped us so much. Right, love?

236
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,224
I've decided to give up
my far right political affiliations.

237
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,226
Although, I'm still a conservative.

238
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:32,978
Conservative?

239
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,481
Isn't that someone who doesn't like sex?

240
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,651
No, Roque, that's a baseless myth!

241
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,152
I'm conservative.

242
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,863
A fervent defender of traditional family.

243
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,116
In fact, I believe in it so much

244
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,119
that I decided to open myself up
to some sexual practices that are…

245
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,746
-Different!
-Different!

246
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,997
Just to avoid divorce.

247
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,209
Better dead than divorced,
as my mother used to say.

248
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,128
We're going back to Spain.

249
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,506
And we'd like you to come with us.

250
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,301
-You want me to be your lover in Spain?
-No.

251
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,680
We want to open a sexual wellness clinic.

252
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,974
For couples that need help.

253
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,685
Spaniards need to be taught
how to shag properly.

254
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,478
Who's better than a professional like you?

255
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,523
But you didn't even give me a chance
to show off my true skills.

256
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,068
No need to tell us now.

257
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,529
Sleep on it.

258
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,073
Think about it and let us know.

259
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,954
Things are complicated, sir.

260
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:36,792
Just today, your Indigenous partners
pulled out of Olmo Chocolates

261
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,627
claiming exploitation.

262
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,380
Some countries blocked the exports.

263
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,966
And the federal government
is launching an investigation

264
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,678
against you and the company
for tax evasion.

265
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,971
Exploiter!

266
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,849
They're shameless.

267
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,767
And that's not the worst of it, sir.

268
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,521
Anonymous sources
have made the news saying that…

269
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,189
Yes, tell him.

270
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,316
-That--
-What?

271
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,320
Well, that you diverted funds
from your foundation,

272
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,198
"Diabetes-Free Kids
for very happy children, sugar-free,"

273
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,700
to the governor's campaign.

274
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,411
I've set up a press conference
to clear things up.

275
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,537
How dare they?

276
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,539
That was forever ago!

277
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,208
Get out! Leave me alone!

278
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,627
-Not you.
-Excuse me.

279
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,087
Olmo, relax.

280
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,716
Don't tell me to relax.
I'm going to fix this.

281
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,345
Hey, Governor. How are we doing?

282
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,389
I bet you're busy with work.

283
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:36,977
I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't extremely important.

284
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,604
It's about

285
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,399
some gossip that's going around.

286
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,361
And also about our deal.

287
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,820
You know what I mean.

288
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,323
Call me when you get a chance.

289
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,201
He didn't get it.

290
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,495
NOT RECEIVED
NUMBER OUT OF SERVICE AREA

291
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:55,996
He blocked me.

292
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,415
The governor blocked me.

293
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,632
What's with him?

294
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,760
Olmo! Relax! Here, take your cane.

295
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,178
Relax, Olmo.

296
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,638
Look.

297
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,557
You helped me with Toño's little problem.

298
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,393
Relax, breathe.

299
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:22,690
Well, now, since we're besties,
it's my turn to pay you back.

300
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:26,652
That is, I will advocate for you.
I'll call the governor.

301
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,028
He hasn't blocked me.

302
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,615
-But I need you to calm down.
-Okay.

303
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,034
-Sir!
-Relax!

304
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,953
-Sir.
-Joaquín.

305
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,789
Can you clarify your finances
with the tax authorities?

306
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,375
Is it true that you paid less taxes
than Salinas Pliego?

307
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,086
Those are nothing but lies. Slander!

308
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,132
Now it turns out
that it's time to pile on Olmo.

309
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,259
I don't quit. And I don't give up.

310
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,469
-I'm not afraid of anything.
-No.

311
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,972
Neither the fallacies of the press

312
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,684
nor the malice of those in power
who bite the hand that feeds them.

313
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,270
I know things about them.

314
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,649
And they won't be happy
when I air their dirty laundry.

315
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,110
All the shit I know about the government!

316
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,445
Do you mean the governor?

317
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,823
-No further comment. Bye.
-Are you in business with the governor?

318
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,033
No.

319
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,075
Please!

320
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,579
Olmo, I told you to be calm. Relax!

321
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,497
Why did you say all that?

322
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,499
That'll turn the governor against you.

323
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,209
I was pissed off.

324
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,170
This new coke makes me lose my temper.

325
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,463
Ew, gross!

326
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,756
But I'm right.

327
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,007
-Of course not.
-Mr. Olmo.

328
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,383
Not now, Lopitos.

329
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,634
It's important.

330
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,138
-I'm giving my two weeks' notice.
-Don't fuck with me, Lopitos!

331
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,098
Sir, it's time to retire.

332
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,102
You don't value me.
You never made me your chief of security.

333
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,812
I'm not in the mood.

334
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,938
Retire?

335
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,024
You don't even have a contract, idiot.

336
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,317
You can leave if you want!

337
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,986
But don't come
asking for more money, Lopitos.

338
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,321
López, sir!

339
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,782
Like our former president.

340
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,367
Same way we forgot about him,

341
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,411
I'll forget about you.

342
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,497
Lopitos!

343
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,632
That's what
the Hispanic Heritage Day is for,

344
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:15,385
to celebrate the eternal union
between Spain and Latin America.

345
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,013
You will always carry Mexico
in your heart.

346
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,476
All right, but can I invite Choquita?

347
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,565
She's my best friend, my bestie.

348
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,277
First and foremost,

349
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,197
I'd like to apologize for the other night.

350
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,074
I was nervous,

351
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,368
and when I get nervous,

352
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,745
I speak like a diplomat.

353
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,413
Without thinking.

354
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,791
We all make mistakes.

355
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,836
I love it. You're very compassionate.

356
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,548
And thanks to you,
I've come to my senses.

357
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,966
You know, Dora,

358
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,928
when you're in power, everyone humors you.

359
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,265
And honesty is appreciated.

360
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:08,147
Well, frankly, I just did
what I considered to be common sense.

361
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,066
Sometimes I wonder

362
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,863
what the future holds
for such a brilliant personality.

363
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:20,701
What exactly does a woman like you want?

364
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,454
Well, to be honest,

365
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,251
since I started working decades ago,

366
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,838
I've always dreamed of being headmistress
of Andes San Javier School.

367
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,131
Power

368
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,967
is what you want.

369
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,926
Of course,

370
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,345
you'd have to do something for me.

371
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,014
What?

372
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,473
Olmo Muriel.

373
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,726
I've heard you're friends.

374
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:51,356
He has become an inconvenience
to this government.

375
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,567
His personality is hard to handle.

376
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,819
Surely you know something

377
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,572
he wants kept under wraps.

378
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,324
No.

379
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,366
Dora.

380
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,202
Help me,

381
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,370
and I'll help you.

382
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,667
Well, Olmo is…

383
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,377
He's my friend.

384
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,589
There are no friends here, Dora.

385
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,675
Got it? There are no friends.

386
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,391
No!

387
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,770
No!

388
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,463
Traitor!

389
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,686
It's disappointing that you don't know
what to do at this point.

390
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,313
Antonio?

391
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,566
About what?

392
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,279
Olmo and the governor, obviously.

393
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,407
I can't betray my friend.

394
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,951
That's why you killed me?

395
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:30,747
To remain a loser here,
stuck in mediocrity,

396
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,292
a measly teacher?

397
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,378
You have one chance in life
to do something,

398
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,257
and you reject it for a bastard who,
should you disappear tomorrow,

399
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,759
would go on vacation with his daughters.

400
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,470
He has it all covered.

401
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,473
He knows what happened to you.

402
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,183
He could expose me.

403
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,603
The chocolatier is not invincible.

404
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:57,316
You need to choose, traitor or loser?

405
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,192
They invited you?

406
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:00,777
And are you going?

407
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:04,156
The cynics invited Choquita
to their Hispanic Heritage Day party.

408
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,909
But I told them what to do
with their colonialist party.

409
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,121
Olmo, you have to stop burning bridges.

410
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,706
You have very few friends,

411
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,916
and you're rude to the ones you have left.

412
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,252
But this is all their fault!

413
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,464
You blame everyone for your problems.

414
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:24,092
Now is not the time.
You can't put on airs.

415
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,218
What?

416
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,720
Honestly, Olmo,

417
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,221
if you ask me,

418
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,975
I think you should go to the party
and show your face.

419
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,686
For fuck's sake! You're right.

420
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,021
I'll do that.

421
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,857
I'll go to the party
flaunting my best smile.

422
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,026
Exactly.

423
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,634
Coming, Pedro!

424
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,095
What's that costume?

425
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,513
Juan del Diablo.

426
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,431
From Wild Heart.

427
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,225
All right.

428
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,983
-Mister Governor!
-Tamarita.

429
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,652
Such an honor to have you here!

430
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,779
Thanks for inviting us.

431
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,031
Are you Pancho Villa?

432
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,282
Gay Pancho Villa.

433
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,910
Such a funny kid!

434
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,292
-Welcome.
-Hello.

435
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,838
-Hi.
-Wow! Another Villa!

436
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,256
I'm the pansexual Villa.

437
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,633
Excuse me.

438
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,301
Cool!

439
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,470
They're our besties, Mom.

440
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,433
-Wannabe Spaniards.
-Toño, don't be annoying.

441
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:59,062
Seriously. Way to be mean, son.

442
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,900
This witch was overdue.

443
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:04,818
Who?

444
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,862
Elba Esther Gordillo, the schoolteacher.

445
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,447
Howdy!

446
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,699
Welcome!

447
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,577
Olmo, Choquita,
what a pleasure to have you here.

448
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,995
What are your costumes?

449
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,539
Tonantzin.

450
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:22,127
And Flores Magón, the anarchist
who refused to submit to the oligarchy!

451
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,378
You'd never understand!

452
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,466
Tonantzin, come.
Don't listen to them. They're horrible.

453
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,633
Olmix!

454
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,094
-Hello.
-Hi.

455
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,012
Say hi.

456
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,388
-Hi.
-Hello, Olmo.

457
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,306
Did you see?

458
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,145
-Choquita, let's go play.
-Be good.

459
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,898
-Hi, Vicentín.
-Wanna play hide-and-seek?

460
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,359
-I'll get some drinks.
-Don't let him do that!

461
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,778
-He patted me.
-Don't let anyone humiliate you.

462
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,447
Should I go beat him up, Mom?

463
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,490
Shut up!

464
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,202
Hello?

465
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,121
-Did you find anything, Lopitos?
-López, ma'am.

466
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,124
And yes, there's plenty of footage.

467
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,542
Have you made the other call?

468
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,085
No.

469
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,504
But I'll do it right away.

470
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,172
Hurry up, López.

471
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,132
Yes, see you soon, ma'am.

472
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,637
I'd like to apologize to Nicolás.

473
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,639
I agree with all of you,

474
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:19,893
my fans, my followers,
and everyone who now wants…

475
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:21,895
Lopitos?

476
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,439
You're here? Didn't you get fired?

477
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,483
No. I wasn't fired.

478
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,735
I quit.

479
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,412
Two, three, four.

480
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:44,501
One, two, three, four!

481
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,923
Olmo.

482
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,300
What's with the sour face?

483
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,927
-Enough.
-Tequila?

484
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,595
Smile. Thanks!

485
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,640
-Another one!
-Right away, sir.

486
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,350
-Hey, are you okay?
-Thanks.

487
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,102
That's not how we drink it.

488
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,437
-You're drinking like a tourist.
-This is how!

489
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,897
Not like that, Olmo!

490
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,692
To New Spain!

491
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,694
To New Spain!

492
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,779
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

493
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,532
Excuse us.

494
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,535
-I don't dance.
-Don't worry. Look.

495
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,706
Come on.

496
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:35,969
Precinct Number Five.

497
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,470
-Officer.
-How can I help you?

498
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,097
I wanna make an anonymous report.

499
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,685
What's wrong?

500
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,817
Stop it, Olmo.
Stop being so angry. Enough!

501
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,320
Stop drinking.

502
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,446
Where are you going?

503
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,488
Olmo!

504
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,034
This is a palace. From Spain to the world!

505
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,119
He did it again.
Say something to your friend!

506
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,081
Howdy, my dear Governor.

507
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,542
Gorgeous!

508
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,003
How are you?

509
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,423
Have you met Nicolás Patiño?

510
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,594
He's my new gay chief of staff.

511
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,723
-Life is full of surprises.
-Keep an eye on our seats.

512
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,352
Hell no! Stupid.

513
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,395
Why are you talking to me

514
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,856
like we don't know each other?

515
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,984
You and I should talk in private.
It'll be quick. Let's go.

516
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,071
Better go back to your table.

517
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,530
-Sorry.
-I can do it myself.

518
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,074
Sorry. Don't mind him.

519
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,201
-You're making a fool of yourself.
-I'm what?

520
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,285
Just so you know.

521
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,204
Enough. Behave!

522
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,205
Oh, Dora!

523
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,625
I always knew
you wouldn't amount to anything.

524
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,960
Sit down, ma'am. You're drunk.

525
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,003
-Let's go.
-Partner!

526
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,505
We need to talk.

527
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,060
What's wrong? Why do you look so sad?

528
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,313
I'm in a decision-making stage.

529
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,774
I might move to Spain.

530
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:14,984
No! Why?

531
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,822
I got a job offer
I'd rather not discuss right now.

532
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,323
I might quit.

533
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,117
No, you can't quit!

534
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,451
I love you!

535
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,789
Hurray for the lovebirds!

536
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,873
Way to go!

537
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,292
Jeez! You sure took your time!

538
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,544
Sorry, ma'am.

539
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,505
It's all in here.
You can expose him with this.

540
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,298
Now leave, Lopitos.

541
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,259
No, I mean López.

542
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,684
Shot!

543
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,893
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

544
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,895
-To better times!
-Excuse me.

545
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,021
Excuse me!

546
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,356
Buddy!

547
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:54,816
Time to go.

548
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,403
-You're a bit drunk.
-I'm not your friend. Fuck no!

549
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,740
You can't tell me if I can drink or not.

550
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,659
Damn Spaniard! I'll kick your ass!

551
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,162
And don't even mention Tonantzin!

552
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,498
I'll tell the chauffeur to drive you.
We'll send your little girl later.

553
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,376
Hypocrite! It can't be!

554
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,797
You are all hypocrites!
You used to smile at me.

555
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,425
And now what?
You reject me. You all reject me!

556
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,928
Like that good-for-nothing
gay governor, damn it!

557
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:24,971
Enough!

558
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,765
Stop, Olmo, please!

559
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:27,724
Enough, damn it!

560
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:31,686
They are fucking humiliating me!
Damn it, Dora!

561
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,313
Fucking consuls!

562
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,398
-They're pigs! They're swine!
-Stop!

563
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,858
We have to do something!

564
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,068
You want to do something?

565
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,028
I do.

566
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,988
Expose them.

567
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,114
What's this?

568
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,574
Videos!

569
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,326
Do what you must.

570
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:49,913
Dorita!

571
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,290
Stop it, Olmo! Gross!

572
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,132
Hey!

573
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,134
-What's up?
-Put this on.

574
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,137
Why?

575
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:08,932
As a favor.

576
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:19,651
Happy birthday to you

577
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:24,113
Happy birthday

578
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:27,826
Happy birthday to you

579
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,454
Happy birthday

580
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:35,166
Happy birthday to you

581
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,837
Happy birthday, happy birthday

582
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:45,552
Happy birthday to you!

583
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,644
Bravo!

584
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,646
You don't know

585
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,815
how happy I am

586
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,900
to leave this country.

587
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:06,322
I mean to leave after having you here
in this moving farewell.

588
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,950
That's why we want to show you a video

589
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:14,664
with some memories here in New Spain!

590
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,708
Ándele, video!

591
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,168
He's drunk.

592
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:48,448
Dear Vicentín,
may you be very successful in Spain.

593
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,117
Vicentín, I'll miss you a lot in class.

594
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,577
Remember that day?

595
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,496
I'm sending you a big hug from Mexico.
I'll miss you.

596
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,082
Have a nice day there in Spain.

597
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,792
We love you!

598
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,007
My goodness!

599
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,556
Cover the kids' eyes!

600
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:18,186
Don't let them see!

601
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,682
You didn't see anything! Let's go.

602
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,060
Hello?

603
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,103
Daddy.

604
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,480
The police just came by the house
asking for you.

605
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,900
I didn't tell them where you were,
but they said it was a homicide.

606
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,194
What? No, that can't be.

607
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,196
Haven't your lawyers called you?

608
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,699
Sweetie, don't worry.

609
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,534
It must be a misunderstanding.

610
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,286
-There.
-What is that?

611
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,372
-God!
-It's him!

612
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,707
Hey!

613
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,542
-Sir, stop!
-That wasn't it!

614
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,461
-Turn that off, asshole!
-No. Let go of him.

615
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,171
-Wait.
-What did you do?

616
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,007
Why did you give me this?

617
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,009
I'm sorry.

618
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,219
We're friends, Dora.

619
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,555
Olmo, up here at the top,

620
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,057
there are no friends.

621
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,352
I urge you to leave the country.

622
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,104
Fucking Dora.

623
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,482
Fucking Dora!

624
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,234
Now take him.

625
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,610
-Yes, ma'am.
-Backstabber!

626
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,572
-Let me go!
-Shut up! Come on.

627
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,115
You betrayed me, Dora!

628
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,450
Well done, Dorita.

629
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,160
Mr. Governor.

630
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,246
López, your assistant,

631
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,415
gave me the information.

632
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,332
All right?

633
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,669
Well played, Dorita.

634
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:11,257
Now I'm gonna check with the consuls

635
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,552
on how to keep their footage
out of the news.

636
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,180
Yes, we have unfinished business.

637
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,062
Guadalajara awakes to shocking news.

638
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:27,440
Olmo Muriel, one of Jalisco's
most successful businessmen,

639
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,900
is in the middle of a scandal.

640
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,402
However, even more scandalous is the video

641
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,280
that he himself made public
at an aristocratic party

642
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:37,867
in which he appears taking drugs
with a young man who vanished months ago.

643
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,244
Evidence leaked
to the state prosecutor's office

644
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,790
links Olmo with
international money laundering operations.

645
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,542
In other news,
the governor made changes to his cabinet.

646
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:51,798
Dora López has no experience in politics,

647
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,591
but what she does have

648
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,511
is my full trust

649
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,765
that she will lead,
with wisdom and liberty,

650
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,476
the Ministry of Public Education

651
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,645
of our state.

652
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,563
-Secretary Dora, face the camera.
-Dora.

653
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,774
Mrs. Dora, this way, please.

654
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,567
Ma'am, this way, please.

655
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:16,239
It is a great honor for me

656
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,283
to have the opportunity

657
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,078
to truly serve

658
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,665
education.

659
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,292
Thank you.

660
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,795
Thanks.

661
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,257
And thank you to all

662
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:39,929
who helped me get here today.

663
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,103
Dear Governor.

664
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,701
Dear passengers,

665
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:05,329
welcome aboard Ibermex flight 042
to Madrid.

666
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,582
So long, my homeland.

667
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,963
Long live the heroes
who gave us our homeland and freedom!

668
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:15,965
Long live Hidalgo!

669
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,384
Long live Morelos!

670
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,053
Long live Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez!

671
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,640
Long live Aldama and Matamoros!

672
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,311
-Long live justice for the rich.
-Come on.

673
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,478
You first, sweetie.

674
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,733
Long live corruption
that never abandons us.

675
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:34,650
Let's go!

676
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,611
Long live inequality!

677
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,572
Control tower, Quetzalcoatl is in the air.

678
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,116
Long live progress,
even if it destroys everything.

679
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,326
Long live!

680
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,494
Long live poverty!

681
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,746
Long live!

682
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,956
Long live consumerism!

683
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,208
Long live!

684
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,168
Long live impunity!

685
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,461
Long live!

686
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,547
Long live luxury based on exploitation!

687
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,924
Long live!

688
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,468
Long live homophobia!

689
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,510
Long live!

690
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,764
-Long live Mexico!
-Long live!

691
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,642
-Long live Mexico!
-Long live!

692
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,771
-Long live Mexico!
-Long live!
