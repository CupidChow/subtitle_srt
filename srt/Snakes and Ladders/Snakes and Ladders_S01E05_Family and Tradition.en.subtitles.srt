1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,960
From an early age,

2
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:48,798
we learn that fear
is a feeling that paralyzes us.

3
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,678
That's why we must fight
anything or anyone

4
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,556
so as not to succumb to it.

5
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,564
SNAKES AND LADDERS

6
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:54,989
I hold a lot of respect and regard
for the consuls.

7
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,577
But I don't know if you're aware
that they support another candidate.

8
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,538
As you surely understand.

9
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,748
I understand perfectly.

10
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,792
Politics.

11
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,544
That's my strength.

12
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,837
Of course.

13
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,756
I was starting to worry,

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,760
thinking that the school
was going through a horrible situation.

15
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,013
Well, it could be better.
But Miss Josefina--

16
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,057
Hold on. No.

17
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,059
Don't be pessimistic, please.

18
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,978
How long have you been at the school?

19
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,189
-Fifteen years. The thing is--
-Teaching what subjects?

20
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,359
I'm a licensed school teacher. We all are.

21
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,069
Until I became prefect.

22
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,279
That's wonderful.

23
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,659
You're a product of the government
when it works well.

24
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,495
What did you specialize in?

25
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,290
Research on rural schools.

26
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,457
That!

27
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,834
That what?

28
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,962
That's what this country needs.

29
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:51,880
It is?

30
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,799
Common folk wanting to be better.

31
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,678
People who don't just hold out their hands
waiting for Daddy Governor

32
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,221
to fix their lives

33
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,559
like the Indigenous boy
that walks 25 kilometers to get to school.

34
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,062
Or the 90-year-old farmer

35
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:12,275
who still wakes up at 4:00 a.m. every day
to plow his land.

36
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,987
That's the kind of people
Mexico needs, Dora.

37
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,157
Well, Mr. Governor--

38
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,366
-No.
-But sir--

39
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,284
Hey.

40
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,660
Please.

41
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,832
Call me Joaquín.

42
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,836
All right, Joaquín.

43
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,841
Let's not glorify inequality.

44
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,259
No, I'd never.

45
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,305
But let's not just use it to complain,

46
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,350
because that's the evil of today, Dora.

47
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,393
Dark-skinned people complain.

48
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,938
Broke people complain.

49
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,649
Not to mention fags.

50
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,983
You can't silence them.

51
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,777
-Gay people?
-Yes!

52
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,321
They've never been better.
They no longer get killed.

53
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,907
Look, Dora.

54
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,076
I'm a respectful man.

55
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,914
But they want to force
their ideology on us. Come on!

56
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,916
I'm sure you have a student like that.

57
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,168
They don't just complain now.

58
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,797
Now they're shameless
and rub it in your face.

59
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,632
My son is gay.

60
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:20,802
How about that?

61
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,597
He won't tell his dad. You know why?

62
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,602
Because he's afraid
he might think like you.

63
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,022
Good night.

64
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,155
Go!

65
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,241
Run faster, bastard!

66
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,784
Run!

67
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:46,828
Coming!

68
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,831
Go, bastard! Go!

69
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,254
Good evening, Mr. Antonio.

70
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,298
Who are you?

71
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,383
Nicolás Patiño.

72
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,891
What happened?

73
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,769
What's wrong?

74
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,319
Do you know how fucked up it is
for me to learn

75
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,571
about your past with Olmo
from the governor?

76
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,698
Listen, honey.

77
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,908
-Let me explain.
-No. Don't lie to me.

78
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,244
He told me everything.

79
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,704
I can't believe it.

80
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:34,584
I can't believe, for all these years,
you never told me something so important.

81
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,961
The guy dumped you at the altar!

82
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,173
He didn't dump me at the altar.
He got a bitch pregnant.

83
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,092
Do you know what your problem is?
You're obsessed.

84
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,929
You're so obsessed with him
that you wanted to move here.

85
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,264
Be honest.

86
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,767
Are you cheating on me with Olmo?

87
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,934
No, Vicente.

88
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,728
Don't get this wrong.

89
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,147
I despise Olmo. He hurt me bad.

90
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,357
I hate him.

91
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,567
That's why what you're saying is absurd.

92
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,611
-You're cheating on me.
-What?

93
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,279
Not only with him!

94
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,239
-What are you saying?
-Nothing.

95
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,282
-Nothing?
-Nothing.

96
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,494
Nothing? I don't like your insinuations.

97
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,497
I'm not cheating on you with Olmo
or anyone else.

98
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,248
It's your problem if you don't believe me.

99
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,918
You're crazy.

100
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,252
-I don't believe you.
-Fuck.

101
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,631
I don't believe you.

102
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,845
I don't want to see him ever again.

103
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,138
Here you are, sir.

104
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,598
I'm sorry,

105
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,101
but I can't pretend I like the guy.

106
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,270
I'd rather be a substitute
at the school again

107
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,857
than owe any favors to that asshole!

108
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,444
I thought you'd have him on your side,
like the consuls do.

109
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,655
How's the stripper doing?

110
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,448
Right, your thing.

111
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,742
She didn't take the bait.

112
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,786
Damn it, Dora!

113
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,205
Nothing's going as planned.

114
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,832
Everything's going wrong.

115
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,084
Well, let's be patient.

116
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,128
Patient? That's easy for you to say.

117
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,130
The consuls keep humiliating me.

118
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,882
I can't exact the revenge they deserve.

119
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,552
What's wrong with you? Gross!

120
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,095
The Cardinal buys it.

121
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,681
I don't care! You're messed up.

122
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,682
I mean it.

123
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,310
Tomorrow I have
the Family Day Festival rehearsal.

124
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,522
After the fiasco with the governor,

125
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,650
I have to go back
to being the best teacher.

126
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,237
I was so naive,

127
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,948
wanting to befriend the governor.

128
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,867
Silly me.

129
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,035
For real.

130
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,539
Olmo, the elections are one week away.

131
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,710
Miss Vero may be a weak competitor,

132
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,004
but I can't be so sure.

133
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,088
No.

134
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,923
Everything must be perfect at the festival

135
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,676
because all the moms and dads
will be there.

136
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,344
All the votes, that is.

137
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,139
What's the Family Day Festival?

138
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,601
The celebration
of Mother and Father's Day together.

139
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,518
Your day.

140
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,605
Our day, Dora! We're mom and dad both.

141
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,981
Cheers! Hell yeah!

142
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,275
You just don't get it, do you, Olmo?

143
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,152
-Focus!
-I'm focused.

144
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,322
And pay.

145
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,284
These shoes are so uncomfortable.

146
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,452
They look good.

147
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,247
What's up, Dad?

148
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:20,833
Look.

149
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,212
I brought some cash, Dad. It'll help.

150
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,089
I don't want your dirty money.

151
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,635
Who knows what you did to get it?

152
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,846
Dirty? Mom gave it to me.

153
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,681
Sure.

154
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,142
-Play dumb.
-What?

155
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,186
Act innocent!

156
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,980
What? What's with you? What? Tell me.

157
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,899
-I don't understand.
-I'll be damned.

158
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,693
I wanted to see my grandkids grow up.

159
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,196
It turns out our lineage ends here.

160
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,782
What are you saying?

161
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,577
Your boyfriend
came to defend you, you fag!

162
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,664
What?

163
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,500
What?

164
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,963
I should've known.
All the signs were there.

165
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,965
Always close to your mother.

166
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:13,135
Always with your drawings
and with your so-called art.

167
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,305
You're a disgrace to this family, asshole!

168
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,974
Dad! Hold on.

169
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,685
I don't understand. Explain yourself.

170
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,353
-You don't understand?
-I don't.

171
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,355
You're a fucking fag!

172
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,900
You hit me where it hurts the most.

173
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,487
Your heart's on the other side.

174
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,698
I don't give a shit!

175
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,950
Like all bitches,

176
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,452
you go tell your boyfriend.

177
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,582
I didn't smash his face in
because I'd get my hands dirty,

178
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,875
and faggots disgust me.

179
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,504
I don't even get close to them
to beat them up. They could infect me!

180
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,172
Now scram!

181
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,262
You're gonna cry now, sissy?

182
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,556
Don't treat me like this. Don't.

183
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,893
I don't want to fucking see you
ever again, bastard!

184
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,063
-What?
-Scram.

185
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,108
Go to hell, you idiot!

186
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,568
Dad.

187
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,056
TAMARA, LOOK
YOU CAN EAT ALL THIS

188
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,559
BLOCK CONTACT

189
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,191
UNBLOCK CONTACT

190
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,779
LOOK!

191
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:58,991
YOU CAN EAT ALL THIS

192
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,578
Who is it?

193
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,374
Lopitos!

194
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,250
What's up, Lopitos?

195
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,710
Sorry it took me so long.

196
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,170
I have news.

197
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,672
-May I come in?
-Sure.

198
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,803
Come on in. What is it?

199
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,097
It's not good news.

200
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,473
You don't say.

201
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,893
Teacher, I regret to tell you
that your son

202
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,311
is gay.

203
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,814
He's probably other stuff too.

204
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,274
-Do you want to see photos?
-Oh, Lopitos!

205
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,318
Put that away, man. My goodness!

206
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,695
I already knew.

207
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,448
You're a terrible detective, Lopitos.

208
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,367
I didn't know you knew.

209
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,121
If you give me the chance,
I'll prove I'm great at my job.

210
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,165
Just don't call me Lopitos.
I don't like it.

211
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,501
Then don't call me teacher,

212
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,670
because I don't like it.

213
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,131
I'll give you the chance
to keep investigating

214
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,633
only because you were highly recommended

215
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,510
and I do like you.

216
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,222
Who the hell asked you to talk to my dad?

217
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,765
I was worried.

218
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,643
You got me in trouble.
My dad didn't know I'm gay.

219
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,686
You're overreacting.

220
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,231
In your world, being gay may be great,
but it's different where I come from.

221
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,357
You know it's not true.

222
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,817
You're the liberal one.

223
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,779
I didn't know you had that issue
with your dad. Sorry.

224
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,531
Fuck off.

225
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,616
Dude!

226
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,618
Don't call me dude.

227
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,455
You stuck your tongue down my throat.
We're not friends.

228
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,756
Now, a swirl and a rainbow!

229
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:37,673
Chicken!

230
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,135
Chicken!

231
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,220
Chicken face.

232
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,097
-Chicken wings!
-Dora.

233
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,557
Come, Miss Dora.

234
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,768
-Do you have a minute?
-Of course.

235
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:53,147
Julieta and Iñaki will stay here.

236
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,648
They'll lead the dance.

237
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,651
-Follow their lead.
-Yes, Miss Dora!

238
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,695
-Come on. I'll be right here.
-Hands up!

239
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,322
I have important news.

240
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,742
I had to revoke Miss Vero's candidacy.

241
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,869
She's not a full-time teacher.

242
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:11,499
Besides, Human Resources
made her contract conditional

243
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,169
on her attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous.

244
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,921
This school can't afford

245
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,800
to have a candidate for headmistress
with that record.

246
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:25,763
That's why I have decided
to cancel the elections.

247
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,059
We can't have elections
with just one candidate.

248
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,436
I have also decided

249
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,774
to stay in my position as headmistress
for six more years.

250
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,779
I'm doing all this
for the sake of democracy at this school.

251
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,322
But, for instance,

252
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,574
if there were another candidate,

253
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,868
a new candidate,

254
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,663
the elections could take place.

255
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,832
I guess so.

256
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,417
Okay.

257
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,313
-What do you want?
-Hi, Tamara. Please don't hang up.

258
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,898
I blocked you.

259
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,484
Leave me alone. Stop harassing me.

260
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,444
Tamara, listen to me, please.

261
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,947
You're the first woman to reject me
after my mom.

262
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,615
I can't get you out of my head.

263
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,075
I want to be with you.

264
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,369
What do I have to do
for you to give me a chance?

265
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,912
Are you crazy?

266
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,623
I didn't do anything to make you chase me.

267
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,793
Stop calling me,
or I'll report you to Miss Josefina.

268
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,387
Josefina is cancelling the elections.

269
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,891
-Because there's no new candidate.
-I knew it.

270
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,643
I knew it, friend. The cards don't lie.

271
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,437
You'd never make it.

272
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,439
Don't say that, Martha Sánchez.

273
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,649
Don't ever say that again.

274
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,320
I have a plan. You're part of the plan.

275
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,864
You'll be the new candidate. Listen.

276
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:10,034
We'll arrange for you to lose.

277
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,744
Then I'll be headmistress.

278
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,579
Is that even legal?

279
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,581
That's not the point, Martha Sánchez.

280
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,875
It's a legitimate fight.

281
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,252
She wants to stay for six more years.

282
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,796
If we let her, she'll never leave.

283
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,714
Like…

284
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,884
Like Maduro or Porfirio Díaz.

285
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,219
That's some heavy karma.

286
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,764
I don't want her rage and rancor.

287
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,932
Martha Sánchez.

288
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,099
Becoming headmistress

289
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,310
is my mission.

290
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,562
I'm tired of being a teacher.

291
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,688
-Tired?
-Yes.

292
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,733
-It's been two days!
-Exactly! Just imagine!

293
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,485
-Horrible.
-What is it?

294
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,403
Calm down! What's going on?

295
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,452
Stay still!

296
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,455
-Enough!
-Calm down.

297
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,207
-Okay now.
-You're good.

298
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,875
-It didn't sting you, Iñaki.
-Yes.

299
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,127
-No, it didn't!
-Are you okay, Iñaki?

300
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,587
-He's okay!
-Are you okay?

301
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,589
-Of course he is!
-Let's go inside!

302
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,800
-Yes, dear.
-Inside! Come on!

303
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,344
Wow!

304
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,388
You saved his life!

305
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,390
Iñaki is allergic to bees.

306
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,017
Stay focused, Martha Sánchez.

307
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,978
Let's get to business.

308
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,730
Let me sleep on it.

309
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,233
I have to ask the cards.

310
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,672
Vicente, what's going on with the phones?

311
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,382
The phones?

312
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:52,428
Yeah. I receive a text, and you receive
another one at the same time.

313
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,929
Really? I don't know.

314
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,559
Let me see your mobile.

315
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,185
What?

316
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,896
No.

317
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,649
Lately, it seems like
you know about every text I get.

318
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,152
Show me your mobile. Give it to me!

319
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,529
No.

320
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,532
In the Iberian market,

321
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,410
we're still leaders
in white and dark chocolate.

322
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,829
No. I can't listen to this.

323
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,042
Postpone this meeting
and call my Indigenous associates.

324
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,503
They're still on strike, sir.
They insist on only working eight hours.

325
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,047
That's what I wanted to hear.

326
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,508
Now I do want
to renegotiate their labor rights.

327
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,678
They could help me with something.

328
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,181
You've been spying on me?

329
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,682
This makes no sense.

330
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,393
You never cared about me at all.

331
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,688
All you wanted was to go back to Spain.
And now you're jealous?

332
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,150
I was. At first, I was.

333
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,945
After I saw the photos, something changed.

334
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,239
I can't get them out of my head.

335
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,659
Vicente, are you really jealous?

336
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:04,458
Honey, those photos and videos
are from Vicentín's PE teacher.

337
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,086
It seems like he's into me, poor guy.

338
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,004
You have nothing to worry about.

339
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,464
I'm not worried.

340
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,514
I can't get the idea out of my head.

341
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,058
I'm curious about the idea.

342
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,603
What do you mean you're curious?

343
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,189
Explain it to me.

344
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,691
Well, thinking

345
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,777
that you're

346
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,239
with another man.
Picturing you with another man…

347
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,201
What?

348
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,702
I can't even say it.

349
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,788
What's wrong?

350
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,957
Does it turn you on?

351
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:49,753
Are you aroused

352
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,132
when you picture me with another man?

353
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,929
Imagine the PE teacher is fucking you
while I watch.

354
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:04,893
Juana?

355
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,813
Do you want to go to an art opening?

356
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,899
I feel you might like the artist.
You should meet him.

357
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,360
Sure. Let's go. Yes.

358
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,737
Okay, great. I'll call Nico.

359
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,865
Nico?

360
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,659
Oh no. I just remembered I can't go.

361
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,452
I have things to do. I can't go.

362
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,913
But I didn't say when or where.

363
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,624
I'd love to, but I can't, Juana. Thanks.

364
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,834
I gotta go.

365
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,344
Baby.

366
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,512
Let's go to the movies.

367
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:41,889
Sure.

368
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,724
Okay, I'll pick up Toño.

369
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,684
You know what?

370
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,603
I'm checking my schedule.

371
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,772
I have a youth party event at that time.

372
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,275
But I didn't tell you what time.

373
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,943
It's all afternoon.

374
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,696
But you guys can go.

375
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,240
Listen, I have to go.

376
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,701
We'll talk later. Bye.

377
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,500
Since you told me your fantasies,

378
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,252
I want to tell you a secret.

379
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,670
I love using this.

380
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,380
From time to time.

381
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,257
I never told you

382
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,719
because you don't like contraceptives
and are very traditional,

383
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,263
so I thought
you wouldn't like sex toys either.

384
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,849
But look. I want to use this one with you.

385
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,102
Look. Here. It's a remote control.

386
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,562
I put this inside of me,

387
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,233
and you can control the speed,
the intensity, everything.

388
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,610
After what you told me,

389
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:40,447
I thought I could use it
at the Family Day Festival.

390
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,242
You could watch me getting pleasure
in front of everyone.

391
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,536
You're perverse.

392
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,748
We don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

393
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,875
You're filthy.

394
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,463
Dirty.

395
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,763
We'll finally have fun at a festival.

396
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,604
Daddy.

397
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,522
Yes?

398
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,651
I think Nicolás and Toño
had a fight over me.

399
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,237
I know, listen.

400
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,823
I did my best.

401
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,866
I saw it coming.

402
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,787
It was inevitable. Toño grew up
under different circumstances.

403
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,748
He's probably never been close
to a rich girl.

404
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,668
A pretty and decent girl.

405
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,588
Nicolás knows
he won't find anyone better than me.

406
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,799
He wants to mark his territory.

407
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,219
But it hurts me
because we were having fun.

408
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,595
Sweetie,

409
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:50,142
we were going to have
this conversation eventually.

410
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,603
You've realized
that beauty is also a curse.

411
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,689
I'm carrying that burden.

412
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,107
There's nothing we can do.

413
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:02,612
Beautiful people must pay a price
for the goods nature gave us.

414
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,574
Especially if we're brilliant.

415
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,410
Less favored people have it hard.

416
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,288
We have to be patient.

417
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,790
I'm asking you to stay strong.

418
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,251
Right, but I didn't ask for this.

419
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,337
I didn't ask to be beautiful.

420
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,257
Ugly people didn't ask to be born,
but there they are, trying their best.

421
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,010
Yeah, you're right, Daddy.

422
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,929
We each have our own struggles.

423
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,473
Exactly, sweetie.

424
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,642
You're learning little by little.

425
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,772
-All right. Please stand up, buddy.
-Chihuahua…

426
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,190
What for?

427
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,358
Your wings.

428
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:44,446
Lérida, Gerona, Tarragona,

429
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,698
and Barcelona.

430
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,075
What are you saying?

431
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,743
So you stand out

432
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,953
from all the rest

433
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,874
and become a Spanish bee.

434
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,502
-I don't want to be a Spanish bee.
-Stay still.

435
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,795
-No!
-Stay still.

436
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,004
No!

437
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,508
Extremadura, two. Cáceres and Badajoz.

438
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,469
Welcome. Come on in.

439
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,138
There are seats at the front.

440
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,015
Please come on in.

441
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,518
Find your seats.

442
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,436
Is it inside you?

443
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,525
Excuse me.

444
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,069
Vicente!

445
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,366
Excuse me.

446
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,952
Welcome to the Family Day Festival.

447
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:35,705
Families, take your seats.
We'll begin shortly.

448
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,791
-Excuse me.
-Hello.

449
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,960
-Excuse me.
-Hi. How are you?

450
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,840
You look so beautiful!

451
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,884
Sure, and you dress
like that every day, right?

452
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,553
All right, Dora.

453
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,097
I've thought about it, and I've decided.

454
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,020
The cards said no.
They were clear on this.

455
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,815
Martha Sánchez, no.

456
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,944
I can't compete against you.
They said it would go horribly.

457
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:10,740
Let's let it flow
and trust the signs from the cosmos.

458
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,826
You didn't say this was a costume party!

459
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,787
Jeez, Dora!

460
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,998
Why didn't you wear this
with the governor?

461
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,459
You would've made a better impression.

462
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,752
Okay, see you on stage.

463
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:23,795
Yeah, bye.

464
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,842
She's funny, isn't she?

465
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,010
Don't talk to her.

466
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:31,887
Don't talk to her.

467
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,724
Leave me alone. I'm not well.
I didn't sleep a wink.

468
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,934
I don't know how I'll even dance.

469
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,228
I'll drink this cup of coffee.

470
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,064
I have just what you need. Saccharine.

471
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,774
The one the Cardinal takes.

472
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,360
Just a little bit, and you'll be ready.

473
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:51,740
So have some chocolate now.

474
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:52,949
So elegant.

475
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,367
You'll be fine.

476
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,536
Thanks.

477
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,749
I've heard of brown sugar for energy,
but this stuff?

478
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,209
I never heard of it.

479
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,921
This is the second call.

480
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,714
Second call.

481
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,134
Remain seated. The show will start soon.

482
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,270
Yes?

483
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,272
Dora, this is Nico Patiño.

484
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,859
Sorry to bother you,
but I want to talk about Toño.

485
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,738
Sorry, Nico. This isn't a good time.

486
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,406
It's urgent.

487
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,576
The person beating Toño up is his dad.

488
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,539
I'm worried.
As his mom, you need to help him.

489
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,748
His dad?

490
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,376
Are you sure, Nico?

491
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,545
This is the third call.

492
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,799
-Remain seated. We're about to begin.
-Well, I mean…

493
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,636
Thanks for telling me. Don't worry.

494
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,556
That bastard
won't lay a hand on him again.

495
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,015
I'll take care of it.

496
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,685
Thanks for telling me, Nico.

497
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,145
Sorry. I have to go.

498
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,147
Bye.

499
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,608
Thanks. Thank you. Thanks.

500
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,945
Welcome to this celebration

501
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:16,825
organized by the school
to celebrate daddies and mommies

502
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,827
together on the same day.

503
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,122
It has special meaning for us.

504
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:26,418
We celebrate family as God created it.

505
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,212
The traditional family.

506
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,718
Unfortunately, it is being threatened
these days

507
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:39,639
by trends and inclinations
promoted by confused souls

508
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,684
who haven't had God in their hearts.

509
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:49,566
They must be confused to not know
that a family is composed of a father,

510
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,027
a mother, and their children,

511
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,489
not only as determined by biology
but also as said by God.

512
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,993
And there's nothing to argue there.

513
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,795
So to start off this celebration,

514
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:16,176
we'll bring our little students on stage

515
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,178
who have worked hard

516
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:23,475
preparing a performance about God's wisdom

517
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:27,937
when He placed on Earth the kind bees,

518
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,230
which give us honey,

519
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,316
which is so delicious.

520
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,110
Let's welcome them
with a huge round of applause!

521
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,321
Let's go!

522
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,451
Mr. Choco.

523
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,329
What's on your nose?

524
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,956
It's pollen.

525
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,999
Come on!

526
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,838
Everyone get down.

527
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,969
This song is from my homeland.

528
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,882
Now, to read a message from the parents,

529
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:24,471
let's welcome to this stage
the renowned chocolate businessman,

530
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,847
Olmo Muriel.

531
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,432
A big round of applause!

532
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,021
-Welcome.
-Thanks.

533
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,107
Thank you.

534
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,650
Thanks.

535
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:39,903
First and foremost,

536
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,654
I'd like to mention that,

537
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:46,451
of course, it's fortunate to have a family
with a mom and a dad.

538
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,119
But in our family,

539
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,665
the mom abandoned us,
so I was forced to assume both roles.

540
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,169
So we deserve to be celebrated too.

541
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,712
However,

542
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,382
I have more pressing issues
to discuss with you today.

543
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,676
I come with a message today

544
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,472
to raise awareness
of something happening at school.

545
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,891
Please join me on stage,

546
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,521
venerable elder from
the Indigenous community of Siete Palos,

547
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,941
who has partnered with Chocolates Olmo

548
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:22,070
to produce the ancestral nourishment

549
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:26,908
that certain parents
want to ban in school nowadays.

550
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,369
For centuries,

551
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,913
the voices of these

552
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:36,876
noble inhabitants of the Americas
have been silenced.

553
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:44,467
Are we going to silence
their culture in Jalisco too?

554
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,512
-Excuse me, old man. Excuse me.
-I'll--

555
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,349
Will we keep looking away

556
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,143
while our roots

557
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,522
continue to be discarded by colonialism?

558
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,399
I ask you

559
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:04,362
not to throw away
thousands of years of tradition.

560
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:09,951
Let's get Mexican food
back on the school menu!

561
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,870
Long live Mexico! Land and freedom!

562
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,084
Long live Mexico!

563
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,172
Thank you very much.

564
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,716
Excuse me. Let's go, old man.

565
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,635
FAMILY DAY

566
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,805
May we come in?

567
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,474
I'm here with Iñaki.

568
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,894
He told me what happened with the bee.

569
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:36,811
Yes.

570
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,980
It all happened so fast.

571
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,691
Luckily, I got there on time.

572
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,860
He could've had an allergic reaction.

573
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,613
That's super dangerous for him.
Super dangerous.

574
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,197
Yes, that was great.

575
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,699
But there's one more thing.

576
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,326
Iñaki is very sad.

577
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,871
He didn't like seeing his teacher
killing a bee

578
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,373
in such a violent and shocking way.

579
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,375
Miss Dora told us in class

580
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:04,422
that bees are very important
to the environment. And that…

581
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:08,009
And that they're essential
for our survival on this planet.

582
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:08,927
That's it.

583
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,181
But you know, Miss Dora
is very sorry for killing the bee.

584
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,142
She'll apologize right now.

585
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,477
Right?

586
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,532
I'm sorry, sweetie…

587
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,204
for killing the bee, but I did it for you.

588
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,413
That will do.

589
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,499
That will do, right?

590
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,294
No.

591
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,005
No?

592
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,049
What, Iñaki?

593
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,802
Remember, forgiveness
is part of Christianity.

594
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,055
I want you to apologize to the bee.

595
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,642
No!

596
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,521
I won't apologize to the bee.

597
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,605
Got it?

598
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,149
Enough nonsense!

599
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,027
-Miss Dora!
-I won't apologize!

600
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,654
Not ever again!

601
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,782
You should thank me for saving your life.

602
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,201
You ungrateful and miserable brat!

603
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,161
-Miss Dora!
-Just like your parents!

604
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,746
Don't talk to a kid like that!

605
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,164
I don't give a damn! Shut up!

606
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:24,502
I won't apologize to anyone ever again!

607
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,338
It's part of the anti-sadness protocol.

608
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,591
Shove the protocol up your ass!

609
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,094
Miss Dora, you're fired!

610
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,554
That's funny!

611
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,139
I'm not fired.

612
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,598
I quit!

613
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,643
You can all go to hell!

614
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,816
Right. Now I understand you.

615
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,943
Olmo keeps attacking me.

616
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,737
And you say it's me.

617
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,489
Bringing an Indigenous old man? Damn!

618
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,617
Don't worry, Tamara. I promise I'll do

619
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,911
something to help you.

620
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,456
It was good, huh?

621
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,457
Give me a kiss.

622
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,086
Thank you very much, families.

623
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,466
Who is it? Who knocks like that?

624
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,467
Me!

625
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,188
Stop knocking! What do you want?

626
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,397
We need to talk.

627
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,149
Really? What about?

628
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,527
About how you've been beating up my son?

629
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,864
Or do you want money?

630
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,908
You only come here when you want money.

631
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,951
Go away.

632
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,411
Get out of my house!

633
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,205
-You're wrong, bitch!
-Out!

634
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:43,915
I'm not here for money.

635
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,292
-I came to open your eyes.
-Really?

636
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,544
I bet you don't even know
your son is a fag!

637
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,546
Such shocking news!

638
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,424
I've known since he was this small.

639
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,968
And you know what?
It doesn't bother me at all.

640
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,929
Not at all. So what's your problem?

641
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,557
Of course he turned into a faggot
with those ideas.

642
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,685
This is all your fault!
You're a bad mother!

643
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,230
-Hell yeah!
-You're useless!

644
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:11,150
-You're not even a good teacher!
-That's so funny.

645
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,528
My salary as a prefect
has been good for you

646
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,571
all this time, you mooch!

647
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,156
At least I put it to use.

648
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,699
And you know what?

649
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,452
Toño has been giving me the money
this whole time.

650
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,663
-We scammed you.
-Like an idiot. So what?

651
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,039
But that's all over.

652
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,166
I'm not letting him near me!

653
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,503
I'd rather have nothing
than a son who's a fag!

654
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,256
Blessed be the day!
We won't see you again!

655
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,508
Now fuck off. Go to hell!

656
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,093
-Fuck off!
-You fuck off!

657
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,221
-Go to hell, bitch!
-You go to hell!

658
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,681
I was never happy with you.

659
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:42,682
Shut up, asshole!

660
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,268
-He won't even ever give me grandkids!
-Shut up!

661
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,895
No one wants you around, son of a bitch!

662
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,940
-Look! Take this shit with you.
-You bitch!

663
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:51,858
Put it down!

664
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,901
Leave it alone, dammit!

665
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,361
Let it go, bitch!

666
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,864
-I'll kill you, you bitch!
-Let me go!

667
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,830
Antonio.

668
