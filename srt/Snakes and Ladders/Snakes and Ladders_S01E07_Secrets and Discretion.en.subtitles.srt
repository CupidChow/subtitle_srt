1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,107
Miss Dora!

2
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:29,821
Empowerment is the process
of gaining freedom and power

3
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:33,491
to do what you please
and control what happens to you.

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,287
That's why power is addictive.

5
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,164
You want it,

6
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,915
you've got it.

7
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,757
SNAKES AND LADDERS

8
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,927
Hi, teacher.

9
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,971
-Oh, Miss Dora!
-No! Prefect.

10
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,431
-Of course, prefect.
-Right.

11
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:42,268
We were saying how happy we are
that you're back at the school.

12
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,479
Yes. We missed you so much, Miss Dora.

13
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,647
You're the best.

14
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,191
Thank you so much, mommies.
Thanks. Have a nice day.

15
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,276
What we miss the most
is your sense of humor.

16
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,736
-Yeah.
-Yes.

17
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,071
-Your smile.
-Yes.

18
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,823
That's nice of you. Thanks.

19
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,324
All of it. See you.

20
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,119
Well, and your discretion. Right?

21
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,913
My best quality.

22
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,958
Second to my perfectionism and humility,
of course.

23
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,793
My discretion.

24
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,212
Have a nice day, mommy.

25
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,345
I called you here
to congratulate you on coming back.

26
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,721
Thanks so much.

27
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,184
Now that I'm back, I wanted to suggest

28
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:28,606
that perhaps we could
hold elections for headmistress again.

29
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,485
Miss Dora, you should be grateful
to have a job.

30
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:38,199
Mrs. Tamara and the other moms
really insisted I let you come back.

31
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,578
The decision has been made.
There won't be any elections.

32
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,996
Is that your final decision?

33
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,997
Yes.

34
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,374
Now get to work, Miss Dora.

35
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,959
Prefect.

36
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,051
Sweetie, what's wrong?

37
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,636
Daddy…

38
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,721
What happened?

39
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,891
Nicolás broke up with me.

40
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,352
Everything's fallen apart.

41
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,896
Nicolás broke up with you?

42
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:09,814
Not you with him?

43
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,858
It must be a mistake.

44
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,736
Are you sure you heard right?

45
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,489
Daddy, I'm nothing.

46
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,659
I'm a pathetic insect.

47
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,786
Hey, hey, hey.

48
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,121
Listen to me, damn it.

49
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,915
That didn't happen.

50
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,458
No one breaks up with us.

51
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,251
Talk to him so he fixes this.

52
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,587
Daddy, there's nothing to fix.

53
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,591
Nicolás is with someone else.

54
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,550
With who?

55
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,136
There's no better catch than you
in Guadalajara.

56
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,847
You're the coolest
and most beautiful girl.

57
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,643
What woman could confuse Nicolás this way?

58
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,144
It's not a woman.

59
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,687
It's a man.

60
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,940
It's Toño.

61
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,316
Dora's son?

62
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,403
Damn it.

63
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,781
I'm busy, Gil.

64
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,242
Sorry, sir, it's important.

65
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,993
I have bad news for you.

66
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,579
The lack of exports to Spain
is affecting the cash flow.

67
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,623
We can't pay our pending debts.

68
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,793
Then stop payments to the Indigenous.

69
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:15,129
Those bastards
are used to living on very little.

70
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,047
Sir--

71
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,554
You'll be fine, sweetie.

72
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,181
I promise.

73
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,980
Inviting you here is my way of apologizing

74
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,942
for being a jerk
at your husband's funeral.

75
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,860
Ex-husband.

76
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,029
Did you know your son is gay?

77
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,741
Of course.

78
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,201
And that he's with Nicolás?

79
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,414
Our friendship goes beyond
anything our kids do.

80
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,748
Listen, Olmo,

81
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,127
did you bring me here
just to tell me that?

82
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,254
No.

83
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,214
Then what do you want to tell me?

84
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,260
The consuls keep harassing me, Dora.

85
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,680
In order for the consuls
to give you back your exports,

86
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,765
we need something else.

87
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:08,766
Evidence.

88
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,853
Every second that goes by,
my company is losing money.

89
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,688
I must do something quick.

90
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,567
You got what you wanted.
That's why you're happy.

91
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,527
No, Olmo. Don't get it wrong.

92
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,696
I didn't get what I wanted.

93
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,532
I want to be headmistress. And where am I?

94
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,076
Back to being a prefect!

95
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,164
Josefina doesn't want
to hold elections again.

96
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,373
What am I gonna do?

97
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,334
I have a proposal.

98
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,419
I'll talk to Miss Josefina.

99
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,049
And you get me the evidence
that will allow me

100
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,927
to have my revenge on the consuls
and humiliate them like they did to me.

101
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,887
Shut up!

102
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,722
Sorry. Yes, sorry.

103
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,353
All right, Olmo.
Calm down already, please.

104
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,562
I'm calm.

105
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,522
Ever had Botox?

106
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,483
Here. Look.

107
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:00,777
Where?

108
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,445
What do you mean "where?"

109
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,114
Here, here, and here. Three spots.

110
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,824
I can't tell.

111
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,035
What's up, Chente? Great to hear from you.

112
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,204
After an arduous search,

113
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,498
I can confirm that, indeed,

114
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,958
you have Sephardic blood.

115
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,878
But it is due
to an extramarital relationship

116
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,297
that an ancestor of yours had.

117
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,342
I don't know if that's a problem
because I know that,

118
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,845
like me, you strongly believe
in traditional family.

119
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,391
I hope this isn't a problem
for the Spanish Crown.

120
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:35,812
The Crown has a long record of adultery
and bastards. I don't think so.

121
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:40,650
I'll start pulling my strings right away
so the Spanish phone company

122
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,777
fills the whole State of Jalisco
with cell towers.

123
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,903
How about that?

124
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,699
Excuse me, Governor. I have company.

125
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,702
-I'll call you later.
-All right, man.

126
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,787
Cleo, you may go.

127
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,955
-Of course.
-Roque.

128
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,873
-Please.
-Yes.

129
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:56,999
Come on in.

130
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,460
-How are you?
-Fine.

131
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,338
-Some whiskey?
-No.

132
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,842
I wanted to thank you for…

133
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,512
Well, you know why.

134
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,638
It's nothing.

135
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,556
Come here.

136
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,391
All right.

137
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,064
All right.

138
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,276
I have an offer for you.

139
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:27,822
If it's money to keep me away from Tamara,
there's no need. I'm not doing that again.

140
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,907
Not at all! No.

141
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,701
The complete opposite.

142
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,412
I want us to have a threesome.

143
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,456
Tamara, you, and me.

144
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,542
Don't worry about the details.
We've taken care of it.

145
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,752
I'm not a mere sex object, Consul.

146
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,505
Fucking isn't everything. I have feelings.

147
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,717
I want to have dates,
go to the movies, go for ice cream.

148
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,262
I'm tired of being nothing but a penis
for everyone.

149
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,431
Roque, you're much more than just a dick.

150
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,475
Way more!

151
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,101
At least to Tamara and me.

152
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,940
The keys to the hotel room.

153
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,027
Think about it,
and let us know your answer.

154
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,112
Let me know tomorrow.

155
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,156
Tomorrow.

156
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,658
Okay, then.

157
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,285
Thanks.

158
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,078
-I'll walk you out.
-Okay.

159
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,125
Thanks.

160
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:22,919
Bye!

161
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,109
I'm so pretty, and my boyfriend
turned out to be gay.

162
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,195
PUBLISH

163
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,729
We're back,

164
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,938
Laura, baby.

165
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,205
Can we talk in private?

166
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,917
I have an offer for you.

167
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,798
It's about time.

168
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:39,096
I thought it was weird
that you hadn't come

169
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,849
to offer me some deal.

170
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,726
No.

171
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,811
I came to

172
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,064
offer you

173
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,191
a gift

174
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:54,570
in exchange for you reinstating
the elections on the expected date.

175
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:57,948
That's what it was.

176
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,160
No, that won't be possible.

177
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,163
I'm sorry I can't accommodate you,
Mr. Muriel,

178
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,291
but there aren't enough candidates.

179
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,128
I'm sure you can fix
that tiny little detail.

180
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,589
Find another candidate.

181
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,634
You really go out of your way
for the prefect.

182
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,135
You're telling me no?

183
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,470
Me?

184
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:25,101
Well, you're not being clear, Mr. Muriel.

185
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,814
Can't you be more specific?

186
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,818
Smart woman.

187
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,612
Tell me.

188
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,073
What do you want?

189
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,826
How about

190
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,870
a management position
at the chocolate company?

191
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,372
A seat on the board.

192
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,250
And some shares, partner.

193
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,918
I like that deal.

194
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,879
Especially the shares part.

195
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,798
It's a great deal, in fact.

196
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,508
We'll all be happy.

197
00:11:58,968 --> 00:11:59,802
Thanks.

198
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,138
If you'll excuse me.

199
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,268
-So it'll take two hours?
-More or less, yes.

200
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,479
Text me when you finish.
I'll come get you.

201
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,397
Yes.

202
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,155
Where are you going?

203
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,490
I have a meeting
with the youth of the party.

204
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,744
Sorry. Everyone's in already.

205
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,495
You're new here, aren't you?

206
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,372
Don't you know who I am?

207
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,708
I hold a key position
in the youth of the party.

208
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,711
Check "Nicolás Patiño" on your list.

209
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:38,174
You can't come in
precisely because you are Nicolás Patiño.

210
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,091
What?

211
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,802
That's impossible.

212
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,475
GABO SENT YOU JUANA MURIEL'S POST

213
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,726
SHE OUTED HIM!

214
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,230
My life just went to shit.

215
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,819
You want me to do what?

216
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:03,949
I want you to run as a candidate
in the elections for headmistress.

217
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,785
Can that be done?

218
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,330
Not because I don't want to.
Actually, I don't want to.

219
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,791
The cards told me not to do it.

220
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,627
Miss Martha Sánchez, you know,

221
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,380
to me, cards are pure nonsense.

222
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,050
They've advised me quite well.

223
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,221
But there are forces
that human understanding can't see.

224
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,765
Let me remind you that Tarot cards

225
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,975
aren't this school's headmistress.

226
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:30,893
I am.

227
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:35,064
That's why I order you
to run as a candidate.

228
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,527
I'll tell you in Spanish.

229
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,488
Either you take part in the elections,

230
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,864
or I'll fire you.

231
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,792
Our plan is going great, Roque.

232
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,921
I knew I could trust you and your…

233
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,549
your charms.

234
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,093
I'm actually depressed.

235
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,388
Why?

236
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,475
You think because I'm a dancer,
I have no feelings?

237
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,854
Inside this hot body,
there's a golden heart no one cares about.

238
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,565
The consuls want to have
a threesome with me.

239
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,441
I feel dirty and used.

240
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,068
Not used, Roque.

241
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,736
Useful.

242
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,448
Useful for our plans.

243
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,575
You'll do it.

244
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,494
You know exactly why.

245
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,621
This is the last thing I do.

246
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,790
You don't decide when.

247
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,128
I'm the one who decides
when the last thing will be.

248
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,673
There's something different about you.

249
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,174
What is it?

250
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,718
Is it your hair?

251
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,136
Your clothes?

252
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,471
Oh, Roque.

253
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,474
It's called power.

254
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,979
But that's something you'll never know.

255
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,522
Cheer up!

256
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,821
I just talked to the governor.

257
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,449
Have you read the parents' group messages?

258
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,617
No, what is it?

259
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,618
Look!

260
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,914
Miss Josefina sent an e-mail
saying the elections are back on.

261
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,498
Who are the candidates?

262
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,667
Miss Dora and Miss Martha Sánchez.

263
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,421
It's so funny she's called Martha Sánchez.

264
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,423
That makes me feel close to her.

265
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,217
Vicente. Are you listening to me?

266
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,178
That's not what you agreed to
with Miss Josefina.

267
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,014
Of course not.
That old lady double-crossed us.

268
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,725
What's wrong with her?

269
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,270
-Roque.
-What?

270
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,148
ROQUE: ALL RIGHT. I'LL DO THE THREESOME.

271
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,817
He'll do the threesome!

272
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,365
Yes!

273
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,118
Did Josefina accept your offer?

274
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,663
-What did you give her?
-I'll tell you one thing.

275
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,039
We all have a price.

276
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,832
I may end up winning.

277
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,668
Wow!

278
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,669
Excuse me.

279
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,755
Do you have cameras
that don't look like cameras?

280
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,715
Like to spy on a babysitter.

281
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,842
Sure, let me show you some.

282
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,719
Great, thanks.

283
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,098
The consuls are such hypocrites.

284
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,476
I love catching them doing this.

285
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,437
-It's a sure thing, right?
-100%.

286
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,605
I have these.

287
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,983
Jeez!

288
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,318
Perfect!

289
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,363
-This thing? Really?
-Yes.

290
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,865
-Where?
-In the eyes.

291
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,660
Jeez! That's true.

292
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,954
-In the eyes. Look.
-Let me see.

293
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,540
We'll catch them "bear" naked!

294
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,125
Perfect!

295
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,468
Daddy.

296
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,470
What is it, sweetie?

297
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,098
You gotta help me. People hate me.

298
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,434
My socials are filled with haters
canceling me.

299
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,351
Canceling?

300
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,146
What are you talking about?

301
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:06,191
It's like when anonymous people
go against celebrities.

302
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,694
They're canceling me for outing Nicolás.

303
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,362
Those are trolls.

304
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,656
That's what they're called, right? Trolls.

305
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,867
This will pass. Don't worry.

306
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,494
"You're an airhead."

307
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,288
"In addition to snob, prejudiced."

308
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,498
"Girly couldn't stand being dumped."

309
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,875
"Educate yourself, stupid."

310
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,293
Should I go on? I have more.

311
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,920
Miss Juana,
do you want me to wash your car?

312
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:27,963
Yes.

313
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,883
Lopitos, let's have a talk.

314
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:31,884
Now.

315
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,938
Why didn't you tell me
Toño and Nicolás were together?

316
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,026
Now my girl is heartbroken.

317
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,736
She's being canceled.

318
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,529
It's all your fault, man!

319
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,367
I didn't know exactly
what the three of them had going on.

320
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,036
Who am I to judge?

321
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,999
Besides, you hired me to inform Miss Dora
of what her son was doing.

322
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,795
-Not about Nicolás.
-That's bullshit, Lopitos!

323
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,757
Sir, my name is Guadalupe,
and my surname is López.

324
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,425
And regarding Juana--

325
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,636
You've worked in this house for years.

326
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,598
You watched Juana grow up.
And you didn't think of telling me?

327
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,476
Don't you wanna protect her?
Don't you care about her?

328
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,812
-Regarding her--
-I don't want to talk to you.

329
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,355
You fucked up.

330
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,066
There's nothing you can do to fix it.

331
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,402
I'm under a lot of pressure.

332
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,113
Leave.

333
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,532
"Finally."

334
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,991
"About time. Success."

335
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,327
Finally? About time?

336
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,871
Matías, a classmate from school,
sent me this.

337
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,831
Did he know?

338
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,250
How? I didn't know myself.

339
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,253
I have a lot like this one.

340
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,215
Sixteen more messages.

341
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,550
-No shit.
-Uh-huh.

342
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,593
And your DMs?

343
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,387
The same. Look.

344
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,181
"Congratulations for coming out."

345
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,684
-"You're a warrior."
-You are.

346
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,102
"You're so cute."

347
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,311
"Top or bottom?"

348
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,147
"Marry me."

349
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,525
"I'd eat you up, bones included."

350
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,068
-Me too.
-"How long is it?"

351
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,572
-This is great.
-See?

352
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,699
It wasn't that bad, huh?

353
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,701
Your life didn't go to shit.

354
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,122
What?

355
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,044
Thanks.

356
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,510
Good morning!

357
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,977
Let's go get those votes, Laura, baby!

358
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,857
Prefect! Have a nice day!

359
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,942
Miss Dora!

360
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:54,985
Good morning!

361
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,613
Miss Dora!

362
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,825
Good morning, Dora!

363
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,570
Miss Juana.

364
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,656
I have bad news.

365
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,823
More?

366
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,410
Isn't this enough, Lopitos?

367
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,790
There's a rumor going around
amongst my acquaintances in the police.

368
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,960
They say there will be arrests
coming soon.

369
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,296
It's about the burglaries
that have been happening here.

370
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,716
They've identified
the alleged thief's car.

371
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,385
It looks like yours.

372
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,096
Mine?

373
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,641
What a coincidence, huh?

374
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,143
A terrible coincidence.

375
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,855
The same model. The same color.

376
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,827
I told you to leave it to me.

377
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,578
The plan is going well.

378
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,539
I'll believe it when I see it.

379
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,124
Dora!

380
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:35,043
I can already smell success.

381
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:35,961
Are you busy?

382
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,587
-Come in.
-Trust me.

383
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,716
Sorry, I have to go. I'll call you later.

384
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,633
All right, Dora.

385
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,676
-Okay now.
-Bye.

386
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,470
-What's up, Martha?
-Oh, Dora.

387
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,680
You know,

388
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,348
I didn't want to be a candidate.

389
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,852
I'm happy teaching my kids.

390
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,061
I have no ambition.

391
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,856
Don't worry, Martha Sánchez.

392
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,357
It's all part of a plan.

393
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,485
I will be headmistress.

394
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,905
It has all been arranged
with Miss Josefina.

395
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,074
You arranged it with Miss Josefina?

396
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,369
She hates you, and you hate her. How?

397
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,163
I can't tell you the details.

398
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,497
But

399
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,167
I can assure you

400
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,918
that I

401
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:21,465
will become this school's headmistress.

402
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,260
Oh, this makes sense
with what the cards told me.

403
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,345
Really?

404
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,222
You got The Emperor,

405
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,099
The Sun, and The Tower.

406
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,684
What does that mean?

407
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,561
That it'll be good for you in the end.

408
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,689
Oh, my dear Marthita Sánchez!

409
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,400
Don't get my hopes up!

410
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,818
You know what, friend?

411
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,697
I haven't felt this happy in so long.

412
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,367
I mean, excited, fulfilled!

413
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,952
You know what I like doing
when I feel like this?

414
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:51,870
What?

415
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:57,793
I need nothing else now that

416
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:04,341
Your immense love
Illuminated me inside and out

417
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,429
Believe me this time

418
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,682
Believe me because

419
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:19,064
Believe me, and you'll see
It will never end

420
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:25,946
I have a wish written high above
That is now flying

421
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:32,577
My thoughts don't depend on my body

422
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,499
Believe me this time

423
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,669
Believe me because

424
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,675
It would hurt me, now I know

425
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,388
Take me without fear now

426
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,891
Make it a lifetime or just an hour

427
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:58,228
Don't set me free naked here

428
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:02,899
My new space that is now yours, I beg you

429
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,402
Take me shamelessly

430
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:09,197
Even if the whole world is against it

431
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,826
Leave appearances behind
And come to your senses

432
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,996
And feel what's inside of me

433
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:23,044
And you transform
Into a picture inside of me

434
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:30,594
That covers my white and tired walls

435
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,640
Believe me this time

436
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,768
Believe me because

437
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:44,608
It would hurt me over and over again

438
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,202
VOTE IS FREE AND SECRET

439
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,041
-Good morning.
-Hello, prefect.

440
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,126
Okay, thanks for coming.

441
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,252
Good morning.

442
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,797
Good day to you all.
It's a pleasure. Thank you.

443
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,971
Who else?

444
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,932
2025 ELECTIONS PROCESS
HEADMISTRESS

445
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,690
We're gonna win.

446
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,069
-Good morning.
-Hi.

447
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,904
-It's so nice to see you.
-Likewise.

448
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,324
Good morning, Mr. Muriel.

449
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,534
Good morning.

450
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:36,993
How are you?

451
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,371
Have you seen the consuls?

452
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,165
Maybe they came early and voted first.

453
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,501
No, they didn't come early.
I arrived early.

454
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,794
They haven't been here.

455
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,587
How's Roque doing?

456
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,797
Let's see.

457
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,136
Oh dear.

458
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:57,973
Nothing?

459
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,058
There's been no movement yet.

460
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,936
But there will be. They will fall.

461
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,688
What a great day.

462
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,064
What a great day!

463
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,065
Do I look good?

464
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,276
Amazing!

465
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,902
I'm nervous.

466
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,153
Me too.

467
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,114
-Let's go.
-Honey.

468
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:17,242
Let's vote quickly at school first.
So Olmo doesn't win.

469
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,954
Enough with Olmo.
Enough. I'm tired of him.

470
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:24,082
Can you believe it?
On such a special day in our marriage,

471
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:27,794
we're about to have possibly the most
important experience of our lives,

472
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:31,423
why do I have to hear his name? Olmo!

473
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,383
No, honey. Calm down.

474
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,760
I just want to know. We won't vote?

475
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,971
No! Olmo is the past.

476
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:41,641
Vicente, I was just saying
to go there quickly,

477
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,435
we vote, and then go to the hotel.

478
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,438
Forget Olmo. Forget the school.

479
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,606
This is very easy.

480
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,026
It's either our marriage or the elections.
You need to choose.

481
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,153
Either we do a threesome now,

482
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,822
or we go to school to get revenge on Olmo.

483
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,284
Choose.

484
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,333
Let's go, friend.

485
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,712
What she deserves.

486
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,172
Darn Dora.

487
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,322
Sorry we're late.

488
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,034
The traffic in this city is unbelievable.

489
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,661
-No. It's fine.
-Yes.

490
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,828
Everything okay?

491
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:44,746
Okay.

492
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,916
How about you?

493
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,250
Good.

494
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,919
Well, I mean…

495
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:52,796
All right.

496
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,090
Shall we start?

497
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,341
-Yes?
-Let's start.

498
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,638
Okay.

499
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:08,978
Tamara.

500
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,941
You're the sexiest woman
to ever set foot in this country.

501
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,568
You're…

502
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,781
You're the best thing Mexico has created.

503
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,243
You…

504
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,412
You're so hot.

505
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,089
Move, Roque. Sorry.

506
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,667
Hey!

507
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,753
Should I leave?

508
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,047
Go hard. Hard.

509
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,591
Yes, Vicente! Vicente!

510
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,009
Fuck me!

511
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,136
Go hard, Vicente!

512
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,764
-I'm leaving.
-Yes, that's it. That's it!

513
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,767
Yes!

514
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,477
Yes, Vicente! Yes!

515
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,478
Bye.

516
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,363
Once you're headmistress,
I'd like some days off.

517
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,323
Just a sec.

518
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,954
Oh, gross.

519
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,210
Roque, where are you?
Why aren't you there?

520
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,264
-Show me your ID.
-Someone called us with a tip.

521
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,433
-Wait. Why do you want my ID?
-Quick.

522
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,518
Give me your ID.

523
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,061
-Hey! You--
-You don't get it.

524
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,230
You can't touch my things, man!

525
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,773
What's going on, man?

526
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,900
You can't search my bag.
You can't do this.

527
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,193
-Here it is.
-Oh, dude!

528
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,861
-That's not mine.
-Come on.

529
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,947
-Hey, no! It's not mine!
-Come on, bring him.

530
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,906
Relax already!

531
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,533
What's going on, man? Hey!

532
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:27,992
That's not mine.

533
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,375
This left me speechless, Vicente.

534
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,628
My best fuck ever.

535
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,131
I didn't want to tell you about my kinks.

536
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,008
I thought you were very conservative.

537
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,303
But I do like perversion.

538
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,223
I hid my kinks from myself.

539
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,891
Roque watching us.

540
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,060
Wasn't that exciting?

541
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,436
Where is he?

542
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,273
Where's Roque?

543
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,942
When did he leave?

544
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:03,820
He's gone.

545
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,366
What if we've been alone all this time?

546
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,661
We get the credit.

547
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,663
I guess we should prove it.

548
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,459
We have a seat for you.

549
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,962
No need, thanks. I'm fine here.

550
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:23,882
Thanks.

551
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:25,884
Hello.

552
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,011
Has the threesome taken place?

553
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,930
Olmo, there's too many people here.

554
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,311
What a great day.

555
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,443
By popular vote,

556
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,570
the new headmistress

557
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,239
of our Andes San Javier School

558
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,283
is

559
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,118
Miss

560
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,829
Martha Sánchez.

561
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,165
Me?

562
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:07,216
Martha!

563
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,182
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

564
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,186
Can you all see me?

565
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,650
…we must be thankful

566
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,570
for the things the cosmos sends us.

567
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,411
What the fuck is this, Olmo?

568
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,759
