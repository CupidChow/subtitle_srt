1
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:24,774
The safest way to keep a secret

2
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,487
is by burying it six feet under.

3
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,541
SNAKES AND LADDERS

4
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,129
Things happen for a reason.

5
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,299
Right, sure, because he's a misogynist.

6
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,509
A crook.

7
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,386
And a homophobe!

8
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,889
Even so,

9
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,558
he's Toñito's dad.

10
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,394
Remember, you were both
a mother and a father.

11
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,563
-He was never there.
-You're right.

12
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,482
Better dead than alive and absent.

13
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,695
But I feel like they're gonna catch us.

14
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,490
Who? The police?

15
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,659
Come on, my friend! Open your eyes.

16
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,662
Trust me. I'll take care of this.

17
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,665
No one will ever see this

18
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,042
child support defaulter!

19
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,377
Let's see.

20
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,797
-Lopitos.
-Yes, sir?

21
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,799
-I need you now.
-Of course, sir.

22
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,304
-Yes, sir?
-That was fast.

23
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,432
-I was in the car, where you left me.
-Excellent service.

24
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,977
The dead guy is Antonio.

25
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,229
A true parasite.

26
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,731
-Sorry, Dora, but it's true.
-Actually, yeah.

27
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,817
-There are many in my neighborhood.
-Yeah.

28
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,319
I don't want anyone
to ever see this bastard again.

29
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,320
You know the drill.

30
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,865
-As if he'd vanished into thin air.
-Exactly.

31
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,325
Get moving, Lopitos! Come on!

32
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,756
Mrs. López, I regret to inform you
that your husband hasn't been seen

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,966
in the last three days.

34
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,218
What? That can't be!

35
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,138
I just saw him last week!

36
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,723
He's my son's father.

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,145
We've found a man
who matches his description.

38
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,438
Dead. In the river.

39
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,023
That's impossible.

40
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,193
No, that's too theatrical.

41
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,819
That's impossible.

42
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,573
"That's impossible." What's that?

43
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,992
Say it normally, "That's impossible."

44
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,037
-Normally, that's impossible.
-Don't say "normally."

45
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,705
"That's impossible." Please.

46
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,624
That's impossible.

47
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,626
He got drunk as usual. Jeez!

48
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,710
All right.

49
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,794
Ready.

50
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,715
-Shit! You broke his hand!
-No.

51
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,092
Do it right and act normal.

52
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,302
"That's impossible."

53
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,346
-That's impossible.
-Don't cry, Dora!

54
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,056
-Don't cry!
-You're too hard on me!

55
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,267
Calm down. No one's gonna find him.

56
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:50,021
They can't ask you
for an alibi or anything.

57
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,023
How can you be so sure? How do you know?

58
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,608
I know. Of course I'm sure.

59
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,527
No one's said anything
about the guy at your party?

60
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,446
Bernie? That never happened.

61
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,615
Neither did the thing with your ex.

62
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,951
You have to learn from politicians.

63
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,037
It's all about controlling the narrative.

64
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,501
Oh, Dora. Everything will be all right.

65
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,670
-It'll be all right.
-We'll talk tomorrow.

66
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,712
Everything…

67
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,422
Everything's gonna be all right.

68
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,467
Everything's gonna be all right.

69
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,385
Everything.

70
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,762
Everything's gonna be all right.

71
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,905
-Yes?
-Dora López?

72
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,370
That's impossible.

73
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,831
-What's impossible?
-I mean…

74
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,084
Well, you always bring bad news.

75
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,877
It's best if you don't tell me.

76
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,170
It's my duty, ma'am.

77
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,257
A man who fell, drunk,
into a river could be your husband.

78
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,467
I don't have a husband.

79
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,470
I have an ex-husband.

80
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,223
How? How do you know it's him?

81
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,559
He had his ID with him.

82
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,352
That's impossible.

83
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,564
Can you come identify him?
It's a simple procedure.

84
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,442
To release the body so you can bury him.

85
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,568
I'm so sorry.

86
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,569
Thank you.

87
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,239
Yes.

88
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,544
Son.

89
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,339
Toñito.

90
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,010
The police just came.

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,058
I have bad news, son.

92
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,936
Your father got very drunk.

93
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,481
He fell into the river.

94
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:00,818
Is he dead?

95
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,613
I'm so sorry.

96
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,956
Can you leave me alone for a minute?

97
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,919
Toño, I know your dad had many flaws.

98
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,045
I know.

99
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:23,132
But he always said you were
the best thing that ever happened to him.

100
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,719
Don't ever forget that.

101
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,806
I'm right here.

102
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,307
I'm here.

103
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,225
Yes.

104
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,248
Laura, baby.

105
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,598
Nico.

106
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,436
You know I'm not into Toño.

107
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,396
He's, like,

108
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,273
kind of rural.

109
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,442
Toño?

110
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,903
Why are you telling me
you're not into Toño?

111
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:30,366
I sense tension between you two,
and I know it's about me.

112
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,411
Listen.

113
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,541
I mean, I get
that your alpha male instinct

114
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,668
makes you fight over me.

115
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,296
But there's really no need.

116
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,006
Sure, uh-huh.

117
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,257
-Times have changed.
-Yes.

118
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,887
A woman like me has every right
to have a boyfriend and a male friend.

119
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,513
It's not like that.

120
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,932
What then?

121
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,562
What do we do
about the testosterone between you two?

122
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,815
Don't make me suffer.

123
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,777
Trust me,
being this beautiful is burden enough.

124
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,998
-I have something to tell you.
-Don't even worry.

125
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,583
I see Toño as a friend.

126
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,419
Baby, what we have is perfect.

127
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,587
Nothing's perfect.

128
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,547
We'll make our dreams come true together.

129
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:31,260
You'll have your political career.
I'll be your influencer first lady.

130
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,180
Always together, right?

131
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,893
Spanish authorities
revoked our export permits

132
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,269
but didn't say why.

133
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,732
They say
it's due to "bureaucratic issues."

134
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,028
Then fix the bureaucratic issue.

135
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,572
Men are fixers.

136
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,784
What are we, men or worms?

137
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,410
Men.

138
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,666
It's the consuls.

139
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,460
Fucking colonizer consuls.

140
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,045
Attack, Gil!

141
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,297
They'll relive The Night of Sorrows!

142
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,549
Genocides!

143
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,842
You're the best, dude.

144
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:12,885
A genius!

145
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,680
Hey, tell your wife I said hi.

146
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,557
Thanks a lot, rockstar.

147
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,016
Well?

148
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,187
It's done.

149
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,940
No more euros for the chocolate maker.

150
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,610
I'd pay to see his face when he finds out.

151
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,945
Son of a bitch.

152
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,659
Dinner is ready.

153
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,910
Thanks, Cleo.

154
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,833
The governor. I have to take this.

155
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,377
I mean… Well, I'll be right there.

156
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,670
Vicentín, time to eat.

157
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,047
Governor, it's great talking to you.

158
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,799
What's up, Chente? How are you?

159
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,803
I'm calling to ask
how it's going with my papers.

160
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,807
Okay, how can I explain this?

161
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:05,104
It turns out your family
didn't precisely help the Jews.

162
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,316
My team discovered that, in 1940,

163
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,861
your ancestors gave money
to the German Nazi Party.

164
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,031
Well, the Jews got kicked out of Spain
for a reason, didn't they?

165
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,241
Vicente, try harder, man!

166
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,619
If you get me the Spanish passport,

167
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,455
I'll immediately green-light

168
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:26,417
the Spanish phone company's entry
into this country.

169
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,919
-How about that?
-I promise I'll do my best.

170
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,046
That's it!

171
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,048
Go Spain, damn it!

172
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,466
Vicente, dinner's ready!

173
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,051
Talk to you soon, Chente.

174
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,010
Amen!

175
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:49,899
Hey!

176
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,653
I'm not sure I'll be able
to help the governor now.

177
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,071
Why?

178
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,823
I just asked to block Olmo's exports.

179
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,118
I'll have to wait awhile
before making any more calls.

180
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,038
Galician cow steak and ham from Huelva.

181
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,749
This smells amazing.

182
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,125
Aren't you eating, son?

183
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,877
I ordered some enchiladas.

184
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,671
And for the king of the house…

185
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,589
Finger-licking good!

186
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,133
Tamara, our son is getting tropicalized.

187
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,511
Did you hear Miss Dora's husband died?

188
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,722
His funeral is tomorrow. We're going.

189
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,475
Why would we?
Besides, she's Olmo's friend.

190
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,645
Sure, but we must keep our enemies close.

191
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,523
I also came up

192
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,900
with an idea.

193
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,906
You will enjoy it.

194
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,411
Vicentín, eat up.

195
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,582
THE BOAT I'LL DEPART IN…
COMPASSIONATE FUNERAL SERVICES

196
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,504
EBONY AND CARBON FIBER

197
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,298
ECONOMICAL PINEWOOD

198
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,645
Hello.

199
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,646
Dora López?

200
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,566
-I'm sorry for your loss.
-Thanks.

201
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,568
Can I bring you some water, coffee?

202
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,069
-No.
-Can I help you with that?

203
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,863
No, thanks.

204
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,448
Follow me, please.

205
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:27,788
Jeez.

206
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,420
Here's your husband.

207
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,715
Ex-husband.

208
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,467
Sorry.

209
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,761
You can open the lid if you want.

210
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:48,058
Would you mind
leaving me alone with him a second?

211
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,727
Gladly.

212
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,228
Make yourself at home.

213
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,146
Excuse me.

214
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,357
Oh God.

215
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,451
Let's see.

216
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,470
-What a tragedy!
-Yes.

217
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,763
Toño, it's a shame.

218
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,767
It wasn't strange
that he didn't pick up the phone.

219
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,018
Especially in the morning.

220
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,437
He liked partying.

221
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,689
And… Sit down.

222
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,525
And…

223
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:41,904
Then the police told me
they'd found his body.

224
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,407
Well, you know how much he liked drinking.

225
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,618
That's where it got him.

226
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,120
At the bottom of the river.

227
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,334
At least he died
doing what he liked the most.

228
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,335
Right?

229
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,253
Oh God!

230
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,129
Such a surprise.

231
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,841
We are so sorry, Miss Dora.

232
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,050
Thanks.

233
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,343
It must be hard.

234
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:05,803
Right, honey?

235
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,222
I mean, within a week, they fired you…

236
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,598
No! I quit.

237
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,352
Well, you quit and became a widow.

238
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,062
We were already divorced.

239
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,439
-It hurts either way.
-Horrible.

240
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,858
-My condolences.
-So difficult.

241
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,776
Who? What?

242
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,616
You think he knows now?

243
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,120
Have you offered your condolences
to Dora, Miss "Olé, olé"?

244
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,414
In English?

245
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,417
And in pajamas? It's cool.

246
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,127
-Not pajamas.
-Excuse me.

247
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,169
Yes, go ahead.

248
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,504
It's energetic.

249
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,840
-It's what?
-It's energetic, not pajamas.

250
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,426
He was a poor soul, yes,
but a bastard too.

251
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,385
Oh, Mom!

252
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,387
Oh, Dora.

253
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,849
-I'm so sorry you're going through this.
-Thanks.

254
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,975
I mean,

255
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,436
first what happened at school, now this.

256
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,104
Don't worry.

257
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,691
You'll get good severance pay.
I'll take care of that.

258
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,901
No.

259
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,153
I don't deserve any severance pay.

260
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,779
I quit!

261
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,740
-Hey!
-It's true.

262
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:11,160
We'll use that money
for something more useful for the school.

263
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,913
-I hope so. That'll be hard.
-After all these years.

264
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,748
-Sure.
-If you'll excuse us.

265
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,251
-Move that, sir.
-Excuse us. Thank you.

266
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,629
That's fine. Thanks.

267
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,922
-Roque?
-What?

268
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,508
-I said a small wreath, not a big one.
-What kind is this?

269
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,302
-It's from the governor.
-Extra-large.

270
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,220
-Extra-large?
-Yes, extra-large.

271
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,264
I've never seen one like this. Have you?

272
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,017
-Have you?
-No.

273
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,731
I didn't know
she was friends with the governor.

274
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,817
That's why you need to get him
his passport already.

275
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,823
Excuse me.

276
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,783
What's up?

277
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,368
Mr. Chocolate.

278
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,244
Are we bothering you?

279
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,829
No, not at all.

280
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,791
It's just that now it reeks of shit.

281
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,878
Who do you think you are?

282
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,048
Moctezuma Xocoyotzin?

283
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:07,925
Where's the gold?

284
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,718
He was betrayed by other Natives.

285
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,262
No. No one betrays me.

286
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,392
You sabotaged my exports to Spain.

287
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,144
You thought I wouldn't notice?

288
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,479
Please!

289
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,732
Your plan stinks of amateur shit.

290
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,235
Wait, no.

291
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,654
Don't overestimate yourself.

292
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,365
Us? Do something against you?

293
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,535
Fuck you!

294
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,869
You wish.

295
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,206
We don't give a fuck.

296
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,042
We don't give a fuck, damn it!

297
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,140
I'M DEEPLY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS
GOVERNOR COSÍO

298
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,642
Damn governor.

299
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,437
Hi, Dora.

300
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,896
-Hello.
-Hi, Olmo.

301
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,023
May I?

302
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,607
Let's talk.

303
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,234
I'll be right back.

304
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,155
Death is so unexpected.

305
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,115
What do you want, Olmo?

306
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,534
Listen.

307
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,785
What's going on?

308
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,621
-I'm talking to everyone.
-I get that.

309
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,748
I'm your friend.

310
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,375
I help you with everything.

311
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,879
But now it turns out my nemeses
have come to your husband's funeral.

312
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,257
And the governor, who you allegedly hate,

313
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,177
sends you a huge wreath.

314
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,511
What's all this?

315
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,139
Listen, Olmo. First, he's my ex-husband.

316
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,140
Please.

317
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,976
Secondly, I can't control
who comes or who doesn't. Come on!

318
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,186
Kick them out!

319
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,356
I don't feel comfortable.

320
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,401
What are they doing here?

321
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,154
They're not your friends. I am.

322
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,907
You realize how much this affects me?

323
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,161
While you welcome them with open arms,
they're screwing up my business.

324
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,954
They're ruining my life, Dora!

325
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,289
Calm down, Olmo.

326
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,874
Relax.

327
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,793
Don't you get it?

328
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,588
I became a widow
and was fired the same week.

329
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,215
I have to look devastated.

330
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,217
Leave me alone.

331
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,136
Jeez!

332
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:18,972
I'm so sorry.

333
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,266
-Thanks for coming.
-It's okay.

334
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,066
Toño, we need to talk.

335
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,610
-We have nothing to talk about.
-Why not?

336
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,033
Thanks.

337
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,661
Thanks for coming. Go with my mom.

338
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,914
She's having a very hard time.

339
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,625
Okay? Please go.

340
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,752
Comfort her. Thanks.

341
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,170
Thanks.

342
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,219
Because of you,
my dad died angry at me. That's why.

343
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,096
He rejected you, and it's my fault?

344
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,931
He used you against your mom.

345
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,852
He mooched off you
and beat you up every other day.

346
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,187
And what's worse,

347
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,648
he made you hate yourself.

348
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,372
He was an asshole.

349
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,878
But he was my dad.

350
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,592
I hate him because of what he said to me.

351
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,469
It's normal that it hurts.

352
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,430
And at the same time--

353
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,556
It's like sex.

354
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,775
Peace be with you.

355
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,444
Thanks.

356
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,571
Peace be with you.

357
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,823
What was that?

358
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,867
It's what Catholics say.

359
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,203
That's said at mass, not at a funeral.

360
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,665
I'm not a fervent believer,
but if you're gonna do it, do it right.

361
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,501
Toñito.

362
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,588
-I'm deeply sorry for your loss.
-Thanks.

363
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,673
-Okay.
-Thanks.

364
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,051
Where's Juana?

365
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,427
Where did you leave her?

366
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,221
She's on her way.

367
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,014
We said we'd meet here.

368
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,058
I'll ask her where she is.

369
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,358
Didn't you tell her?

370
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,616
I didn't expect you to come.

371
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,785
Oh, come on!

372
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,204
Just listen.

373
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,081
This is important. The thing is,

374
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,084
I don't get good vibes here.

375
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,503
You know? It's like

376
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,172
something smells fishy.

377
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,257
Right?

378
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,300
This is all I could afford.

379
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,886
Antonio had nothing.

380
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,304
Literally nothing.

381
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,847
No.

382
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,517
I'm sensing something powerful.

383
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,187
I sense Antonio's death
wasn't an accident.

384
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,398
Stop it, Martha Sánchez!

385
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,944
People say accidents don't exist.

386
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,738
Especially when it comes to a drunkard.

387
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,116
As was his case. Just between us two.

388
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,742
-What's up?
-Juana, where are you?

389
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,286
-Hi.
-I'm home.

390
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,912
-Olmo.
-Your friends are waiting.

391
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,623
I feel him connected to the deceased.

392
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,582
Why?

393
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,961
I don't know.
I feel the murderer is close.

394
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,005
Like Antonio was killed on purpose.

395
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,715
It wasn't on purpose!

396
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,632
All right.

397
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,635
I mean, that's what I think.

398
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,263
It couldn't have been on purpose.

399
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,891
Because when things happen,

400
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,186
they happen for a reason, right?

401
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,189
Maybe I'm just seeing things.

402
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,524
I guess so.

403
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,110
Yes, you are, Martha Sánchez.

404
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,486
And…

405
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,240
Listen, I'll be honest with you.

406
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,992
If you came here

407
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,413
just to upset me
at my ex-husband's funeral,

408
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,708
I'll kindly ask you to leave.

409
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,959
Oh no!

410
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,378
No. I even brought my guitar
in case you need it.

411
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,838
Yes, I'll need it.

412
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,673
I hope this makes you feel better.

413
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,591
Thanks.

414
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,521
Oh, Miss Vero.

415
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,899
Can I talk to the teacher for a sec?

416
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,943
Vicentín is struggling at PE, right?

417
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,154
Of course, ma'am. See you.

418
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,280
-Sure.
-Thanks.

419
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,492
It's so nice to see you here, Roque.

420
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,202
Mrs. Tamara.

421
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,455
Too bad these are the circumstances.

422
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,916
Your text messages made me very horny.

423
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,126
My text messages?

424
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,711
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

425
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,968
If you write the same way you fuck,
then write me a whole novel.

426
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:08,804
A novel?

427
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,430
Listen, come.

428
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,849
-Where?
-Come.

429
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,935
It's now or never. Come on.

430
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,318
DO NOT ENTER

431
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,904
Come on.

432
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,742
What are we doing here?

433
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,536
Help me choose one.

434
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,579
One?

435
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,126
I think we need a bigger one.

436
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,462
I'm not sure this is a good idea.

437
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,882
Look, there's a saying in Spain
that goes,

438
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,136
"The bigger, the better."

439
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,387
Take your clothes off.

440
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,736
VICENTE

441
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,197
You're always welcome in my office.

442
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,950
Miss Josefina, if you'll excuse me.

443
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,703
It's a very important call from Spain.

444
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,662
Of course.

445
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,747
Your Majesty.

446
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,667
Such an honor and joy hearing you.

447
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,295
It's the King.

448
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,337
Juan Carlos?

449
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,297
Felipe.

450
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,757
Please forgive me. There's too much noise.

451
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,720
Communications in Mexico
aren't as good as in Europe.

452
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,690
This is too tight.

453
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,150
-It's fine.
-No.

454
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,360
Lie down!

455
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,806
CELESTIAL SODAS

456
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,271
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,

457
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,690
and to the Holy Spirit.

458
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,776
As it was in the beginning,

459
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:31,154
is now, and ever shall be…

460
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,197
Amen.

461
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,785
Dear ladies,

462
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,287
dear gentlemen,

463
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,707
in honor of Antonio,

464
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:47,379
and to bring some comfort
to our son Toño here,

465
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,590
and to his relatives and friends…

466
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:55,136
That is, if he still had any friends
and they were here today.

467
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,808
I'd like to say a few words.

468
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,102
When it comes to death,

469
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:06,064
we are all the same.

470
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:11,736
Under the scythe's edge, we all fall.

471
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,200
Both rich and poor.

472
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:23,790
It doesn't matter if it's a kind person

473
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:27,210
or a horrible sinner,

474
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:31,840
because death asks no questions.

475
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:42,392
-Roque, I've never been so horny. Fuck me.
-Under its dark veil, it burns you.

476
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,560
Fuck me.

477
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:46,438
It kisses you. It traps you.

478
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,821
It drags you to its abyss.

479
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,825
Like a distant, cold mother

480
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,202
that is unforgiving.

481
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,996
But…

482
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,914
But…

483
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,167
No, wait.

484
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,753
We're not just here to cry.

485
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,424
We're also here
to remember Antonio's good traits.

486
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:18,219
But to do so,
we have to go way back in time.

487
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,431
To back when he was in college.

488
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,432
There,

489
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:27,145
he won this trophy.

490
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:33,652
He was very fond
and very proud of this darn trophy.

491
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,071
Today,

492
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,238
I give you…

493
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,491
We give you…

494
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,786
-Repeat after me.
-We give you.

495
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:47,457
…all the good things life gave you

496
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,252
so you can take them with you
and have them there with you,

497
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,923
where you'll continue debating

498
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,425
with the angels.

499
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,302
All the good things life gave you…

500
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,220
Of course.

501
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,473
…debating with the angels.

502
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,231
Martha. Martha Sánchez.

503
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,608
-He's gone.
-He is.

504
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,693
He went too soon.

505
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,403
Martha, the guitar.

506
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,613
We must end this event.

507
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,031
Lower.

508
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,574
-I can't.
-Yes, you can.

509
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,742
No, I can't.

510
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:31,292
He doesn't even answer the phone anymore

511
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,880
My hope is hanging from a thread

512
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:41,970
I never thought
I could lose my head like this

513
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,514
For him

514
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:50,103
Why did he suddenly not want me?

515
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:54,482
Why has my life been left empty?

516
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,861
Nobody answers my questions

517
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:02,866
Because I have nothing left without him

518
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:09,164
He's gone, the perfume of his hair is gone

519
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:13,752
He's gone
The murmur of his silences is gone

520
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:17,964
He's gone, his fabled smile is gone

521
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:21,926
-Sadness makes me horny.
-The sweet honey I tasted is gone

522
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,887
It's very sad your dad died.

523
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,640
He's gone, I'm only left with his venom

524
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:31,811
He's gone, and my love is covered with ice

525
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:36,691
He's gone, and my life left with him
He's gone…

526
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,485
-Okay, now, push.
-It closed shut?

527
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,486
-Push.
-No.

528
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,779
-Push.
-I'm pushing.

529
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,407
…tears

530
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,201
Bravo!

531
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,036
Bravo!

532
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,378
-Such a beautiful tribute, Dora.
-Thanks.

533
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:01,925
What's with this funeral home?
It smells like a cheap motel.

534
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,344
Dad, have you seen Nicolás?

535
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,097
They just left.
They were here and went that way.

536
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,434
Nicolás has been with Toño all day,
keeping him company.

537
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,520
So sweet.

538
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,900
Well, at least
they made amends after this.

539
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,444
I'll look for them.

540
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,245
We'll open it. Push, you're strong!

541
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,955
I can't.

542
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,122
-Listen, Roque.
-No.

543
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,707
Relax. Everything's okay.

544
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:35,625
Vicente.

545
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,293
-Please.
-We need help, Vicente.

546
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,505
Vicente, can you hear me?
We're trapped in the storage room.

547
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,422
Breathe.

548
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,178
-Please.
-Yes, okay.

549
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,721
Push.

550
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:49,722
With your legs.

551
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,933
No, I can't.

552
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,186
SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.

553
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,441
Vicente, can you hear me?

554
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,360
Please.

555
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,112
For Christ's sake!

556
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,463
I love it.

557
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,847
-Here!
-Here?

558
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,307
Here where?

559
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,475
We're inside a coffin. Please.

560
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,686
-That doesn't help me.
-Get us out already!

561
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,521
PE teacher!

562
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,108
They all left. Do you want me to stay?

563
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,693
No, it's over.

564
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:44,611
Are you sure?

565
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,821
-Yes, it's over.
-Just for a little while?

566
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,156
No, thanks.

567
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,533
-We sang and everything, Martha Sánchez.
-Okay.

568
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,327
Okay then. Take care.

569
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,955
-Thanks.
-Bye.

570
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,582
Good night.

571
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,721
Hello?

572
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,983
Hurry up! We can't breathe.

573
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,068
Relax.

574
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,195
-Please.
-Breathe.

575
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,822
Please.

576
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,532
Please, help.

577
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,492
Here!

578
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,702
Hurry up. We can't breathe.

579
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,120
Help!

580
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:37,956
Please.

581
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:40,833
Hurry, please.

582
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,173
Oh, Vicente, get me out.

583
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,637
Were you listening?

584
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,933
Help me get out.

585
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:41,370
