1
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,045
There are irrational actions

2
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,589
that can change our lives.

3
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,718
Or they can change us for life.

4
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,020
SNAKES AND LADDERS

5
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,662
What is that?

6
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,999
Nothing, I fell.

7
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,920
Don't ruin my night with your lies.

8
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,799
You can't afford to go down the evil path.
You know why?

9
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,385
Because you don't even have
the aptitude for it.

10
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,930
It's worrying, really.

11
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,933
I never see you.
And when I see you, all you want is money.

12
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:27,230
Am I asking you for money right now?
Don't worry about it. I borrowed some.

13
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,398
From who, your dad?

14
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,734
My new friends turned out to be useful.

15
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,027
Isn't that what you wanted?

16
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,655
You dared to ask Juana Muriel for money?

17
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,782
I didn't raise you that way.

18
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,576
I'm warning you, huh?

19
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,786
Damned if I ask you for cash.

20
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,331
Damned if I don't. Nothing I do is right.
Make up your mind, Dora.

21
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,000
Shut up!

22
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,002
Don't call me by my name. I'm your mother!

23
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,255
You'd better not get
Juana Muriel in trouble, Toño.

24
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,465
Don't worry about her.

25
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,509
Juana Muriel isn't the problem.

26
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,802
Sure!

27
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,972
I can't ever have a good time.

28
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,599
Seriously, what the hell?

29
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,147
How's my favorite prefect?

30
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,482
-Olmo.
-Well, not a prefect anymore.

31
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,194
-I know, Olmo. Listen.
-My cabaret singer.

32
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,278
Listen to me.

33
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,280
I need help with Toño.

34
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,866
-With what?
-He's been lying a lot lately.

35
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,993
Good morning!

36
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,418
Here we go again,

37
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,504
in this hideous teacher's uniform.

38
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,591
But chasing our goal.

39
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,301
Laura, baby.

40
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,556
-What?
-Yes.

41
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,933
You really didn't know?

42
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:45,850
No.

43
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,686
Miss Paula was hospitalized.
Miss Dora is replacing her.

44
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,898
I'll create a chat group
to send her a gift or something.

45
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,692
Once she's discharged,
they say she's moving to Puerto Vallarta.

46
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,404
Another chat? Dani, for real?
No, for God's sake.

47
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,406
-She likes…
-Good morning, mommies!

48
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,908
-Good morning, Dora.
-Morning.

49
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,201
Good morning!

50
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,496
I heard that she likes
geraniums and hydrangeas.

51
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,498
Maybe flowers, and--

52
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,917
She ended up in the hospital
because she's diabetic.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,085
Unless she's into keto.

54
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,253
Maybe a stuffed animal.

55
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,214
Any news?

56
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,715
Nothing.

57
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,635
That woman is immune to my attributes.

58
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,303
I took my shirt off at the gym.

59
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,973
I took it off in the rain.
I took it off in her car.

60
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,225
This mare can't be tamed.

61
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,186
You took off your shirt?

62
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,022
That's all you did?

63
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,357
What?

64
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:35,858
Should I do more?

65
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,111
That's how thousands have fallen.

66
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,070
Roque,

67
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,906
this isn't a strip club.

68
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,451
You're seducing a consul's wife.

69
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,539
I'm desperate for evidence
to blackmail her

70
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,125
so she'll stop messing with my plans.

71
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,503
You need to be creative, I don't know…

72
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,505
Text her.

73
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,631
Text her?

74
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,591
Yes, or call her.

75
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,843
I don't know. You need to be

76
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,178
romantic, innovative.

77
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,764
You've never had to try hard
for a woman, have you?

78
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,184
-No.
-Well, there's always a first time.

79
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,853
So figure it out.

80
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,940
I have to find out what her plans are
now that Miss Paula won't be headmistress.

81
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,067
Okay, fine.

82
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:19,902
Not like that.

83
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,863
With confidence.

84
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,740
Okay, fine.

85
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,866
No.

86
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,868
Okay. Fine.

87
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:31,956
Listen, Roque, that's why the school
never wins medals in sports.

88
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,333
You're weak!

89
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,924
Good morning!

90
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,345
Good morning, Prefect Dora!

91
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,388
As you know,

92
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,891
I'm Miss Dora.

93
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,186
You know me. I'm the prefect.

94
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:57,190
But now I will be your teacher.

95
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,568
Let's start. Take out your books

96
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,489
because now,

97
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:09,827
the wonderful journey of knowledge begins.

98
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,496
What did they say?

99
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,832
That Miss Paula is retiring.
And I said, "What?"

100
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,169
But Miss Paula
is the school's next headmistress.

101
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,546
What do you mean you're retiring?

102
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,008
Mrs. Tamara,
I thank you very much for your support

103
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,635
and those beautiful flowers.

104
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,346
But if some chocolate
brought me to the hospital,

105
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,889
I cannot fail again.

106
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,975
That is why I have decided…

107
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,230
to stop teaching.

108
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,651
I never should've had that chocolate!

109
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,987
What do you mean chocolate?
What chocolate, Miss Paula?

110
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,115
The kind they sell at school.

111
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,491
Olmo Muriel's brand?

112
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,661
Yes.

113
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:56,207
I never should've had that chocolate!

114
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,667
Cleo!

115
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,753
When is Vicentín's birthday?

116
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,839
September 20th!

117
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,398
Miss Vero?

118
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,902
Was there a parents' meeting today?
I forgot. No way.

119
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,944
No.

120
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,530
I only came to discuss Miss Paula.

121
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:16,078
It's just that her departure left
a huge void in the run for headmistress.

122
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:16,996
Is that so?

123
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,122
And I'm wondering,

124
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,250
"What experienced teacher

125
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,670
with an impeccable track record
could fill that void?"

126
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,838
I can't think of one.

127
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,007
You, Miss Vero. Who else?

128
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,469
Who'd vote for me? I don't even know
what to offer in the campaign.

129
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:35,431
I and all the moms are concerned

130
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,935
about the bad practices
that take place in this school.

131
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,853
The food, for example.

132
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,607
The school menu
is all sugar and saturated fats.

133
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,526
Look what happened to Miss Paula

134
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,029
because of some chocolate
she ate here at school!

135
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,323
Didn't you know?

136
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,825
Look.

137
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,913
I swear that if you present
your candidacy,

138
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,917
all the moms in this school
will vote for you.

139
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,378
Do you think so?

140
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,879
You could beat Dora.

141
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,637
…sugar.

142
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,638
GOOD MORNING, ALL

143
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,015
MISS VERO AND I TALKED.
WE SHOULD CHANGE THE MENU

144
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,642
TO A HEALTHIER, SUGAR-FREE MENU.

145
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,024
Teacher.

146
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,694
I have someone who can help you with Toño.

147
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,699
The driver?

148
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,493
Lopitos is the whole package.

149
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,414
Errand boy, driver,
and very good at investigating.

150
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,292
He took care of our little problem
at the party.

151
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,585
-Olmo!
-Bernie.

152
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,336
Ma'am.

153
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,382
Guadalupe López,
at your service, and my boss'.

154
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,010
Lopitos was with my father.

155
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,053
Now he's with me. He has my full trust.

156
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,973
I'll follow the suspect, your son.

157
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,183
And he won't even notice.

158
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,435
I mean it.

159
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,730
I'll get to the bottom of this
and keep you informed.

160
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,106
All right.

161
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,942
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Lopitos.

162
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,153
Lopitos!

163
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,540
So vintage.

164
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,500
Do they look good?

165
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,672
Relax already. I won't wear them
in public. I'm not stupid.

166
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,094
Anyway, I'll go now.

167
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,264
I'll see you tomorrow.

168
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:42,850
Bye.

169
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:44,977
Bye.

170
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,498
-Okay, no.
-What?

171
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,834
This can't happen. I have a girlfriend.

172
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,253
I'm with the Conservative Party.

173
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,880
I'm a Legionnaire.

174
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,840
I can't be gay.

175
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,385
Fuck, imagine if you could be.

176
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,930
It's easy for you to criticize.
You have nothing to lose.

177
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,223
My life had meaning.

178
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,184
I had a career, political aspirations.

179
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,061
You're dragging me down, Toño.

180
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,270
Listen. Chill.

181
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,941
If you were so happy,
so content, with Juana

182
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,276
and with your closeted life before,
that's fine.

183
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,737
I'll go so you don't get stressed.
I'll go.

184
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,322
I'll call an Uber.

185
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,992
I'm booking it. It's almost here. Almost.

186
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,079
You don't even have the Uber app.

187
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:37,798
LINKED

188
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,091
LINKED FROM "TAMARA"

189
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,388
Olé!

190
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,182
That's it.

191
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,559
Hey.

192
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,643
What's going on?

193
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,896
Didn't you see the moms' chat?

194
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,105
The moms' chat?

195
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,648
Read it.

196
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,150
CLAUDIA: POOR KIDS

197
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,153
If I were you, I'd go.

198
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,738
We'll see.

199
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,655
Let's go.

200
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,284
Have fun, my little milky chocolate.

201
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,205
Of course the school's head office
listens to the parents.

202
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,165
And I assure you that we'll do our best

203
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:15,211
to improve the cafeteria menu,
making it much healthier.

204
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,962
Of course, it'll take some time.

205
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,966
But I think we can start
by consuming less sugar.

206
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,468
-Excuse me?
-I totally agree.

207
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,677
Yes.

208
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:30,100
We'll prohibit sugar and chocolate
consumption on school premises.

209
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,685
-Is that okay?
-Very well.

210
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,521
Zero tolerance.

211
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,023
-Hey, Vicentín!
-I think it's great.

212
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,983
-Hey, Choquita!
-Vicentín!

213
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,068
-No!
-No!

214
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,362
-Let go of him!
-Let's go! Don't touch her.

215
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,279
Sweetie!

216
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,906
-Sweetie, that way.
-Vicentín.

217
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,367
-No. We have an agreement.
-Have fun! That way.

218
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,246
Fucking bitch.

219
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,927
MR. CHOCO
MISSED CALL

220
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,598
Kids, please!

221
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,060
You don't have to shout to paint!

222
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,780
Alfonso!

223
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,617
Be careful, son.

224
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:33,664
You could've hit me in the eye.
Imagine, you'll leave me one-eyed.

225
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,251
Did you tell a child
that he could leave you one-eyed?

226
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,296
I told him, "You're lucky, huh?"

227
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,798
"That you didn't leave me one-eyed."

228
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,259
But that doesn't mean that I was saying,

229
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,344
"Hey, you made me one-eyed."

230
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,221
-No.
-Well, the kid is crying.

231
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,264
A lot.

232
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:55,978
I mean, you made him feel guilty
for something that didn't even happen.

233
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,273
No, that was a misunderstanding,
Miss Josefina.

234
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,443
Why would you associate
being one-eyed with something bad?

235
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:06,488
Those are not the values of equality
that we teach at Andes San Javier.

236
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,366
Yes, I mean, I do understand.
And I'm very sorry.

237
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,327
It won't happen again, Miss Josefina.

238
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,165
Under the anti-sadness protocol,
you will have to apologize to the student.

239
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,293
Frankly, I find it excessive to apologize.

240
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,921
No child suffers here

241
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,466
because children who suffer
complain to their parents,

242
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,093
and the parents come and complain to me.

243
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,306
Come in.

244
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,734
Alfonso.

245
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,111
Will you forgive me?

246
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:51,909
Thank you.

247
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,355
The consuls came back for revenge.

248
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,943
Why else would they ban sugar at school?

249
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,736
They want to sink me.

250
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,072
They want to humiliate me.

251
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,407
Enough, Olmo!

252
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,534
They're hitting me
where it hurts the most.

253
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:34,827
-Your daughters?
-What?

254
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,745
Yes, my daughters.

255
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,832
What hurts me the most,
after my daughters, is my company.

256
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,710
I built it single-handedly.
From scratch. I'm a dad and a mom.

257
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,670
Wait, didn't your grandfather found it?

258
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,838
Excuse me.

259
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,548
The point is

260
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,759
that this is one of the consuls' schemes.

261
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,677
Take this.

262
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,930
-"Take this."
-They talked to Miss Vero.

263
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,975
To Miss Josefina, to the moms.

264
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,811
The moms love Miss Vero.

265
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,439
And now it turns out they hate sugar!

266
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,857
Stop, Olmo!

267
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,316
Listen to me! Sit down!

268
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,570
Look.

269
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,113
First…

270
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,074
first…

271
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,327
I don't know, breathe.

272
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,163
Yeah, inhale, exhale.

273
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,499
Hear me out.

274
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,711
If I get involved in this argument,

275
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,379
that's what Tamara wants.

276
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,381
Of course.

277
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:33,135
To turn the daddies and mommies
against me, but no.

278
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,845
So?

279
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,556
Well, we have to wait.

280
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,017
For the right moment.

281
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,853
And then, you strike the blow
with everything you've got.

282
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,021
Okay.

283
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,983
But promise you won't rush things,
that you'll wait.

284
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,236
I promise.

285
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,530
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

286
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,496
Pathetic.

287
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,712
Hello.

288
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,507
Everything okay?

289
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,099
How was your day?

290
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,559
Fine, normal. Yours?

291
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,615
I WISH I WERE IN BED WITH YOU RIGHT NOW

292
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,500
DELETE ALL PICS

293
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,711
I WISH I WERE IN BED WITH YOU RIGHT NOW

294
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,464
TOUCHING THESE PAGES GENTLY
JUST LIKE I'D TOUCH YOU

295
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,472
Take this to school

296
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,559
and share it with your classmates
for your birthday.

297
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,312
-Her birthday is a month away.
-You can celebrate it whenever you want.

298
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,400
Not when the calendar says so.
Right, my little milky chocolate?

299
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,442
Yes, Daddy.

300
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,655
What's new with Tamara?

301
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,241
-She hasn't answered a single message.
-No.

302
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,202
Really, Roque. Let's see. Give it to me.

303
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,541
No wonder.

304
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,877
These are the pictures you sent her?

305
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,794
What?

306
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,964
This is all you're capable of, Roque?

307
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,258
You need to attack her libido.

308
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,469
Not just with your looks,
but with your scarce intellect.

309
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,387
Take this!

310
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,349
Hey! No!

311
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,434
Hey!

312
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,476
Find peace.

313
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,728
Apologize to him.

314
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,147
-What's up, Martha Sánchez?
-Oh, look at him.

315
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,650
-Oh no.
-Look at those arms and that ass.

316
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,235
Want some chocolate?

317
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,236
Yes!

318
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,197
No.

319
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,490
What's going on here?

320
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,700
Hey, children.

321
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,160
Sure you don't want some?

322
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,578
Mom put me on a diet.

323
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,662
Okay, listen.

324
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:10,125
You know that chocolate
is forbidden here at school.

325
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,920
But it's to celebrate my birthday.

326
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,713
Oh, is it?

327
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,882
What's going on?

328
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,927
But rules are rules.

329
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,887
So I'll have to take it from you.

330
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,472
Let go.

331
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,806
Let go!

332
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,726
This is the worst birthday of my life!

333
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,896
It's not even your birthday.

334
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,442
You're mean!

335
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,362
No, I'm not mean! And I will report you!

336
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,951
What part of the anti-sadness protocol
didn't you understand?

337
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,786
Yes, I understand, but--

338
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,790
Then explain to me
why Olmo Muriel's daughter is crying.

339
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:53,043
I simply took the forbidden chocolate
away from her.

340
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,171
But you must use tact,

341
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,674
subtlety, diplomacy.

342
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:03,345
I say this for your sake
because unhappy parents

343
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:07,224
won't vote for you
in the coming elections.

344
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,145
Hey.

345
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,607
How about we go to a hotel?

346
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,026
-A hotel? No, you're crazy.
-It's uncomfortable.

347
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,111
Who cares?

348
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,696
Help me with my belt.

349
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,698
-No.
-Yes. Come on.

350
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,744
Wait.

351
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,706
Fuck, it's Juana.

352
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,375
I forgot. We were supposed to meet her.

353
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,753
Don't laugh, dude. What should I do?

354
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,132
You're so rude to not even reply.
The Orendains went on a trip to Europe.

355
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,676
It's perfect for our first job together.

356
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,428
Well, it's your loss.

357
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,352
Now what?

358
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,437
Well, enjoy.

359
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:54,938
Just a minute.

360
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,437
Oh, youth.

361
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,357
What a treasure.

362
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,597
-What are you doing here?
-You're avoiding me, aren't you?

363
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,224
I didn't want to wake you up.

364
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,520
Toño, you disappear every night.

365
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,982
And I don't even know where you're going,

366
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,193
or who you're with,

367
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,070
or what you're up to,

368
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,490
or if you still have debts or anything.

369
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:32,035
So listen, I have time.

370
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,162
I'm listening.

371
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:38,625
I'm tired. I'm sleepy. Not right now.

372
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,378
I'm talking to you, Toño.

373
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,840
My house is not a hotel

374
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,759
where you just come to sleep. You hear me?

375
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:52,264
And I just asked you a question
that you are going to answer.

376
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,520
Yes.

377
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,191
Maybe I haven't told you a few

378
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,485
little things.

379
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,736
What little things?

380
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,324
Mom…

381
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,706
I'm gay.

382
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,707
Oh, Toño.

383
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,630
Tell me something I don't know.

384
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:27,883
Are you serious?

385
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,509
Oh, my boy.

386
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,681
Look, we moms
know everything about our children,

387
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:39,186
even before you even know
what's going on with you.

388
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,648
What I don't understand
is what you being gay

389
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,109
has to do with you always needing money.

390
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,195
Well, it's just that…

391
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,947
Yeah, it's a…

392
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,491
What?

393
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,493
I like

394
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,537
Nicolás Patiño.

395
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,249
That's Juana Muriel's boyfriend.

396
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,334
Yes, him.

397
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,627
And

398
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,379
I've been hanging out with them,

399
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,590
like you told me. And

400
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:13,220
I've had to keep up with them.
That's why I've needed so much money.

401
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,764
And what does that boy think?

402
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,016
Does he like you or what?

403
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:22,103
-He's fucking crazy for me.
-Don't talk like that, Toño.

404
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,607
He burns for me.

405
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,734
And is Juanita aware of this?

406
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,361
No.

407
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,030
Nothing is easy with you, son.

408
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:36,368
Anyway, I thank you for telling me,

409
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,245
for trusting me.

410
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,997
Because now
you've told me everything, right?

411
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,751
-Everything?
-Yes.

412
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,839
Come here, my baby boy.

413
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,304
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

414
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,305
What's up?

415
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,559
I understand you don't want to help me,
but making my little girl cry?

416
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,144
Confiscating her chocolate
on her birthday?

417
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:07,691
Banning chocolate
is like censoring song lyrics,

418
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,859
like burning books. No, it's even worse.

419
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,988
You're an accomplice to the whims
of Tamara and the consul.

420
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,156
You wanna cancel me?
I thought we were friends!

421
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,908
That's enough, Olmo!

422
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,953
-I'm doing my job.
-Well, you could've stopped her.

423
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,246
I couldn't!

424
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,748
I'm just a teacher!

425
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,166
Listen to me.

426
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,586
If we wait,

427
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,255
the moment will come.

428
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,090
And then,

429
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,634
we'll see the consuls defeated.

430
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,139
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must teach the two times table.

431
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,561
So what's new, Chente?

432
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,438
Am I a Spanish citizen now?

433
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,565
Well, right.

434
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:52,027
Frankly, I haven't made much progress
in that matter.

435
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,697
What I'm thinking now is
I should pack my bags and leave.

436
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,492
That teacher won't stop fucking with us.

437
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,623
So you're having trouble with a teacher?

438
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,959
It turns out
she's conspiring with Olmo Muriel.

439
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,670
And they're making our lives miserable.

440
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,882
And Tamara's changed so much.
I suspect things.

441
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:14,966
Oh, my friend.

442
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,511
There's something you should know.

443
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,807
There is information

444
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,435
that you don't know and that I think…

445
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,064
you should know.

446
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,025
-About Olmo and Tamara.
-Thanks.

447
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,654
Is she cheating on me?

448
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:39,824
Look, I don't want to gossip
about Guadalajara's society,

449
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,786
but they used to be sweethearts.

450
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,747
The thing is…

451
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,167
they were once engaged.

452
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,086
Hold on.

453
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,629
What?

454
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,715
What are you saying?

455
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,093
They were gonna get married?

456
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,012
He called off the wedding
days before because

457
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,640
he got another woman pregnant.

458
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,644
It was the talk of the town.

459
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,897
These things hurt.

460
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,942
They take time to heal. And maybe

461
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:19,197
that's why your wife
has been behaving strangely.

462
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,372
But, man,

463
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,499
Tamara must be happy with you.

464
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,128
She hit the jackpot marrying a Spaniard,
for fuck's sake.

465
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,505
Yeah, it's just that I…

466
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,174
I'm a very good accessory.

467
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,177
Look, here's what we're gonna do.

468
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:45,014
You'll get my Spanish citizenship,

469
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:49,310
and that phone company
sets up shop in this country.

470
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,148
And as for this teacher,

471
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,734
don't worry about that.
I'll take care of her.

472
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,528
-You?
-Yes, I'll take care of her.

473
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,548
The police!

474
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:19,883
Dora López?

475
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,301
I'm innocent!

476
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,678
I left the party early.

477
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,681
The governor is calling you.

478
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:28,975
The governor?

479
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,019
Hello?

480
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,437
How are you? Good morning.

481
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,064
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

482
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,733
This is your governor.

483
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,694
My governor? Of what state?

484
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,363
Well, which one could it be?

485
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,534
Listen, I'd like to talk to you tonight.

486
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,204
I'll send you the location and time.

487
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:51,873
But--

488
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:53,875
He hung up.

489
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,627
If you'll excuse me.

490
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,593
What could the governor want
with a woman like me?

491
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,637
Am I going to be fired?

492
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:09,098
If that's what he wants,
they would've fired you already.

493
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,810
Well, you've put my mind at ease, Olmo.

494
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,646
You must be prepared for that meeting.

495
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,105
Prepared how?

496
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,650
My father, may he rest in peace,

497
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,319
used to say that a problem

498
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,197
is an opportunity in disguise.

499
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,660
This is your chance
to win over the governor for your cause.

500
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,578
You think so?

501
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,581
What I could do is defend myself

502
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,960
in case of any false accusations
from the consuls, right?

503
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,169
Or from Miss Josefina.

504
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:39,712
Exactly.

505
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,841
With his support,
I'd be the new Andes headmistress.

506
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,300
That's the idea.

507
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,136
Though you can't go
dressed like that to the meeting.

508
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,472
I'll take you shopping this afternoon.

509
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,808
-Bye.
-Okay.

510
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,937
Miss Josefina,
did something happen to Vicentín?

511
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,397
Not at all.

512
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,232
Please have a seat.

513
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,819
I've seen, surprisingly,

514
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:07,991
that you're supporting Miss Vero's
candidacy as the new headmistress.

515
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:12,078
Yes. Well, someone
has to replace Miss Paula,

516
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:16,291
and Miss Vero
is a very experienced teacher

517
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,084
who the children love very much.

518
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,503
She's fit, isn't she?

519
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,089
But Miss Vero
can't even handle her own life.

520
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,341
How is she going to run a school?

521
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:29,053
We have her here, yes,
but as a substitute.

522
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,638
Just to be charitable.

523
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,182
Because of her problem.

524
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,561
Okay. No, I didn't know.

525
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,063
Anyway…

526
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,484
Well, someone has to compete
against Miss Dora.

527
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,861
Or not.

528
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:48,740
Miss Paula was the only one
who could keep up with me.

529
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,450
But without her,

530
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:54,078
I'll be forced to continue
in the headmistress position.

531
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,080
A reelection.

532
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,833
I think that suits us both. Don't you?

533
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,962
Because it moves Miss Dora
away from the position.

534
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,925
So no elections will be held?

535
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,677
Let's say

536
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,139
elections with a single candidate
would be undemocratic.

537
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:17,435
And who better
to continue in the headmistress position

538
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,521
than someone who's been headmistress
for 20 years?

539
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:25,610
I'll talk to all the moms
and convince them.

540
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,237
You read my mind, Tamara.

541
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,950
I knew you and I
would understand each other.

542
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,286
Thanks.

543
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,621
Excuse me.

544
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,002
You're going on a date.

545
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,713
And with the governor!

546
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,802
-It's not a date date.
-Isn't it?

547
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:54,347
I mean, it's a professional meeting.

548
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:58,685
How long has it been
since you've been alone with a male human?

549
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,186
How long? Tell me.

550
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,355
See?

551
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,815
I'm telling you, Dora,

552
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:08,194
your love life is a wasteland, a desert.
Not even cactuses grow there anymore.

553
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,822
Stop, Martha Sánchez. I get it.

554
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,951
Now, the governor is somewhat…

555
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,997
interesting.

556
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,959
Because he's not young or handsome.

557
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,711
But he's rich and powerful.

558
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,337
Enough, Martha Sánchez.

559
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,425
I have a lot of work to do.
You're so annoying. Get to work!

560
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,634
Don't be nervous.

561
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,302
Go to your place, please.

562
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,971
But tell me about it, huh?

563
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,441
Not that one. It's for a wedding. No.

564
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,781
What a difference! Listen to me, Dora!

565
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,332
-Hello.
-Hi.

566
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,128
Hey, we could meet somewhere else, right?

567
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:11,674
We could meet in the dark rooms downtown.

568
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,846
Or in the saunas
that are across the avenue.

569
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,481
-What?
-Your face just then.

570
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,444
-I told her I had--
-No. It's not Juana.

571
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,613
Then who is it?

572
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,491
You know what?

573
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,534
I think…

574
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,579
I think I have to go home.

575
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,456
Why? What happened?

576
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,167
It's my dad.

577
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,628
He's been calling me for days.

578
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,089
He needs money.

579
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,256
Money?

580
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,092
You should've told me.

581
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,803
Of course not, Nico.
You already lent to me once. Besides…

582
00:34:56,886 --> 00:35:01,307
No. I don't want to get you involved
in my dad's affairs.

583
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,184
Why not?

584
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,353
He's a mess, that's why.

585
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,025
He bets and loses.

586
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,527
He bets again,

587
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,530
thinking that this time
he's going to make it and he's gonna win.

588
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,533
He's so convinced
that he ends up convincing me too.

589
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,243
And stupid me,

590
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,871
I get money either from my mom or…

591
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:26,874
from you.

592
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:31,087
TIME TRAVEL:
SCIENTISTS CLAIM TO HAVE FOUND THE KEY

593
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,427
Toño, your dad is using you.

594
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,263
Yeah, I know, but

595
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,223
he's my dad.

596
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,601
What do I do?

597
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,565
JOSEFINA BARRIOS

I'm Dora López Negrete.

601
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,721
What?

602
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,347
It's a pleasure.

603
