1
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,966
It comes from the Greek ethos,

2
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:54,679
which means moral character.

3
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:01,269
Ethics is related to beliefs

4
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,355
about what is right or wrong

5
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,108
in people's behavior.

6
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,528
That is, rules or norms

7
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:14,491
that guide a human being's actions,

8
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:18,119
changing the spiritual,

9
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,164
rational, and sexual faculties.

10
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,460
The adjective "ethical" is used

11
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,505
to refer to someone who is honest

12
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,509
and follows good moral standards.

13
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,594
SNAKES AND LADDERS

14
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,946
PREFECT

15
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,664
Good morning.

16
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,791
-Good morning.
-Are you coming for lunch?

17
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,753
-See you later.
-Good luck.

18
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,092
Good morning, Laura, baby.

19
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,469
MONDAY

20
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,519
I deserve to be headmistress.

21
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:32,068
LA SANTA DINER

22
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,629
…life

23
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:56,843
Good morning, Mister Sun

24
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:04,267
I'll keep trying to be better
I'll keep trying to be better

25
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,689
Good morning!

26
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,362
-See?
-Welcome.

27
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,906
-Good morning.
-Ready?

28
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,116
Remember, we have an election
in five weeks

29
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,993
to appoint a new headmistress.

30
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,245
Miss Paula would like you
to look at her résumé

31
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,289
so you have a little more information.

32
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,542
-Okay, thanks.
-See you. Have a good day.

33
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,757
This is a shocker.

34
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,926
She asked me to help her. I had no choice.

35
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,261
Refuse. Tell her you're with me.

36
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,015
Poor Miss Paula.
At her age, it's probably her last wish.

37
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,352
-To be a headmistress?
-No, for me to help her hand out flyers.

38
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,896
-You have nothing to worry about.
-Here's what I think.

39
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:50,897
Dora.

40
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,149
-They're looking for you.
-Who?

41
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,526
Miss Josefina.
She's waiting for you in her office.

42
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:57,987
Can I ask you a favor?

43
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,906
Could you put this on my desk?

44
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,324
-Okay.
-Thank you.

45
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,421
Rest assured,

46
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,173
at our institution,

47
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,593
the children's safety is paramount.

48
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,595
Come in.

49
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,722
Come in, Dora.

50
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,225
This is Dora López, our prefect,

51
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,228
in charge of our young students' behavior.

52
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,229
-Good morning.
-Hi.

53
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,107
She was present
at the time of the incident.

54
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,860
They're the parents of our new student

55
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,697
who just arrived from the motherland,
Vicente García.

56
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,866
Mrs. Tamara Sahagún.

57
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,494
Her husband, the Spanish consul,

58
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,871
His Excellency, Mr. Vicente García.

59
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,291
I'm only Vicentín's father here.

60
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,253
Thanks, but to be honest,
I want to take this opportunity

61
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,506
to reiterate what an honor it is for us

62
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,509
that you have chosen
Andes San Javier School.

63
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,885
The honor is ours.

64
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,554
Hello.

65
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,723
Sorry, the traffic was terrible.

66
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,851
Come in, Mr. Muriel. Please, sit down.

67
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:10,852
Miss.

68
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,316
Morning.

69
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,571
Okay, now…

70
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,157
Can we get started?

71
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,368
Because all of us here have a lot to do.

72
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:31,080
Well, it turns out that yesterday,
when Vicentín got home,

73
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,915
he told us that Chotita--

74
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:33,875
Chotita?

75
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,585
-You mean my daughter?
-Yes.

76
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,586
It's Choquita.

77
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,714
That's how we are known
in Guadalajara, as the Chocos.

78
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,591
I produce chocolate.

79
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,633
Okay.

80
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,845
Choquita and Vicentín had an altercation.

81
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:46,846
And…

82
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,434
It hurts even talking about it.

83
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,478
It's okay, ma'am. Take your time.

84
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,480
We are in an environment of trust.

85
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,231
Choquita

86
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,442
crushed one of his nuts.

87
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,360
A testicle.

88
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,321
-Our son's.
-Hold on, what are you saying?

89
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,074
That my son was sexually assaulted.

90
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,202
-They're just kids playing. My God!
-No.

91
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,996
-Let's leave God out of this, please.
-Sure.

92
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,539
My little girl told me

93
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,501
that she got in a fight at recess
with her new best friend.

94
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,960
That's all.

95
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,923
She's six years old.
She doesn't even know how she'd do that.

96
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:25,385
We want whoever is responsible
to be punished.

97
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,261
-My daughter?
-Well…

98
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,807
You're saying
that she has the knowledge to think--

99
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,142
Careful, I'm not assuming anything.

100
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,354
-Your "well" indicates otherwise.
-That's what we're here for.

101
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,022
-Isn't it? Mister…
-Olmo.

102
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,232
-Olmo.
-Olmo Muriel!

103
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,317
-Very well.
-Or Mister Choco, as you wish.

104
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,654
-Please, gentlemen, calm down.
-Excuse me.

105
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,700
I understand that this situation
is quite delicate, right?

106
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,161
And I was there yesterday, present.

107
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,996
And, to be honest,

108
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,626
well, I can't affirm
that the girl did that.

109
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:02,338
Nor can I deny the boy's claim.

110
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,509
Because, honestly,
this type of altercation

111
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,720
is actually quite common among students.

112
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,639
-Savage Mexicans.
-Vicente.

113
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,018
I have a question.
What's the prefect here for?

114
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,523
Well, to do things ethically, ma'am.

115
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,610
It's important to me
that you are convinced

116
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,447
that this situation
will be resolved no matter what.

117
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,366
Violence goes against
this school's principles.

118
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,120
In fact, we have protocols
specially designed

119
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,539
to prevent it or deal with it.

120
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,582
What protocols?

121
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,126
Basically, the anti-sadness protocol

122
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,836
that I designed myself.

123
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,672
No boy or girl

124
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,633
shall experience sadness or suffering,

125
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,594
much less violence,

126
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,847
while on this school's premises.

127
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,307
In this school,

128
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,185
no testicle can be crushed

129
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,895
without consequences.

130
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:05,526
So I ask you to please
go home with your children and calm down.

131
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,613
I'll listen to what the prefect
has to say,

132
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:12,533
and I assure you, I'll find a resolution.

133
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,659
Punishment.

134
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,662
This is all so absurd.

135
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,706
Please, calm down.

136
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,167
How about we continue tomorrow?

137
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,377
We can meet first thing in the morning.

138
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,670
We'll be here.

139
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,256
-If we may.
-Of course.

140
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,050
Go ahead.

141
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,468
Prefect Dora.

142
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,053
Sit down.

143
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,600
Will you explain

144
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,852
the meaning of all this?

145
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,022
You and I both know
that elections for the new headmistress

146
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,732
are just around the corner.

147
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:45,942
Yes, in five weeks.

148
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,945
That's why I'm surprised
you're making such wrong decisions.

149
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,739
-You must be a good politician.
-Yes.

150
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:55,076
The new headmistress
will be chosen by the parents, right?

151
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,078
And you're going against

152
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,956
the most influential couple
in this school.

153
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,416
Well, I can't say for sure

154
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,710
that the girl actually did that.

155
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,213
-And it would be wrong to say so.
-No.

156
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,840
Your pretenses of grandeur,

157
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,803
justice, and superiority
will get you nowhere.

158
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,139
So tomorrow,
I want you to bring me a report

159
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,227
showing a firm position
that will reassure the consul.

160
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,271
And his lovely wife.

161
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,481
The consul and his wife.

162
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,732
Lovely.

163
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,069
Choco-choco, la-la…

164
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,779
Vicentín, we're leaving.

165
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,073
-Bye, Choquita.
-Bye, Vicentín.

166
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,866
Enough. Thank you. Let her go.

167
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,080
You must stop hanging out
with that girl after what she did to you.

168
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,790
What? Crush my nut?

169
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,834
Don't say "nut." Damn it.

170
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,169
I can't believe how they assume victory.

171
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,381
Hasn't anyone told them this isn't 1492?

172
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,342
I won't let any man
point his finger at you.

173
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,094
You're not seeing her anymore.

174
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,679
Are we going back to Spain?

175
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,389
No, of course not.

176
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,391
They're kicking her out of school.

177
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,394
Why? She's my best friend in Mexico!
What did she do?

178
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,479
She can't be your best friend in Mexico.

179
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,814
You'll find another one.

180
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,898
No crying.

181
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,692
Be a man.

182
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,901
A good Spaniard man.

183
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,154
But Vicentín is a boy, not a man.

184
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,365
Least of all Vicentín-Consul-Firecracker.

185
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,118
-I hit her too! And I crushed her!
-No.

186
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,286
No.

187
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,246
You defended yourself. Okay?

188
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,334
This is the reconquest. And we'll win it.

189
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,628
-Yes, Daddy!
-That's it.

190
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,422
Let's go. Come on.

191
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,383
-Hello.
-Hi.

192
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,223
-I'll be right back.
-Yes, sir.

193
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,143
Tamara.

194
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,437
Tamara!

195
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,272
I don't think that's wise.

196
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,443
I didn't know you had come back.

197
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,945
How long has it been?

198
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,741
Nineteen years, Olmo.

199
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,410
Believe me, if I'm here,
it's because I have no choice.

200
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,121
Is something wrong with you?
With your dad?

201
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,791
No, we're all very good.

202
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,294
It's Vicente, my husband.
He's been named consul of Spain.

203
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,172
And you being so fond of titles.

204
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,676
We'd better keep our distance.

205
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,760
Not with the children.

206
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,762
That's all I ask of you.

207
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,972
They don't have to pay for our issues.

208
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,683
Hashtag not with the kids.

209
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,602
What are you talking about?
I just want justice to be done.

210
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,188
Why are you talking like that? Ridiculous.

211
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,023
Let's go.

212
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,861
Listen to the headmistress, my friend.

213
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,656
You don't want her as an enemy
weeks before the elections.

214
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,409
Besides, the consul
is obviously a strong-willed,

215
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,036
violent, powerful man.

216
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,706
-Just another conquistador.
-Oh, Martha.

217
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,416
Of course not.

218
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,543
And what nobody sees is that Olmo

219
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,545
is the most popular dad in school.

220
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,171
No matter what anyone says.

221
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,214
Everyone loves him.

222
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,884
And without his support, without his vote,

223
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,803
I'm lost, Martha.

224
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,889
-Just look at her!
-Let's see.

225
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,391
She doesn't waste time.

226
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,232
Well, Miss Paula is loved by everyone.
It's looking rough.

227
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,401
What else do you see?

228
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,862
Well…

229
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,823
That's all for now,
but we'd have to read the cards.

230
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,658
Do you have time this afternoon?

231
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,538
Listen, Martha, don't start.

232
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,290
I don't even understand you.

233
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,791
Besides, it's my future.

234
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,334
Well, yours too, huh?

235
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,128
Our future.

236
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,756
Because when
I'm this school's headmistress,

237
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,716
you'll be in a better place.

238
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,635
Okay, 6:30 at your house.

239
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,821
Jesus, give me patience!

240
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,166
What are you doing here?

241
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,213
I needed to talk to you.

242
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,423
That's what phones are for.

243
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,425
Or what? You ran out of credit?

244
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,594
No, I'm not out of credit.

245
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,888
But it had to be in person.

246
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,640
Toño is in a bad place.

247
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,391
How so?

248
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,185
Well, I don't know if he's told you,

249
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,896
but he's been betting
and owes a lot of money.

250
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,441
Oh please, that kid
doesn't even play hide-and-seek, man.

251
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,194
Maybe you don't know our son very well.

252
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,154
You don't say.

253
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:46,158
Because the one who gave birth to him,
who nursed him,

254
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:51,080
who took care of him, who raised him,
who educated him, single-handedly, was me.

255
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:55,084
But now it turns out that the one
who knows him very well is you. Sure.

256
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,878
Well, the people following him called me.

257
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,172
-Really? And who's following him?
-The Mafia.

258
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,257
The Mafia?

259
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,678
What is this, The Godfather? Come on!

260
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,514
If anything happens to Toño,
it'll be your fault.

261
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,934
-I'll never forgive you. Bad mother!
-You're gonna start with that?

262
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,228
Tell me, are you gonna start?

263
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:18,399
Because I don't see any fucking trophy
for best dad in the world.

264
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,610
The only trophy you've earned is that one.

265
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,987
First place.

266
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,907
Yeah, first place at bowling
with the money you took out of my drawers.

267
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,119
And you know what?
You can take your fucking first place

268
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,621
if you don't want me
to smash it on your head!

269
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,126
Speak of the devil.

270
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,753
What are you doing here?
I'd meet you at your house.

271
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,423
I had to come talk to your mom, Toño.

272
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,425
I don't have any money.

273
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,635
I'm afraid
something might happen to you, son.

274
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,721
And I do? I do have money?

275
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,556
Where? Because I can't see it.

276
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,849
Mom, I'm going to work,

277
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:56,478
and I'm going to pay you back every penny,
but I need to borrow a little money.

278
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,396
Listen, Toño.

279
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,523
I've raised a man

280
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,901
on ethics and morality,

281
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,069
on responsibility and civility.

282
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,989
And now you tell me
that you've taken up gambling

283
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,991
and that the Mafia is after you?

284
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,212
I think I have a visitor.

285
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,297
You think you do?

286
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:24,882
Yes.

287
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,385
And you're both leaving right now.
You'll go to your house

288
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,305
and solve your little problem.

289
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,223
-Fuck! Who's here?
-Got it?

290
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,892
What do you care?

291
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,936
Busybody!

292
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,270
Listen to me.

293
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,898
The three of us are going outside.

294
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,610
But we're going outside smiling.

295
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:48,238
Because it's important
that we look like an exemplary family.

296
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,949
Smiling.

297
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,035
Teeth.

298
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,789
Have a great day.

299
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,335
Bye. Don't fuck with me, Antonio.

300
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,004
-See you, Mom.
-Take care, son. Bye.

301
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,633
-Nice day, isn't it, Dad?
-Wonderful.

302
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,595
Miss Nora.

303
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:12,930
Hop in.

304
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,099
There's something I wanna tell you.

305
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,728
My name is Dora.

306
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,021
And I'm not a teacher.

307
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,024
I'm a prefect. Here's my badge.

308
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,275
Get going, Lopitos.

309
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,360
-Yes, sir.
-No!

310
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,112
I can't go for a ride.

311
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:31,281
It isn't right
that we're having this conversation

312
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,408
outside of school.

313
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,409
Relax.

314
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,036
-Teacher, it's okay.
-Yes.

315
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,040
I wanted to express my concern
about what happened at school today.

316
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,626
-It's a complete exaggeration.
-I know.

317
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:48,215
I'm very concerned that my daughter
will be branded a sex offender.

318
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,425
She's not.

319
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:54,179
In my house, no one touches anyone's body
unless it's consensual.

320
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,682
Well,

321
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,727
frankly, I shouldn't tell you this.

322
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,437
But

323
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,107
I agree that everything is out of control.

324
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,152
But, as you know, it's up to me

325
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,320
to provide a resolution

326
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,823
on behalf of the school tomorrow.

327
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,033
A punishment?

328
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,202
-Probably.
-You're gonna testify against Choquita?

329
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,371
I'm sorry.

330
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,165
Forgive me, miss.

331
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,626
There's something you need to know.

332
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,544
Tell me.

333
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,880
You're dealing with an ancient fight.

334
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,798
Vicentín's mother and I

335
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,635
were going to get married
when we were young.

336
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,928
-No way!
-Yes.

337
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:40,601
But I accidentally got
my eldest daughter's mother pregnant,

338
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,102
and I'm not one to bail.

339
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,980
No, I follow through.
So what we had went down the drain.

340
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,440
Now you understand?

341
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,109
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Muriel,

342
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:54,990
an accident is when you trip over a rock
or something like that,

343
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,785
not when you get someone pregnant.

344
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,661
I mean, really.

345
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,164
As I was saying,

346
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,416
they sent her to live in Spain,

347
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,543
and I never heard from her again.

348
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,712
So she is using this fight

349
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,758
to show me how things are going to be
now that she's back.

350
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,761
They're manipulating you.
It's all to see whose is bigger.

351
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,014
Mr. Muriel,
there's no need to use those examples.

352
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,599
Show some respect, please.

353
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,601
I appreciate you stopping by,

354
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,520
but I'll have to ask you to leave.

355
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,688
No, thanks for listening.

356
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,274
-Don't mention it.
-I'll leave you my card.

357
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,485
It has my cell phone number.

358
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,903
You can call me

359
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,281
if there's any wish
you want me to fulfill.

360
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,950
And believe me,

361
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,285
I can do anything.

362
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,041
I only ask you

363
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,710
to think about my poor daughter.

364
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,631
It's just that
I can't accept anything from you.

365
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,592
It's unethical.

366
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:57,886
Get it?

367
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,346
No.

368
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,517
-Anyway, it's been a pleasure.
-Have a nice day, miss.

369
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,645
-Can I ask you something?
-Of course.

370
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,230
How did you know where I live?

371
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,315
I know everything.

372
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,992
THE TOWER

373
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,875
ACE OF CUPS

374
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,630
THE SUN

375
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,382
Well, no.

376
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,926
I don't see anything.

377
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,512
Five weeks until the elections,
and I don't see a thing.

378
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,306
Take a good look, Martha.

379
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,350
Well, no, it's not lined up
for you to be headmistress.

380
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,604
Listen, Martha Sánchez,
a week ago, it was aligned.

381
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,105
So what's going on?

382
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,191
Is it because of the kids' quarrel?

383
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,317
I'm sure it is.

384
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,361
That's why the mummy
let me decide what will happen with that.

385
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,030
-To harm me.
-Yes.

386
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,031
That's it.

387
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,202
-Look, the star says it all.
-What?

388
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,830
That you're not gonna be headmistress.
It's not to be, not today.

389
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,666
But how can a star
mean something negative?

390
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,628
A star is also a black hole.

391
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,131
In other words, if you rule
in favor of one family,

392
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,009
the other one
will come down on you, and vice versa.

393
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,803
You need the support of both families.
Oh, my friend!

394
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,224
Your career as headmistress is over.

395
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,893
Then who'll be
Andes School's headmistress?

396
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,270
-Miss Paula?
-Beats me.

397
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,231
I'd have to read the cards to know.

398
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,982
-Then that's it.
-No.

399
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,861
-What do you want?
-Hi. Hello, Martha Sánchez.

400
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,364
-Hi, Antonio. How are you?
-No, not Antonio.

401
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,282
We call him Toño here.

402
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,785
-Toño. How are you?
-Fine.

403
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,536
Listen, I'm sorry, Martha Sánchez.

404
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,916
I'd appreciate it if you left
because I have to talk to Toño.

405
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,293
-I'm sorry.
-Weren't you gonna invite me to dinner?

406
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,045
What can I say? You know how it is.

407
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,256
All right, then.

408
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:01,301
-Hey, but what about the money?
-I'll pay you tomorrow at school.

409
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,680
-All right. See you, Toño.
-See you, Martha Sánchez.

410
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,682
-Thanks, friend.
-See you tomorrow.

411
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,641
Yes.

412
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,602
-My goodness!
-Mom, have you thought about it?

413
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,688
-I'm always thinking, Toño.
-About the money.

414
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,314
Again with that?

415
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,692
You didn't work it out with your dad?

416
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,027
-No.
-Look, Toño.

417
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,821
I'm tired

418
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,907
of trying to make you
a respectable person.

419
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,367
I won't talk about it anymore.

420
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,996
-Then what did you want to talk about?
-Me? Nothing.

421
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,914
That's what you told Martha Sánchez.

422
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,542
She wouldn't leave otherwise, Toño.

423
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,793
I'm in danger, Mom.

424
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,253
You don't say.

425
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,088
Me too, Toño.

426
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:42,968
It's time you take responsibility
for your own problems.

427
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,303
I've had it with you!

428
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,485
I have to be a good politician.

429
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,866
As was discussed yesterday,

430
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,995
this conflict is in a gray area.

431
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,122
Therefore,

432
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,375
I have taken on the task of analyzing

433
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,628
both students' behavior

434
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,674
in order to decide.

435
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:27,012
And both Vicente García and Mariana Muriel

436
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,764
are two of our students

437
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,725
who have always shown
good moral standards.

438
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,853
Therefore, I believe we have succumbed

439
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,147
to exaggerating the matter.

440
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,940
Exaggerating?

441
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,443
Yes, exactly.

442
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,071
I mean, inflating our positions.

443
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,406
And as prefect of conduct,

444
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,368
I can't allow it, can I?

445
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,287
Or even consider an expulsion.

446
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,290
I can't allow a girl to be singled out

447
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,376
for a minor quarrel

448
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,544
where, if she did commit the deed,

449
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,589
she must have done so
with no malice or ill intent.

450
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,673
-Yes, that.
-"Minor"?

451
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,134
I can't believe it.

452
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,469
No, if you'll allow me.

453
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,929
In this school,

454
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:13,642
one of our commitments
is for it to be a safe place for everyone.

455
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:19,022
So Vicentín can move
to Miss Vero's classroom

456
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,565
for your peace of mind.

457
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,027
What I understand from this

458
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,781
is that what you are suggesting

459
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,324
is that my son,

460
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,785
in addition to having been assaulted,

461
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,995
should be the one who changes classrooms.

462
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,500
No, I mean,
that's just one possible solution.

463
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,626
No.

464
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,504
Vicentín loves Miss Paula.

465
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,048
Yes. It's just a suggestion, you know?

466
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,135
Because what I perceive
is that the kids have forgotten about it.

467
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,804
-They're good friends--
-Let's keep the kids out of this.

468
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,849
So this isn't about them?

469
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,644
Vicente, let's go.

470
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,813
But ma'am…

471
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,482
This will reach the king's ears.

472
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,652
But…

473
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,736
Good morning.

474
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,948
If you'll excuse me.

475
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,408
Go ahead.

476
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,535
Dora!

477
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,245
What have you done?

478
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:17,956
The right thing.

479
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,542
Sit down.

480
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,710
There you go.

481
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,045
-Hi, Choquita.
-Hi, Lopitos.

482
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,548
-Park up ahead. I'll be right back.
-Of course, sir.

483
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,633
Did you bring me any snacks?

484
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,303
Why did you do it?

485
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,055
-See you tomorrow.
-Another one.

486
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,600
Because it was the right thing to do.

487
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,895
You could've called me,
and you'd have profited from this.

488
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,190
Well, not all desires
can be bought with money, can they?

489
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,983
-Of course they can!
-No.

490
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,276
What do you mean?

491
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,738
Well, look, let me explain.

492
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,700
My dream is to be
this school's headmistress, okay?

493
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,910
So what do I do?

494
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,453
Well, I focus.

495
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,247
In other words,
I focus so things work out well for me,

496
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,043
and I thus earn your trust
and the trust of the parents.

497
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,961
Well, you have mine.

498
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,631
-Thank you.
-And I'm very popular with the moms.

499
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,759
Not to brag, but I'm good-looking, rich,

500
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,012
a widower, both a father and a mother.
What more could you want?

501
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:14,971
I know.

502
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,807
Listen, miss. Forgive the audacity.

503
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,519
I'm celebrating my birthday tonight
at my house.

504
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,812
Many parents are coming.

505
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,482
You could come and campaign.

506
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,192
It'll bring you closer to them.

507
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,736
That's unthinkable, Mr. Muriel.

508
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:32,322
I mean, I really appreciate it.

509
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:35,075
But that would be against the rules.

510
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,118
We'll keep it a secret.

511
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,038
We'll handle it
more as a personal interest

512
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,916
for our children to have
the best possible headmistress.

513
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,334
Think about it.

514
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,920
The address is on the card
I gave you yesterday.

515
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,672
I know you kept it.

516
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,257
Goodbye.

517
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,800
See you, miss.

518
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,887
-Bye, miss.
-Bye, see you tomorrow.

519
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,557
Spare me, Jesus.

520
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,350
"Chocolmo."

521
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,018
OLMO MURIEL

00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,275
DORA LÓPEZ
PROFESSIONAL OBJECTIVE

523
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:15,365
LA SANTA DINER

524
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,497
Mom, are you going out?

525
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,458
No, this is what I wear to get the milk.

526
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,752
Since you never go out.

527
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,213
Well, since you never gamble.

528
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,174
Well, I tried to get money,
and nobody lent me any.

529
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,468
You don't say, Toño.

530
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,845
Well, what a shame,

531
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,014
because I don't have that kind of money.

532
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,515
What about your savings?

533
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,267
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

534
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,685
-Say it again.
-Never mind.

535
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:44,686
Listen, Toño.

536
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,856
I've worked my ass off
to make you a respectable person.

537
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,649
-This is all on you.
-Yeah.

538
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,361
And stop scrounging off Mrs. Tota.

539
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,323
-I left you some food in the fridge.
-Yeah.

540
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,574
-Move it!
-Okay, fine.

541
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,783
Get inside!

542
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,701
-Pepe.
-Yes?

543
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,369
-Put my quesadilla on my tab.
-Yes.

544
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,495
Lazy asshole!

545
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:11,546
A social climber
who thinks money can buy manners. Please!

546
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,007
Since he was a kid,
he's always been a commoner,

547
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,968
a mobster,
the worst of Guadalajara society.

548
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,511
I didn't know you knew him.

549
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,056
We all know each other in Guadalajara.

550
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:25,101
We've always hung out with the same crowd.
We marry each other.

551
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,729
I mean, not like in San Pedro,
but among friends.

552
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,357
So he is your friend.

553
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,360
Vicente, did it seem like
he was my friend?

554
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,486
Of course not.

555
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:39,949
I mean, he's an acquaintance
of some friends. But not too close.

556
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,577
And you want my son
to grow up in this environment?

557
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,622
This environment is
the country's cream of the crop.

558
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,123
Here, help me.

559
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,795
-We were better off in Spain.
-No.

560
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,756
Without chauffeurs, without maids,
and without Cleo?

561
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,635
No. I can't take it anymore, Vicente.
I already told you.

562
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,929
You'll get used to it.
It's just a matter of time.

563
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,681
Get used to corruption?

564
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:07,060
Corruption that we inherited from you,
I mean, from thee.

565
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,021
Vicente.

566
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,358
I have a great idea.

567
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:19,072
At dinner, we could tell the governor
what's going on at school with Vicentín.

568
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:22,575
I'm sure the governor
has much more important things to do.

569
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,370
Wow! More important than your family?

570
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,581
Tamara, it's not an option.
I won't fall for provocation.

571
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,711
Well, I mean,

572
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:39,175
I was just saying because it's something
all my friends' husbands would do.

573
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,468
All of them.

574
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,722
Even that asshole,

575
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:47,142
that stupid idiot Olmo,
that dumbass, would do it.

576
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,269
Again with that Olmo guy!

577
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,895
Turn the page already.

578
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:20,967
Prefect.

579
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,970
It's me, Nicolás Patiño.

580
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,096
Remember me?

581
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,308
-From…
-I was your student.

582
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,226
At Andes, in San Javier Hills.

583
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,813
Nicolás!

584
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,275
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

585
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,277
It's good to see you.

586
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,446
Good to see you too.

587
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,365
I didn't introduce you.
This is Juana Muriel, my girlfriend.

588
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:45,950
Muriel?

589
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,077
-You must be--
-The eldest Choco.

590
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,496
Olmo's daughter.

591
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,414
-The birthday boy.
-Yes.

592
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,957
Are you here for the party?

593
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,836
-Yes.
-Then welcome.

594
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,048
Aren't you staying?

595
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,091
-No.
-No. You know what?

596
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,385
My dad prefers
we let him have the night off.

597
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,639
-Yes.
-It's just that I don't know anyone.

598
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,599
Well, I know Nico.

599
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,727
Do you remember my son?

600
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,356
-You have a son?
-Yes, Toño.

601
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,943
You sometimes played with him
outside of school.

602
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,197
You don't remember.

603
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,200
Well, it will be a pleasure
to meet him again someday.

604
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,701
I hope so.

605
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,204
Well…

606
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,497
Have fun.

607
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,332
Don't go.

608
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,920
-Wait.
-Ma'am.

609
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,797
Are you here for the party?

610
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,175
-Yes, I am.
-I'll walk you in.

611
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,639
What happened?

612
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,809
It's not a costume party, teacher.

613
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,894
Sir.

614
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:38,980
Here.

615
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,523
This…

616
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:45,820
Mr. Muriel, I don't think
it's very difficult to remember, is it?

617
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,864
That I'm a prefect.

618
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,407
What's the difference?

619
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,785
That I've gone through that.
I've already been a teacher.

620
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,745
But

621
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,122
my big dream

622
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,416
is to be a headmistress.

623
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,336
Well, that's why you're here tonight,

624
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,046
Miss Prefect.

625
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,340
I've got it under control.

626
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,674
-You do?
-Follow me.

627
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:17,226
I've told many of you
who have children at Andes School

628
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,772
about my special guest.

629
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,566
-She's…
-Prefect.

630
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,068
Prefect Dora.

631
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,278
-López.
-Dora López.

632
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:31,407
Whom I ask you to take
the opportunity to meet,

633
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,619
keeping in mind
we're making a very important decision

634
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:38,998
in the upcoming elections
for school headmistress.

635
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,793
Let's say no more. Let the party continue.

636
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,002
-Cheers!
-Thank you.

637
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,295
Welcome.

638
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,134
How are you? Come.

639
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,058
DORA LÓPEZ
PROFESSIONAL OBJECTIVE

640
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,360
Let me give you one of these.

641
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:13,116
I'm sure you heard a while ago
when Mr. Muriel introduced me to everyone.

642
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:17,954
And here you have my information,
my academic experience--

643
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,205
Give us a minute.

644
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,585
What are these shitty printouts, prefect?

645
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,296
It's information.

646
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,507
So they can

647
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,718
get to know me, know who I am.

648
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:35,138
Nobody's going to read it.
That's not how things work.

649
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,139
Listen, teach…

650
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:37,849
Dora.

651
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,809
You have tonight

652
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,310
to empathize.

653
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,813
To tell them what they want to hear.

654
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,482
Don't bother them or confuse them

655
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,318
with these shitty papers
that clash with my decor.

656
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,611
No.

657
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,864
Seize the opportunity.

658
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,449
You're in the big leagues now.

659
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,659
Bernie.

660
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,620
Have fun, prefect.

661
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,706
Let's keep going, Bernie.

662
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,256
Are you sure, baby?

663
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,341
Yes.

664
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,970
This is just what we planned.
Everyone's at Daddy's party.

665
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,306
This is safer than usual.

666
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,059
I thought it was the adrenaline you liked.

667
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,227
What I like is you.

668
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,542
Ready?

669
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,555
Nico, come here.

670
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,975
They're hot, aren't they?

671
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,941
Amazing.

672
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,818
I know.

673
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,518
Hello.

674
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,777
Ma'am, can I help you?

675
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,987
Yes.

676
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,615
Excuse me, do you know
where I can find Mr. Muriel?

677
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,533
Yes.

678
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,994
In his office. He's with some guests.

679
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,998
And would it be possible to say goodbye?

680
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,040
Sure.

681
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,125
This way, please.

682
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,209
Thank you.

683
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,756
-Which way now?
-To the left.

684
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,181
The door on the right, ma'am.

685
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,775
-This one too.
-Dora!

686
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,069
Come on in!

687
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,450
Our friends here are on their way
back to the party. Off you go.

688
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,827
-Off you go.
-Yes, sir, thank you.

689
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,497
Dora.

690
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,458
Sit down.

691
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,880
Tell me.

692
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,298
How did it go?

693
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,258
Was it worth staying up late?

694
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,885
Yes, of course.

695
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,220
It was worth it.

696
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:03,930
Very much so.

697
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,098
Much more than you can imagine.

698
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,145
Well, I just came

699
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,730
to say goodbye

700
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,775
and to thank you.

701
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,694
If our plans go as we think they will…

702
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,073
I have before me

703
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:28,412
the new headmistress
of Andes San Javier School.

704
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,250
God willing.

705
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,293
God willing.
Thank you very much, Mr. Muriel.

706
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,711
No, but you know what?

707
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,465
There is one thing that worries me.

708
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,009
Vicentín's parents.

709
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,137
Vicentín-Consul-Firecracker?

710
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,723
Don't worry, I've taken care of it.

711
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,434
They're just one vote.

712
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,395
Me,

713
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,939
and now you,

714
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,566
we have the affection of the masses.

715
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,901
If you want to succeed,

716
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,529
you have to talk to the people,
not to those stiffs.

717
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,739
-Yes, right?
-Yes.

718
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,035
Politicians

719
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,162
come and go.

720
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,582
But not me.

721
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,544
I'm here to stay.

722
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,093
The one in the middle.

723
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,432
That one.

724
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,649
That's a good one.

725
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,069
We'll fucking eat that one.

726
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,574
What?

727
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,660
You don't like checking
that the food is fresh?

728
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,705
Yes, sure.

729
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,707
It looks delicious.

730
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,667
Then why the look on your face?

731
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,753
It has nothing to do with the lobster.

732
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,464
We just had a rough day. Didn't we, love?

733
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,049
A difficult day.

734
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,717
Nothing important.

735
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,679
-I'm going to the powder room.
-Me too. I really have to go.

736
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,600
Well, then you go.
We aren't leaving the governor alone.

737
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,393
No, don't worry about me.

738
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,895
Seriously, I can wait.

739
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,189
Baby, please,

740
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,316
ladies first.

741
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,318
Vicente, you really have to go.

742
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,737
Go, man. I'll take care of her for you.

743
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,412
Your Spaniard takes good care of you, huh?

744
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,372
Yes.

745
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,458
I was talking to my dad on my way here.

746
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,959
He sends his regards.

747
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,712
That's nice. Tell him
I'm looking forward to seeing him.

748
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,632
-Of course.
-He must be happy with your return, right?

749
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,051
Let's see how long it lasts.

750
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,596
-Why?
-Well, he isn't fitting in well here.

751
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,640
He misses Spain very much.

752
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,935
I have to explain to him that,
as long as he's close to us,

753
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,604
we'll soon put him somewhere bigger.

754
00:39:58,687 --> 00:39:59,814
Look, I'll tell you.

755
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,192
We had a misunderstanding
at our boy's school

756
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,027
with Olmo Muriel.

757
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,612
The Choco?

758
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,449
Your children go to the same school?

759
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,617
Yes, they do.

760
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,161
Are you familiar
with Andes San Javier School?

761
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,079
Hey.

762
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:20,042
All respectable men in this city
are graduates of Andes San Javier School.

763
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,086
What a coincidence. Isn't it?

764
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,462
So

765
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,174
could I ask a small favor?

766
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,426
Tell me.

767
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,469
But first, let's toast to your welcome.

768
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,470
Cheers.

769
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,226
Sorry.

770
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,940
TOÑO - VIDEO
NOW

771
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,609
I'll pay you! Mom!

772
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,862
Is everything all right?

773
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,700
An emergency.

774
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,285
-Do you need help?
-Sorry. No.

775
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,704
No, I'll figure it out.

776
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,249
Your friend.

777
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,502
-He fell asleep, didn't he?
-Yes.

778
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,838
Guys who don't control their excesses.

779
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,548
Bernie! Get up!

780
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:10,801
Hey,

781
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,720
is he all right?

782
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,431
-He'll wake up. It's okay.
-No, but…

783
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,850
It's just that he's so pale.

784
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,272
And cold.

785
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,441
-Bernie.
-No!

786
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,443
-Let me see.
-Not like that. Let's see.

787
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,360
Bernie!

788
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,239
Oh no!

789
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,074
This isn't right.

790
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,744
-We need to call a doctor.
-No.

791
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:37,995
-A doctor.
-Dora!

792
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,539
You'd better go.

793
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,209
These things happen when they overdo it.

794
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,127
You weren't here.

795
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,088
You can't tell anyone.

796
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,425
-No. We should call a doctor.
-We're not calling anyone!

797
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,885
It's not ethical.

798
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,304
-It's not moral.
-What are morals, Dora?

799
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,390
Don't ruin your future.

800
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,768
And don't get me in trouble.

801
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,603
Trouble?

802
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,232
What do you need for your silence?

803
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:13,656
Money.

804
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,951
I need money.

805
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,001
SNAKES AND LADDERS

806
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,967
