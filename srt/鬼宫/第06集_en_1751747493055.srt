1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,420
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,640
Gangcheori, now.

4
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,560
Do it!

5
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Gangcheori!

6
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,960
Damn it…

7
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,010
Is Gangcheori's luminous pearl not enough?

8
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,760
No.

9
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,430
The talismanic iron net is being torn.

10
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,770
Stay back.

11
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,790
Your Majesty. You have to do it now.

12
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,270
Warrior Deity…

13
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,490
Out of the way!

14
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,200
Is it that scoundrel again?

15
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,370
The unknown sorcerer in the palace…

16
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,830
Who is this rascal?

17
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,500
Why must they mess with me every time?

18
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,290
Oh, Warrior Deity.

19
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,130
Warrior Deity…

20
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,140
You will not be able
to leave here on your own terms.

21
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,560
This is the medicine the queen
has been taking recently?

22
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,600
It does not come from the Royal Clinic.

23
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,980
It is secretly brought in
from outside the palace.

24
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,860
- Antaehwan?
Yes, Your Grace.

25
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,240
I secretly questioned
a court lady physician

26
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,540
and she told me it was medicine
prescribed to deter miscarriages.

27
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,540
I hear she also took it often
when she was pregnant with the prince.

28
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,420
The Royal Clinic seems to be
in the dark about it.

29
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,340
I do not know how she is hiding it.

30
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,390
Your Grace?

31
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,680
Summon Pung-san.

32
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,060
Your Grace, but he is--

33
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,270
I am well aware

34
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,270
that he is a vile snake.

35
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,690
However, my son has died.

36
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,870
That child…

37
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,830
and the bizarre way he died…

38
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,830
How am I to accept any of it?

39
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,720
As soon as day breaks,

40
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,260
I shall summon Fortuneteller Pung-san.

41
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,400
This is him.

42
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,110
He placed the talisman
near the Royal Library.

43
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,870
REPORT TO YOUR MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE
IF YOU HAVE SEEN A MAN OF THIS DESCRIPTION

44
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,990
We must find him first

45
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,750
if we wish to expose
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost's accomplices.

46
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,000
We are questioning every court eunuch.

47
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,960
It might not be a eunuch.

48
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,300
Expand the search
to outside the palace as well.

49
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

50
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,300
How is the security
at the prince's quarters?

51
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,470
As you have commanded,

52
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,010
It has been reinforced with
additional royal guards and stewards.

53
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,930
I dispatched dependable soldiers
who are skilled at combat.

54
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,810
Anyone would think twice
before trying to enter.

55
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,560
I installed bells

56
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,980
and a fresh talismanic iron net
at His Highness's quarters.

57
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,280
Even if someone manages to break in
and places another talisman for the ghost,

58
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,820
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
will get caught in the net

59
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,700
and the bells will ring
on their own to notify us.

60
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,170
But, where is he today?

61
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,090
It appears he became
a bit fatigued after yesterday.

62
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,510
He is resting at home
because he was feeling unwell.

63
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,470
I see.

64
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,860
But, this eyeglass lens…

65
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,450
Last time at Mount Bugak,

66
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,570
you confronted that ghost
with this lens after stealing it from me.

67
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,700
You also told me
to use this against the ghost

68
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,410
if things went awry this time.

69
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,830
What makes this so special?

70
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,090
That is… a Ghostbane Stone.

71
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Ghostbane Stone?

72
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,130
It is referred to as the stone
of the Dragon King

73
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,840
and possesses mystical powers.

74
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,760
Your Majesty remained safe
from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

75
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,520
because you kept it with you up until now.

76
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,940
Your Majesty.

77
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,990
May I ask how you managed
to acquire that Ghostbane Stone?

78
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
It was…

79
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,540
By chance,
did Shaman Neop-deok present it to you?

80
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,750
Did you say Neop-deok?

81
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,170
I am certain
that female Ghostbane Stone once belonged

82
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,970
to Shaman Neop-deok.

83
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,180
Are you really not familiar
with Shaman Neop-deok?

84
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,030
Shaman Neop-deok…

85
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,410
was cherished by Queen Indeok,
my late grandmother.

86
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,200
I believe my grandmother summoned her
to the palace a few times.

87
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,580
Then…

88
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,540
That shaman gave me this corrective lens.

89
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,340
I did not believe in heretical ceremonies,

90
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,130
but I acknowledged the effort
that kind shaman put into refining it.

91
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,510
Hence, I used it to make these glasses.

92
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,850
But…

93
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,650
how do you know Shaman Neop-deok?

94
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,940
She is…

95
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,320
my maternal grandmother.

96
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,160
What a strange connection we have.

97
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,180
My grandmother was at this palace.

98
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,810
Did she foresee it then?

99
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,820
Did she know the royal bloodline
would be threatened by this ghost?

100
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:09,320
Is that why she gifted
the female Ghostbane Stone to him?

101
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,000
Unfortunately, this is

102
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
the only thing I can do for you
as a lowly subject who sympathizes

103
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,880
with His Highness's predicament.

104
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,800
If you keep this close,

105
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,310
it shall protect you.

106
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,700
I am even weaker than before…

107
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,410
This confrontation was
harder than the one at Mount Bugak.

108
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,870
How…

109
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,790
Damn it.

110
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,680
You claimed Prince Yeongin died because
of the sorcerer under the king's command.

111
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,310
Did you find out who that sorcerer is?

112
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,270
That Examiner Yoon Gap
you mentioned last time…

113
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,950
He was kicked out but returned
to the palace with a young girl.

114
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,860
I hear she has been frequenting
the Queen's Palace recently.

115
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,330
Who is she?

116
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,410
They say she is an eyeglass artisan.

117
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,460
Apparently, the king summons her
to the Royal Library frequently.

118
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,500
An eyeglass artisan?

119
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,750
I should look into that.

120
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,300
I cannot believe that some brat
could hinder the Warrior Deity so…

121
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,850
How dare you try to scheme before me!

122
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,770
Your Grace,

123
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,350
that is not true.

124
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,520
Then, what is the truth?

125
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,690
My son met such a tragic death…

126
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,700
but the king is expecting another child.

127
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,530
You claimed the king had a sorcerer.

128
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,450
You made a mockery of me
with this unverified claim.

129
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,370
Your Grace.

130
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,580
The energy inside the palace
shifted a fortnight ago.

131
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,040
I am certain the figure
who first entered the palace then

132
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,800
to stay by His Majesty's side

133
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,630
is the sorcerer.

134
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,680
A fortnight ago?
Yes, Your Grace.

135
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,010
However, did you just say

136
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,350
that His Majesty is expecting a new member

137
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,230
of the royal bloodline?

138
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,150
The queen has been sowed
with the king's seed.

139
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,620
The Warrior Deity will have fresh prey.

140
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,410
Are you all right?

141
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,700
Yes. I am fine. Just fine.

142
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,330
Should you not have a seeing guide?

143
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,250
Well, I do have a servant,
but something came up

144
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,880
and I could not bring him with me.

145
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,960
Hold on,

146
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,430
you have quite an extraordinary aura
for a young maiden.

147
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,970
Are you a court lady?

148
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,140
No. I am an eyeglass artisan
at the Royal Couturier.

149
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,600
The young maiden
possesses such remarkable talent.

150
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,980
Anyhow, thank you.

151
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,650
Not at all.

152
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,530
That brat must be the one.

153
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,450
She must be.

154
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,750
Is he a fortuneteller?

155
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,530
What are you going to do
with that cursed thing?

156
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,620
Well…

157
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,660
it seems the royal bloodline
is expecting a new member.

158
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,540
I will take that nascent fetus

159
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,670
to create the most restorative tonic

160
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,460
that will heal
the Warrior Deity's injuries.

161
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,630
A soul, not tainted by the grime
of the mortal world in the slightest.

162
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,600
It will be most helpful
in revitalizing the Warrior Deity.

163
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,490
Were you waiting for me?

164
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,870
Is it not obvious?
I am your patron deity, after all.

165
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,290
Because you are worried I might be jinxed
by some wandering spirit?

166
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,630
Yes. You are correct.

167
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,680
Are you feeling all right?

168
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,110
Last time, it seemed like
you recharge in clean, fresh water.

169
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,940
Maybe you should again?

170
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,530
I have already done so.

171
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,240
I see.

172
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,990
Listen, about what happened yesterday…

173
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,040
I guess I thought with your luminous pearl

174
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,540
and my grandma's implements,

175
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,590
we would be able to confront
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost without issue.

176
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,960
I was too hasty and rash…

177
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,590
and it made you overexert yourself.

178
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,100
So? Do you wish to give up
on being my disciple?

179
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,270
What?

180
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,440
You agreed to become my disciple
because you believed

181
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
that I could catch
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

182
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,320
However, when the chance arose,
I failed to do so.

183
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,030
Hence, you no longer have any reason
to serve me as your patron deity.

184
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,950
No.

185
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,250
An agreement
between a patron deity and a disciple

186
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,580
cannot be broken so easily.

187
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,590
I still hold some resentment
and contempt for you.

188
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,960
However, I also know

189
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,260
that for many years,
you did whatever it took

190
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,640
to keep me safe.

191
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,970
And you continue to do so to this day.

192
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
Am I wrong?

193
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,490
You are correct.

194
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,630
That is strange.

195
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,130
You are right here…

196
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,260
but I sense the aura
of an Imugi over there, too.

197
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,770
Bibi.

198
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,360
My lord, let me pour you a drink.

199
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,190
How nice.

200
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,240
Did you hear that rumor?

201
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,280
They say a ghost was responsible
for Prince Yeongin's demise.

202
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,660
I heard that rumor as well.

203
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,710
But you know, I believe those ghost rumors
have been around since the late king.

204
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,790
Yes.

205
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,880
For the past few years,
rumors of ghosts being responsible

206
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,590
for the sudden deaths of royal kin

207
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,090
have been swirling around
and making their rounds.

208
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:32,180
My goodness, so the ghosts
are wiping out the royals?

209
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,270
All that stuff

210
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,190
was just uselessly made up
by the court ladies.

211
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,280
Nothing more than silly rumors.

212
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,950
What is Lord Choi Won-u up to?

213
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,080
Well, apparently,

214
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,450
he simply offered
his condolences for Prince Yeongin

215
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,790
and left before even having
an audience with the king.

216
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,750
From what I hear,
he was bedridden from an illness

217
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,380
and did not meet with anyone.

218
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,100
I do not believe you need
to be concerned about him.

219
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,100
My lord, may I pour you a drink as well?

220
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,690
He is a childhood friend,
currently the magistrate of Gwacheon.

221
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,150
He was so desperate
for a chance to meet you

222
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,820
and begged me so incessantly…

223
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,110
Excuse me. I need to relieve myself.

224
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,450
Pardon?
Wait, my lord…

225
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,790
My lord…

226
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,590
Who are you even looking for?

227
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,840
My younger brother.

228
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,970
What? You have a younger brother?

229
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,010
Then, that Imugi aura I detected earlier…

230
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,820
How dare you!

231
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,700
How dare a measly examiner

232
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,200
display such impertinence to me,
the Minister of War!

233
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,580
Is it because you are
an ignorant, lowborn bastard?

234
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,410
Possibly.

235
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
Probably.

236
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,540
Why that scoundrel…

237
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,970
Rascal, did you pass
your 60th birthday this year?

238
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,800
What did you say?

239
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,550
You are fine if you did not,

240
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,470
but if you did,
you should be careful here.

241
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,310
One could argue
that I ended up in this body

242
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,190
and was able to welcome
Yeo-ri as my disciple,

243
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,860
all thanks to you.

244
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,570
That is why I kindly offer this advice.

245
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,570
My sword. Where is it?

246
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,860
How dare you insult me like this?
You scoundrel!

247
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,620
Heed my warning.

248
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,620
I am a bit busy
looking for my younger brother.

249
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,840
If you interfere once more,

250
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,590
I will not hold back.

251
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,060
Did I not warn you?

252
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,100
You scoundrel!

253
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,410
My goodness. You were telling the truth.

254
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,620
I thought you were bluffing
with that constant talk of whirlwinds,

255
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,170
but you just released a whirlwind

256
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,590
and blew him away.

257
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,210
That was nothing.

258
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,510
Yeo-ri, I am Gangcheori.

259
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,550
The most malicious malevolent deity
who humans fear the most.

260
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,810
Wait, how far did you send him away?

261
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,980
I am not sure.

262
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,060
Wind can be so unpredictable.

263
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,190
I cannot say.

264
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,820
Based on the direction,
it seems he will be riding the north wind.

265
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,570
Perhaps, he will land by the sea off Jeju?

266
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,950
Gosh!

267
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,700
Why did you hit me?
What now?

268
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,700
He is the Minister of War, a real bigwig!

269
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,780
Did you even consider
the possible consequences?

270
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,410
That man…

271
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,960
is Yoon Gap's killer.

272
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,750
What?

273
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,760
He was the one
who stabbed Yoon Gap to death.

274
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,180
Is that true?

275
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,640
Then, the Kwak Sang-chung
you mentioned last time…

276
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,100
Correct. That was him.

277
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,440
I saw it with my own eyes.

278
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,320
Good job.

279
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,360
Well done!

280
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,070
You should have just blasted
him off to Japan while you were at it.

281
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,790
Where?
Go.

282
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,450
A bit further.
Where?

283
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,620
It came from over here.

284
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,460
Lord Kwak's scream came from over here.

285
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,040
What in the world is going on?

286
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,510
Are you not Examiner Yoon Gap?

287
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
What are you…

288
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,640
doing here?

289
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,730
We just heard Lord Kwak scream.

290
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,150
By chance, did you do something to him?

291
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,230
What?

292
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,440
My lord, your jest goes too far.

293
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,990
As if Lord Kwak
with his exceptional combat skills

294
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,700
could even be ruffled
by this wimpy whippersnapper.

295
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,910
Where in the world is Lord Kwak?

296
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,750
A whirlwind just now--

297
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,580
We heard a whirlwind pass through

298
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,170
and the sound of a scream as well.

299
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,340
However, we did not see
a single person in the vicinity.

300
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,340
Right, my lord?
You did not see anybody, either.

301
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,180
My goodness.

302
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,970
What are we to do?

303
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,350
What is going on here?

304
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,970
How will we find him?

305
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,690
He is an Imugi.

306
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,610
There really was
another one besides Gangcheori.

307
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,340
That man is dead.

308
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,670
He killed that man instantly.

309
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,090
What is with that Imugi?

310
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,560
Where in the world could Lord Kwak be?

311
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,060
My goodness.
We must find him.

312
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,820
Look here, my lord.

313
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,530
What has gotten into you?

314
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,650
My goodness. What happened to him?
What is going on?

315
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,820
Wake up.
Why am I…

316
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,330
Open your eyes!

317
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,080
Go and fetch a physician.
Right.

318
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,250
Hear me! Is anyone there?

319
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,370
Hear me!

320
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,960
What is going on here?
Yes, my lord?

321
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,710
Let us hurry. Come on.

322
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,800
Quickly now.

323
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,960
Oh, goodness. My lord.

324
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,430
How terrible.

325
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,270
Oh my…

326
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,900
Who are you?

327
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,980
Me?

328
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,570
I am Imugi Bibi. I'm here to eat you.

329
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,870
Eat? Eat what?

330
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,280
Do not come any closer. Stop!

331
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,870
Stay back! Stop!

332
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,150
I have not been this stuffed in ages.

333
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,240
His belly was full of spite.

334
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,320
Quite tasty indeed.

335
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,740
He ate him.

336
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,580
He just devoured a man.

337
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,620
You have not changed one bit, Bibi.

338
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,210
What?

339
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
You see me?

340
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,810
Is that you, Gangcheori?

341
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,980
I just cannot believe this.

342
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,230
So, it is true.

343
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,070
The Gangcheori I know

344
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,820
is really inside this body.

345
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,860
Damn it.

346
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,990
Even when the wandering spirits
at the market street

347
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,250
yammered away about some clueless Imugi

348
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,750
being stuck in a human body, I…

349
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,000
I still had hope that it was not you.

350
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,340
But they were indeed
actually talking about you?

351
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,670
Geez.

352
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,140
Who knew the invincible, lofty Gangcheori
would end up in such a sad state?

353
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,470
Seeing as how emaciated you look,

354
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,430
your hunt for aristocrats
must not be going easy.

355
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,350
Maybe I ate too many of them?

356
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,020
The supply of aristocrats over 60
has been drained in the south.

357
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,820
That is why I have come to the capital.

358
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,530
There are bountiful feasts
all over the capital.

359
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,320
You can eat whatever you want.

360
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,990
How many more do you need?

361
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,990
I need 12. Once I eat 12 more,

362
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,950
that will make 100 aristocrats over 60.

363
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,370
Once I do, I shall ascend
into the sky as a black dragon.

364
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,710
I shall occasionally let you know
how I am doing from up there.

365
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,300
"Gangcheori!"

366
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,550
"The water up here is so nice!
Ascend so we can have some fun together!"

367
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,060
That is enough foolishness.

368
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,640
Come out now.
Where?

369
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,480
Come out of
that smelly human body already.

370
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,070
Do I look like I have a choice?
What?

371
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,030
What?

372
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,910
Are you kidding me?
Do you really not know how?

373
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,080
Do you?

374
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,870
It is so simple.

375
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,580
You need to destroy this body you are in.

376
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,040
Just kill this Yoon Gap
or whatever his name is.

377
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,920
As if there was anything easier
to kill than a mortal.

378
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,510
I need to…

379
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
kill this body?

380
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,770
Just jump off a cliff

381
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,350
or stab it in the heart.

382
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,270
It is so simple.
What are you complaining about?

383
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,230
Look. That would be perfect.

384
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,160
Grab it.

385
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,040
Damn it.

386
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,290
Turn it.

387
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,210
Just stab it.

388
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,760
Stab it?

389
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,300
Stop!

390
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,550
Who says you can kill His Lord?
Absolutely not.

391
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,310
It is that brat from before.

392
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,430
You locked eyes with me earlier.
Can you see me?

393
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
Yes.

394
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,230
Also,

395
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,570
we are already linked
as patron deity and disciple.

396
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,280
We agreed to keep
this body safe until we catch

397
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,400
that Eight-foot-tall Ghost
and save Lord Yoon Gap.

398
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,780
What?

399
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,870
Gap!

400
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,740
Move it.

401
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,830
Gap!

402
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,300
Gap!

403
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,710
Tell her I am sleeping.

404
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,130
I am asleep.

405
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,470
Gap!

406
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,890
I came in to borrow this,

407
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,730
but it seems His Lord is already sleeping.

408
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,230
He is sleeping already?

409
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,020
I thought I heard him talking outside.

410
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,570
Oh, that…

411
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,360
He kept talking in his sleep.

412
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,320
It must have been
a busy day at the palace.

413
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,110
My goodness.
What am I going to do with this punk?

414
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,370
What is the matter?

415
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,280
That expensive medicine I bought for him…

416
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,040
He dumped all of it in the outhouse.

417
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,500
What?
I cannot believe him.

418
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,750
You damn punk!
Do you know how much that costs?

419
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,080
How could you dump
that precious medicine out like that?

420
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,710
You could have just let me take it!

421
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,050
I am so upset, I could die!

422
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,760
I cannot believe you!

423
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,260
How can you even sleep?

424
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,720
This damn punk. How can you even sleep?

425
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,850
Going to the outhouse?

426
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,150
This is hilarious.

427
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,110
The almighty Gangcheori…

428
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,570
is now forced to use
that smelly, dirty outhouse.

429
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,490
That brat from earlier…

430
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,000
She is the one you used
to chase around and obsess over, right?

431
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,000
Are you really going to fight
that pesky Eight-foot-tall Ghost?

432
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,500
Just for that measly human's sake?

433
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,300
I already gave her my word I would.

434
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,880
Gangcheori.

435
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,510
Gangcheori…

436
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,550
Okay, fine.

437
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,350
Once a human with mighty spiritual energy
starts serving you

438
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,100
with great reverence as your disciple,

439
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,900
you get another chance to ascend.
I am also familiar with that legend.

440
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,980
However,

441
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,230
how can you trust those lowly mortals?

442
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,980
You know how fickle they can be.

443
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,990
Bibi.

444
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:08,450
I learned a few things while living
in this despicable mortal world.

445
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,500
Guess what the most useful thing is.

446
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,870
What is it?

447
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,460
Lying.

448
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,430
Gosh, who knew you were such a jerk?

449
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,140
The most malicious, malevolent deity.

450
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,850
I plan to go with how things play out
for the time being.

451
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,480
And there are so many dishes
I have yet to taste.

452
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,610
Once that girl fully opens her heart to me
and follows me wholeheartedly…

453
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,990
I shall kill this body and escape

454
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,750
to claim her for myself.

455
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,960
Yes, great.

456
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,960
Excellent.

457
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,130
You can just go right for it. Yes.

458
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,720
Hear me, you scoundrels!

459
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,140
Is anyone out there?

460
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,180
Get me down this instant.

461
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,390
Why these scoundrels…

462
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,440
I am Kwak Sang-chung, the Minister of War!

463
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
Get me down now! Go on!

464
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,150
Hear me, scoundrels!

465
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,870
Is there truly no one there?

466
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,040
Can someone get me down?

467
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,960
Those wretched lords.

468
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,920
I shall teach them
a painful lesson when I return.

469
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,010
I shall!

470
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,260
Wait. No.

471
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,350
Please.

472
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,520
Please, can someone just let me down?

473
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,310
Anyone, please just get me down from here.

474
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,750
Wait.

475
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,380
Just stay there. Let me step out first.

476
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,810
Damn it. This is insane.

477
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,690
What is insane?
Damn it!

478
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,070
You startled me.
Startled enough to blush like a peach?

479
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,030
What happened?

480
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
What is it?

481
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,330
Listen, Yeo-ri--

482
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,620
I mean, Listen, Bibi.

483
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:04,790
The desire to devour an aristocrat…

484
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,220
Does it make you want
to stare at them all the time?

485
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,180
Does it make your heart race
when they are near?

486
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,430
Does it make you want
to touch them and stuff?

487
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,510
No.

488
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:20,180
I am too busy gobbling them down.
Who has time for touching?

489
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,940
Are you like that?

490
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,690
That girl, Yeo-ri…

491
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,190
She has finally accepted me
as her patron deity.

492
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,950
But my heart strangely aches
whenever I am near her.

493
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,240
And sometimes,

494
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,450
I think I might want to devour her…

495
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,160
How strange…

496
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,830
What about other mortals?

497
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,000
Other mortals?

498
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,970
Does Lord Yoon Gap…

499
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,050
really live in this village?

500
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,430
Did you think
a low-ranking official born a bastard

501
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,480
would be living in fancy Bukchon?

502
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,690
Goodness.

503
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,490
I should have known.

504
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:25,540
I guess love that overcomes social classes
only exist in fairy tales.

505
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,550
Gosh, my lady! That is quite an epiphany!

506
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,800
My goodness!

507
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,430
All right. We should return now.

508
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,260
You will be in big trouble
with His Excellency if he finds out.

509
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,640
But still, we need to return this plant.

510
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,310
He may be looking for it.

511
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,870
Another mortal?

512
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,240
Yes.

513
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:06,330
See if you feel the same thing
about any other human.

514
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
Another mortal.

515
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,450
She is another mortal…

516
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,160
but I do not

517
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,370
feel…

518
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,200
anything.

519
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,580
My lord.

520
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,050
This is the plant
you entrusted me with last time.

521
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,800
I came here to return it.

522
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,590
The plant from that damn quack monk?

523
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,720
I do not need it.

524
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,010
Keep it or toss it.

525
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,770
Do as you wish.

526
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,570
Now, I understand…

527
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,570
I do not want to devour her as Bibi does.

528
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,710
Gosh.

529
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,170
I assumed you were staying home
when I did not see you.

530
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,960
What are you talking about?

531
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,380
You expect a patron deity to stay behind?

532
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,810
So, what choice do I have?

533
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:34,270
I cannot keep my promise to you
and defeat the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

534
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,070
Nor can I leave this body
and abandon your side.

535
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,320
I have no choice but to continue lying

536
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,620
and prolong the time we have together.

537
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,680
It's strange…

538
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,510
Something about His Lord has changed.

539
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,720
He is not the man I first met.

540
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,100
How did he change?

541
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,100
How shall I put it? He seems a bit wilder.

542
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,190
It makes him even more attractive.

543
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,190
Attractive? As if.
He just shoved you aside.

544
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,700
Hey, that was because he was embarrassed.

545
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,950
See?

546
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,870
He even gave me a gift.

547
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,790
Did you not hear him tell you to toss it?

548
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,710
You just do not understand.

549
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,420
His Lord may seem curt on the outside,

550
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,130
but he has a warm, tender heart
on the inside.

551
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,550
Such men are prevalent in fairy tales.

552
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,590
I see. Sure.

553
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,310
What? What is the matter?

554
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,100
What?
Shush.

555
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,230
Is that Father?

556
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:05,450
What is he doing with such ruffians?

557
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:15,370
Help yourself.

558
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,290
The Royal Confectionery
is known for its desserts.

559
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,000
Thank you.

560
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,640
By chance,

561
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,560
could I forgo them now
and take them with me later?

562
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,680
Why?

563
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,850
For Examiner Yoon Gap's sake?

564
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,190
No, I would not go that far.

565
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,150
He is waiting for me outside

566
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,150
for he is not allowed
in the Queen's Palace.

567
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,820
Do not worry and help yourself.

568
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,410
I shall have them pack some
for Examiner Yoon separately.

569
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,540
Thank you.

570
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:58,750
Instead of the yugwa,
you should send him dasik and yakgwa.

571
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,170
They are tastier.

572
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,710
It appears you have
some affection for Examiner Yoon.

573
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,510
Did he treat you well?

574
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:07,340
Well, what happened was--

575
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,260
I would not say he treated me well.

576
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,470
I find him comical.

577
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,020
I have never met a man like him
in the palace before.

578
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,480
What was that?

579
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:25,280
Your Highness.
Mother.

580
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,740
A vision?

581
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,000
My apologies.

582
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,590
It appears my stomach is a bit upset.

583
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,170
Your Highness, are you all right?

584
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,720
Perhaps, you should take your leave now.

585
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,890
Yes.

586
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,310
Your Highness, are you all right?

587
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:03,400
Why are you not leaving?

588
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,900
Your Highness, by chance,

589
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,490
have you dreamt of a nightmare recently?

590
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,200
How do you…

591
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,170
Escort the prince out
and give us the room.

592
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,030
How did you know about that?

593
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:52,740
Just a moment ago,
I had a vision of Your Highness.

594
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,830
You were suffering from a nightmare.

595
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,170
It has already been several days

596
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,580
since I started having that nightmare.

597
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,030
At first,

598
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,870
I thought it was
just an upsetting nightmare.

599
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,960
However, as the days passed,
the nightmare felt more real.

600
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,420
It felt as if I was
actually experiencing it.

601
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,170
Did you say he spat out
black water from his mouth?

602
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,390
Can you figure out the cause?

603
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,190
Please allow me to inspect
your chambers for a moment.

604
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,500
My goodness!

605
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:28,080
My lord!

606
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,420
Thank the heavens you are safe.

607
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,170
I would call this divine intervention.

608
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,380
It is indeed a great relief.

609
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:36,680
What happened to you?

610
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,100
The whole capital was
flipped inside out to look for you.

611
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,600
Where in the world have you been?

612
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:47,640
And what happened to your leg?

613
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,190
Yoon Gap.

614
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,110
Where is that scoundrel?

615
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:53,440
Pardon?

616
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,250
There you are!

617
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,380
Why you…

618
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,510
You rotten scoundrel.

619
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:17,010
You ghastly rascal.

620
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:18,630
How did you do it?

621
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,390
How did you do that to me?

622
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:22,640
You came sooner than I expected.

623
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,850
And you are surprisingly…

624
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,930
perfectly intact.

625
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,230
What did you say? Why you…

626
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,270
I will kill you someday.

627
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,820
I will pay you back
a hundred, a thousandfold!

628
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,530
What is all this commotion about?

629
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,240
Your Majesty.

630
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,830
Minister, what happened to you?

631
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,580
And what exactly

632
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,710
did Examiner Yoon do to enrage you so?

633
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:53,670
This scoundrel.
This scoundrel and his whirlwind…

634
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,050
His whirlwind…

635
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:14,690
I do not expect you to observe
proper etiquette towards me.

636
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,360
You are not Yoon Gap.

637
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:21,070
Therefore you are not one of my subjects.

638
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,280
Then, you should have
just kept on walking.

639
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:26,450
Why did you bring me here?

640
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,910
However,

641
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:30,960
once you draw attention to yourself
by acting out like this,

642
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:35,540
I will no longer be able
to protect you or Yeo-ri.

643
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,210
Would that be fine as well?

644
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,380
So, you order us to stop
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost,

645
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,550
but if things go awry,

646
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:48,930
you will simply play dumb
and leave us to take the fall?

647
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,690
Is that it?

648
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,480
Why this rotten little…

649
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:57,570
You scoundrel.

650
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:59,150
You are right.

651
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,030
I am not one of your subjects.

652
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,160
I am…

653
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,280
Gangcheori.

654
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:10,080
Gangcheori?

655
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,460
As in that wretched Imugi

656
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,090
who brings forth misfortune
wherever he goes?

657
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:20,420
You refer to
that malevolent deity from legends?

658
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:27,180
I believe I have heard
of him as well, Your Majesty.

659
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:29,720
He was on his way to ascend as a dragon,

660
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:33,230
but he was jinxed when a human spotted him
and he fell back down to earth.

661
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,730
Afterward, he spent
his time tormenting mortals.

662
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:37,770
That rotten Imugi…

663
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,440
And…

664
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,610
you are him?

665
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,130
It is perfectly clean.

666
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:45,510
Nothing seems out of place.
What could it be?

667
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:58,520
May I step up for a moment?

668
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,440
You may.

669
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,040
What is the matter?

670
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,770
My goodness!

671
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:42,650
Your Highness.

672
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:59,160
Do you finally understand?

673
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:03,250
Do you understand who I really am now?

674
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:08,880
Although I am unsure if feeble mortal eyes
can perceive such things.

675
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,590
Since we will be
spending some time together,

676
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,260
I shall graciously explain it to you.

677
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:17,140
So,

678
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,430
if the king is here,

679
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,310
I may be a malevolent deity
but a deity nonetheless.

680
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,440
I am here.

681
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:30,400
Thus, who should observe
proper etiquette toward whom?

682
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,580
But,

683
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:46,380
what exactly happened
between you and the Minister of War?

684
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:50,510
From what I heard,
you were present when he went missing.

685
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,340
Were you the one responsible?

686
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:53,930
Oh, that?

687
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,680
He just kept yammering away,

688
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,760
so I sent him off with a whirlwind.

689
00:53:58,350 --> 00:53:59,390
A whirl…

690
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,560
What?
A whirlwind.

691
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,610
I summoned a whirlwind
and sent him packing.

692
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:06,940
Blasted him right off.

693
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,190
What? What did you say?

694
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,240
What did you blast off with a whirlwind?

695
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:15,320
Must I repeat myself?

696
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:18,240
I hurled that fool into the sky.

697
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:22,000
But it seems in this human body,

698
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,460
I am weaker than I used to be.

699
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,170
I thought he would land by the sea
off Jeju and we would enjoy some quiet,

700
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,340
but seeing as how he returned
in just a few days,

701
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:32,840
it appears he did not go very far.

702
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,220
So, you are saying

703
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,430
you made the Minister of War
fly off with a whirlwind?

704
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,270
You? You did that?

705
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:00,990
Your Majesty.

706
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:02,790
Something terrible has happened.

707
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,420
Are you saying

708
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,380
this object was discovered
inside the queen's chambers?

709
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:20,470
What about the queen?
Is the queen all right?

710
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,390
Yes, Your Majesty.
She fainted for a moment,

711
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,020
but the royal physician
said she would be fine.

712
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,480
However…

713
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,440
Since she is with child,

714
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,450
he said she should be careful.

715
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:40,330
What are you talking about?

716
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,910
What do you mean the queen is with child?

717
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:48,210
Are you saying Her Highness is pregnant?

718
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,000
Your Majesty, I have sinned gravely!

719
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:54,590
Her Highness feared
something terrible would happen

720
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:57,300
due to the Eight-foot-tall Ghost,

721
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,390
so I remained silent on the matter.

722
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:07,060
Then, this skull…

723
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,370
What…

724
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,920
BONFIRE

725
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,250
What is that?

726
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,840
It was written by the same person

727
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,510
as the last talisman.

728
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,310
Then…

729
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,060
this is related
to the Eight-foot-tall Ghost?

730
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

731
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,060
And this talisman…

732
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:35,320
Speak!

733
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:37,820
It appears this talisman

734
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,700
targets the baby in Her Highness's womb.

735
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:05,890
Make no exception

736
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,100
and apprehend every attendant
in the Queen's Palace!

737
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

738
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,450
Just a moment.

739
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:24,610
Please let me inspect it a bit longer.

740
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,330
What are you trying to do?

741
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:33,790
I cannot just stand by and watch.

742
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,210
How could they target an unborn child?

743
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:38,500
I will get them.

744
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,050
Do you think you can find out who it is?

745
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:45,130
The ghost tormenting Her Highness
must be here,

746
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,350
but my powers feel blocked by something.

747
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:53,600
I must retrieve my myeongdu
from the Royal Couturier.

748
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:57,310
MYEONGDU: A MIRROR THAT REVEALS
SPIRITS TO A SHAMAN

749
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,720
Stop.

750
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,220
You must be more careful.

751
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:35,350
What did I tell you?

752
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,940
A myeongdu reveals spirits

753
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:44,740
and reflects the world
unseen by mortal eyes.

754
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,820
It is how a shaman finds their voice.

755
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,990
You must treat it like a part of your body

756
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,120
and cherish it.

757
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,170
Myeongdu, the mirror for spirits.

758
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,460
With this…

759
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:05,170
What is the matter?

760
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:30,280
I suggest you stop there.

761
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:33,330
His sword is powerful enough
to easily annihilate

762
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,620
and completely wipe out
a wandering spirit like yourself.

763
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,260
He was a drowned ghost.

764
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,760
What?

765
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,050
That makes no sense.

766
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,560
How did it manage to stay
out of water for that long?

767
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,140
It must have been thanks to that talisman.

768
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,940
That is how he managed
to brazenly stay on dry land for so long.

769
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:07,690
He escaped through this waterway.

770
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:08,860
We must catch him.

771
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:34,010
There he is.

772
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:37,140
That is where he is hiding.

773
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:05,960
Make sure you catch him.

774
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:15,390
Grant me mercy so that I may salvage
and guide this spirit to cross over.

775
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:34,200
Got you.

776
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,260
Are you all right?

777
01:02:58,430 --> 01:02:59,430
What is wrong?

778
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:41,720
Damn wandering spirit…

779
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,660
If you tell me who instigated it,

780
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:42,280
I shall spare your life.

781
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:45,490
I thought you may know something.

782
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:48,040
Are you suspecting me right now?

783
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:51,250
Something feels off. My body feels heavy.

784
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:53,130
She ended up being struck by a curse
in the end.

785
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:54,840
The queen has similar symptoms.

786
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,670
That vicious drowned ghost
is targeting the unborn child.

787
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,510
Then, will you offer
your son in your stead?

788
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:02,510
There is only one way to break that curse.

789
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,600
You catch the ghost that placed it.

790
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,520
Yeo-ri will die if we waste any more time.

791
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,650
