1
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,917
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,421
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,310
<i>He is not here.</i>

4
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,395
<i>He is nowhere near this house.</i>

5
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:08,026
<i>Where in the world did Gangcheori go?</i>

6
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,533
You had that terrible fever
through the night.

7
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,037
Take the day off.
Must you go to the palace today?

8
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,206
The nation will not fall
just because you are absent.

9
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,625
You should stay with me a bit longer.

10
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,502
I must see His Majesty.

11
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,963
Yeo-ri, let us go.

12
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:30,882
Yes, my lord.

13
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:32,884
I shall be off, Mother.

14
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,511
All right.

15
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,020
Gosh. That really is my Gap.

16
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,606
That is him, all right.

17
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,993
<i>I cannot believe this.</i>

18
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,954
<i>It really is Lord Yoon Gap.</i>

19
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,872
<i>The look in his eyes is different.</i>

20
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,375
<i>This is what I have been praying for.</i>

21
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,754
<i>Lord Yoon Gap has truly returned.</i>

22
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,925
Yeo-ri.

23
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,969
Thank you.

24
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,429
Pardon? For what?

25
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,640
You looked after my mother

26
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,892
and kept my body safe.

27
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,103
That was…

28
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,021
not my doing.

29
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,650
Yes. He was responsible.

30
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,570
The malevolent deity
named Gangcheori, was it?

31
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,698
My lord, how did this happen?

32
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,325
You were held captive
by the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

33
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,869
How…

34
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,453
I do not know, either.

35
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,415
The realm beyond life
was hazy and obscured.

36
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,917
I found it difficult to think clearly.

37
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,087
However…

38
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,010
there is something I am certain of.

39
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,512
And what might that be?

40
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,056
I have come back…

41
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,062
because there was
something I needed to tell you.

42
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,108
Back then,

43
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,068
I felt a great sense of urgency

44
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,446
after seeing the royal family
on the verge of peril

45
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,656
and His Majesty suffering so.

46
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,783
I was planning to tell you

47
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,036
everything after we arrived
at the Capital.

48
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,289
I… deceived you.

49
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,083
I pushed you into danger
with the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

50
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,712
I am sorry, Yeo-ri.

51
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,425
Perhaps…

52
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,637
I tried so hard to save you

53
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,307
because I wanted
to hear you say such words to me.

54
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,727
I am very happy…

55
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,813
to have you back, my lord.

56
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,918
This…

57
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,420
is not mine.

58
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,257
That…

59
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,719
was intended for another.

60
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,265
I see.

61
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,804
Your Majesty,

62
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,098
please forgive this unfaithful servant.

63
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,601
I offer you my delayed greetings

64
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,603
after I failed to obey your royal command.

65
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,485
He is indeed Examiner Yoon Gap.

66
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,987
What are you saying?

67
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,823
Are you saying he is
no longer Gangcheori the Imugi,

68
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,075
and has reverted back to Examiner Yoon Gap

69
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,036
just like that?

70
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,162
Yes.

71
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,417
Yoon Gap…

72
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,253
has returned?

73
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,421
Your Majesty.

74
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,634
I longed to offer up my futile existence

75
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,014
to become kindling in your honor
to lend Your Majesty my meager support,

76
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,641
but I failed to do so.

77
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,187
You really are…

78
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,523
Yoon Gap.

79
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,782
The Yoon Gap that I cherished so…

80
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,828
has returned to me.

81
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:11,746
Yes, Your Majesty.

82
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,457
It is I.

83
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,085
Your unfaithful servant…

84
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,671
has finally returned.

85
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,259
Gap.

86
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,555
Are you okay, Your Majesty?

87
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,016
My goodness, Your Majesty!

88
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,354
My reaction was delayed

89
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,023
because his acts of insolence
have been so frequent as of late.

90
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,441
Such insolence!

91
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,151
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

92
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,988
As soon as I felt your royal frame,

93
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,323
I experienced unbearable pain.

94
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,158
Thus…

95
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,493
What do you mean?

96
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,288
Your Majesty, it is because
of the Ghostbane Stone.

97
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,874
Ghostbane Stone…

98
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,010
This is it.

99
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,720
It is a stone that wards off ghosts.

100
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,806
I learned about it, thanks to Yeo-ri.

101
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,101
I hear this Ghostbane Stone
of the Dragon King

102
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,437
is what kept me safe

103
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,564
from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
all these years.

104
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,483
Ghostbane Stone…

105
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,902
Stone of the Dragon King…

106
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,073
So it was because of that…

107
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:39,083
But did you not say
this Ghostbane Stone warded off ghosts?

108
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,336
Then, why is it having an effect
on Yoon Gap who is alive and well?

109
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,591
The soul of the deceased
has returned to the body,

110
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,676
but this body
has already experienced death once.

111
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,470
Thus,

112
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,014
that is why he cannot
approach the Ghostbane Stone.

113
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,730
Regardless, I remain delighted
by your return.

114
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,071
You lost your life while carrying out
my royal command.

115
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,324
You must have experienced such sorrow.

116
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,494
I have felt sorry…

117
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,705
time and time again.

118
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,373
Your Majesty.

119
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,269
What do you think
of the finalized state-owned slave reform?

120
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,562
Your Majesty.

121
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,148
I am truly in awe.

122
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,859
You supplemented with commoners to counter

123
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,363
the bureaus' slave labor deficit,
voiding the distinction of slaves.

124
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,367
Your Majesty has faithfully acted
in the best interest of the people.

125
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,453
Now that the opponents
of the reform have been subdued,

126
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,497
you <i>will</i> forge this into reality.

127
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,124
Do you truly believe that?

128
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,972
<i>You will achieve</i>
<i>that noble pursuit you seek.</i>

130
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,014
<i>After all,</i>

131
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,058
you are one of those mortals

132
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,646
I come across occasionally.

133
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,652
That damn Imugi rascal…

134
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,956
Without you around,

135
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,127
His Majesty experienced
all sorts of discomfort.

136
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,799
You will inevitably be weary
of public scrutiny for a while.

137
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,885
Rumors of your insanity
ran rampant in the palace.

138
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,683
By the way,
are you sure you will be all right?

139
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,352
Your body has found a new master overnight

140
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,938
and I heard you had
a fever through the night.

141
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,942
His Majesty also said
you should not overexert yourself.

142
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,694
I am all right.

143
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,740
Thank you, Head Eunuch.

144
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,875
Right, I am the Head Eunuch…

145
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:32,089
Maybe I should go to the courtesan house
for some grilled abalones tonight?

146
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,675
He could have said goodbye before leaving.

147
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,053
That rotten Imugi scoundrel…

148
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,098
You cannot hear me, right?

149
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,269
Can I get a "Grilled Abalone"?

150
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,955
<i>Eight-foot-tall Ghost…</i>

151
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,500
<i>This must be your doing.</i>

152
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,899
<i>Let harmonious energy arrive soundly</i>
<i>From east to west</i>

153
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,904
<i>If evil energy exists</i>
<i>Let it be released to the west</i>

154
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,080
All better?

155
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,173
I called you here to stop your pain.

156
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:57,967
You are…

157
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,886
that wicked spirit's lackey.

158
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,013
I have nothing to say to you.

159
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,641
How does it feel to reclaim
your once stolen body?

160
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,895
Do you not feel a surge of resentment
over the things you had lost?

161
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,776
That body will not remain yours.

162
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,361
It will not last long.

163
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:24,076
Pour this on the King's Ghostbane Stone.

164
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,828
If you do,

165
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,622
the Warrior Deity will ensure
you keep that body for good.

166
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,709
What happens…

167
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,129
if I pour that over the Ghostbane Stone?

168
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,922
What will happen to His Majesty?

169
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,717
Why would you ask
about such useless things?

170
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,512
Just do as you are told
and that body will be yours forever.

171
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,545
As if I would fall for your tricks.

172
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,006
I would rather choose

173
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,510
to be a pile of ashes
than put His Majesty in harm's way.

174
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,144
Have you not found him yet?

175
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,771
No.

176
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,690
I thought he would be
at the creek he frequented,

177
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,484
but he was not there, either.

178
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:46,825
The soul of a deceased man returning
to his body is strange enough as it is.

179
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,246
And now that once virile creature
has suddenly gone missing.

180
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,459
It seems something is definitely going on.

181
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:59,088
There is no way Gangcheori
would back down so easily.

182
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,382
His feelings for you ran deep.

183
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,842
I am afraid.

184
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,012
I am so afraid that Gangcheori will

185
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,557
also end up like Bibi.

186
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,698
- Mother.
- Yes?

187
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,616
You must be tired. You should go and rest.

188
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,742
I'm not tired at all.

189
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,203
I've been full of energy all day.
I cannot sleep.

190
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,746
Mother.

191
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,499
I will go to my room soon.

192
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,209
I will…

193
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,295
I am just worried you might leave me again

194
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,630
while I sleep.

195
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,842
You should go to sleep.

196
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,760
Let me look at you a bit longer. Lie down.

197
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,688
That body will not remain yours.

198
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,565
It will not last long.

199
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,476
<i>You call yourself a patron deity?</i>

200
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,521
<i>How could you just abandon</i>
<i>your disciple and disappear like this?</i>

201
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,523
<i>You wretched, malevolent deity.</i>

202
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,069
<i>Fine. It is my time to be reckless now.</i>

203
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,906
<i>So, hurry up and come here to scold me.</i>

204
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,742
<i>Come and yell at me</i>

205
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,286
<i>for daring to use such a tone</i>
<i>with my sacred patron deity.</i>

206
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,001
<i>Even if you successfully save his soul</i>
<i>and bring him back to life,</i>

207
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,879
<i>nothing will change</i>
<i>until I ascend as a dragon.</i>

208
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,590
Even if you ardently hold him
in your heart,

209
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,550
I will never…

210
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,429
let you go.

211
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,141
<i>What happened to never letting me go?</i>

212
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,979
<i>You vanished without a word.</i>

213
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,398
<i>What do I do now?</i>

214
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,514
<i>Yeo-ri.</i>

215
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,354
Yeo-ri.

216
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,564
I am right here.

217
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,987
Damn Yoon Gap.

218
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,364
Release me at once.

219
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,658
Let me go.

220
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,501
No. You cannot go.

221
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,587
I cannot let you go to Yeo-ri.

222
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,965
I will not let you take her from me.

223
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,927
Let go of me already.

224
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,430
Yeo-ri is calling out for me.

225
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,810
Gangcheori.

226
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,021
I will never let you go.

227
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,607
I need to go!

228
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,900
You cannot!

229
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,234
Why can I not?

230
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,238
- Yeo-ri!
- What?

231
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:54,948
Gangcheori?

232
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,326
No, Yeo-ri.

233
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,036
It is I.

234
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,538
My lord.

235
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,499
This rascal is really something else…

236
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,888
It is my body. It belongs to me.

237
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,182
You may not move it as you wish.

238
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,852
<i>Gangcheori has been</i>
<i>in that body with His Lord?</i>

239
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,063
<i>How did this happen?</i>

240
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,565
How can you just claim
someone else's body like this?

241
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,777
Leave… my body at once!

242
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,655
Damn it.
I would have left it ages ago if I could.

243
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,616
Do you think I want to be stuck
in this wimpy, little body?

244
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,537
Did you think I would not know
you used this hand

245
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,330
to grab Yeo-ri's hand?

246
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,126
Well… I could not grab it with a foot.

247
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,920
A scholar must maintain
a pure and chaste demeanor.

248
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,339
You rascal have made
rags of all my clothes.

249
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,258
You consumed so many sweets.

250
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,885
You ruined my teeth,
just after a few months.

251
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,471
"Your body, hair, and skin
are a gift from your parents."

252
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,598
You have abused my parents' gift.

253
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,517
How dare you act so brazen?

254
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:07,771
Did you hear him?

255
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,774
He should be thanking me
for stopping his body from rotting.

256
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,152
What a pompous prig he is.
Just prattling on and on.

257
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,695
Prattle, prattle.

258
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,155
Enough.

259
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,118
Yeo-ri.

260
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,246
That was not meant for you, my lord.

261
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,707
Anyhow, you should stop it
as well, my lord.

262
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,459
This is not the time for quarreling.

263
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,881
Yeo-ri is right.

264
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,634
There is no way that dogged, wicked spirit
let you free for no reason.

265
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,262
What is he scheming?

266
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,477
My lord?

267
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,694
You were just prattling on
without any issue before.

268
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,113
Why are you suddenly silent like a mouse?

269
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,240
You…

270
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,202
What are you scheming right now?

271
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,547
That damn Imugi.

272
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,716
I thought he would easily hold out
for a few days.

273
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,469
But that damn Imugi was awakened already.

274
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:38,946
Gangcheori.

275
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,073
Gangcheori!

276
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,171
<i>Gangcheori and Lord Yoon Gap</i>
<i>are trapped in one body together.</i>

277
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,215
<i>How is this even possible?</i>

278
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,053
<i>The Eight-foot-tall Ghost</i>
<i>must be behind this.</i>

279
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,308
<i>It feels like he is using my lord</i>
<i>to plot something.</i>

280
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,727
<i>What should I do?</i>

281
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,274
That damn Imugi rascal…

282
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,120
Stop…

283
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,333
Stop it.

284
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,001
This is not mine.

285
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,003
That…

286
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,298
was intended for another.

287
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,405
<i>Nothing could have happened overnight…</i>

288
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,129
My goodness.

289
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:46,258
It appears our Gap is really back indeed.

290
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,178
Look at how neatly he folded his bedding.

291
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,806
Gap was always like this before.

292
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,725
He was only messy after he lost his mind.

293
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,144
He has always been this orderly.

294
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,652
<i>The Ghostbane Stone…</i>

295
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,903
What is wrong, Yeo-ri?

296
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,655
You're as pale as a ghost.

297
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,867
<i>His Lord wants the Ghostbane Stone?</i>

298
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,827
<i>Is it the Eight-foot-tall Ghost?</i>

299
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,663
My goodness.

300
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,039
What's wrong, Yeo-ri?

301
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:33,054
SINBU: A PASS FOR THE PALACE

302
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,189
<i>My lord, you cannot.</i>

303
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,399
- My goodness!
- I am sorry.

304
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,484
You should watch where you are going!

305
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,444
<i>My lord…</i>

306
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:50,572
My goodness, what am I going to do now?

307
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,956
Your Majesty, what are you writing?

308
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,168
I was struck with an excellent idea

309
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:06,588
after hearing your thoughts
on the slave reform plans yesterday.

310
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,381
Step up here for a moment.

311
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,145
Here. Take a look.

312
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:36,034
I am honored to have you record
my humble opinion in such a manner.

313
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,328
I am most obliged.

314
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,415
I have been struck with another one.

315
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,672
Goodness me.

316
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,425
Yeo-ri insisted with such zeal

317
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,470
that I keep this with me at all times,
so I have.

318
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:59,266
But it is just impossible
to get any writing done with it.

319
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:12,904
<i>My lord.</i>

320
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,447
<i>Please.</i>

321
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,119
Yes, so if we proceed as such,

322
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,997
the people do not need to worry
about being implicated as slaves

323
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,835
and public sentiment toward the king
waning will not be a concern.

324
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,297
Both the state and private domains
will be content.

325
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:40,890
<i>No!</i>

326
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,723
Be careful, Your Majesty.

327
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,892
The bottle has completely shattered.

328
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,393
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

329
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,900
Are you all right?

330
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,110
Damn it.

331
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,196
My goodness.

332
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,114
Sure.

333
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,509
What in the world is this?

334
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,804
Is this alcohol?

335
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:01,971
Sang-deuk!

336
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,765
- Hurry. This bottle shattered.
- Yes, my lord.

337
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:11,898
Stop right there!

338
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,403
Please let me take care of it!

339
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,329
My lord?

340
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,291
Gangcheori!

341
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,178
My lord.

342
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,179
Stay back, Yeo-ri.

343
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,684
Do not look at me.

344
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,104
Unbeknownst to me,

345
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,567
I grew resentful of my stolen life
and my heart grew wicked.

346
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,194
I fell for his ruse.

347
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,072
He said my body would be mine if I spilled
alcohol on the Ghostbane Stone.

348
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,119
I let my heart grow beastly.

349
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,664
You are wrong.

350
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,295
I was not the one who grabbed your hand
in that last moment.

351
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,546
It was you.

352
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,466
<i>No!</i>

353
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,218
You…

354
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,637
did not let your heart grow wicked.

355
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,808
It does not change the fact
I was initially willing

356
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,728
to do that to His Majesty.

357
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,647
I…

358
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,902
tried to harm His Majesty.

359
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,738
If I continue,

360
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,740
I will end up betraying His Majesty

361
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,785
and become a sinner condemned by history

362
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,789
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
has me by the throat

363
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,208
and we do not know
how he will use me next time.

364
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,044
Before…

365
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,214
I become a detestable, evil spirit,

366
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,842
you must let me go.

367
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,012
Yeo-ri.

368
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,059
Please guide me to the afterlife.

369
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,104
My lord.

370
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,374
That moron.

371
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,920
I offer him a chance to reclaim his body
for good and he still refuses.

372
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,547
But it does not matter.

373
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,966
Things have gotten a bit messy,

374
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,511
but now we know the Ghostbane Stone
was what was in the Warrior Deity's way.

375
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,430
Getting rid of that will be a breeze.

376
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,316
My goodness. You are home early today.

377
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,069
The food is all done. Hurry and wash up.

378
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,571
Gap.

379
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,913
Why…

380
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,374
are you here?

381
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,043
What happened to my Gap?

382
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,004
Why are you back?

383
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,758
Yeo-ri.

384
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,303
This is not my Gap.

385
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,806
He is not my Gap!

386
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,312
Where is my Gap? Why are you back?

387
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:42,233
What did you do to my poor boy?
Why are you back here?

388
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,323
My poor Gap… My son…

389
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,911
Please return my Gap to me.

390
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,831
Please return him to me.

391
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,003
Please return my Gap to me.
Please, I beg you.

392
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,216
I am sorry, Mother.

393
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,844
Where did my Gap go?

394
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,012
I am truly sorry.

395
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,684
My Gap! Give me back my son!

396
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,732
Return him to me. Please…

397
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,778
<i>An ablution rite.</i>

398
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,032
<i>A ceremony that cleanses the soul.</i>

399
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,285
<i>Through this ceremony, Lord Yoon Gap…</i>

400
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,456
<i>will wash away</i>

401
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,126
<i>all the karma from his lifetime.</i>

402
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,505
The spirit of the deceased Yoon Gap
we wish to guide today.

403
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,592
Of all endeavors to cleanse
the three karmic deeds,

404
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,638
nothing exceeds
the purification of the heart

405
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,308
and when it comes
to the purification of all things,

406
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:43,104
nothing compares to pure water.

407
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,406
<i>In accordance with</i>
<i>The sacred law of the Buddha</i>

408
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,826
<i>The ritual altar of ablution</i>
<i>Has been prepared</i>

409
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,911
<i>May the soul of the deceased Yoon Gap</i>

410
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,998
<i>Be cleansed of defilement,</i>

411
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,792
<i>All at once</i>

412
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:10,006
<i>May he attain unchanging purity</i>

413
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:15,428
<i>And ascend to rebirth</i>

414
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:22,310
<i>In the Pure Land</i>

415
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,030
<i>Now,</i>

416
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,742
<i>His Lord has…</i>

417
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,889
My lord.

418
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,271
I am sorry.

419
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,571
Yeo-ri.

420
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,407
You are not to blame for my death.

421
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,827
If it becomes your fault,

422
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,788
my intentions in fighting
for His Majesty's noble cause

423
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,040
becomes meaningless.

424
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,794
Though I am saddened,

425
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,380
I have no regrets about my life.

426
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,138
Yeo-ri.

427
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,143
Is my Gap here?

428
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,438
He is, is he not?

429
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,190
Gap.

430
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,902
Gap!

431
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,906
Gap, please don't go.

432
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,952
Don't leave me here alone.

433
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,746
Gap…

434
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:09,625
Mother…

435
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,005
Gap, please don't go.

436
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,012
Mother.

437
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,097
Thank you for giving birth to me.

438
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,560
Living as your son

439
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,315
was my greatest joy.

440
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:33,292
YOON GAP

441
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,223
Yoon Gap…

442
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,729
has left us in the end.

443
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:04,740
YOON GAP

444
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,169
Why did you not tell Yeo-ri?

445
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,547
You also had feelings for her.

446
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,759
She has already given
her heart to another.

447
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,095
If I tell her,
just to satisfy my own greed,

448
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,724
I will only end up distressing her.

449
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,934
How annoyingly cool you are.

450
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,022
Have a safe journey.

451
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,775
For you led a beautifully steadfast life
like that of an evergreen pine,

452
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,153
you will move on to a peaceful place.

453
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,196
Please take good care…

454
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,493
of Mother and Yeo-ri.

455
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,379
Have you lost your mind?

456
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,214
How could you ask me to do such a thing?

457
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,509
I am going to end up losing my head
as a heinous traitor

458
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,220
before that Imugi ever has
a chance at my throat.

459
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,600
Then, are you saying you cannot do it?

460
00:39:56,018 --> 00:40:00,439
How could anyone sane
do such things to the King and the Prince?

461
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,440
Se-won.

462
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,818
Grab the bottles. We are done here.

463
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,619
What do you think you are doing right now?

464
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:17,164
I know I am blind, but I always believed
I had a good eye for judging character.

465
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,207
Maybe not.

466
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,627
I should continue my search for someone

467
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,087
with greater mental fortitude.

468
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,758
This nation might be small, but surely,

469
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,761
there must be at least one other
for the Chief State Councillor's seat.

470
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,556
Hold on… Stop.

471
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,120
Those are some mighty callused hands.

472
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,081
Do you know how to wield a sword?

473
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,083
Pardon?

474
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,003
The Warrior Deity is
quite pleased with you.

475
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,052
Your Majesty!

476
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,597
Your Highness.

477
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,682
- Oh, my!
- You got it, Your Highness.

478
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:52,927
Gwang's legs have become
much stronger since last we played.

479
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:57,515
I almost found it difficult
to keep up with his running.

480
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,644
In a matter of a few months,

481
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,396
he had another growth spurt.

482
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,982
It has been a year already, not months.

483
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,151
Pardon?

484
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,154
It has been over a year
since His Majesty played

485
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,281
a game like that with the Prince.

486
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,205
Has it been a year already?

487
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,748
Yes.

488
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,710
It appears I have been
quite a heartless father.

489
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,511
Ma'am.

490
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,763
We are heading out now.

491
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,727
Do not skip any meals.
Be sure to eat well.

492
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,364
Let's go.

493
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,661
Come on.

494
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:51,378
She knows you are not Lord Yoon Gap now.

495
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,049
It would be too cruel to her

496
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,052
if we stay here.

497
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,321
Pardon? You only have one room left?

498
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:22,076
The merchants here for the market tomorrow
have filled up the rest.

499
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,828
It is also the smallest room
in the corner.

500
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,747
Do you still want it?

501
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,132
Well?

502
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,642
What are we going to do tomorrow?
We cannot continue sleeping at taverns.

503
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:49,144
Ask that King to buy you a house.

504
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,271
You have saved his family
countless times already.

505
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,273
It is one order after the other
without reward.

506
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,109
You deserve a few houses, at least.

507
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,611
Then, you should talk to His Majesty.

508
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,614
Even if it is not a mansion,

509
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,825
a small two-room house
would be more than enough.

510
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,930
Yoon Gap must have…

511
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,100
crossed the River of the Afterlife by now.

512
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,311
Yes.

513
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,565
Your initial reason to face
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost is now gone.

514
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,276
Right.

515
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,902
And yet…

516
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,363
you will continue to pursue him?

517
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,120
You are right.

518
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,456
It started with Lord Yoon Gap.

519
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,502
But my grandma still remains his captive.

520
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,254
Regardless of everything else,

521
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,590
I know now.

522
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,426
I know this is what I must do.

523
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,347
And I also pity the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
for suffering so,

524
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,517
while letting his grudge fester

525
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,228
for all those years.

526
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,940
I want to purify and free Cheon Geum-hwi

527
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,193
from his pain and suffering,

528
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,404
along with the countless grudges

529
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,782
of the villagers of Yongdam

530
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:27,993
that remain tied to him.

531
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,667
Why do you remain by the door?

532
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,211
Come in. You will catch a cold.

533
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,340
No. I like it here just fine.

534
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,386
You do not need to know. Just trust me.

535
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,143
Why? Are you scared I will devour you?

536
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,605
You can sleep on that side.

537
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,358
You are surprisingly naive sometimes.
Did you know that?

538
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,457
You dare refer
to your sacred patron deity as naive?

539
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,794
Do you want to see how naive

540
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,213
I could really be?

541
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:23,549
No, thanks.

542
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,722
If I ask you…

543
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,934
to let it all go and run away with me…

544
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,146
would you?

545
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,613
Now, I cannot return this body to Yoon Gap

546
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,242
and I still have no way to escape it,

547
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,285
so maybe…

548
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,912
I just embrace it

549
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,915
and postpone all that ascension business.

550
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,375
Maybe…

551
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,003
I just become an ordinary mortal.

552
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,381
How would you like
to live 100 years with me?

553
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:27,070
How could we even run
without dealing with that damn ghost?

554
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,239
Wherever we go,

555
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:32,117
he would follow us with vindictive intent.

556
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,746
I was not being serious.

557
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:36,747
Gangcheori.

558
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:38,915
I…

559
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,840
You two aren't wed yet.

560
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:50,010
You should not be sharing a room already.

561
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,012
Come on.

562
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,444
Day will break at this rate.

563
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,404
Let us get a move on.

564
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,531
Yes, ma'am.

565
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,997
Why did she wait
if she was going to drag us

566
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,457
back in the dead of night anyway--

567
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:26,630
Exactly. Why did you have to choose
a tavern in the middle of nowhere

568
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:30,050
and make me search the whole Capital
in the dead of night?

569
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,260
- What is she saying?
- Shush.

570
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,263
Unbelievable.

571
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,613
- Did you find out?
- Yes.

572
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,075
His Majesty plans
to go outside the Capital.

573
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,662
Outside the Capital?

574
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:00,706
Where exactly?

575
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,040
I am unsure of the details.

576
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,584
He has always been quite secretive.

577
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,046
However, I hear
the Queen Dowager, the Queen,

578
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,507
and even the Prince is to accompany him.

579
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,801
I, too, am to accompany the royal guards.

580
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,386
I shall report back in detail afterward.

581
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:30,068
SPIRIT TABLET OF THE LATE CHEON GEUM-HWI

582
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:46,209
Have Yeo-ri and Imugi Gangcheori arrived?

583
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:51,298
They said they would go directly
to Jinseung Temple with Venerable Gaseop.

584
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,887
We should head out as well.

585
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:03,477
Your Highness,
His Majesty is here for you.

586
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,275
Your Majesty.

587
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,944
What brings you to the Queen's Palace?

588
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,406
No matter how hard I think it over,

589
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,700
I believe this is right.

590
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,749
Your Majesty,
is that not the Ghostbane Stone?

591
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,752
Why are you giving it to me?

592
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,962
You also carry a member

593
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,049
of the royal bloodline in your womb.

594
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,803
Furthermore, the ghost
has targeted you once before.

595
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,888
Hence, you should hold onto it.

596
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,598
No, Your Majesty.

597
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,811
Your Majesty's safety comes before mine
or that of the unborn child.

598
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,897
At today's passage rite,

599
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,527
I will be making a plea for forgiveness
to the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

600
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,904
on behalf of my ancestors
who greatly wronged him.

601
00:51:55,987 --> 00:52:00,200
However, if I approach him
with the very thing that repels him,

602
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,661
that would be duplicitous.

603
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,719
CHEON GEUM-HWI

604
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:32,107
Grandma.

605
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,317
Are you performing an afterlife ritual?

606
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:37,821
Yes.

607
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,824
It appears the top house
across the bridge,

608
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,994
is dealing with a troublesome evil spirit.

609
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:48,164
Why did you stick an identification tablet
and a talisman inside your overcoat?

610
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,338
When you do,

611
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,924
a shaman can summon the Grim Reaper

612
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,344
to take the evil spirit directly
to the underworld.

613
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:06,308
The Grim Reaper needs a clear record
that contains the name

614
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:08,143
and the date of death for the deceased.

615
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,021
However,

616
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,064
this method

617
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:16,526
does not relieve the grudge of the ghost

618
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,112
and…

619
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,407
the shaman could instantly die

620
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,868
if things go awry.

621
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:26,620
It must…

622
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,539
It must be used as a last resort.

623
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,667
What if you end up dying instantly?

624
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,630
For I know
that evil spirit's true identity,

625
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,798
I will be fine.

626
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,394
Look!

627
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,980
The caragana has blossomed.

628
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,609
The buds were definitely tightly shut
just last night,

629
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,110
but this morning,

630
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,571
I saw that they all fully bloomed.

631
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,867
Since you made a special request of me,

632
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,161
I ran over as soon as I saw them.

633
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,412
My lady!

634
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,539
You should not scurry off like that.

635
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,875
It will only get me in trouble later.

636
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:17,545
When did I scurry off?

637
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,422
You are just a slow walker.

638
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,590
Damn it.

639
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,178
Thanks.

640
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:27,639
My lord.

641
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:31,518
This is exactly why I said we should just
forget about that rotten jerk…

642
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,479
now.

643
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,611
<i>As if they were scheduled,</i>

644
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:45,448
<i>the flowers just happened to bloom</i>
<i>on the 100th anniversary</i>

645
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,866
<i>of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost's birth.</i>

646
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,995
You did not even like coming
to the palace from the start.

647
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:52,789
You came because of me.

648
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:57,293
I am already plenty thankful
for all that you have done.

649
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,671
<i>Yeo-ri already knows that</i>

650
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,257
<i>in order to</i>
<i>banish the Eight-foot-tall Ghost</i>

651
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:05,135
<i>the luminous pearl</i>
<i>must be completely drained.</i>

652
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,528
<i>With her temperament,</i>

653
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:27,240
<i>she will do something reckless</i>
<i>to keep me out of harm's way.</i>

654
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,200
<i>Hence, this will just be</i>

655
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,954
<i>a precaution,</i>
<i>in case Yeo-ri ends up in peril.</i>

attain Buddhahood.

668

Something feels off.
Something has gone amiss.

672
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:20,955
Stay back.

673
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,126
- Stop him!
- Keep His Majesty safe!

674
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,783
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty…

675
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,571
