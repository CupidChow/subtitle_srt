1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,420
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,550
Don't…

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,630
Stay still, I say.

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,350
You could barely wipe it due to the pain.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,350
Gosh.

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,180
Just stop it!

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,900
Do you know
what the most infuriating thing is?

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,780
My grandma must be suffering right now
within the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,490
Her futile death still breaks my heart.

11
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,740
Yet…

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,080
deep in my heart…

13
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,620
I am relieved.

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,670
So relieved that you were not the one

15
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,300
who did that to my grandma.

16
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,430
That was the first thought I had.

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,140
I was relieved to find out

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,350
that I no longer have to feel guilty
about being attracted to you.

19
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,400
That thought was all…

20
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,690
You--
How is this even possible?

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,360
How can someone be so wretched?

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
I think

23
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,040
your mother is awake.

24
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,380
Right.

25
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
You should check on her.

26
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,680
Call me if you need me.

27
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,220
Oh… Me?

28
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,060
I should go inside? Now?

29
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,730
Yes, you should. Go on.

30
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
Go inside…

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
I will go inside.

32
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,760
My child, are you all right?

33
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,010
I am fine.

34
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,050
Did you get hurt badly earlier?
Let me see.

35
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,390
I told you I'm fine.

36
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,810
Thank goodness.

37
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,520
Do you know how shocked I was?

38
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,190
Why in the world
did that lord do that to you?

39
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,770
What sort of bitterness toward you

40
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,780
drove him to even kidnap me
and put you through all that danger?

41
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,320
He wasn't seriously hurt, right?

42
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,070
Even one slipup with such a nobleman

43
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,990
leaves people like us in ruins.

44
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,540
There is nothing to worry about.

45
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,710
He will never come after you again.

46
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,710
Gap.

47
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,130
Just forget civil service.

48
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,880
Can you not just come up
with an excuse and quit?

49
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,050
I wish you would just quit,

50
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,060
so you, Yeo-ri, and I can just go back
to Yongdam Village together.

51
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,520
How many times
have you risked your life already?

52
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,980
Living is not that complicated.

53
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,690
The years pass by just like that.

54
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,650
So…

55
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,910
grab the hand of the one
you hold in your heart

56
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,780
and embrace the affection you share.

57
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,370
That is the best way to live.

58
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,240
All right?

59
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,090
Did you say this talisman

60
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,550
was crafted by the noble elder
of the blind association?

61
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,170
Yes, my lord.

62
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,760
They say everyone has been lining up
for this talisman.

63
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,650
I cannot believe
the esteemed Minister of War

64
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,070
has come all this way
to our squalid corner of the world.

65
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,780
Unlike the others,

66
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,030
I am not here to make a request.

67
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,700
I--

68
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,830
Are you not here
because of Examiner Yoon Gap?

69
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,960
You must be curious how the Haeilbu
talisman managed to stop him

70
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,840
and his otherworldly powers.

71
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,800
How… How did you know?

72
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,970
He is

73
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,880
an Imugi.

74
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,260
What did you say?

75
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,810
What do you mean he is an Imugi?

76
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,350
Imugis possess luminous pearls
inside their bodies.

77
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,270
Those pearls hold wondrous power.

78
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,520
Blasting someone off with the wind
is a cinch for a holder of the pearl.

79
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,900
Was that how that scoundrel
came back from the dead?

80
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,570
You must keep that talisman
with you at all times.

81
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,610
Also…

82
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,120
if you ever have to face him,

83
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,660
use that against him.

84
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
What is up with you?

85
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,010
Why are you glowing like a newlywed?

86
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,390
What is it?

87
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,770
Yeo-ri…

88
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,070
said she likes me.

89
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,820
What?

90
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,490
Are you some sort of dummy? A half-wit?

91
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,370
Do you not know that mortals
are easily dazzled by what they see?

92
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,960
Do you actually think she likes you?

93
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,880
She likes that body you are in.

94
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,790
That's why she is also confused.

95
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,300
What could you possibly expect
from a mortal?

96
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,260
Did it ever occur to you
that you would only end up hurt?

97
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,300
You may be right.

98
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,100
However,

99
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,850
she saw me for the first time.

100
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,440
That is what I will be
focusing on for now.

101
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,820
Also, I have a dependable brother-in-arms
like you by my side.

102
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,650
How could I get hurt?

103
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,530
Do not worry.

104
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,030
I shall catch you a rascal with
a belly full of spite for you to devour.

105
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,280
Goodness me,
you should take the day off today.

106
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,120
You went through hell yesterday.

107
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,410
You never know what might happen.

108
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,120
What if that man tries to harm Yeo-ri?

109
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,340
That's why you two always stick
by each other's side, starting today.

110
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,510
Take good care of Yeo-ri.

111
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,560
We should go.
All right.

112
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,850
Go on. Follow after her.

113
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,110
Always stick together!

114
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,530
What a cute couple.

115
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,900
Adorable.

116
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,300
Oh, right. Your mother…

117
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,510
She mentioned that
you knew her captor well. Do you?

118
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,970
That woman must have imagined it
amidst all the chaos.

119
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
I did not recognize him.

120
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,930
Then, why did a stranger
go after you and your mother…

121
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,560
It means the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
is no longer our only foe.

122
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,230
We have been found out
by the King's political adversaries.

123
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,070
Do not worry.

124
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,200
As long as you are by my side,

125
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,950
no one will even lay a finger on you.

126
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,250
Hence, you must never leave my side.

127
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,330
Understand?

128
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,920
Oh! Wild chrysanthemums.

129
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,470
Wild chrysanthemums?

130
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,140
I guess they still need
a few more days to bloom.

131
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,950
They have all bloomed already.

132
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,190
His Majesty commanded
you wait for him here.

133
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,570
Yes, my lord.

134
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,820
What now? What is it?

135
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,110
This must be

136
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,410
Lord Yoon Gap's brush.

137
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,040
YOON GAP

138
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,290
That is right.

139
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,210
Examiner Yoon Gap
used that very brush in this library.

140
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,800
Your Majesty,

141
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,720
have you been praying
for Lord Yoon Gap's soul?

142
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,020
No one in the world knows of his death.

143
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,690
I thought I should at least offer
my prayers for his soul.

144
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,030
I am sure Examiner Yoon Gap is
also grateful for Your Majesty's prayers.

145
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,200
Could I take you returning here today

146
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,160
to mean you will continue helping me

147
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,580
with my undertaking?

148
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,380
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost is
my grandmother's sworn enemy as well.

149
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,800
I am certain her soul
remains captive under it.

150
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,170
To ensure my grandmother's soul
rests in peace,

151
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,220
I will see to it that
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost crosses over.

152
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,180
All right.

153
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,600
I was informed by the clerk officer

154
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,480
that you also faced hardships yesterday.

155
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,520
Yes… sir.

156
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,110
"Yes, sir"?

157
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,940
Did you just say, "Yes, sir"?

158
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,240
Yes, sir.

159
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,620
I am certain I did, sir.

160
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,580
I heard it as well. "Yes, sir."

161
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,300
You are a deity

162
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,010
and I am a mere king.

163
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,510
Yet, you show me such respect?

164
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,720
You may be a mere king,

165
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,300
but you commendably saved Yeo-ri's life.

166
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,510
A king who cherishes his people

167
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,430
deserves a certain level of respect.

168
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,310
Forget it, you rascal.

169
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,520
If that is your idea of respect,
do not bother.

170
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,570
Well, that effort was wasted.
Forget it then.

171
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,410
So, were you able to get a look

172
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,200
at your attackers?

173
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,410
I did, but I did not recognize
any of them.

174
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,540
They kidnapped Yeo-ri

175
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,590
and Yoon Gap's mother simultaneously
to leave me incapacitated.

176
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,960
They plotted to tear Yeo-ri and me apart.

177
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,470
So, they got together to conspire.

178
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,590
The man who took me away
definitely claimed

179
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,180
Chief State Councillor Kim Bong-in
had summoned me.

180
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,270
But His Lord has stated
that he never sent anyone for you.

181
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,770
He just denies it and walks free?

182
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,570
Are you protecting your grandfather?

183
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,400
I also confirmed that His Lord
was in the palace at that time.

184
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,450
As you allege,

185
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,660
His Lord indeed
could have done such a thing,

186
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,280
but, conversely,
someone could be framing him

187
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,330
because he is one of my supporters.

188
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,900
My lord.

189
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,650
He has arrived.

190
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,110
All right. Let him in.

191
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,420
I am Yi Hwa-seong from Onsu-gol, Chungju.

192
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,750
My lord, you are second only to the King.

193
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,710
May I ask why you summoned me here?

194
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,670
You may lift your head.

195
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,510
Was your great-great-grandfather not
Prince Hopyeong,

196
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,220
King Yeonjong's younger brother?

197
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,640
Then, why do you present
yourself in such a manner

198
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,810
when you are of royal descent?

199
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,730
Royal descent?
I am unworthy of such a title.

200
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,400
I am not even of a collateral line.

201
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,900
I am well aware you rely on the needlework
of your widowed mother to keep afloat

202
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,990
and for the past several years,

203
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,580
you failed to even pass the first round
of the civil service examination.

204
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,330
How did you--

205
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,870
If you just do as I say,

206
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,830
you will be able to leave
that outcast existence behind.

207
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,800
What do you say?

208
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,970
Will you do as I say?

209
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,640
You say there are
no evil spirits in this nation?

210
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

211
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,190
My grandmother repeatedly said that
to me in her lifetime.

212
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,230
What does that mean?

213
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,440
Is the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
not an evil spirit?

214
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,070
That evil spirit is responsible
for all the tragedies of the royal family.

215
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,360
How could there be no evil spirits?

216
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,120
It means no evil spirit commits evil deeds
unprovoked and without reason.

217
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,240
That is to say,

218
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,910
there are only
vengeful spirits with grudges

219
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,960
that commit evil deeds to resolve them.

220
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,250
Vengeful spirits?

221
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,630
Then, does that mean

222
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,010
if the grudge of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
is resolved,

223
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,760
it will be able to cross over?

224
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,260
That is correct.

225
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,550
So far, we have utilized
various ad hoc measures to banish it,

226
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,390
but none of them
offered a lasting solution.

227
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,560
It is because we were not applying
the right method.

228
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,850
The right method?

229
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,900
There is only one proper method.

230
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,110
We must expose the true identity
of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

231
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,860
and resolve its grudge.

232
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,570
But,

233
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,660
how will you expose its true identity?

234
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,870
The only thing we know about it

235
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,200
is that it was burned to death
to become an ember ghost.

236
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,580
Perhaps,

237
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,460
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost was
a military officer in its lifetime?

238
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,000
A military officer?

239
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,010
Why do you think that?

240
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,390
The combat skills Your Majesty displayed
while being possessed by it

241
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,140
were extraordinary.

242
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,690
A military officer…

243
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,280
Finding out its true identity

244
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,120
will be the first step
in the correct method to banish it.

245
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:54,620
I will search for any small clue
that may help reveal its true identity.

246
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,670
Proceed as such.

247
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,880
I shall do all I can to help.

248
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,470
That damn quack monk claimed
the luminous pearl had to be drained

249
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,430
for the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
to be banished.

250
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,930
Even if its true identity is exposed,

251
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,180
it will all be useless
without the luminous pearl.

252
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,390
Then, we shall now take our leave.

253
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,240
Hello?

254
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,420
Goodness. Why are you grabbing his hand?
Let us go.

255
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,630
All right.

256
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,250
What is with the hand-holding?

257
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,550
How grotesquely indecent!

258
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,630
Why that…

259
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,200
YOON GAP

260
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,820
My lord, are you all right?

261
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,030
Has he committed
another impropriety toward you?

262
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,030
Yoon Gap, you scoundrel…

263
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,250
What are you scheming?

264
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,340
We ask the Ten Kings of the Underworld
To aid the spirit

265
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,300
Of the late Grand Prince Yeongin
Born in the Year of the Earth Pig

266
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,970
Please grant his soul

267
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:19,060
Passage to the Pure Land
And rebirth in eternal peace

268
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,810
Homage to the First Great King Jingwang

269
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,360
We humbly plead with you
To relieve his grudge

270
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,480
Homage to the Second Great King Chogang

271
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,200
We humbly plead with you
To relieve his grudge

272
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,490
Homage to the Third Great King Songje

273
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,030
We humbly plead with you
To relieve his grudge

274
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,200
Homage to the Fourth Great King Ogwan

275
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,200
We humbly plead with you
To relieve his grudge

276
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,790
Homage to the Fifth Great King Yeomna

277
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,000
We humbly plead with you
To relieve his grudge

278
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,210
Homage to the Sixth Great King Byeonseong

279
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,840
We humbly plead with you
To relieve his grudge

280
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,550
Homage to the Seventh Great King Taesan

281
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,590
We humbly plead with you
To relieve his grudge…

282
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,430
Your Grace.

283
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,850
Today concludes
the Ceremony of Passage for the Deceased.

284
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,730
I am sure Prince Yeongin

285
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,440
has now peacefully crossed
the River of the Afterlife.

286
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,280
Your efforts are appreciated.

287
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,200
However, who was that young man earlier?

288
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,700
He was earnestly praying
for Prince Yeongin.

289
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,250
I did not recognize him at all.

290
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,330
He is Yi Hwa-seong,
great-great-grandson of Prince Hopyeong.

291
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,670
He was so heartbroken
to hear about Prince Yeongin's passing,

292
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,090
he personally made an ardent plea
to be a part of the ceremony.

293
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,890
Is that so?
Yes, Your Grace.

294
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,470
He has a pure mind
and conducts himself with integrity.

295
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,680
He appears to be
an excellent candidate to oversee

296
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,440
Prince Yeongin's memorial rites
since there is no living heir.

297
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,320
Ask him to come by the palace
to read me a book.

298
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,650
I must observe him more closely.

299
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,030
Yes, Your Grace.

300
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,160
I shall carry out your command.

301
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,680
Myeongdu, the mirror that reveals spirits.

302
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,720
I am certain Yeo-ri used this

303
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,810
to neutralize the talisman back then.

304
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,610
What are you doing here?

305
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,120
Nothing at all.

306
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,230
For some odd reason,

307
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,730
it seems Yoon Gap has kept silent
about yesterday's incident.

308
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,360
He is unusually quiet.

309
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,450
It seems he kept it from the King as well.

310
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,570
If he had reported it,

311
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,620
the King would not be this quiet.

312
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,040
I reinforced security, just in case.

313
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,870
Well done.

314
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,920
Keep an eye on him.

315
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,340
If you notice anything strange,

316
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,300
report back to me immediately.

317
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,420
Yes, my lord.

318
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,770
Is anyone out there?

319
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,070
Who are you?

320
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,340
How dare you show up here?

321
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,280
You damn rat! Die!

322
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,130
You damn scoundrel…

323
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,880
Please spare me.

324
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,300
I will grant you whatever you wish.

325
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,640
Just please…

326
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,850
There is only one thing I desire from you.

327
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,020
What is it?

328
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,560
Your life.

329
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,280
What?

330
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,650
Oh, there is one more thing.

331
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,320
At the very least,

332
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,280
you should apologize to Yoon Gap
who died by your hand.

333
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,660
I knew it.

334
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,290
You are not Yoon Gap.

335
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,290
So, you are…

336
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,600
What did you say?

337
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,770
The Minister of War
suddenly passed last night?

338
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

339
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,730
That is not possible.

340
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,440
He was in robust health.

341
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,610
How could he end up like that,
all of a sudden?

342
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,700
They say he passed in his sleep.

343
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,620
My lord…
He had already stopped breathing

344
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,790
when the maidservant
discovered him in the morning.

345
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,670
The Minister of War…

346
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,540
How could he die such a meaningless death?

347
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,840
This has been happening
quite frequently as of late.

348
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,010
Old vassals have been meeting

349
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,220
cruel and unnatural ends
in the dead of night.

350
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,930
Your Majesty, actually…

351
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,930
You may speak up.

352
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,060
I heard a rumor recently.

353
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,740
They say that an Imugi
has been going around

354
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,650
and devouring elderly noblemen.

355
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,700
Could this mean

356
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,950
Gangcheori was responsible?

357
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,740
Yoon Gap…

358
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,790
Did he kill the Minister of War?

359
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,670
That is utterly preposterous.

360
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,710
Who would believe such a thing?

361
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,130
No, no. I certainly do not
believe it to be true,

362
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,340
but I hear a lot of the noblemen
in the capital are seeking out

363
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,180
the noble elder of the blind association

364
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,390
to avoid unforeseen calamity.

365
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,270
I hear they believe carrying around
a talisman from him

366
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,850
is enough to keep them safe
from such misfortune.

367
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,270
Here we are again with him.

368
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,730
The noble elder of the blind association…

369
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,280
I cannot help but feel discordant.

370
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,950
For the past 13 years,
I mulled over the coup he instigated

371
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,870
and I have vowed to myself,
time and again,

372
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,040
to see that he is properly punished.

373
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,460
However, he just met
the most futile death.

374
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,510
Your Majesty.

375
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,880
Provide them with what they need
for the funeral

376
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,680
and follow protocol to process it.

377
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,550
Yes, Your Majesty.

378
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,510
I shall carry out your command.

379
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,200
Who are you and why were you
in the Queen Dowager's Palace?

380
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,950
Your Majesty.

381
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,330
I am the great-great-grandson
of Prince Hopyeong.

382
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,710
Yi Hwa-seong is my name.

383
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,330
Prince Hopyeong?

384
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,010
As in King Yeonjong's brother?

385
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

386
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,140
I came to the palace
because Her Grace summoned me.

387
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,390
I see.

388
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,060
You may leave now.

389
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,400
It appears the Queen Dowager
has chosen that sad excuse of a man

390
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,820
to replace Prince Yeongin.

391
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,500
Your Majesty, what is the matter?

392
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,610
Did I leave it like this last time?

393
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,040
My goodness, where is my head?

394
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,170
We are completely out of rice. Sheesh.

395
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,340
I will go and pick up some barley.

396
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,960
No, that is all right, Yeo-ri.

397
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,470
You worked hard to make that money
with your glasses. Save it.

398
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,050
And Gap is receiving
his three-month salary today.

399
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,220
It may not be much, but it is enough
to keep the three of us fed. Do not worry.

400
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,180
All right.

401
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,060
But why is that rascal not home yet?

402
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,810
I'm not sure.

403
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,940
He told me to go on ahead
because he needed to stop by somewhere.

404
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,030
Did he?

405
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,900
Gosh. I should at least
make some porridge.

406
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,000
Come on and take a look.
I will be generous with the servings.

407
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,500
Here.
Can you give me another?

408
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,920
Sure. Coming right up.

409
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,470
How much is one piece of pumpkin taffy?

410
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,600
Hello, sir. It is one pun per piece.

411
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,220
One… pun?

412
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,310
Yes, sir.

413
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,600
I thought this salary was meager at best,

414
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,520
but 15 nyang come out to 1,500 pun.

415
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,320
So, 1,500 pieces of pumpkin taffy!

416
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,570
Up until now, I had to suck up

417
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,610
an exorbitant amount
just for a few pieces.

418
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,200
Now, I can lavishly eat
ten pieces a day without worrying.

419
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,210
This must be why mortals
go so crazy for money.

420
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,590
How many would you like?

421
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,260
I will be right back. Stay put.

422
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,010
You must not sell out.
Yes, sir.

423
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,980
Welcome. Feel free to look around
as much as you wish.

424
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,600
I will take that pair.

425
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,520
Are you referring to these?

426
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,650
No.

427
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,360
The ones embroidered
with the longevity emblems.

428
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,280
These are quite pricey.

429
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,370
I just received my salary today.

430
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,170
How much could those possibly cost?

431
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,670
Yes, sir. I will wrap them up for you.

432
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,980
This is quite well-made.

433
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,310
I will take this, too.

434
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,530
Are you sure?

435
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,070
There you go again.
I told you I just got paid today.

436
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,280
I can even buy 1,500 pieces
of pumpkin taffy if I wish. That I can.

437
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,120
Yes, sir.

438
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,830
It feels like I have been swindled.

439
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,920
How could I

440
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,460
only be left with enough
to buy five pieces of taffy?

441
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,510
Why are maidens' shoes
and hairpins so expensive?

442
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,430
Master, I told you.
We need to go that way.

443
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,510
We were just there.
What is this now?

444
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,100
Is that Gaseop?

445
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,430
What is that rascal doing here?

446
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,940
No, we need to…

447
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,190
Master, wait!
Damn it.

448
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,940
Wait, stop!

449
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,200
No. Stop. Goodness me!

450
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,660
What is going on?
Why is that wretched monk in the capital?

451
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,120
Sheesh! You scared me.

452
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Why are you alone?

453
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Where is the giant?

454
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,670
Give me some, too.

455
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,380
Give you what?

456
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,970
How did you even know?

457
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,440
Got… you!

458
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,360
What the… Where did you pop up from?

459
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,610
Let go of me.

460
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,280
Damn quack monk.

461
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,040
Gosh, am I happy to see you!

462
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,540
Do you know how many times I circled
the capital looking for your house?

463
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,790
Master.

464
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,340
We will not be sleeping
on the streets tonight!

465
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,260
It is so nice to see you. Just delightful.

466
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,010
Stop smiling! Stop laughing! Damn it.

467
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,560
We have finally arrived.

468
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
Venerable!

469
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,480
What brings you here?
When did you arrive in the capital?

470
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,360
I came because I had
something to give you.

471
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,280
You do not know how many hardships

472
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,490
we have been through in the last few days
looking for this house.

473
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,330
I see. Come inside.

474
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,450
My goodness! Look who it is!
Hello, Venerable!

475
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,710
Hello, Venerable! Have you been well?

476
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:04,710
My goodness. I am so happy to see you two.
It feels like a holiday.

477
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,210
I apologize for imposing.

478
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,920
Do not be silly.

479
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,420
Gap actually got paid today.

480
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,510
We'll be able to show you
some proper hospitality.

481
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,220
Excellent. Let us go inside, Master.

482
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,390
This way.
All right.

483
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,940
So…

484
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,110
you just spent every last bit

485
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,990
of your three-month salary to buy this?

486
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,120
Well…

487
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,330
I was sick and tired of looking at that.

488
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,330
Sick and tired?

489
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,830
Why, you scoundrel!

490
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,380
Look at you spewing nonsense
like a damn fool.

491
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,250
Just look at you go!

492
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,880
I cannot believe you!

493
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,460
Ma'am, please try to calm down.

494
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,590
Master, it seems we chose
the wrong day to come.

495
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,510
Yes. Calm down.

496
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,720
How dare you touch me?
"Calm down"?

497
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,980
And what happens if I do not?
What are you going to do about it?

498
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,350
Ah! Hot!

499
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,560
My goodness.

500
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,400
Oh, no. What is wrong?

501
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,700
That's right!

502
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,370
I forgot I came
all this way to deliver this.

503
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,330
I can be so scatterbrained.

504
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,250
Here we go.

505
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,750
That is--

506
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,000
The Ghostbane Stone.

507
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,960
That is my Ghostbane Stone.

508
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,970
No!

509
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,260
I thought I lost it for good.

510
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,850
How did you find it?

511
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,020
Well, you see…

512
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,390
All right.

513
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,110
Stop!

514
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,190
Yes, Master.

515
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,030
Master?

516
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,240
What sort of monk looks at fish like that?

517
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,620
Master, let us go now.

518
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,830
You can just take it.
Pardon?

519
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,210
I cannot sell it
with that busted belly anyway.

520
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,210
No, that will not be necessary.

521
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,760
What would we do with fish?

522
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,220
Master, let us…

523
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,740
Great Shaman Neop-deok
claimed that she first discovered

524
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:46,040
the set of male and female
Ghostbane Stones

525
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,210
under a boulder by the sea,
a long time ago.

526
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,300
With that story, she also told me

527
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,670
that the Ghostbane Stones
have mystical powers

528
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,760
and that they always find
their way back to their owners.

529
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,390
This all happened
because that laudable object

530
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,390
was intent on finding its way back to you.

531
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,690
My goodness. Is that stone that precious?

532
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:12,980
What exactly is it?

533
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,780
This is called a Ghostbane Stone.

534
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,950
It wards off ghosts.

535
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,410
Gosh, it even wards off ghosts?

536
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,080
My goodness, what a marvelous object.

537
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,870
Look at this.
This apparently wards off ghosts.

538
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,580
Get that away from me.

539
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,750
Please be careful.

540
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,880
Careful… My goodness.

541
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,420
Is it not amazing?
Get it away from me!

542
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,510
You knew about this…

543
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,640
from the start, did you not?

544
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,850
That the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
killed my grandma.

545
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,230
You see, Yeo-ri…

546
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,280
When I think back on it now,
there were so many clues.

547
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,070
I went to see you
to get rid of Gangcheori,

548
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,950
but you taught me
a recitation ceremony for evil spirits

549
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,660
and had me repeatedly review all the ways

550
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,380
my grandma used to ward off ghosts
throughout her life.

551
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,670
All the pieces were there.

552
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,550
What a fool I was.

553
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,720
Thirteen years ago,

554
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,270
the reigning Queen Dowager

555
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:31,640
summoned me to banish
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

556
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,850
However,

557
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,770
I was no match for it.

558
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,110
So,

559
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,360
I asked Great Shaman Neop-deok

560
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,910
to come with me to the capital.

561
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,660
I am largely to blame for what happened

562
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,540
to Great Shaman Neop-deok.

563
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,960
I kept this from you because--

564
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,500
You must have been afraid
that I would rashly confront

565
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,290
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

566
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,380
Yeo-ri--
Venerable.

567
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,680
I am not that little girl anymore.

568
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,220
My grandmother is being
held captive by that ghost.

569
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,730
I will catch the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

570
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,230
The blind association?

571
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,490
That Haeilbu talisman

572
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:25,950
was crafted for the noblemen by Pung-san,
the association's noble elder.

573
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,740
A mere blind fortune teller

574
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:30,660
managed to craft a talisman
with that much mystic force?

575
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,540
So? Have you met him yet?

576
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,040
I tried to get close
to that Pung-san scoundrel,

577
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,920
but I did not get very far
because of the strong fire energy.

578
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,250
Fire energy…

579
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,300
You know, that myeongdu…

580
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,340
came in quite handy.

581
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:47,090
I will have no issue
setting my feast table if I have that.

582
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,810
I will be very happy for you
on your ascension day.

583
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,810
Your ascension will give me hope.

584
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,520
I will continue to actively support you.

585
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
Gangcheori…

586
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,440
However,

587
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,360
do not tell Yeo-ri.

588
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,070
Why?

589
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,620
She will not understand.

590
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,410
She is a mortal.

591
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,040
Damn it.

592
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,890
Why are you not sleeping?

593
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,020
I could not, even if I wanted to.

594
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,230
The thunderous roars are deafening.

595
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,070
They must be tired.

596
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:29,070
It sounded like they had quite a journey.

597
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,240
And what about you?

598
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,530
Why are you up?

599
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,200
I just… am.

600
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:39,000
Yoon Gap's mother grinds her teeth,
does she not?

601
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,130
She rolls over once every hour,
then flings a leg on you.

602
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,630
Stop it. She will hear you.

603
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,390
I gave them to you to wear, not cuddle.

604
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,100
I was just briefly admiring them
for their beauty.

605
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:02,190
How could someone like me
ever put such expensive shoes on my feet?

606
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,230
They will need
to be returned for a refund.

607
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,610
You are going to get
a refund for the gift I gave you?

608
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:10,900
What choice do I have?
Think of all the mouths we have to feed.

609
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,200
I went out of my way to get them
because I saw you gawk at that embroidery.

610
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,670
What are you talking about?
When did I ever do that?

611
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:22,880
Last summer,

612
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,710
when you went to go sell glasses
to Scholar Park, one village over.

613
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:30,090
Did you think I did not notice
you gawking at the embroidery

614
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,300
on his daughter's shoes?

615
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:35,010
I was just admiring how
the sun, moon, mountains, and trees

616
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,720
all managed to fit so harmoniously
on those small shoes.

617
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,650
You were truly…

618
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,980
always by my side.

619
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,450
I thought I was completely alone
for all those years.

620
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,040
I was quite a fool.

621
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,870
Yes. A big fool.

622
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,090
I will…

623
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,710
expose that ghost's identity
and have it cross over as soon as I can.

624
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:13,930
So I can save

625
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,220
my grandma's soul

626
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,470
and Lord Yoon Gap's as well.

627
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,770
And after you save Yoon Gap?

628
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:29,730
You might…

629
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,150
have to leave that body.

630
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,240
But,

631
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,200
even without a physical body,

632
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,660
you will still be Gangcheori

633
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:45,500
and I will wholeheartedly serve you
as my patron deity.

634
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:48,710
That will be my way

635
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,130
of thanking you for protecting me
all those years…

636
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,550
and honoring my heart

637
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,390
that yearned for you.

638
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,000
So hot!

639
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,160
What's wrong?

640
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,330
Do you… have the Ghostbane Stone?

641
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,050
Oh, right. This is like poison to you.

642
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:33,710
Should I set it aside for now?

643
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,930
Set it aside… to do what?

644
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:42,430
I mean, I was not trying to,

645
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:43,970
but you were…

646
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,360
Ghostbane Stone!

647
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,870
That is the blind fortune teller
I met last time.

648
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,040
This path leads
to the Queen Dowager's Palace.

649
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,500
That means…

650
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,290
He is the noble elder
of the blind association?

651
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:13,800
Hello again.

652
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,670
Huh? Who is it?

653
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,720
I am the Royal Couturier's
eyeglass artisan you met last time.

654
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,560
You are that young maiden

655
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,730
with the extraordinary aura.

656
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:30,480
He just looks like
a normal blind fortune teller.

657
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,480
Take care. Please excuse me.

658
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,860
You can craft implements
that clear up one's sight,

659
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:43,280
but can you not make anything for a blind
man like me to make my eyes open wide?

660
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:47,330
Forgive me, my talents remain lacking.

661
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,630
I do not know his name.

662
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:57,760
It was a eunuch with scary eyes.

663
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,340
His fingertips were black.

664
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:04,930
It is him.

665
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:06,720
He is the Yapper.

666
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,270
I must let His Majesty know immediately.

667
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,650
Pardon me, I must go now.

668
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:16,780
Se-won.

669
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,650
Is there anyone watching us?

670
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,950
There is not even an ant in sight.

671
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,160
How fortunate.

672
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,370
Your Majesty!

673
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,580
You were correct!

674
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:37,170
Your Majesty was correct indeed!

675
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:40,510
As you commanded, I reviewed
the exhaustive roster of royal relatives,

676
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:43,840
covering both direct
and collateral descendants,

677
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:47,350
who have passed away in the last 13 years.

678
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,350
Please take a look at this.

679
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:03,740
Did you have me come here this early
to look at a measly piece of paper?

680
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,280
Why you…

681
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,040
It is not some measly piece of paper.

682
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,750
It is the royal family tree.

683
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,000
Royal family tree?

684
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,710
For over ten years, many royal relatives
met their sudden deaths.

685
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:21,260
Only after I started to believe in the
Eight-foot-tall Ghost by you and Yeo-ri,

686
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,050
was I able to confirm

687
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:25,300
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
was behind their deaths.

688
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,100
So?

689
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,560
Yesterday, I met a man
by the name of Yi Hwa-seong

690
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,140
who claimed to be
a distant, collateral royal relative.

691
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:35,900
Which means the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

692
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,440
did not target its victims
just because they had royal blood.

693
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,940
Yes.
Then…

694
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:44,700
looking at the victims of the Eight-
foot-tall Ghost for the past 13 years,

695
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,910
we will discover who was responsible
for its grudge.

696
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,790
Your Majesty, it is Sang-deuk.

697
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,840
Yes. Enter.

698
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,760
Why do you come alone?

699
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,430
I told you to fetch Yeo-ri.

700
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:09,430
Well…

701
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:12,350
Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri
was not at the Royal Couturier.

702
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,020
They said she just left.

703
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,980
However, I did not find her
after searching the vicinity.

704
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,900
What?
Did you see anyone suspicious?

705
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,940
No, Your Majesty.

706
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:25,320
And the Queen Dowager has been quiet?

707
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,860
The Queen Dowager has summoned

708
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,780
a blind fortune teller
for a recitation ceremony of sutras.

709
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,760
What are you doing?

710
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,920
I tried to get close
to that Pung-san scoundrel,

711
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,880
but I did not get very far
because of the strong fire energy.

712
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,210
Yeo-ri!

713
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,590
Celestial Venerable speaks
Of the nine spirits in the body

714
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,640
Shall we summon them?
On the first day, Heaven-born

715
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,510
On the second day, Lightless
On the third day, Dark Pearl

716
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,600
On the fourth day, True Center
On the fifth day, Crimson Child

717
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,520
On the sixth day, Returning Cycles
On the seventh day, Crimson Origin

718
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,020
On the eighth day…
Your Grace.

719
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,730
His Majesty is here for you.

720
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:42,900
What?

721
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,160
Your Majesty, welcome.

722
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,410
You may leave us, Noble Elder.

723
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,710
Yes, Your Grace.

724
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:01,790
No.

725
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,670
Take a seat.

726
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,920
Pardon?

727
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:11,430
I hear you led Prince Yeongin's
Ceremony of Passage for the Deceased.

728
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:14,300
I am grateful.

729
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,180
Thanks to you,
Yeongin's bitter sorrow was relieved

730
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:21,730
and I am now able to wipe away
Her Grace's tears.

731
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,150
Your Majesty.

732
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:25,570
I am truly honored.

733
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,400
Your Grace.

734
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,450
I wish to reward him handsomely.

735
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,320
What do you say?

736
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:34,490
He is a lowly creature.

737
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,620
His talents can be useful at times,

738
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,040
but he does not deserve your attention.

739
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,250
Not at all.

740
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,210
I feel sorry
for misunderstanding him in the past

741
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,090
and I should be thankful
for all the effort he has shown

742
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:51,170
in always providing Her Grace with solace.

743
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,300
Your Majesty.

744
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,720
For what reason do you--

745
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,810
Yes, that will be best.

746
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:00,930
I shall personally make my way
to the Association of the Blind

747
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,100
and publicly commend you
for your contribution

748
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,850
for all to see.

749
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:08,190
Your Majesty,
our quarters are much too squalid

750
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:10,990
to welcome the exalted sovereign
of this nation.

751
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:12,490
Not at all.

752
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,860
The Association of the Blind

753
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:18,160
is a meaningful institution that has long
been a safe haven for the forlorn blind.

754
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,500
But I am curious

755
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,830
as to how you made your way here alone

756
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,630
when you are not able to see
what is in front of you.

757
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:30,010
Where is your servant?

758
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,260
Could he have figured out
what we did with that brat?

759
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,300
Pung-san is extraordinary.

760
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,890
Making his way to the palace alone
is no trouble for him at all.

761
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:41,600
Hence,

762
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,560
that is why I so greatly value
his talents.

763
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,150
I see.

764
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:25,810
What is that?

765
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,520
It is fine abrasive sand.

766
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,190
Sand used to polish corrective lenses.

767
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:32,900
It belongs to Yeo-ri.

768
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,700
This leads to the drainage gate.

769
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,660
Once you pass the drainage gate,
the Association of the Blind is nearby.

770
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:44,750
Someone…

771
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,250
dragged Yeo-ri out of the palace.

772
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,540
Yeo-ri!

773
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,300
Yeo-ri!

774
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,130
You cannot just enter like that.

775
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,300
The noble elder is not here right now--

776
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,470
Where is she?

777
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,060
What did you do with her?

778
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,350
Why are you doing this to me?

779
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:05,560
My goodness…

780
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,640
I don't know what you are talking about.

781
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,150
What do you think you are doing?

782
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:14,690
My goodness.

783
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:16,490
What is the meaning of this?

784
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,240
I may just be a lowly blind man,
but this is unacceptable.

785
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,870
Where is Yeo-ri?

786
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:25,700
Who is Yeo-ri? Why are you doing this?

787
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:28,500
I am the only lowly creature
who resides in this chamber.

788
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,830
That is enough.

789
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,210
He is protected by the Queen Dowager.

790
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,430
I have already searched
every corner of this place.

791
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:45,890
There was nowhere to hide someone.
So, please…

792
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:51,370
Yeo-ri!

793
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,840
Yeo-ri! Where are you?

794
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,840
My goodness.

795
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:04,300
What did you do with her?

796
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:05,850
Where is she?

797
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:07,010
Please spare me.

798
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,020
I am just a lowly blind man
who knows nothing.

799
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,100
Please spare me.

800
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,560
A lowly blind man who knows nothing?

801
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,820
Then, explain why this shrine
is overflowing with potent fire energy.

802
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:21,320
You are the Yapper.

803
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,700
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost is behind you!

804
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:38,840
You…

805
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:02,030
Go and tell the King.

806
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:03,610
Go on!

807
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,450
Why…

808
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,210
do you attack me?

809
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,330
I saw it.

810
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,090
On the day I was born 100 years ago,

811
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:22,090
I saw you fall to the ground.

812
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:24,260
Then, why?

813
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:26,630
Why do you attack me and not them?

814
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,350
What sort of nonsense are you spewing?

815
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,140
I am not your foe.

816
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,520
The King's royal bloodline is.

817
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,900
Then, why?

818
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:40,820
Why do you attack me?

819
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,710
It is odd that the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
just disappeared like that.

820
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:41,380
Where is Pung-san's shrine?

821
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,000
Reveal yourself this instant!

822
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:46,800
He was really born the day
you fell to the ground?

823
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,220
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost's grudge
must be against him.

824
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,090
I shall go to Yongdam Village in ten days.

825
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:54,390
I will expose the true identity
of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

826
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,560
I no longer need the Ghostbane Stone.

827
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,560
You are my protector now.

828
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,940
You have strayed too far
from Gangcheori the Imugi.

829
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,270
All because of that brat, Yeo-ri.

830
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,860
Just hand over that brat named Yeo-ri.

831
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,530
I am sorry, but please die here and now.

832
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:11,610
