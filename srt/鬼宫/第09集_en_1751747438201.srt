1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,420
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,430
Please…

4
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,770
My lordship! Please spare--

5
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,190
My lordship…

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,030
Grandfather, perhaps that is enough now.

7
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,700
At this rate, what if he really dies?

8
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,120
No, Your Highness.

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,580
That man conjures
the most despicable hexes.

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,830
He kidnaps young children and starves them
to death to turn them into ghosts.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,830
And then, he uses those ghosts
to swindle money from others.

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,170
He is the vilest of the vile.

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,170
He was just trying
to survive as a blind man.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,260
You should stop now.

15
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,090
You should head inside.

16
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,560
You are here for convalescence.
You should not see such sights.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
But…

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,140
Please return inside now.

19
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,010
A vengeful ghost
with the most bitter grudge…

20
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,390
Your lordship!

21
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,100
Your lordship!

22
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,850
The royal family…

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,810
A vengeful ghost with a bitter grudge…

24
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Hold on.

25
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,110
Stop.

26
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,870
- What did you say?
- A vengeful ghost…

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,000
with a deeply bitter grudge

28
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,250
has latched onto the royal family.

29
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,340
You must flee.

30
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,920
Or everyone will die.

31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,920
You must flee!

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,720
Did you say there was a ghost
harboring a grudge

33
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,890
against the royal family?

34
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,350
Yes, my lordship.

35
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
If you just let it be,

36
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,730
that man earlier… No.

37
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,690
All the esteemed members
of the royal family will perish.

38
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,910
My lordship, if you just spare my life,

39
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,160
I will do whatever it takes
to stop that ghost.

40
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,410
That will not

41
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,660
be enough to spare your life.

42
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,250
Then…

43
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,000
what must this lowly creature do
to earn your forgiveness?

44
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,380
What must I do?

45
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,380
I hear you are quite gifted
with the starving-children hexes.

46
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,010
Never…

47
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,430
Never will I commit
such a monstrous deed again.

48
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,270
So please, just spare my life…

49
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,640
Do you think

50
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,100
you could summon that ghost?

51
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,230
What?

52
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,660
Neop-deok?

53
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,780
Yes.

54
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,330
The wretched shaman

55
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,830
who overpowered the Warrior Deity
after he had possessed the late king.

56
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,170
Yeo-ri, that brat,
is of the same bloodline.

57
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,960
I sent someone to Yongdam Village
and confirmed it beyond doubt.

58
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,920
Are you saying that measly brat

59
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,840
is the one responsible for this mess?

60
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,720
You can just get rid of her
like you did with that old shaman wench.

61
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,770
I was able to do that then.

62
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,940
<i>Watch over the prince with favor</i>

63
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,900
<i>Our hope grows with every word</i>

64
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,820
Fire!

65
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,790
<i>Back then, I was able to escort</i>
<i>the Warrior Deity there</i>

66
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,160
and help him devour her.

67
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,340
However, this time
the situation is not as simple.

68
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,960
She is not alone.

69
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,630
Examiner Yoon Gap's body
is actually possessed by an Imugi.

70
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,680
- Imugi?
- Yes.

71
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,850
I cannot, for the life of me,
figure out why that Imugi is helping her,

72
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,980
but because of him,
getting close to her is no easy feat.

73
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,690
<i>Are you saying</i>

74
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,150
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost did that
to Shaman Neop-deok?

75
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,750
<i>How could I not have known?</i>

76
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,460
<i>Idiot.</i>

77
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,290
<i>Why did I not figure it out?</i>

78
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,710
<i>The fire spread</i>
<i>from the ritual table candle.</i>

79
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,090
<i>And Grandma fell into the sea</i>
<i>because of that fire.</i>

80
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,010
Grandma!

81
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,020
<i>An ember ghost was obviously responsible.</i>

82
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,320
Your Majesty was already aware of this.

83
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,190
Earlier,

84
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,490
you were shocked to hear my grandmother
died in the Year of the Water Rabbit.

85
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,120
You must have
already figured it all out by then.

86
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,200
I was hoping that my assumption was wrong.

87
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Neop-deok…

88
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,500
was the only shaman
who managed to provide…

89
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,340
my father with momentary relief
from his mania.

90
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,210
I will…

91
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,880
I will kill you all!

92
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,550
This bloodline will be

93
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,430
uprooted by my hand.

94
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,270
Resume!

95
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,020
Father!

96
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,320
<i>I thought that was the end of it.</i>

97
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,150
I did not believe in heretical ceremonies,

98
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,360
but after that day,

99
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,700
my father had returned
to his former, virile self.

100
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,370
However…

101
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,310
Fa… Father.

102
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,350
I was in denial for all these years,

103
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,640
but now I know for certain.

104
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,060
That was not…

105
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,730
Father who stood before me.

106
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,740
After my father passed away,

107
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,830
I thought it was finally all over.

108
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,830
But similar symptoms manifested…

109
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,040
once again in my young son.

110
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,010
What sort of grudge
does that Eight-foot-tall Ghost harbor

111
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,680
to commit such heinous acts?

112
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,350
Why did you

113
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,310
keep this from me until now?

114
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,230
The palace was in a state of turmoil

115
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,240
after the erratic behavior
of the king who was possessed by a ghost.

116
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,990
There were even threats of a coup
led by those who held military power.

117
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,790
Addressing that incident once more

118
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,580
would have even endangered my legitimacy.

119
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,830
Furthermore,

120
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,790
a king…

121
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,010
must place his trust in no one.

122
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,090
My grandma

123
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,060
fought for someone
who did not even believe in her

124
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,850
and as a result,
ended up tragically losing her life.

125
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,480
Yeo-ri.

126
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,490
I am the King of this nation.

127
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,860
I am responsible
for all that happens on this land

128
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,280
and be involved in all matters.

129
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,450
No matter what happens,

130
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,040
I shall endure any hardship
that comes my way

131
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,460
for the sake of the nation I dream of.

132
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,050
However,

133
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,920
when it comes to matters
that drift between life and death…

134
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,050
I remain clueless.

135
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,550
I must seem shameless…

136
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,180
and it breaks my heart…

137
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,820
but I need your help.

138
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,490
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

139
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,740
Please excuse me.

140
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
<i>I get it now.</i>

141
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,770
<i>The Eight-foot-tall Ghost</i>
<i>must have devoured Grandma's spirit.</i>

142
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,490
<i>That is why she has</i>
<i>never been able to visit me.</i>

143
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,700
<i>How could I be such an idiot?</i>
<i>Just completely in the dark…</i>

144
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,590
Talk to me.

145
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,800
I asked if you regret lying to that brat
about killing her grandmother.

146
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,180
I do not.

147
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,510
I knew it.

148
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,220
I told you back then.

149
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,430
Pompous mortals like her need to be shown
the mighty, intimidating powers

150
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,270
of deities like us.

151
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,190
My regret lies elsewhere.

152
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,070
Back then, I noticed early on that

153
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,070
Neop-deok brought the vile Eight-foot-tall
Ghost with her from the capital.

154
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,160
I wanted to warn her then, however…

155
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,660
I resented that girl
for refusing to open her heart to me,

156
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,000
so I did not.

157
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,210
I only regret failing

158
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,460
to give her that warning.

159
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,550
And if you had?

160
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,800
Would she have lauded you
and accepted you as her patron deity?

161
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,010
At the very least,

162
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,890
Neop-deok could have
avoided such a tragic end.

163
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,010
And if she had,

164
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,100
Yeo-ri would not be forced to confront
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost now.

165
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,020
Gangcheori!

166
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,370
What are you doing here?

167
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,130
You should not be out alone this late.

168
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,720
I forgot such concern
is not allowed in our arrangement.

169
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,340
I shall go on ahead.

170
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,560
Follow me if you wish.

171
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,640
- Or not.
- Why have you kept silent?

172
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,310
- What are you talking about?
- Why did you not tell me

173
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,940
that it was the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
who killed my grandma and not you?

174
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,360
Why would you keep that from me?

175
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,860
You knew everything.

176
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,580
You were not responsible at all.

177
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,080
How did you find out?

178
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,040
After I repeatedly told him not to…

179
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,920
That rotten scoundrel, I shall--

180
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,750
How could you not speak up?

181
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,250
You were subject to
my resentment, rage, and loathing…

182
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,380
Why did you never say anything?

183
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,390
Because it was easier for me.

184
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:20,850
What did you say?

185
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,730
You were just 13 years old back then.

186
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,560
Too young to even take care of yourself.

187
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,610
What would have happened if you foolishly
confronted the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

188
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,190
to save Neop-deok's devoured soul?

189
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,610
You would have ended up as his prey

190
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,870
and I, who was looking
to use you to ascend,

191
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,700
would come up empty-handed…

192
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,590
What I meant was…

193
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,990
Are you leaving already?

194
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,660
You got in really late last night.

195
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,830
They barely pay examiners enough.

196
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,950
It cannot be much different
for eyeglass artisans.

197
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,870
Why are you up so early?

198
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,250
I slept enough.

199
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,670
But why are you whispering?

200
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,710
- To avoid waking Gap up?
- No.

201
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,510
Excuse me, I have a busy day today.

202
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,140
You should still have
some breakfast before you go.

203
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,260
My goodness.

204
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,980
You need a full belly to work.

205
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,520
Gap. Are you awake already?

206
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,270
You should have let me know if you were.

207
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,030
Hold on.

208
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,990
What the…

209
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,740
Sleeping with your eyes open?

210
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,080
I guess something happened
between these two again.

211
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,670
I don't want to!

212
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,670
I'm not that brat's nanny.
Why would I follow her around?

213
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,960
I refuse.

214
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,760
Yeo-ri found out.

215
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,680
She was already hotheaded and reckless.

216
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,890
Now, she knows the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
devoured her grandmother.

217
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,100
Who knows what she will do now?

218
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,400
Just stay by her side
and let me know if she is ever in danger.

219
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,110
Are you in any position
to worry about her?

220
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,110
I confirmed it when you dealt
with that drowned ghost, Bang Mak-dol.

221
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,820
You are not as strong as you used to be.

222
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,030
Really?

223
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,370
Were you watching me from afar?

224
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,870
I'm so worried about you,
it's just killing me inside!

225
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,960
What if you never get
to ascend because of her?

226
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,420
No, I refuse!

227
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,750
<i>Hold on.</i>

228
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,630
<i>If I follow her around,</i>
<i>it might be easier to split them up.</i>

229
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,470
Does it repulse you that much?

230
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,930
It does…

231
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,640
but I am sure lugging
that heavy body around

232
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,810
to chase after her cannot be easy for you.

233
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,150
What choice do I have?

234
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,400
The younger brother

235
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,780
must lend a hand to his older brother.

236
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,660
Thank you. Thank you so much, Bibi.

237
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,490
Thank you. I shall put my faith in you.

238
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,080
You are the best Imugi!

239
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,380
<i>If you did not show this time,</i>

240
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,260
I was planning to have you pay dearly
for refusing a royal summons.

241
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,590
Your Majesty.

242
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,300
Have you decided?

243
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,310
I have been fearing

244
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:52,810
that I might become a hindrance
in your noble mission.

245
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,940
And that fear remains even now.

246
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,480
I, too, am afraid.

247
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,440
I fear my mission

248
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,660
will cause all my vassals
to turn their backs on me.

249
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,120
I fear it may only make
the lives of the people harder.

250
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,870
I fear my supporters…

251
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,080
will be brought into harm's way.

252
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,250
Your Majesty.

253
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,460
However, that will not stop me.

254
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,930
Thus, you must help me.

255
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
What are you doing?

256
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,330
Are you mad at me?

257
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,710
What was I supposed to do?

258
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:02,250
I am nothing more than a poor water ghost
who lives in a well.

259
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,130
Even the almighty Gangcheori

260
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,180
struggled against that drowned ghost.

261
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,760
Just imagine what would have happened
if I also confronted him.

262
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,430
Were you there?

263
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,730
Well, you know…

264
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,980
I was a bit worried.

265
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,320
You made sure of that!

266
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,360
So, what is it now?

267
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,150
What?

268
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,740
Why aren't you at the Royal Couturier
and pouting the day away here?

269
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,670
Geez.

270
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,880
Where is she?

271
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,340
And what is that thing?

272
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,640
So? You just ran out of there?

273
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,060
Because you were scared
to face Gangcheori?

274
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,430
As if.

275
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,140
It just feels a little awkward.
That is all.

276
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,650
I mean, for the past 13 years,

277
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,980
I explicitly hated him nonstop.

278
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,780
I was relentless.

279
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,780
Loathing him was like breathing.

280
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,990
He was the bane of my existence
who ruined my life and killed my grandma.

281
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,620
But…

282
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,330
it turns out he did not kill her.

283
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,170
So, what do I do now?

284
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,130
Is it not obvious? Just stop hating him.

285
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,050
But still…

286
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,900
Is your heart wavering?

287
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,860
Worried you might fall for Gangcheori?

288
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,700
Wavering? How absurd.

289
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,040
Then, why are your cheeks so flush?

290
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,170
No, they're not.

291
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,300
Yes, they totally are.

292
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,380
No, you're wrong.

293
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,090
"Those who harm others for gain
will harm themselves in time."

294
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,220
It means if you cause suffering to others
for the sake of personal benefit,

295
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,980
you will ultimately end up
blighting yourself.

296
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,980
Well done, Your Highness.

297
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,980
Your progress has been steady
since you regained your health.

298
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,400
I hear that

299
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,780
Examiner Yoon Gap has been
frequenting your quarters.

300
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:39,080
Perhaps, he has been aiding
in your studies?

301
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:44,120
Father told me he is a great scholar
who will be of great help to me.

302
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,880
And that eyeglass artisan as well?

303
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,960
Well…

304
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,590
She is…

305
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,970
That was… because I was curious
about how glasses were made.

306
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,680
She had some corrective lenses
that were wondrous and--

307
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,060
That is quite all right.

308
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,980
It seems His Majesty commanded you
to not speak on this matter.

309
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,530
Thus, you do not need to trouble yourself.

310
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:18,620
There is nothing I detest more
than to see Your Highness distressed.

311
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,920
<i>So, the Yapper was right.</i>

312
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,170
Your Highness, Eunuch Song
from the Grand Hall seeks an audience.

313
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,250
Let him in.

314
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,180
What is a eunuch from the Grand Hall
doing here?

315
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,010
Did Father send you?

316
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,310
Yes, Your Highness.

317
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,310
He asked me to escort
the Chief State Councillor back.

318
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,270
Your Majesty wishes to appoint Lord
Choi Won-u as the Left State Councillor?

319
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,650
Yes, I plan to do so.

320
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,780
What are your thoughts on the matter?

321
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:02,080
I believe you also once mentioned
that Lord Choi Won-u was far too gifted

322
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,290
to be wasting his years
as a hermit scholar.

323
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,790
Yes, I did indeed say that.

324
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,130
However, your vassals
will understand his appointment

325
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:15,090
as a sign of Your Majesty
actively pursuing slavery reform.

326
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,140
We have yet to capture
the heinous individual responsible

327
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,180
for the egregious act committed
against the Queen.

328
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,930
Thus, if Your Majesty once again summons
Lord Choi Won-u to your side,

329
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,400
the opposing parties will only grow
more beastly in their hearts.

330
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,110
I am prepared for as much.

331
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,070
You must be aware of it as well.

332
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,620
The late king departed
in such a manner to protect me.

333
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,790
On that rare day when his mania subsided,

334
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,620
he became aware
of the stirrings of a rebellion…

335
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,880
and he…

336
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,920
was felled by his own hand for my sake.

337
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,470
Your Majesty.

338
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,890
In his heart, the late king also desired
to bring forth slavery reform.

339
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,850
On behalf of the late king as well,

340
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,270
I plan to properly carry out
my sovereign duties.

341
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,850
Please help me do so.

342
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,230
Your Majesty.

343
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,690
If that truly is your desire,

344
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,490
this elderly subject will wholeheartedly
carry out your command.

345
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,990
Your Majesty,
Examiner Yoon Gap seeks an audience.

346
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,370
Yes! Let him in.

347
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,250
You may be dismissed now.

348
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

349
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,720
Hold on. What are you doing?

350
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,970
<i>She is not alone.</i>

351
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,970
Examiner Yoon Gap's body
is actually possessed

352
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,060
by an Imugi.

353
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,940
What are you doing?

354
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,610
- Let me go.
- Look here.

355
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,570
I said, let go of me, Grilled Abalone!

356
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,650
Stop calling me Grilled Abalone!

357
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,080
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

358
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,580
Why would you tell Yeo-ri that?

359
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,880
I did not tell her that.

360
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
What?

361
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,090
I never knew that Neop-deok fell victim
to the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

362
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,640
However, it appears you did.

363
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,010
That…

364
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,060
is because I am a deity
with almighty power beyond mortal reach.

365
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,980
However, you must have hid
that fact from Yeo-ri

366
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,060
to keep her safe.

367
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,240
It appears you were worried about her.

368
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,700
I did so

369
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,820
because I need that girl to ascend.

370
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,990
So, you hold her dear in your heart.

371
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,960
Even the omnipotent Imugi

372
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,420
knows to blush when speaking
of the maiden he harbors affection for.

373
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,760
Do not laugh.

374
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,140
Affection? Nonsense.

375
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,260
Getting a grasp
of her emotions is impossible.

376
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,390
When I think about her
a searing rage surges from deep within.

377
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,640
Not even the slightest clue
as to what she is thinking.

378
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,980
Fine.

379
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,150
I understand she is upset

380
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,690
upon learning her grandmother died
because of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

381
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,980
However, if she cries such sorrowful,
heartrending tears,

382
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,490
what am I to do?

383
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,740
There is nothing scarier in this world
than a maiden's tears.

384
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,080
That is quite true.

385
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,210
I also used to become
very flustered when the Queen cried.

386
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,630
However, I most certainly know better now.

387
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,880
I know what a man must do
in those situations.

388
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,510
And what…

389
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,510
could that be?

390
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,310
What is it?

391
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,150
You just need to offer a warm embrace

392
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,650
and listen to her with an open heart.

393
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,080
<i>Offer a warm embrace</i>
<i>and listen to her with an open heart?</i>

394
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,380
<i>How could I when she will not</i>
<i>even lock eyes with me?</i>

395
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,660
Goodness me, they are still at it.

396
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,080
I wonder what terrible thing Gap did
to make Yeo-ri act like that.

397
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,410
Gangcheori did nothing wrong.

398
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,160
Yeo-ri just has a nasty temper.

399
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,790
No way.

400
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,130
And here I thought I could get
him married off this year. Guess not.

401
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,710
Right?

402
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,210
I concur.

403
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,010
The yearning heart of a mortal
has long been

404
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,510
mere fleeting lust necessary
for the continuation of the species.

405
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,390
The mortal heart is fickle
and flips easier than a hand.

406
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,060
No.

407
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,270
Fickle human hearts
may flip easier than hands,

408
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,570
but one cannot flip feelings
that are not there.

409
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,940
What the…

410
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,450
Can this mortal hear me?

411
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,450
I am certain they like each other.

412
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,460
Geez…

413
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,310
You are clearly distracted.

414
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,900
Are you all right?

415
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,320
What are you scheming?

416
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,110
Why do you keep following me around?

417
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,400
Do you think I want to be doing this?

418
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,580
I could share this if you would like.

419
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,830
Why Gangcheori lied and told you
that he killed Neop-deok.

420
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:32,130
You see, Gangcheori has always considered
mortals to be lowly since the olden days,

421
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,510
and never felt the need
to be honest with them.

422
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,720
Are you not curious
about how many lies he has weaved

423
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,230
throughout your history?

424
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
For example,

425
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,900
when he claimed he would defeat
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost for you…

426
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,020
Why are you telling me this?

427
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,900
What?

428
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,570
Well…

429
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,240
because…

430
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,280
I just feel bad for you falling…

431
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,410
for such tricks.

432
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,750
Don't you dislike me?

433
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,120
Should you be sharing
Gangcheori's secrets with me like this?

434
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,040
Does he know about this?

435
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,670
You

436
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,170
are doing this to separate us,
are you not?

437
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Leave already.

438
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,980
How despicable! I just loathe them.

439
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,230
Mortals make my skin crawl.
I just hate them.

440
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:32,320
And clever ones like that one,
I despise even more and then some!

441
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,990
I just need to ascend as soon as possible
and get away from these damn mortals.

442
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,130
And right on cue is my next feast.

443
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,300
I believe it has been quite a while
since we've met like this, my lord.

444
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,260
What sort of urgent matter

445
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,680
led you to summon me like this
when you value your privacy so?

446
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:48,440
The King wishes to appoint Lord Choi Won-u
as Left State Councillor.

447
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,900
In the end,

448
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,360
does the king wish to pursue
this slavery reform business?

449
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,200
How could you have just let things
proceed this far?

450
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,200
During the rebellion we led 13 years ago,

451
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,910
we should have taken care
of the crown prince as well.

452
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:13,130
My lord,
your temperament is far too fiery.

453
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,670
You were also too rash
when you tried to kill Examiner Yoon Gap.

454
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,800
How do you know--

455
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,390
The haphazard execution
of your reckless pursuits

456
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,730
will end up hindering us.

457
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,110
You should abandon
such pursuits as soon as possible.

458
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,360
However,

459
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,150
he is no longer the Yoon Gap of the past.

460
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,450
His behavior has been strange,
almost inhuman at times.

461
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,370
Where there is a will, there is a way.

462
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
From what I hear,

463
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,330
he is a son quite devoted
to his filial duties.

464
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,100
How was that fellow's fortune?

465
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:15,060
He appeared to be in peril
like a candle against the wind.

466
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:19,320
I do not believe the Minister of War
will stand a chance against that Imugi,

467
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,820
no matter what he does.

468
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,910
That was not what I was hoping for.

469
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,370
If we can just briefly hold
that Imugi captive,

470
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,370
we can easily take care of that Yeo-ri.

471
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,250
It will be no trouble at all.

472
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,500
You focus on the Queen Dowager
and get her to act.

473
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,130
We must…

474
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,130
first stop Choi Won-u.

475
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,600
The King is bringing
someone new into the court?

476
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,720
Who is it?

477
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,100
I do not know.

478
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:54,350
However, Your Grace will soon find out.

479
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:56,730
You must stop it.

480
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,440
Once he enters the palace,

481
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,490
His Majesty's power
will only grow stronger

482
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:04,160
and you will forever lose your chance

483
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,950
to get vengeance
for Prince Yeongin's death.

484
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,400
It appears you have had a change of heart.

485
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,900
I am certain you told me last time

486
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,860
that you had no intention
of becoming a supporter of the King.

487
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,660
I, too, wish to stay in the countryside

488
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,870
and spend the rest of my days
teaching the next generation of scholars.

489
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:51,950
However…

490
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,420
I wish to provide His Majesty
with what little help I can

491
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,880
as he embarks on his lone battle.

492
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,590
- Your Grace--
- I was born

493
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,760
to a noble family
suffering abject destitution.

494
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:13,600
I sometimes sought out aid
from a distant uncle on my mother's side.

495
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,520
I was embarrassed
about asking for his help

496
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,610
and I used to stall for no reason
by wandering around that big house.

497
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,900
Once, I ended up in the study

498
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,820
and discovered a very amusing book.

499
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,660
I believe it was called
<i>The Anthology of Light and Darkness.</i>

500
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,240
Was it not?

501
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,540
The book written by Lord Choi Gil-sang,
my uncle's great-great-grandfather,

502
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,130
as he safeguarded the king in the royal
procession during the war a century ago.

503
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,960
What are you trying to say?

504
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,890
I…

505
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,640
have nothing else to lose now.

506
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,640
My unwavering desire to destroy the King

507
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,650
is all I have.

508
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,230
That is to say
I am not the least bit afraid

509
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,820
of the contents of that book
being released into the world.

510
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,740
However, you have a lot to lose,
do you not, Uncle?

511
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,830
If you wish to avoid that,

512
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,750
go back to Yongdam Village.

513
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,920
That is where
you are meant to be, my lord.

514
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,190
- Are these all the books?
- Yes.

515
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,780
- Hurry it up.
- Yes, sir.

516
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,570
Hello, my lady.

517
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,910
Did something happen?

518
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,500
Why is everyone packing up?

519
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,870
His Excellency said we are
to head back to Yongdam Village.

520
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,580
What?

521
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,880
Do not just stand there.
Pack up her lady's belongings.

522
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,590
My lady…

523
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,900
Your Majesty.

524
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,650
This letter from Lord Choi Won-u
just arrived.

525
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,610
Did you say Lord Choi Won-u?

526
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,750
<i>My fidelity to the sovereign</i>
<i>and sense of duty toward him</i>

527
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,380
<i>remain fervent in my heart.</i>

528
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:52,510
<i>However, I am unqualified</i>
<i>to answer Your Majesty's summons</i>

529
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:56,100
<i>and meet the lofty expectations</i>
<i>laid upon me.</i>

530
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,480
Send a messenger to escort
Lord Choi Won-u back this instant.

531
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

532
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,320
No.

533
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,820
I shall go myself.

534
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:07,040
She should be back now.
Where could she be?

535
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,180
Lady Choi In-seon?

536
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,150
What brings you here, my lady?

537
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:32,190
Have you been staying here
this whole time?

538
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,700
- A talisman?
- Yes.

539
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,120
Every nobleman over 60 in the capital
had the same talisman with them.

540
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,410
What sort of talisman?

541
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,040
A Haeilbu talisman.

542
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,540
Haeilbu?

543
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,750
As in a pig talisman?

544
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,790
Seriously?

545
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,260
What sort of lunatic
is trying to ward us off

546
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,050
as if we are serpents?

547
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,430
That measly talisman

548
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,640
stopped the almighty Bibi
from gobbling up a nobleman?

549
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,180
I told you it was not
some measly talisman.

550
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,560
I never saw anything like it.

551
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,020
It possessed indomitable spiritual energy.

552
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,360
Hey. You have a guest.

553
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,530
A guest?

554
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,830
My lord.

555
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,200
It has been a while.

556
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:39,010
My lady is here today
because it would be reprehensible

557
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,970
to forgo a gesture of gratitude
to the savior who saved her life twice.

558
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,180
Hence, we stand before you now.

559
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,390
"Saved your life"?

560
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,930
I saved your life?

561
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:54,360
Remember? Back in Yongdam Village,

562
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,780
you saved her once
when she collapsed in the silk store.

563
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,110
And last time, there was that collision
where she was about to fall on her behind…

564
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,700
I mean, she was about to fall

565
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,040
when you reached out
to save her, just in time.

566
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,420
So, that makes two.

567
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,250
That is the argument.

568
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,840
Not mine, but Her lady's.

569
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,880
That is right.

570
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,090
Not to mention,

571
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,020
you also gifted me
that lovely potted plant last time.

572
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,140
Potted plant?
The one that Venerable Gaseop gave us?

573
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,770
Are you familiar with it?

574
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,240
I am not sure. It could be the same one

575
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,110
or that lord over there
could have picked one up from the street.

576
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,240
Go on, Mak-geum.

577
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,620
Yes, my lady.

578
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,890
I purchased them all from the
most renown confectionery in the capital.

579
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,850
A small gesture of my thanks.

580
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,910
Please try this one as well.

581
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,500
But

582
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,300
how did that girl come to stay here?

583
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,340
"That girl"?

584
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,100
You must have taken her in out of pity.

585
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,140
Did you not say she was
like a sister to you,

586
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,480
who grew up in the same village?

587
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,020
Well, you could say that.

588
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:01,320
We grew up in the same village together
as if we were siblings.

589
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,700
That is the extent of our relationship.

590
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:09,620
You are ever so compassionate, my lord.

591
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,290
Well, you never know with people.

592
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,000
I have seen friendly acquaintances
become newlyweds once or twice before.

593
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,080
Hey!

594
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,540
How noisy.

595
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,460
You there.

596
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,300
Perhaps, if that task is not so urgent,

597
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,050
you could give us some privacy?

598
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,260
There is something I wish
to discuss privately with His Lord.

599
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,570
Sure. I was actually about to go out
to look for the lady of the house

600
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,940
who should have been home by now.

601
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:45,650
I see.

602
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,530
Then you should get going.

603
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,540
Try this, too.

604
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:06,630
What was that about?

605
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,590
What is that esteemed daughter
of a nobleman doing here anyway?

606
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,760
He saved her life twice?

607
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,720
It looked like they were close.

608
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,520
When did that start?

609
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,310
Did it start with Lord Yoon Gap?

610
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,060
Or after Gangcheori's possession?

611
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,030
Are you Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri?

612
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,570
Yes, I am.

613
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,580
His Lord, Chief State Councillor
Kim Bong-in, wishes to meet you.

614
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,040
He wishes to have
some glasses made by you.

615
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,440
I just need to grab
something really quick.

616
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,990
Why am I making excuses for myself?

617
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,420
Well.

618
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,340
I am leaving for real now.

619
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,140
Please feel free to do whatever you wish.

620
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,890
All right. Go on.

621
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,200
This one is tasty as well.

622
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:58,410
No, thanks.

623
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,620
All these sweets are making me thirsty.

624
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:18,260
<i>I have your mother.</i>

625
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:19,930
<i>If you wish to save her,</i>

626
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,770
<i>come to the abandoned house</i>
<i>next to the slaughterhouse near Seosomun.</i>

627
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,940
<i>Yoon Gap's mother was kidnapped?</i>

628
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,560
What does it say?

629
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,480
It is nothing.

630
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,660
<i>Yes, this is nothing.</i>

631
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,200
<i>That woman is just Yoon Gap's mother.</i>

632
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,870
<i>She was useful</i>
<i>for her above-average cooking skills,</i>

633
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,370
<i>but that was all. Nothing more.</i>

634
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,040
<i>But, why do I have this nagging feeling?</i>

635
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,340
Right.

636
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,510
These sweets pale in comparison

637
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,350
to that woman's garlic chive pancakes.

638
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,720
Where are you going?

639
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:03,600
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

640
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,770
Just a moment, my lord.

641
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:10,690
I will be leaving the capital
to return to Yongdam Village today.

642
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:12,900
Before I do,

643
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,360
there is something I must tell you.

644
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,450
No need.

645
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,780
But you do not even know
what I am about to say.

646
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:25,330
You come off scatterbrained,
but you are actually quite clever.

647
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,250
You must also be well aware
of what the future holds for you.

648
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,250
You will marry the man your parents choose
and give birth to his children.

649
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,720
As your mother and sisters
have done before you,

650
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,510
you shall quietly live out your days

651
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:39,550
as a nobleman's wife within the confines
of your walled-off home.

652
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,930
I am sure thinking about that
only left you frustrated beyond belief.

653
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,730
It must have made you want to rebel.

654
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:48,690
However,
I am not the sort of man you seek.

655
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,650
Nor do I have any desire
to fulfill your wishes.

656
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,730
My lord, I just--

657
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,860
Furthermore…

658
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,910
if you wish to order Yeo-ri around
like some handmaiden,

659
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,450
you are not welcome in my presence.

660
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,290
My lord.

661
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:38,400
Where is Lord Choi Won-u?

662
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:43,990
Yes. His Lord took everyone
and left about one hour ago.

663
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,700
Was he headed to Yongdam Village?

664
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,540
Yes, he was.

665
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,670
He could not have gone far if
he is traveling with his whole household.

666
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:18,490
Are you sure this is the way
to Lord Kim Bong-in's residence?

667
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:20,700
Yes, of course.

668
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:24,370
I told you His Lord is
waiting for you right now.

669
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,410
<i>I heard Lord Kim Bong-in</i>

670
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:29,500
<i>was the King's maternal grandfather</i>
<i>and the Chief State Councillor.</i>

671
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,710
<i>Why would he reside</i>
<i>in such a secluded area?</i>

672
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:38,670
What is the meaning of this?

673
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,690
It appears you foolishly misplaced
your sense of fear.

674
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,560
Shall I send you flying
with another whirlwind?

675
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,900
Try it if you can.

676
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:43,400
However, it appears your mother's blood
will stain the floor before you do.

677
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,950
Will you be okay with that?

678
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,580
I guess even a ghastly scoundrel like you
grows fearful before your flesh and blood.

679
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,040
I just could not make any sense of it.

680
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:02,920
I most certainly stabbed you
in the abdomen.

681
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,380
I even confirmed
you were dead beyond doubt.

682
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,010
Who are you?

683
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,770
Did you create this mess to find that out?

684
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:15,940
If you were so curious,
you should have just asked.

685
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,400
I would have gladly provided an answer.

686
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,780
I am…

687
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,900
You ghastly scoundrel.

688
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:04,650
Behind you!

689
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,200
Gap…

690
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,830
<i>I told you it was not</i>
<i>some measly talisman.</i>

691
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,590
I never saw anything like it.

692
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,920
It possessed indomitable spiritual energy.

693
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,150
Damn it. How annoying.

694
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,470
What are you doing?
Run before they wake up.

695
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,640
Right.

696
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,880
Why, you damn wench.

697
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,400
<i>I cannot summon the wind?</i>

698
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:17,740
Bibi.

699
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,010
My lord!

700
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,530
<i>Save me, Gangcheori. Please.</i>

701
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:42,580
Stop!

702
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,160
Your Majesty.

703
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,130
What do you think you are doing?

704
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,300
Yeo-ri. Are you all right?

705
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,970
Whom do you serve?

706
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:19,530
Your Majesty!

707
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,380
Your Majesty, are you all right?

708
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,470
Your Majesty was injured because of me.

709
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,720
It is nothing serious. Just a scratch.

710
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:44,930
Who do you think instigated them?

711
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:47,430
They displayed exceptional swordsmanship.

712
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,770
It seems someone found out
about her true identity.

713
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,770
We must return to the palace.

714
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:53,900
Your Majesty.

715
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,110
What shall we do about Lord Choi Won-u?

716
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:00,030
If her true identity has been exposed,

717
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:02,740
I cannot leave the palace vacant for long.

718
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,120
Escort Yeo-ri back.
They may try to attack her once more.

719
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:09,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

720
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:20,930
Will His Majesty be all right?

721
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,390
He lost a lot of blood.

722
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:25,220
His Majesty will be fine.

723
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:26,310
More importantly,

724
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:29,270
it appears someone is targeting
you and Examiner Yoon Gap.

725
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,980
You must be even more careful now.

726
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,440
Yes, I shall.

727
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,530
Where is everyone?

728
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,700
Ma'am?

729
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,910
Gangcheori?

730
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:57,550
Gangcheori!

731
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:11,600
What in the world happened?

732
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,480
How did she end up like this?

733
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,400
Should we not call for a physician?

734
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,070
It was nothing serious.

735
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,400
She is just sleeping.

736
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,450
There were no serious injuries.

737
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:24,740
It looks serious to me.

738
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,740
Just what happened?

739
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:29,660
And what happened to you?

740
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:32,080
I am fine.

741
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,460
I ran into some trouble,

742
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,130
but His Majesty saved me.

743
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,630
And he got injured in the process.

744
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,430
The King got hurt
while trying to save you?

745
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:05,530
Where were you in the middle of the…

746
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,540
Did you leave to retrieve this?

747
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,870
This late?

748
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,710
- Let me.
- It is fine. I can do it.

749
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,250
Just stay still.

750
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,800
Don't…

751
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,930
Stay still, I say.

752
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:31,850
You could barely wipe it due to the pain.

753
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,850
Gosh.

754
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:36,690
Just stop it!

755
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,400
Do you know
what the most infuriating thing is?

756
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:46,280
My grandma must be suffering right now
within the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

757
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:49,990
Her futile death still breaks my heart.

758
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,240
Yet…

759
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,580
deep in my heart…

760
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,130
I am relieved.

761
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:04,050
So relieved that you were not the one

762
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:06,800
who did that to my grandma.

763
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,890
That was the first thought I had.

764
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:15,640
I was relieved to find out

765
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,900
that I no longer have to feel guilty
about being attracted to you.

766
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:21,900
That thought was all…

767
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,190
- You--
- How can I be like this?

768
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,780
How can someone be so wretched?

769
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:06,030
SPECIAL THANKS TO SONG JAE-HEE

770
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:28,010
<i>She saw me for the first time.</i>

771
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:29,670
<i>That is what I will be</i>
<i>focusing on for now.</i>

772
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,470
What could you possibly expect
from a mortal?

773
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:34,260
Could I take you returning here today

774
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:37,180
to mean you will continue
helping me with my undertaking?

775
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,390
<i>He is unusually quiet.</i>

776
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,940
<i>Yoon Gap, you scoundrel,</i>
<i>what are you scheming?</i>

777
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,560
<i>Do not tell Yeo-ri.</i>

778
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:47,110
You knew about this
from the start, did you not?

779
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,110
<i>Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri</i>
<i>was not at the Royal Couturier.</i>

780
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,870
<i>Someone dragged Yeo-ri out of the palace.</i>

781
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:55,700
Yeo-ri!

782
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:01,660
