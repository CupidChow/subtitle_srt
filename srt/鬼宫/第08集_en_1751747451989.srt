1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,420
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,180
RETURN

4
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,150
Yeo-ri.

5
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,650
I had palace attendants swiftly make this,

6
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,400
but…

7
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,620
will this be enough?

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,820
Yes.

9
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,410
I need this to break the curse.

10
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,250
My goodness. All right.

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,210
- Take it.
- Yes, my lord.

12
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,010
Are you sure you can make it there
in such a state?

13
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,930
I must.

14
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,300
Gangcheori will be in danger
if I do not go.

15
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,390
Then again,

16
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,520
it did seem like that rowdy Imugi
cared for you deeply.

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,690
You must go if it distresses you so.
Let us go.

18
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,230
- Let us prepare to leave.
- Yes, my lord.

19
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,740
<i>First, I need to save Gangcheori.</i>

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,250
Stand your ground!

21
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,220
Your Majesty!

22
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,060
- Stay back. You will only get in the way.
- But--

23
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,270
I do not need one more victim to save.

24
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,710
<i>That drowned ghost</i>
<i>will appear during the daytime.</i>

25
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,920
<i>Rotten water spreads easier</i>
<i>under the hot sun.</i>

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,500
<i>Gangcheori is in danger.</i>

27
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,390
<i>This water has a rotten stench.</i>

28
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,110
<i>I cannot…</i>

29
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,650
<i>I cannot breathe.</i>

30
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,360
<i>A member of the royal bloodline.</i>

31
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,950
<i>Come with me.</i>

32
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,740
<i>You will come with me!</i>

33
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,820
Your Majesty!

34
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,900
Do not just stand there! Take him now!

35
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,630
<i>It is not like last time.</i>

36
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,590
<i>This water reeks of decay.</i>

37
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,390
I cannot breathe…

38
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,930
Imugi, the cocky freshwater sovereign.

39
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,680
Not so cocky now in that mortal body.

40
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,810
How's the taste of rotten water?

41
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,860
Now, I end you!

42
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,540
<i>The curse…</i>

43
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,930
Your Majesty. He fell into the water.

44
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,060
Should we…

45
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,570
What are these?

46
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,200
Consider it a last-resort weapon.

47
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,790
Although I am sure we will not need it.

48
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,000
"Earth overcomes water."

49
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,750
Dirt will bind and trap water.

50
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,050
Dirty wandering spirit.

51
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,100
Let me show you the true power…

52
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,440
of the freshwater sovereign.

53
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,360
Oh, no! Your Majesty!

54
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,490
Your Majesty! Are you all right?

55
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,290
What is that on your neck?

56
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,830
I am fine.

57
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,840
However…

58
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,510
Gangcheori!

59
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,780
<i>He has been cursed. I must hurry.</i>

60
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,900
I call upon the guardians
of the Blue-East, White-West,

61
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,150
Red-South, Black-North,

62
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,400
and Yellow-Center…

63
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,030
Please return the curses
from all cardinal directions

64
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,830
back to their origins.

65
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,830
You rotten wench…

66
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,600
Gangcheori!

67
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,650
It looks like the curse was broken.

68
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,740
Why is he not waking up?

69
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,740
Gangcheori.

70
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,450
Wake up.

71
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,240
Gangcheori, wake up!

72
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,790
Wake up already!

73
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,880
Seeing how you are yelling
at the top of your lungs,

74
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,090
it seems you've recovered.

75
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,180
You're alive.

76
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,520
You are alive…

77
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,480
I was worried something might have
happened to you.

78
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The curse…

79
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,630
was broken.

80
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,290
That is impossible.

81
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,380
You must be mistaken.

82
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,170
You were sure even that brat
was struck with the curse.

83
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,800
Then, how could it have been broken?

84
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,640
That wench…

85
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,850
hails from Yongdam Village.

86
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,180
Yongdam Village?

87
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,390
What is so special about that?

88
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,940
How dense and worthless you are.

89
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,110
Did you actually forget
about Yongdam Village?

90
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,490
But that happened a long time ago.

91
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,870
It must be a coincidence--

92
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,040
Coincidence?

93
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,620
You need more than an Imugi by your side
to confront the Warrior Deity

94
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,250
and break the drowned ghost's curse
with such swiftness.

95
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,210
You still think it's a coincidence?

96
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,800
But…

97
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,130
His Lordship did not mention anything.

98
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,550
How could His Lordship know?

99
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,890
<i>Take that deceased spirit</i>

100
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,270
<i>Cleanse the soul and purify the spirit…</i>

101
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,190
<i>You and I</i>

102
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,270
were the only ones
to visit Yongdam Village.

103
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,790
You…

104
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,500
- My goodness.
- Such behavior…

105
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,000
You seem perfectly fine now.

106
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,970
Of course, I am the almighty Gangcheori.

107
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,430
A drowned ghost is no match for me.

108
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,250
Your Majesty,
we should return to the palace.

109
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,250
We must swiftly get
your injuries looked at.

110
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
Let us return.

111
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,300
Go on.

112
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,600
Are you all right? Let me see.

113
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,930
I'm fine.

114
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,150
I have a bad feeling about this.

115
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,000
Your Highness,
His Majesty is here for you.

116
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,130
Your Majesty.

117
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Your Majesty,

118
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,430
Her Highness has made a full recovery…

119
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,190
Your Majesty.

120
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,860
Forgive me for worrying you.

121
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,410
I am fine now.

122
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,120
They say the child in my womb
is also healthy.

123
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,540
Such wonderful news.

124
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,010
I was terrified that I might…

125
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,930
end up losing you.

126
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,350
Your Majesty.

127
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,230
Damn wandering spirit.

128
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,860
Do not bother wasting your energy.

129
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,370
Without a single drop of water around,
you will not be able to flee.

130
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
Who instigated this?

131
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,290
Answer me.

132
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,290
Or I shall seal you
in that puppet once more

133
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,170
and bury you in the ground.

134
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,250
Go on.

135
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,630
This punk…

136
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,220
Start talking! You wretched scoundrel.

137
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,310
We will not be able to get
this scoundrel to talk.

138
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,360
Seal him in the puppet once more.

139
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,320
I shall bury him deep
in the driest, most barren land.

140
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,280
There is no need

141
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,910
to rush his burial.

142
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,960
I heard you appeared
in the Queen's nightmares every night

143
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,460
to torment her.

144
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,300
But did you know

145
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,090
you are targeting the wrong person?

146
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,470
Seeing your current state,

147
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,180
the cause of your death
must have been drowning.

148
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,060
Instead of retrieving your head
from the water for a proper funeral rite,

149
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,350
an insidious individual placed it

150
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,270
in the Queen's pillow
for the sake of a curse.

151
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,440
Should you not expose them
so they may be punished?

152
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,780
I am sure they made you
a promise of some sort.

153
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,330
Tell me.

154
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,080
I shall grant you your wish.

155
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,010
My wish?

156
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,970
That is right. Your wish.

157
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,050
So tell me.

158
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,390
You need to grant my wish first.

159
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,100
After you do,

160
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,020
I will tell you who that individual is.

161
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,990
He is Bang Mak-dol, an off-site slave
from Goksan, Chungcheong-do.

162
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,820
He says he died ten years ago
due to a flood.

163
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,910
He has agreed to speak
if I deliver his remains to his daughter.

164
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,790
Then, you leave for Goksan immediately?

165
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,120
Yes.

166
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,130
I believe I will be able to meet
his daughter if I visit his former home.

167
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,340
Come closer.

168
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,140
Closer.

169
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,360
So, are you feeling better now?

170
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,990
I am fine now, Your Majesty.

171
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,490
Thank you for bestowing me
those precious medicinal herbs.

172
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,280
No need to thank me.

173
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,660
I will grant you the use of a horse.
Have a safe journey.

174
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,330
Clerk Officer.

175
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,170
You shall escort her there,
she has a rough journey ahead.

176
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,590
I shall do my very best to keep her safe.

177
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,960
Then, I shall take my leave.

178
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,510
All right. Safe travels.

179
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,760
What is the matter?

180
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,690
That queen woman remains reclined,
resting in her bed.

181
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,060
You suffered the same curse,

182
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,980
yet you are sent off
to some faraway place?

183
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,320
Is he just allowed to abuse
the lower class as he wishes?

184
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,740
Watch your tongue. His Majesty
generously provided her with a horse.

185
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,650
Horse? He should have
given her a palanquin!

186
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,330
- I must go back and argue with him.
- I told you I am perfectly fine.

187
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,700
Really?

188
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,870
Your Majesty.

189
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,170
Were you overly affectionate
toward that Yeo-ri on purpose?

190
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,760
Was it obvious?

191
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,630
Just a bit.

192
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,390
That Gangcheori
was steaming from his ears.

193
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,440
My word.

194
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,400
What? What is it?

195
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,990
What is it? Is there misfortune?

196
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,870
My goodness, say something.

197
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,450
Maybe it is because
of those awful rumors about the Imugi?

198
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,620
Not to mention,
officials are dropping like flies.

199
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,750
I am just a ball of anxiety.

200
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,790
A flood has broken out.

201
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
The trees are about to be uprooted.

202
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
Does that mean…

203
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,050
I am going to die?

204
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,720
Do not worry. I shall save you, my lord.

205
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,350
I shall craft this talisman for you
with the utmost care.

206
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,850
Always keep it with you at all times.

207
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,020
Do not go anywhere without it, all right?

208
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,610
<i>The almighty Imugi is</i>
<i>just a snake at the end of the day.</i>

209
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,530
<i>Hence, it must be stopped</i>
<i>by its </i>gluttonous <i>mortal enemy,</i>

210
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,990
<i>the pig.</i>

211
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,390
Take it back.
I do not believe in such things.

212
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,100
Just accept it for my sake.

213
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,310
I had it crafted by the noble elder
of the Association of the Blind

214
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,940
and even brought one for you.

215
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,480
Do you truly believe
this will make a difference?

216
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,280
We live in strange times.

217
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,660
Our colleagues
are dying one after another.

218
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,950
Almost as if someone is aiding the king.

219
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,160
Whether it is a ghost or an Imugi,

220
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,710
it is better to be safe than sorry.

221
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,460
Keep it with you.

222
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,620
Can I help you?

223
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,080
Is this the residence of Bang Mak-dol?

224
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,290
Yes. He is my father.

225
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,250
But he passed away a long time ago.

226
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,840
What is this?

227
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,180
They are your father's remains.

228
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
What?

229
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,690
What do you…

230
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,240
Father…

231
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,580
Please forgive me.

232
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,260
My father ended up like this
as he tried to save me.

233
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,840
Please forgive me.

234
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,220
My dear Kkeut-sun…

235
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,980
Kkeut-sun…

236
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,440
Hey.

237
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,280
We granted your wish,
now honor your promise.

238
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,190
I am beginning to get hungry.

239
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,660
Hey, Lady Shaman.

240
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,830
My daughter's heart has been shattered.

241
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,120
Can you lend me your body
so I can just tell her a few words?

242
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,750
That is a bit…

243
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,710
We pull you from the roaring river

244
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,210
and now you want to rob us?
This is not what we agreed upon!

245
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,500
Then, what?

246
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,220
Do you want my baby, my poor Kkeut-sun,

247
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,090
to live with that sorrow forever?

248
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,640
How can you be so heartless?

249
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,430
To hell with it!

250
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,310
If you refuse,

251
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,600
these lips will remain sealed for good.

252
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,350
What a rotten scoundrel…

253
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,190
I will beat you up
and teach you a mighty lesson.

254
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,450
Do you promise to answer our questions
if I let you briefly borrow my body?

255
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,450
I will tell you everything!

256
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,290
Every single little thing I remember!

257
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,920
Do you know how exhausting
being possessed can be?

258
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,250
And you just offer yourself up?

259
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,290
Did you forget your body is mine--

260
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,540
Just for a brief moment!

261
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,670
I just need to tell her one thing.

262
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,810
A very brief moment.

263
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,310
Do I just enter now? Yes? Now?

264
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:50,810
Do I?

265
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,230
You are entering nothing…

266
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,530
It worked. Golly gee!

267
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,700
Already?

268
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,830
That damn brat…

269
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,410
Have you lost your mind?

270
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,210
That is why I told you not to go!

271
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:15,090
If you had just listened to your father,
we could have avoided this mess! Well?

272
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,300
Father?

273
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,090
Father, is that you?

274
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,800
Yes, it is me.

275
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,180
Who else would I be?

276
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,720
Anyhow!

277
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:30,100
You just never listened
ever since you were a kid.

278
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,100
You just had to walk into the flood--

279
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,520
Then, what about you?

280
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,110
You would have yelled at me again
if I lost that fishing net!

281
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,570
And what about you?

282
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,110
You should have reeled it in
when I told you to!

283
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,410
My goodness.

284
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,620
Look at this little one.

285
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,870
Who does he get his handsome looks from?

286
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,420
Look at you, Kkeut-sun.

287
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,880
You even commendably birthed
this strapping lad.

288
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,130
Father!

289
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,460
She is a daughter!

290
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
Oh, a daughter?

291
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,060
She looks exactly like you
when you were a baby.

292
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,650
Wait.

293
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,650
Father!

294
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Kkeut-sun.

295
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,490
It was not your fault.

296
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,030
It was just my fate. All right?

297
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,700
And on my ancestral rites table,

298
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,500
can you just place
a dried persimmon for me?

299
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,960
Father!

300
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,710
Father…

301
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,920
Dried persimmon and what else?

302
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,970
What else do you want to eat?

303
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,100
That will be enough.

304
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,850
Oh, Father…

305
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,730
- My sweet puppy…
- Father.

306
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,360
You better have a happy life.

307
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,190
Do not cry for me anymore.

308
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,900
Father…

309
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,410
But…

310
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,580
what is this "dried persimmon"?

311
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,590
A blind man?

312
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,920
Yes. He could not see.

313
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,010
After being swept away by the flood,

314
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,890
my skull that had been rolling around
the bottom of some still river water

315
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,010
was caught by a fisherman's net.

316
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,810
And that blind rascal

317
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,850
was delighted to find a spirit
with a bitter grudge

318
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,270
and bought it off him.

319
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,310
- And who was that man?
- Let me see…

320
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,070
His name was…

321
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,410
Yapper, that scoundrel!

322
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,700
I heard someone call him that.

323
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,910
- Yapper?
- Yes.

324
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,250
Then, the Association of the Blind
held me captive for all those years.

325
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,250
Only recently,
that blind rascal took me out

326
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,460
and told me
he would let me see my daughter

327
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,680
if I brought him royal blood.

328
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,890
<i>The Yapper…</i>

329
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,310
A character of your magnitude is rare.

330
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,770
Your spiritual energy is
certainly more enticing

331
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,560
than the energy of that lowly Yapper.

332
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,440
<i>The Eight-foot-tall Ghost</i>
<i>definitely mentioned that name before.</i>

333
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,780
<i>The blind Yapper…</i>

334
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,110
<i>Who could it be?</i>

335
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,420
Gosh. It has been over ten years
since I have been to the capital.

336
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,300
I do not know where anything is.

337
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,050
If I knew I would be here so soon,

338
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,630
I would have asked that Yoon Gap

339
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,340
where his house was beforehand.

340
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,720
I mean…

341
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,510
Master?

342
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,600
Master!

343
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,730
- Master--
- What are you doing, old man?

344
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,860
You cannot just pick up and eat
what does not belong to you!

345
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,150
Does it look like
I am running a charity here?

346
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,900
My goodness. My apologies.

347
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,070
My master was a bit hungry.

348
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,580
I will pay you for it.

349
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,750
Here.

350
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,920
I would appreciate
a discount on the rice cakes.

351
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,520
I only came to the capital because

352
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:46,230
you told me you managed to acquire all
the books that book peddler had bought up.

353
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,110
But what is this?

354
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,440
The book I am looking for is not here!

355
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,530
My lord,

356
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,160
I am just as frustrated.
Exactly which book are you looking for?

357
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,280
How can I find it if I do not know
what I am looking for?

358
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,920
Search again.

359
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,210
You must acquire

360
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,130
all the books that scoundrel
has ever touched, looked at,

361
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,090
or even walked past in the capital.

362
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,350
Is that how you do business?

363
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,100
I don't need your business!

364
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,250
Are you all right?

365
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,830
Yes.

366
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,710
You rotten scoundrel!

367
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,800
You better scram this instant!

368
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,220
Is there something up there?

369
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,010
I don't see anything.

370
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,390
- Do you see anything?
- Nothing but air.

371
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:04,310
I don't see anything.
Who is that fellow talking to?

372
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,360
Here you are, Master.

373
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,440
I was worried
how we would pay for the rice cakes.

374
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,740
Thank you for your generous offering.

375
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,410
Not at all. I owe you a great thanks.

376
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,290
I do not know why such things
have been happening to me recently.

377
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,000
There is no smoke without fire.

378
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,210
Pardon?

379
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,880
I managed to chase it away for now,

380
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,550
but it seems you partook
in the formation of a deep grudge.

381
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,640
I am afraid I do not understand.

382
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,730
Not even in the slightest.

383
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,940
You must face your sin and repent

384
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,020
to guide the bad energy out

385
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:55,490
if you do not want this to repeat.

386
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,610
I take refuge in Amitabha.
May Avalokitesvara show us mercy.

387
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,030
Master, let us go now.

388
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,750
Here we go.

389
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,220
What?

390
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,680
We must swiftly return
and report back to His Majesty.

391
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,390
She is in no state to ride a horse.

392
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,010
Go on ahead if it is so urgent.

393
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,560
What are you talking about?
We need to catch this Yapper.

394
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,980
He must know
that the curse has been broken now.

395
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,310
We need to hurry back.

396
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,730
Do you even know how you look right now?

397
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,940
You were already weak
after that curse a few days ago.

398
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,400
And you even let
that trifling wandering spirit in today.

399
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,950
This will not do. I shall go on ahead.

400
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,910
Do you think the name Yapper
is enough to find him?

401
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
The Association of the Blind
should know something.

402
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,920
You get some rest.

403
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,670
Yes, my lord. Don't let me keep you.

404
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,850
Such great magnanimity you possess.

405
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,560
Did you already forget
his curse almost killed you?

406
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,400
Being possessed is beyond draining.

407
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,690
Why would you offer yourself up?

408
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,360
He put us through that hell,
just so he could scold his daughter again?

409
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,450
How pathetic.

410
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,490
He is not pathetic in the slightest.

411
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,750
Mortals do not even live to be 100.

412
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,910
That daughter of his will die
and join him in just a few years.

413
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,460
Why was he being so fussy?

414
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,800
What? What now?

415
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,470
Do you not understand?

416
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:45,180
The fact we cannot even live 100 years
makes the grief that much more poignant.

417
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,890
Just because you consider
fleeting mortal lives to be lowly,

418
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,190
do not call the love
between a father and daughter…

419
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,770
lowly.

420
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,700
My grandma said…

421
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,240
that everyone in the world

422
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,960
was pitiful and tragic behind it all.

423
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,790
I was hoping I would never find out
what she was feeling

424
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,840
as she lived
that foolishly obstinate life…

425
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,230
Noble Elder.

426
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,320
Burn it all.

427
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,240
Yes, sir.

428
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,380
With the curse broken,

429
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,760
who knows what
that drowned ghost will blab about?

430
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,180
They will soon investigate
the Association of the Blind.

431
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,180
Move it!

432
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,970
My goodness!

433
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,930
- Goodness me!
- What is going on?

434
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,980
Wait. Stop. Why are you doing this?

435
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,150
Hold on. What is going on?

436
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,280
My word.

437
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,490
My lord,

438
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,200
what brings you
to our squalid corner of the world?

439
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,830
Apprehend all the fortune tellers
in the Association of the Blind!

440
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,160
That is a royal order!

441
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,540
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

442
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,060
<i>All the fortune tellers</i>
<i>will be dragged out.</i>

443
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,020
Investigate every corner of that place.

444
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,190
You must find evidence.

445
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:41,020
My goodness!

446
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,070
Please, spare me, my lord.

447
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,400
Who are you?

448
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,570
I am just a mere servant here.

449
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,700
I swear I do not know anything!

450
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,120
My lord! I swear I do not know anything!

451
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,120
My lord.

452
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,960
- My lord!
- Take him to the State Tribunal.

453
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,210
- Yes, my lord.
- My lord…

454
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,970
Announcing His Majesty!

455
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,730
I, your lowly blind subject,

456
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,890
offer my humblest greetings

457
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,360
to Your Divine Majesty!

458
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,650
Do you know someone called Yapper?

459
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,280
Your Majesty, did you say the Yapper?

460
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,790
I have never heard
of such a name before, Your Majesty.

461
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:43,960
If I find that you speak
even a single lie,

462
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,000
you will deal with the harshest
of consequences.

463
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:52,550
Why would this pitiful creature
ever lie to His Majesty?

464
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:56,100
Then, it is true you have been frequenting
the Queen Dowager's Palace?

465
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,720
Answer me!

466
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,230
When did those visits start?

467
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,150
Are you asking when Her Grace,

468
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:08,070
the noble and exalted Queen Dowager,
began to show this pitiful creature

469
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,860
some favor, Your Majesty?

470
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,240
Let me think…

471
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,860
Yes.

472
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:19,240
It began when the late king passed,
during the Year of the Water Rabbit.

473
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,250
The Year of the Water Rabbit?

474
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:25,170
Her Grace married into the royal line
at the most tender age of 17

475
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,210
and experienced the greatest tragedy.

476
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,920
You must be aware
of it as well, Your Majesty.

477
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:33,050
That heinous evil spirit.

478
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,680
Your Majesty must be careful as well.

479
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,810
If you do not,

480
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:43,350
Your Majesty will not be able
to avoid great misfortune.

481
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,940
I thoroughly searched
the association grounds,

482
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,280
but I failed to procure any evidence.

483
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,370
I questioned the other fortune tellers,

484
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,040
but none were familiar
with this Yapper character.

485
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,080
Unbelievable…

486
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,040
Will this be all right, Your Majesty?

487
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,630
The Queen Dowager is involved.

488
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,960
Yeo-ri would not have spoken carelessly.

489
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,920
One of them must be the Yapper.

490
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,800
Imprison all of them
and continue the interrogation.

491
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,100
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

492
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,940
- Two soups with rice.
- Coming right up.

493
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,980
I feel much better after some warm food.

494
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,820
- Bring out one more.
- Coming.

495
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,030
- No, that will not be necessary.
- All right.

496
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,490
Why? I can easily finish another.

497
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,790
Stop eating already.
Do you know how much this costs?

498
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,330
I might not have enough…

499
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,630
You will end up with terrible regret
if you are stingy with your patron deity.

500
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,470
- We are done here. Let us go.
- What?

501
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,340
What?

502
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,510
What?

503
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
Take care.

504
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,390
You are going back now?

505
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:10,350
My stomach is full and I feel renewed.
There is no reason to delay.

506
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,990
My word.

507
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,700
You want to ride a horse
through the rain this late?

508
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,740
Not a chance.

509
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,910
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

510
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,670
My goodness. Look at it come down.

511
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,920
It looks like a passing shower.

512
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,970
We can go when it stops.

513
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,440
Why…

514
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,240
are you looking at me like that?

515
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,780
How am I looking at you?

516
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,660
You are looking at me as if I were

517
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,750
someone you longed for.

518
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,050
Yoon Gap did indeed have feelings for you.

519
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,970
Perhaps,

520
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,300
this heart races

521
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,560
at a dizzying speed when I look at you
because it belongs to him.

522
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,230
Or perhaps, it is just a cruel joke
being played on me

523
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:13,640
because I have been trapped
in this mortal body.

524
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,610
Truth be told, I am not sure either.

525
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,690
That is my current state.

526
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,200
What about you?

527
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,030
What do you mean?

528
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,950
I have always been curious.

529
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,200
When you smile at me,

530
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,250
is it for me to see? Or…

531
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,630
is it intended for Yoon Gap?

532
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,430
We need this rain to stop
if we want to leave.

533
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,600
But the rain just shows
no signs of stopping.

534
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,690
Hold on.

535
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:58,230
You are an Imugi,
a deity that governs the weather.

536
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,860
- Don't tell me…
- My goodness.

537
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:06,070
Do you think an Imugi can just control
the world's weather as he sees fit?

538
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,370
Even an Imugi has his limits.

539
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,760
Hear me!

540
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:31,260
I am about to die of thirst here.
Bring me a cup of water!

541
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,440
How dare an imprisoned criminal
give out orders?

542
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,070
Be quiet!

543
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,320
Does a mere constable
dare to speak down to me?

544
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,030
For your sake,

545
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,450
I suggest you go fetch it, unless
you want to be cursed in your sleep.

546
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,960
All right?

547
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,380
Water.

548
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,500
Damn it.

549
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,960
Noble Elder, what is to become of us?

550
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:09,220
You just had to go after
that wretched queen.

551
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,430
Look at this mess we are all in.

552
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,390
Noble Elder,
you should come up with a plan.

553
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:16,560
- Yes.
- Yes, please think of a good one.

554
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,230
Did you forget who we were?

555
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:21,270
Anyone who is anyone in the capital

556
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,820
has benefited from our association
at least once.

557
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,530
Buddhist temples are not allowed
in the capital

558
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:30,780
and shamanistic rituals are only permitted
ten li past the city walls.

559
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,990
No matter what anyone says,

560
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,660
we fortune tellers have managed
to survive all these years.

561
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,660
Am I wrong?

562
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,790
- Sure.
- You are right. Yes.

563
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,590
No one will be able to touch us.

564
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,130
Your Majesty, you cannot.

565
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,130
The orison of the blind

566
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,800
is not some ploy that seeks
to harm the people.

567
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,180
Your Majesty even showed benevolence
to the lowly slaves.

568
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,810
Without evidence, how could you imprison

569
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:02,400
the blind fortune tellers, the vulnerable
and destitute members of our society?

570
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,810
What are you saying?

571
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,440
Someone has committed
an unspeakable act of the mystical arts

572
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:08,650
against the Queen.

573
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,200
Yet, you suggest we just let them go
because we should pity their blindness?

574
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,320
The Chief State Councillor is right.

575
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:18,540
The Queen was in mortal danger
because of that incident.

576
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,370
If there is any truth to the allegations,

577
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,920
rationale dictates that
they should be properly investigated

578
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,380
to expose their crimes for all to see.

579
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,090
However, all of you suggest
the association be freed

580
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,390
as if you had all conspired together.

581
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,140
Your Majesty.

582
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,350
Do you believe the Queen Dowager
utilized the association

583
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:46,610
to bring the Queen into harm's way?

584
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,740
I have yet to clarify as such.

585
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,660
Your Majesty.

586
00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:01,660
I hear the blind fortune tellers visited
the Queen Dowager to recite scriptures

587
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,000
for the late Prince Yeongin.

588
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,000
How is that, Your Majesty?

589
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:09,960
Did that help clear the air for you,
Your Majesty?

590
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:16,300
They sure love to quote
the words of Confucius and Mencius,

591
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:20,470
but all the scholar-officials of this
nation secretly nudge their wives

592
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,890
to have talismans and hexes crafted
to ensure their good fortunes.

593
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,650
If we open our mouths,

594
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,690
their depraved secrets
will spill out one by one.

595
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:29,860
Should we be shaking like a leaf?

596
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,150
Or should they be?

597
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,240
It's clearly them.

598
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,120
Where in the world could he be?

599
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,350
Grilled Abalone.

600
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,390
If you have phlegm, just spit it out.

601
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,560
Must you do that?

602
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,570
Stop calling me Grilled Abalone.

603
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,940
I am the Head Eunuch.
You should address me as such.

604
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,820
I may have been

605
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,200
explicitly and overly irritated

606
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,530
about your conduct and manners recently,

607
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:24,450
but that was because I did not know
who was actually in your body.

608
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:28,170
You lacked the knowledge of etiquette
and propriety of the mortal world.

609
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:32,170
Now, I truly understand
where you are coming from.

610
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:36,220
Thus, that is enough
of that abalone business.

611
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,550
And just address me
as "my lord" or "Head Eunuch."

612
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,470
Do you understand?

613
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:41,760
Good.

614
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:44,770
Then, I shall see you around.

615
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:50,230
Tell Yeo-ri I am hungry
and to wrap it up so we can go home.

616
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:52,360
- Head--
- There we go.

617
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,320
Grilled Abalone.

618
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,780
Grilled Abalone.

619
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,990
Grilled Abalone!

620
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:09,460
Are you saying you were unable to find
the blind fortune teller named Yapper?

621
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,500
That's right.

622
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,050
We even questioned
the slaves at the association,

623
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,670
but no fortune teller had such a name.

624
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,760
Besides his name,

625
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,600
did the ghost give you any other clues?

626
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,850
Because he was also sealed
for all those years,

627
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:28,270
he did not know much.

628
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:32,440
Forgive me for my shortcomings,
Your Majesty.

629
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:36,690
No.

630
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,910
You have saved my family
several times already.

631
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:43,700
You saved the Prince and the Queen.

632
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,950
You also saved the baby
in the Queen's womb, did you not?

633
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,080
I thank you.

634
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:57,170
About your maternal grandmother…

635
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,470
Did you say her name was Neop-deok?

636
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:02,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

637
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,600
Did she ever mention
that she visited the palace?

638
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:08,270
No, she did not.

639
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,020
Not even once?

640
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,020
My grandmother passed away
in the Year of the Water Rabbit.

641
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,400
I was just a child when she passed.

642
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,820
The Year of the Water Rabbit…

643
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,700
Shaman Neop-deok died
in the Year of the Water Rabbit?

644
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,330
Yes. In the fifth month of the year.

645
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,700
How did she pass?

646
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:41,800
I asked you how she died.

647
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,320
<i>It was an accident.</i>

648
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:02,530
She fell into the sea during a ritual.

649
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,620
Your Majesty.

650
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:18,840
You may leave now.

651
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,660
My goodness. Do something.

652
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,500
I cannot believe this.

653
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,050
So clumsy.

654
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,490
What are you mad about now?

655
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,990
I also heard the news.

656
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,790
They failed to locate Yapper.

657
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:35,460
He managed to kill a prince
of this nation without hesitation.

658
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,040
Did you think
they would get him after one try?

659
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:40,920
They will find him soon.

660
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,670
Do not be too discouraged.

661
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,260
Yeo-ri.

662
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,050
Yeo-ri!

663
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:56,390
I went through hell catching that damn
drowned ghost because you asked me to.

664
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,310
I dealt with foolish mortals
even when they disgust me.

665
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,650
I did all that for you.
What could you possibly be mad at now?

666
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:04,650
Why are you treating me so coldly?

667
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:11,070
You are right. You did all those things.

668
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,700
However,

669
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,290
that was all
so I would accept you as my patron deity.

670
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:17,410
In order for you to ascend as a dragon.

671
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,500
And that is our deal.

672
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,380
Yes.

673
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,130
Thus, I am trying my best
to keep that promise.

674
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,550
I will also keep that promise,
no matter what.

675
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:31,680
I will properly serve you
as my patron deity,

676
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,180
and until the day you ascend as a dragon,

677
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,350
I shall pray with both hands and feet.

678
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,730
However, that is as far as I go.

679
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,810
I will do just that and nothing more.

680
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,980
Thus, you should do just
as much and nothing more.

681
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,900
Whether I am fatigued or not,

682
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,030
or whether I drop
my eyeglass chest or not,

683
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,070
do not meddle yourself.

684
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,410
Do not look at me like that either.

685
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,050
I am certain there is an instigator.

686
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:11,800
How else could they move
in such perfect unison?

687
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,720
However, it cannot be the Queen Dowager.

688
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,310
This is not how she operates.

689
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:19,020
Your Majesty.

690
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,610
You should release the members
of the Association of the Blind.

691
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,400
Chief State Councillor!

692
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,650
I, too, wish to punish the one responsible

693
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,360
in the most merciless way.

694
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:34,240
However,

695
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,620
there is no definitive evidence
to convince the court.

696
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,920
I put you in charge of that investigation
to find that very evidence.

697
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:48,170
In no way, am I trying to side
with the Queen Dowager.

698
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,590
If someone had conjured a nasty hex
against the royal bloodline,

699
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,550
then, the biggest victim
with the deepest wound

700
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,770
would be the Queen Dowager.

701
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,770
Her influence in the court
is quite formidable.

702
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:08,190
I fear this may lead…

703
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:11,240
to vicious backlash.

704
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:49,900
Your Majesty,
the Association of the Blind members

705
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,030
were just released
from the State Tribunal.

706
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:55,450
Are you certain
we should release them like this?

707
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:57,700
That is why evidence…

708
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:03,580
As of today, I am sure of it,
more than ever.

709
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:07,210
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost has a puppeteer.

710
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:12,210
But who could that be?

711
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,930
Investigate the association further.

712
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:23,980
I must catch the Yapper first.

713
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,200
Hey, grab me that towel.

714
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:57,880
It appears I have made a grave mistake.

715
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,010
Handing over of towels
is not a part of our deal. Our deal…

716
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:05,390
does not go that far.

717
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,310
I have committed a terrible breach.

718
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:08,650
I am truly, terribly sorry.

719
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:11,110
- Move.
- I am so sorry, I could die.

720
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:12,400
Move.

721
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:18,700
She could have just walked around me.
She just had to…

722
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,970
Grandma.

723
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:43,930
I…

724
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,730
was smiling at him.

725
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,320
<i>I was looking at the man who killed you</i>

726
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,740
<i>and smiling.</i>

727
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,290
I thought I was just confused.

728
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,290
I really believed that was why…

729
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:11,670
I'm sorry, Grandma.

730
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:17,460
Did Gangcheori really kill Neop-deok?

731
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:20,510
Hey, you were eavesdropping?

732
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:24,550
You were latched on to the Queen Dowager.
Why are you here now?

733
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,430
You promised to buy me new shoes
and you did not.

734
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,600
Thus, I will latch on to you

735
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:36,020
and torment you
with steadfast persistence.

736
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,980
Fine.

737
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:40,070
I hear you.
Can you just leave me alone now?

738
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,240
Leave now.
I will buy them for you tomorrow morning.

739
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,660
I am in no mood
to deal with you right now.

740
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,290
Hold on.

741
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:50,000
But how do you know my grandma?

742
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,540
Because I met her.

743
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,880
I told you I was older than your grandma.

744
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,170
Do you just not listen to me?

745
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:58,710
You met her? At the palace?

746
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,960
When?

747
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,220
So, that was…

748
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:05,390
Let me think.

749
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:08,100
Right. The fourth month
of the Year of the Water Rabbit.

750
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:12,140
That was a month before she passed away.

751
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,230
Was she really at the palace then?

752
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:16,940
That's what I said.

753
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,230
She came to the palace,

754
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,650
then left with some members
of the royal family.

755
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,320
So I followed them.

756
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,110
I hid nearby and saw everything.

757
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,790
Neop-deok and the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
made a mess in some temple courtyard.

758
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,500
What did you just say?

759
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:38,920
Ma'am, where did Gang…

760
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,340
I mean, where is Lord Yoon Gap?

761
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,220
He just left for some errand.
Did you not see him?

762
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,260
What is the matter?

763
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:48,050
I just remembered an urgent errand.
Please go ahead and sleep.

764
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,140
Where are you…

765
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,310
My goodness.
What if a night guard catches you?

766
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:00,320
<i>In the end, Neop-deok was able to</i>
<i>overpower the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.</i>

767
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,950
But I am pretty sure that ghost ended up
going after her to get his revenge.

768
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,330
The more I learn about a maiden's mind,
the less I know about it.

769
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:15,540
She is charming me
with her smile one moment

770
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,750
and bringing forth a blizzard the next.

771
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:20,920
The midwinter northern wind
has nothing on her.

772
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,880
Charming who? You?

773
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:25,340
As if you were mortal?

774
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,010
It is just a figure of speech.

775
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:32,060
Then, you can just stop here.

776
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,600
Just stop being that brat's patron deity.

777
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,560
What?

778
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,110
Do you regret it?

779
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:44,320
What are you talking about?

780
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,030
Back then, when you told that brat…

781
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,160
you killed her grandmother.

782
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,670
Geez. I told you no.

783
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,670
My goodness.

784
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,970
You cannot seek an audience
with him at this hour.

785
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,800
I must see His Majesty now.

786
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:11,760
It is regarding the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

787
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:12,850
Eight…

788
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:16,060
Did something else happen?

789
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,520
So…

790
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,940
what brings you here this late?

791
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,190
Your Majesty.

792
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:26,320
In the Year of the Water Rabbit,
the year you ascended the throne,

793
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,070
was the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
at the palace?

794
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,830
Was a member of the royal family back then

795
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:36,120
possessed by the Eight-foot-tall Ghost?

796
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:43,590
That is a private matter
of the royal family.

797
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:45,300
I cannot give you an answer.

798
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,670
No. I must know.

799
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,260
I must know when
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost first appeared

800
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,390
and who was responsible for its grudge.

801
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,600
I must.

802
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,850
Please, answer me, Your Majesty.

803
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,280
If you refuse to tell me the truth,

804
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:10,280
I will no longer be able

805
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:12,620
to assist Your Majesty.

806
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:18,790
Fine.

807
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:21,580
It was here.

808
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:25,500
During those horrific times…

809
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,300
Even back then…

810
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:31,930
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost was here.

811
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,640
That damn evil spirit…

812
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,100
took hold…

813
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,230
of the late king…

814
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,570
my father.

815
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,330
I believe that damn evil spirit…

816
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,580
also killed my grandmother.

817
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,550
<i>It was not Gangcheori.</i>

818
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,010
<i>It was the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.</i>

819
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:15,430
<i>The Eight-foot-tall Ghost</i>
<i>killed my grandma.</i>

820
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:23,270
Draw me a hot bath first.

821
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:27,110
My body stinks
after rolling around in that filth.

822
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:28,940
Yes, sir.

823
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:49,460
Yapper, you scoundrel!

824
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,170
My goodness! My lordship!

825
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,810
My goodness…

826
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,520
Please show me mercy, my lordship.

827
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:08,560
I know things
did not turn out well this time.

828
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:10,440
I am terribly upset about it as well!

829
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:14,780
Even in the afterlife,
I will not forget the great kindness

830
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,110
you have shown me
when you saved me this time.

831
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,950
But, you do not need to worry.

832
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,660
The Warrior Deity has a plan.

833
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:25,000
He has a brilliant plan to catch

834
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,710
those rascals and heal
all his injuries in one swoop.

835
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:39,800
Wait. You cannot.

836
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:41,600
No!

837
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,520
My lordship, you cannot!

838
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,600
Wait, my lordship! My lordship!

839
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,310
Please stop, my lordship!

840
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,650
Please stop!

841
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:54,190
Please stop, my lordship.

842
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:58,030
My goodness… No…

843
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,740
That will anger the Warrior Deity.

844
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:04,410
My lordship, you cannot…

845
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,210
My goodness. My lord…

846
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:09,460
I could not care less

847
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:10,920
about what a ghost does.

848
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:12,800
I pulled you from that nasty market

849
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,670
where you conjured hexes with the ghosts
of the children you starved,

850
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,090
and brought you all the way up here.

851
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,340
After making a complete mess
of everything,

852
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:23,140
you still seek out the Warrior Deity?

853
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:27,640
Who do you serve? Do you serve that ghost?

854
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,650
Or do you serve me?

855
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:32,270
Of course, I serve you, my lordship.

856
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,820
I will stay loyal

857
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,780
to your lordship until my dying breath.

858
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:41,160
My lordship. The month grace period

859
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,370
you granted me last time is not over yet.

860
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:47,330
I promise I will end
the prince's life by then.

861
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:49,460
Fine.

862
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,080
If you fail to take care of this by then,

863
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:55,210
I shall end your life with my bare hands.

864
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:07,770
My lordship!

865
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:08,980
That damn eyeglass artisan!

866
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:10,690
The wench who ruined everything!

867
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:14,690
She is of the same bloodline
as that shaman.

868
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,150
She shares a bloodline
with Shaman Neop-deok!

869
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,560
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM YOUNG-KWANG

870
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:07,660
<i>Why did you not tell me</i>

871
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:10,830
that it was the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
who killed my grandma and not you?

872
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:12,420
<i>I told you to keep your mouth shut.</i>

873
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,710
Why would you tell Yeo-ri that?

874
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:16,290
It appears you were worried about her.

875
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,880
<i>I am certain they like each other.</i>

876
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,880
If we can just briefly hold
that Imugi captive,

877
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:24,550
<i>we can easily take care of that Yeo-ri.</i>

878
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,390
<i>Every nobleman over 60 had</i>
<i>the same talisman with them.</i>

879
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:29,810
<i>I cannot summon the wind?</i>

880
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:31,640
<i>I have your mother.</i>

881
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:33,560
<i>If you wish to save her,</i>
<i>come to the abandoned house.</i>

882
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,020
<i>What is the meaning of this?</i>

883
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,940
<i>Save me, Gangcheori. Please.</i>

884
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:41,990
