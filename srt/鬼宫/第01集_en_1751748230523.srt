1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
(This story is purely fictional)

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,420
(Filming of child actors and animals follows safety regulations)

3
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,270
Jiang Chaoli was originally a dragon

4
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,360
At the bottom of the deep pool

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,070
After a thousand years of hard training, he finally ascended to heaven

6
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,540
However

7
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,000
He suffered misfortune

8
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,760
If a mortal sees the dragon that is transcending the tribulation

9
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,970
You will lose your destiny

10
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,230
Will definitely fall into the body of a dragon again

11
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,440
Heaven is ruthless and God's will does not allow for a single ounce of luck

12
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,990
His thousand years of hard work were destroyed in an instant.

13
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,910
Falling into the mortal world

14
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,410
Because of the cruelty of fate, a child accidentally saw

15
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,250
therefore

16
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,750
Jiang Chaoli to Humanity

17
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,920
Hate it to the core

18
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,190
Rumor has it that Jiang Chaoli passed through the place

19
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,070
Even the autumn harvest season will turn into spring cold and barrenness for a reason

20
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,700
Jiang Chaoli is really a terrible evil god

21
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,161
He just had bad luck.

22
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,038
Why vent your anger on innocent people?

23
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,707
Wait until I become a great witch

24
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,792
We must teach him a lesson

25
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,090
Tell him not to set foot in the village again

26
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,250
Shhh

27
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,720
This is not allowed

28
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,430
You can't use this method to deal with him.

29
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,640
If you really meet him

30
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,310
You must run away without looking back.

31
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,810
It is well known that Jiang Chao picks on people like you.

32
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,230
The witch with high moral character and pure soul took action

33
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,030
So you have to escape

34
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,490
Promise me

35
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,700
Promise now

36
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,820
(13 years later)

37
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,530
Go away…

38
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,120
Stay away from me!

39
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,290
No, Your Highness, please stop.

40
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,130
Ouch…

41
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,150
You actually want me to summon a witch to the palace to set up an altar and perform a ritual

42
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,530
Exorcise evil spirits?

43
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,490
Please forgive me for daring to speak out

44
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,570
But this is related to your majesty's duty of loyalty to the world

45
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,160
The royal doctor is doing his best

46
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,160
Working day and night in the dark to develop a solution

47
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,620
But even the famous doctor

48
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,500
I was helpless and had no results for several months.

49
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,580
Only one explanation remains

50
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,340
That's evil doing.

51
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,010
Evil spirits are nothing but an imbalance of yin and yang!

52
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,090
His Majesty!

53
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,810
What are you looking at?

54
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,270
Is there something on it?

55
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,240
I didn't see anything. What's wrong with you?

56
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,240
The adults are still waiting. Follow me.

57
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,130
Can you see this word clearly?

58
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,420
Too blurry to see clearly

59
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,610
Then try using glasses

60
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,990
Oh my god, this is the word "Huan" which means glory.

61
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,750
See clearly. See clearly.

62
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,580
let me see…

63
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,040
I have been looking forward to reading this book for a long time

64
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,840
Unfortunately, due to poor eyesight, I had to put it aside.

65
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,970
But now...

66
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,100
I finally got to read it myself

67
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,230
This girl's glasses are famous in the local area.

68
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,730
I have tried lenses made by famous craftsmen all over the world.

69
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,440
Everything pales in comparison to this

70
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,400
My eyes, which had been confused for half a lifetime, have regained clarity.

71
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,490
This girl is really talented

72
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,590
I dare to ask this government

73
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,260
Are any children sick?

74
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,550
My poor child

75
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,470
Hold on

76
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,640
Do you see anything?

77
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,810
Is there any way to save his young lady?

78
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,150
What did you say?

79
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,400
Rescue kindness?

80
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,520
grown ups

81
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,190
This child is a descendant of Nerd.

82
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,990
Who is Ned?

83
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,280
That was the time when I was treated

84
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,830
The old lady's witch

85
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,910
Are you a witch too?

86
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,830
I'm not a psychic.

87
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Just smell

88
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,960
The smell of medicine being boiled in the palace

89
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,100
Send this item secretly to Song Daren, the governor of Gyeonggi Province

90
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,060
I pay my respects to Mr. Choi Won-woo.

91
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,270
Persuade him to join our camp

92
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,480
Absolutely not

93
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,280
Leaked news

94
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,490
Yes, Your Majesty

95
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,700
I am just returning home

96
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,200
Visiting the ancestral graves

97
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,040
Although weak

98
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,380
But it is undoubtedly a vengeful spirit

99
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,760
The young lady in the mansion suddenly developed a strange disease

100
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,340
This thing must be causing trouble

101
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,640
My child, don't...

102
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,390
Oh! Kindness!

103
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,140
No, this is impossible.

104
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,350
The poor lady was doomed to die.

105
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,020
My poor child...

106
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,980
This is the sin of the ancestors

107
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,120
If people knew their sins in their previous lives

108
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,700
Will not end with death

109
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,710
Descendants still have to bear the consequences of their sins

110
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,170
Will the world be less absurd?

111
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,380
What should I do? The lady is vomiting blood!

112
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,010
Where is the doctor?

113
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,020
I want

114
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,180
Drink water

115
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,020
Drink water?

116
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,070
Hang on, I'll be right back.

117
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,050
Get out of here quickly

118
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,210
impossible

119
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,380
Her father destroyed my legs

120
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,840
And took my life

121
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,050
At least she can accompany me

122
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,470
Go to hell!

123
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,290
Even the bran tastes so sweet

124
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,830
What a poor fellow

125
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,920
Who are you?

126
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,010
Soul

127
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,180
I pity you

128
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,010
I feel deeply sorry for your misfortune

129
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,520
How dare a girl who is not even a witch to show mercy to me!

130
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,150
Don't you understand yet?

131
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,570
I don't want to save those who have been living in luxury since childhood.

132
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,860
Noble Lady

133
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,410
I want to save

134
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,080
It's you

135
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,490
What?

136
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,160
The deeper the karma

137
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,580
Will eventually become an evil spirit

138
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,460
Sins will torment you like leeches

139
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,920
Force you to commit more evil deeds

140
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,420
And you will be trapped in the nine heavens forever

141
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,840
No rebirth

142
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,350
This is true

143
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,350
Is it what you wish?

144
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Yeah?

145
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,570
There's still time

146
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,280
Let me help you

147
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,070
Come

148
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,450
Don't try to trick me

149
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,500
You have even given up your life as a witch, how can a lowly servant like you help me?

150
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,250
He possessed her in an instant.

151
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,500
How could a mere remnant spirit be so fast?

152
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,790
impossible…

153
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,300
I'm going to kill this bitch.

154
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,920
Take her to hell!

155
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,310
stop!

156
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,600
What is that?

157
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,060
How can it be so powerful...

158
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,520
Let me go! Let go!

159
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,100
It must be extremely painful

160
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,110
Get out of her body quickly

161
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,520
Don't irritate me anymore

162
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,020
Come out to me!

163
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,140
What's going on?

164
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,390
I really sympathize with you.

165
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,560
Do you need my help?

166
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,100
Just open your mouth

167
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,650
I'm happy to help

168
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
That's right

169
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,660
Just open your mouth

170
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,740
That's right.

171
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,670
Get lost

172
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,440
Just a little bit...

173
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,370
Why does my stomach feel so uncomfortable today?

174
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,210
How strange…

175
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,960
What's going on?

176
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,090
Oh my god wait

177
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,680
Who is this lady?

178
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,850
Who are you?

179
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,270
Oh my god

180
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,770
Isn't this Miss Choi In-sun?

181
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,150
Miss, wake up!

182
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,400
Why are you coming out dressed like this? Miss!

183
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,410
Miss!

184
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,780
Are you okay?

185
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,370
What did you say?

186
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,580
She can't even walk by herself.

187
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,790
Where can I go?

188
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,380
What are you still standing there for?

189
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,510
Send someone to search around immediately!

190
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,670
Yes, sir.

191
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,310
Miss…

192
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,310
grown ups

193
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,030
Kindness! Miss!

194
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,110
What's going on?

195
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
How come you brought my kindness back?

196
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,080
This man saved me.

197
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,080
You saved my daughter?

198
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,920
Not me

199
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,420
The one who saved her was...

200
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,180
I just found her unconscious and escorted her back

201
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,220
Ruli

202
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,760
Ruli...

203
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,390
Is your neck okay?

204
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,400
It must be painful

205
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,030
The backlash of the vengeful spirit is not pleasant

206
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,110
Want me to help take a look?

207
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,700
I hate humans

208
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,540
But I can make an exception for you.

209
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,760
But you are really extraordinary

210
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,100
With only a peach wood branch, he doesn't even have a decent magic weapon.

211
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,680
Easily suppress the evil spirits

212
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,680
I didn't see the wrong person.

213
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,190
I'm never wrong

214
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,860
Such a pure spiritual essence, such a rare root...

215
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,650
As long as you speak

216
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,320
I will be your patron saint and help you become a great witch

217
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,240
Can preside over national sacrifices

218
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,870
Scared?

219
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,910
It seems that you at least recognize this soul-soothing stone.

220
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,370
You have the guts to speak so brazenly...

221
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,500
Stop acting.

222
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,880
I know you gave that one-legged ghost supernatural powers

223
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,670
Do you think I don't know? Are you planning to borrow his power?

224
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,430
Steal the Soul Stone and possess me again

225
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,440
Since we know it clearly

226
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,530
Better to complete me

227
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,860
As the saying goes, ten years can make a world of difference.

228
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,120
Now 13 years have passed.

229
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,420
I almost convinced that one-legged ghost

230
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,250
He wandered for many years between the nine days

231
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,760
I could have resolved the resentment

232
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,720
But you ruined it all

233
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,840
So I hate you

234
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,510
You are shameless and despicable

235
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,850
Disrespect for Heaven and Earth and No Concern for the People

236
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,270
You are such an evil god

237
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,230
Jiangchaoli

238
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,440
My first meeting with Jiang Chaoli

239
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,610
When I was 13 years old

240
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,890
stop!

241
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,810
Oh my god

242
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,480
Ruli

243
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,440
grandmother

244
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,650
What's wrong?

245
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,700
There is a black dragon...

246
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,780
Always follow me

247
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,790
Black dragon?

248
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:15,920
In the tide of the river!

249
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,970
Jiang Chaoli?

250
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,970
Did you hear that? Jiang Chaoli is here!

251
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,640
The evil god Jiang Chaoli is chasing Ruli!

252
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,640
Oh my god, our village is in trouble.

253
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,350
not good!

254
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,110
The curse caused by man

255
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,320
It needs to be exorcised by someone with strong spiritual power.

256
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,320
Legend has it that if there is a person like you who is noble and pure

257
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:44,740
Willing to accept Jiaolong as the patron saint

258
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,870
Pray sincerely to the sky

259
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,460
The dragon can then transform into a dragon and ascend to heaven again.

260
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,300
This is the soul stone.

261
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,090
This is the Dragon King's Stone

262
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,430
You have to treat it as your own

263
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,060
Soul Stone

264
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,890
Can drive away evil spirits

265
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,230
Not only can it block the river tide

266
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,520
It can also stop many wandering ghosts

267
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,860
This stone will keep you safe

268
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,660
Cleanse the soul

269
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,240
Cleanse the soul

270
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,330
Standing on impurity

271
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,710
Welcome the Dragon King

272
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:42,010
Bless the prince's good fortune

273
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,220
Prayers grow with blessings

274
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,310
grandmother

275
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,030
grandmother!

276
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,500
grandmother!

277
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,020
After the accident

278
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,730
They call me the human bridge

279
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,520
"Human Bridge"

280
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,900
That is, "using corpses as bridges"

281
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,160
This is the God's fight against the witch summoner.

282
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,950
No! Stop it!

283
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,120
stop!

284
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,660
Get up!

285
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,330
All because of you!

286
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,210
It was you who brought the tide of the river into the village, and now the village is plagued by misfortunes

287
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,590
That's why Ned Po ended up like this.

288
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,800
No

289
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,760
No… that’s not the case!

290
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,760
This is how Jiang Chaoli managed to take my grandmother away

291
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,640
That's my last relative.

292
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,020
Do you understand now?

293
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,770
Mortals cannot resist God

294
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,450
Wouldn't it be better if you had listened to my advice earlier?

295
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,740
You should throw away that broken soul stone

296
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,120
Accept me

297
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,690
You little devil...

298
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,540
You are so brave.

299
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,790
I…

300
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,380
Just a powerless mortal

301
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:24,050
But I will never serve an evil god like you.

302
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,180
Even if I am shattered into dust...

303
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,390
It will never be like this

304
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,980
This is my revenge

305
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,570
grandmother

306
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,790
Your resting place is so comfortable

307
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,870
Why have you never come to visit your granddaughter once?

308
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,380
How can you…

309
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,510
Never come to see me once?

310
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,190
Queen Consort, you can't do that.

311
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,530
Queen, get out of the way

312
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,610
Concubine

313
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,070
I haven't seen my grandson for three months.

314
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,410
Strict palace rules

315
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,830
I think he is not fulfilling his duty and I am afraid he is depressed.

316
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,210
So as a grandmother I decided to visit

317
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,050
When the queen heard that her nephew was seriously ill, she became sick with worry.

318
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,050
This is the medicine made by the famous imperial doctor. It should be able to cure his illness.

319
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Wind chill…

320
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,480
He had a severe cold.

321
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,810
I'm worried that he might pass the disease on to the Queen Mother.

322
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,150
Please... Wind chill?

323
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,070
My pure queen

324
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,910
Even the lies are so bad.

325
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,370
How can I survive in this cannibalistic palace?

326
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,120
What are you still standing there for? The medicine is almost cold!

327
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,550
Open the door

328
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,380
The Queen Mother is...

329
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,470
immediately!

330
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:41,390
His Majesty has arrived!

331
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,980
Concubine

332
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,590
It is a great pleasure for Your Majesty to see you.

333
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,100
You even put aside your official duties to visit the sick prince.

334
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,560
The Queen Mother is so caring for him, I admire her very much.

335
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,600
I am...

336
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,900
What's that sound?

337
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:55,010
Whenever the disease worsened, he suffered unbearable pain.

338
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,930
This is such a heart-wrenching scene that I cannot bear to see...

339
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,050
Stop talking!

340
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,170
Your Majesty, is your Majesty all right?

341
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,550
Your Majesty is right.

342
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,550
This palace is still

343
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,890
Please leave first.

344
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,690
Oh my god

345
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,880
Are you okay?

346
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,630
Please forgive me

347
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,760
You did a great job

348
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,800
Go get treatment.

349
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,900
If the Queen realizes the truth

350
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,320
What should we do?

351
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,990
She didn't see it with her own eyes

352
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,910
Can't tell yet

353
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,080
Don't worry too much, Queen.

354
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,060
Are you leaving now? So soon?

355
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,510
I haven't replied yet

356
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:52,140
Your Majesty's Letter

357
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,730
Sir, you have already replied

358
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,440
Yeah?

359
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,320
Although you were once a left-wing minister

360
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
But I am sincere to you

361
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,740
I am just a minor official in the palace

362
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,660
You still confide in me

363
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,790
This is not for me

364
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,870
But for His Majesty

365
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,000
That's right.

366
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,170
But even so, it does not mean that I am willing to assist His Majesty

367
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,010
But your heart is shaken after all, right?

368
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,300
This is a matter of national importance to North Korea

369
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,890
This may lead to opposition from the scholars.

370
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:33,310
Why does Your Majesty insist on doing this impossible thing?

371
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,390
His Majesty…

372
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,690
I firmly believe that as long as you help me, this matter will be successful.

373
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:58,420
I heard that adults are looking for this thing

374
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,130
I didn't see anything valuable, just some corrective lenses.

375
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,510
Why are you looking for this?

376
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,180
You looked inside? What?

377
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:17,690
I heard that the mirror maker had a hot temper.

378
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,690
Rashly handing her belongings to adults

379
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,650
Something may be wrong

380
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,650
Don't worry

381
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:30,870
Ruli and I were from the same village since childhood.

382
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,330
Like a sister

383
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,210
Like a sister?

384
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,680
Please stay

385
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,520
Are you Yin Jia from Longtan Village?

386
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:00,520
Oh my god, how many years has it been?

387
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,610
You got the wrong person.

388
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,860
That lowly bastard

389
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,830
How did you get out of Lord Cui Yuanyou's house?

390
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,790
Come on

391
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,130
Take a look

392
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,050
Are you kidding me, ma'am?

393
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,300
This ox horn costs a full ounce?

394
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,180
I heard that the village blacksmith bought one for only three cents yesterday.

395
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,180
The selling price is set by the seller!

396
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,810
I ran into the witch of doom early in the morning...

397
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,610
Auntie, do you want me to tell you what true misfortune is?

398
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:51,530
Listen carefully to the call of the eight souls, evil spirits, wandering souls and wronged ghosts

399
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,490
Perched on the main pillar of your house day and night

400
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,660
First make you sick

401
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,460
Cut off your bloodline

402
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,290
The whole family died

403
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,130
This is the real bad luck

404
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,420
What did you say?

405
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,250
How dare you threaten me!

406
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,760
Or that spirit over there staring at you...

407
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,050
It's your mother-in-law who drowned a few years ago.

408
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,520
If you want to call it "bad luck", there must be a drowning ghost

409
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,520
I'll have to live in your toilet, right?

410
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,900
never mind

411
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,320
Even if someone offered me sacrificial rice, I wouldn't want that!

412
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,240
You don't want to?

413
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,900
This is ridiculous.

414
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,990
I'll sell it to you for three cents. Take it if you want it.

415
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,500
-How about some premium scrub powder? What?

416
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,920
I'm a frequent visitor here.

417
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,090
See you next time

418
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,750
Hey you...

419
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,720
Hey, sprinkle some salt where she stood.

420
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,850
For so many years, you have been so stubborn

421
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,600
It hasn't changed at all.

422
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,950
Have you forgotten who I am?

423
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,120
Young Master Jia?

424
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,880
Long time no see Ruli

425
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,420
Are you ok?

426
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,470
A little to the side

427
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,630
That’s right, turn to the right, that’s it!

428
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,300
Twist over there.

429
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,760
Slightly to the side

430
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,390
Turn around a little bit

431
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,140
No problem, that's it.

432
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,770
Yes, that's where

433
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,810
Why are you alone again?

434
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,650
That's right.

435
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,780
It's right there. Turn around.

436
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,280
Are they ostracizing you again?

437
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,070
That's not the case.

438
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,370
Wait and don't move

439
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,710
I'll pick you the biggest and reddest persimmon from that tree.

440
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,170
Why does he always look at me with a smile?

441
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,640
Just a little more

442
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,560
Come on, no, that's not it...

443
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,270
A little further to the side

444
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,610
This is not right, not that side

445
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:33,780
Young Master, come down quickly! Quickly!

446
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,610
What? I don't want persimmons anymore

447
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,990
Forget it!

448
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,320
Don't worry

449
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,870
A small matter

450
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,000
Look

451
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,380
No, is he okay?

452
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,690
See?

453
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,940
I'm totally fine.

454
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,950
It seems you are doing well.

455
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,830
Now he is considered an official, right?

456
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,080
That's right.

457
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,330
Your prediction back then really came true.

458
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,750
I, a useless bastard, actually became an official

459
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:38,840
Then you should believe in the Dragon King and the spirits now.

460
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,470
But I heard that you became a mirror maker instead of a witch.

461
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,270
Where did you hear that?

462
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,940
Master Choi Wonwoo mentioned you

463
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,850
I stayed at his house for some time.

464
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,650
Is this yours?

465
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,940
I've always wanted to take it.

466
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,330
Lord Cui is very satisfied with the mirror you made.

467
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,080
Speaking of which…

468
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,290
Could you give me a pair, too?

469
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,460
You don't need

470
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,920
Who is that for?

471
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,430
His Majesty

472
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,810
That's right.

473
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,690
Although there are many skilled craftsmen

474
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,320
But recommending the imperial craftsmen in the palace cannot be done casually.

475
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,030
I can be praised for recommending talented people

476
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,620
You will be honored to become the Imperial Mirror Maker

477
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,490
Killing two birds with one stone

478
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,670
But going to Hanyang suddenly is a bit...

479
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:54,790
Hanyang?

480
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,670
Hanyang?

481
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,960
It's really depressing

482
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,930
Can't go

483
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,930
Do you know how terrible Hanyang is?

484
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,720
Even if your eyes are wide open, you can still be deceived

485
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,770
They can rob you right before your eyes.

486
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:17,020
The scoundrels there

487
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,530
You, a country girl, can swallow it all in two or three bites.

488
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,530
Hanyang is so scary...

489
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,450
What happened?

490
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,290
fine

491
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,750
I thought I heard a dog barking

492
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,750
dog?

493
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,290
Have a dog?

494
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,880
"Evil spirit" is bad enough, now you call me "dog"?

495
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,550
Is there a dog barking?

496
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,300
I didn't hear anything

497
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,550
It's best not to hear this kind of barking

498
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:49,890
You...

499
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,270
You stupid brain!

500
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,930
He is lying to you!

501
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,820
I forgot I had a pair of glasses that I needed urgently.

502
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,280
Must we do it now?

503
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,870
For urgent matters please...

504
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,160
Excuse me

505
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,410
Ruli

506
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:18,830
I hope

507
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,630
You can stay with me this time

508
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:24,800
I don't want you to answer immediately.

509
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,760
I will stay in the tavern for a few days.

510
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,090
Let me know when you decide.

511
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Okay?

512
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:49,160
What an annoying guy.

513
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,210
you say

514
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,420
Don't try to trick me.

515
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,000
No tricks allowed

516
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,800
What's up with your sudden hysteria?

517
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,340
What did you lie to me, sir?

518
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:10,340
you say

519
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:15,220
Where did your spiritual power go?

520
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,140
You really don't know?

521
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:21,150
He has no intention of bringing you into the palace as a mirror maker.

522
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,480
He doesn't care whether you are dead or alive.

523
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:28,570
He just wants to use you to achieve his own ambitions.

524
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:33,660
Adults don't do that.

525
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,120
So naive

526
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,710
How could you trust him so blindly?

527
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:42,630
You don't know what's going on in the palace, yet you dare to speak so brazenly?

528
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,090
What's in the palace?

529
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,510
What else?

530
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,560
That place is filled with gloom.

531
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,730
Evil Spirits…

532
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,480
What? What do you want?

533
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,780
Although I don't know the reason

534
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:08,530
But you

535
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,610
Scared

536
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,660
So it happened suddenly

537
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,740
I didn't

538
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:19,040
Then I have to go

539
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:21,460
That can scare you so much

540
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,540
It certainly won't hurt me.

541
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:29,970
This little devil...

542
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:35,930
no

543
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,480
It's not that I particularly want to go.

544
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,520
only

545
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,100
The adults spoke sincerely

546
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:48,280
Besides, I still owe him a favor because of what happened before.

547
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,240
Besides

548
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,450
I'm tired of being alone

549
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:06,340
A sign?

550
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,170
Oh my god!

551
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:11,510
What?

552
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:14,360
Why do you close your eyes?

553
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,450
grown ups

554
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,580
Your attitude

555
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,870
I almost peed my pants.

556
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:27,620
You are so hypocritical.

557
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,640
Uncle

558
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,890
Jingyun, why are you here?

559
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:50,480
I'm here because I have something important to discuss.

560
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,050
Why is your Excellency here?

561
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,340
Everything has changed

562
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:18,550
Only this persimmon tree remains the same

563
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,050
That's it

564
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,850
The place where you used to sit

565
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:26,480
Do you still remember such trivial matters?

566
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:36,070
Do you still remember that agreement?

567
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,030
I said I'd come back to you

568
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:47,250
Come with me, Ruli

569
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,380
My omens have never been wrong

570
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,460
The adults will be fine.

571
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:02,300
I will never let anyone be taken away by the river tide again

572
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:04,600
So…

573
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,620
grown ups!

574
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,050
Are you okay? I'm fine.

575
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:12,310
I'm sorry for putting you through this.

576
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,480
but…

577
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:22,730
Isn’t that weird?

578
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,610
It should take three days to walk from Longtan Village to Hanyang

579
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:31,280
We have been wandering around for two days

580
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,950
Beyond that mountain is the capital.

581
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:36,830
It's almost like...

582
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,380
Like what?

583
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,050
It seems like someone is blocking us from entering the palace

584
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:47,880
How could anyone do that?

585
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,680
We must have taken the wrong path.

586
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:59,520
I'll go look around and pick some herbs.

587
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,480
Don't overwork yourself

588
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:03,940
I'll be back here soon.

589
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,540
come out

590
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:15,620
Show up quickly!

591
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,580
I know it's you who's causing trouble in Jiang Chao!

592
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,960
How long will you torture me?

593
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,340
Come out, come out quickly!

594
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,300
13 years

595
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:31,050
Isn't it enough that you tortured me for 13 years?

596
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:35,100
Just let me go, you stinking evil god!

597
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:39,900
Go ahead, shout all you want.

598
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,020
No matter how you struggle

599
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,440
You can never leave this mountain.

600
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,440
Come out, come out quickly!

601
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:49,700
Hello!

602
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,590
What is happening here?

603
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,730
Sorry Ruli

604
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,310
I deceived you

605
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,030
Everything I do is my duty to the world.

606
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,570
No need to forgive me Ruli

607
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,370
Coming back now?

608
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,810
come out

609
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:05,650
Come out you stinking evil god!

610
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:07,190
Hello!

611
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:24,870
Ophiopogon japonicus

612
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:43,640
What did you conspire with Choi Won-woo?

613
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:46,310
Why did the king send you here?

614
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,900
Damn villain!

615
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:52,650
Tell the truth quickly!

616
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,410
Ruli will be back soon

617
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:05,580
She will be in danger if this continues.

618
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:11,760
What a stubborn thing.

619
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,800
If you don't want to die, speak up

620
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,680
Kill me

621
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,390
If my death

622
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,560
Can become poison for you, Guo Shangzhong

623
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,980
It can also serve the king's great cause

624
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,070
Lay a bone stone...

625
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,780
Then I

626
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:36,400
Die without regrets

627
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:48,420
His Majesty

628
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,000
Please forgive me

629
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,050
grown ups

630
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,510
How could you kill him?

631
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:04,350
I've long wanted to make this bastard's mouth

632
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,980
Closed forever

633
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,900
It's really refreshing

634
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,400
Clean up the body

635
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,990
Secretly staged the scene of Choi Won-woo's murder

636
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:23,450
Yes, sir.

637
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,240
The first time it was attached to a person

638
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:47,290
This body is so stuffy and clumsy.

639
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:24,320
It should be enough to stop the bleeding.

640
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,790
Something is wrong

641
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,920
I can't sense any breath

642
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:43,470
Where did Jiang Chaoli go?

643
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,340
Could it be that he...

644
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,760
Lord A?

645
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:57,020
grown ups

646
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:06,740
What's wrong with you?

647
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,990
Ruli...

648
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:41,440
Jiangchaoli

649
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:52,790
Jiang Chaoli possessed Lord Yin Jia

650
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,690
Soul-calming stone!

651
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,080
Ruli

652
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,290
You are mine now

653
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:39,670
It's you!

654
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:41,790
You did it

655
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,920
You killed the adults

656
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,510
Taking someone's life is not enough, they even want to take their body!

657
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:50,180
No, it's not like that.

658
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,640
I didn't kill that guy.

659
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:58,100
Hey, did I kill you?

660
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:02,020
It's you who overestimated your own abilities and acted recklessly in the palace to bring about your own destruction.

661
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,280
Why is there someone exactly like me?

662
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:15,700
How is this...

663
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:17,120
Don't feel wronged

664
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,420
I also hate this dull and weak body.

665
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,580
Disgusting

666
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:25,460
I just borrowed it to use before it rots.

667
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:27,460
Who are you?

668
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:29,840
Why do you want to occupy my body?

669
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:31,760
Give it back to me now!

670
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,110
Ruli

671
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:57,030
How is this possible?

672
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,120
grown ups

673
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:06,460
That damn soul-soothing stone is gone.

674
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,170
Letter is also good

675
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,720
Don't believe it

676
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,310
When I become your guardian angel

677
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:20,310
You will obey me.

678
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:23,020
Let me go, you scoundrel!

679
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,850
You have no choice now

680
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,400
Can only bow down

681
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,360
Be my follower...

682
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:37,120
Be my follower...

683
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,250
Be my follower!

684
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,800
Why doesn’t it work?

685
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,050
I have waited for this moment for 13 years

686
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,800
Only by becoming her patron saint can you transform into a dragon

687
01:02:57,890 --> 01:02:59,430
but why?

688
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:02,980
Why can't I escape from this body?

689
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,900
Soul Stone

690
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,600
No!

691
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,820
It's unfortunate

692
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:52,690
What are you going to do?

693
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,780
You'll never find it

694
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,200
That broken soul stone

695
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,490
You damn...

696
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:20,890
Ruli!

697
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:28,390
Ruli...

698
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:37,070
(Special thanks to: Jin Yongguang)

699
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:59,840
-Where am I? This is the palace

700
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,760
What happened to Prosecutor Yin?

701
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,850
This is amnesia

702
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:06,060
But its five senses are indeed extremely rare

703
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:09,390
This wonderful device can actually make your mind clearer

704
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,310
Soul-calming stone?

705
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:12,230
Why did you summon the mirror maker into the palace?

706
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:15,270
Yin Jia must have a deep meaning in bringing her here at this moment

707
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,690
I really miss you so much that my heart aches

708
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:20,820
-But didn't that mean he found his soul and returned to his body?

709
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:22,030
His lifeline has long been cut off

710
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:23,030
This is ridiculous.

711
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:23,990
This side of Ruli

712
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,160
-The Lord's spirit is still in the palace, please save me...

713
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,200
My lord!

714
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:30,370
was cheated

715
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,710
Why is this body so clumsy?

716
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:34,460
It's him

717
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:39,550
