1
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,917
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,421
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,173
100 YEARS AGO

4
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,716
<i>Month of the Ox, Year of the Fire Rat.</i>

5
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,676
<i>The winter this year</i>

6
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,388
<i>has been especially cold.</i>

7
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,266
<i>On the day a bitter wind swept through,</i>

8
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,062
<i>the king set out of the palace,</i>
<i>garbed in the dragon robe.</i>

9
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,814
<i>Enemy forces were closing in</i>
<i>on the Capital</i>

10
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,901
<i>and the threat of it falling</i>
<i>was far too great to ignore.</i>

11
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,320
<i>This became known</i>

12
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,156
<i>as the flight of the King.</i>

13
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:30,298
<i>However, the enemy forces' pursuit</i>
<i>was relentless,</i>

14
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:35,178
<i>and the safety of the King resembled</i>
<i>a flickering candle in the wind.</i>

15
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,891
<i>That was when a military officer</i>
<i>stepped forward.</i>

16
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,563
Escort Officer Cheon Geum-hwi
of the Royal Guards Command

17
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,106
at your service, Your Majesty.

18
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,985
Yongdam Village is
a day's distance to the south.

19
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,530
It is my hometown.

20
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,990
It is known as the village
where dragons ascended from

21
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,661
and its mountain ridges tower above.
It would serve as an ideal refuge.

22
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,124
Yongdam Village…

23
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,710
All right. Let us go there.

24
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,384
Halt!

25
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,850
Your Majesty, you must flee this instant.

26
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,019
There are enemy forces encamped
at the foot of Mount Paltae.

27
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,439
Your Majesty.

28
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,985
The foot of Mount Paltae is
just north of Yongdam Village.

29
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,403
He is right, Your Majesty.

30
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,531
It appears they have already
discovered our travel route.

31
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,408
We must change course, Your Majesty.

32
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:43,163
But where are we to go now?

33
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,250
Where do I go to stay alive?

34
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,503
Perhaps, we should swiftly make
our way south--

35
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,839
And what if they follow us?

36
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,132
What, then?

37
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,594
All right.

38
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,638
Send someone to Yongdam Village

39
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,349
and have them raise
the ceremonial flag high.

40
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,186
We must make our enemies think
that I am headed there.

41
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,815
That deception should give us
enough time to flee.

42
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

43
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,944
That is a great idea, Your Majesty.

44
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,115
You cannot, Your Majesty.

45
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,243
That will leave the inhabitants
of Yongdam Village in danger.

46
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,496
If you can just permit me one hour,

47
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,751
I will be able to evacuate them.
Please, permit me that time, Your Majesty.

48
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,127
You fool!

49
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,923
Our enemies will figure it all out
if the villagers are evacuated.

50
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,344
The greater cause demands sacrifice.

51
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:40,845
Your Majesty!

52
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:46,726
Yongdam Village is home
to my elderly mother and young son.

53
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,311
Please, Your Majesty!

54
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,536
He cannot be allowed to botch things up.

55
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,497
Bind him and ensure he cannot escape.

56
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:08,957
Let us go.

57
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,202
<i>That night, we survived</i>

58
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,246
<i>and they died in our place.</i>

59
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,499
<i>How will we ever pay</i>

60
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,460
<i>for this grievous sin?</i>

61
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,932
Is everything

62
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,935
in this book true?

63
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,563
Did King Yeonjong

64
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,482
truly sacrifice all the villagers here

65
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,778
to flee from enemy forces?

66
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,953
Thus, this Cheon Geum-hwi fellow…

67
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,124
harbored a great grudge
against the royal family…

68
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,003
and became the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

69
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,172
to get his revenge--

70
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,673
Your Majesty.

71
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,217
My great-great-grandfather

72
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,262
dared to write about
the private affairs of the royal family.

73
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,514
This blasphemous sin…

74
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,811
should never be forgiven.

75
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,983
I shall decide your fate later.

76
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,861
You may leave me now.

77
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,404
Yes, Your Majesty.

78
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,593
THE ANTHOLOGY OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS

79
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,597
Yeo-ri?

80
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,354
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

81
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,064
I have suddenly been struck

82
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,359
by an immense sadness
that is hard to bear.

83
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,821
Is it Cheon Geum-hwi's sadness?

84
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,032
I suspect

85
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,701
it might be, Your Majesty.

86
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,038
It appears Cheon Geum-hwi

87
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:59,585
was filled with bitter sorrow
and crushing guilt because he believed

88
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,131
his family and the villagers
all died because of him.

89
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,300
He was overwhelmed by sadness
and suffered immensely.

90
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,846
Thus, it appears that led him
to become that terrible, evil spirit.

91
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,228
However, it was not
just one person's sorrow.

92
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,938
It was dozens.

93
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,024
No, it was the sorrow
of even more than that.

94
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,069
And it swept over me, all at once.

95
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,615
Now, I understand
why his energy felt so chaotic.

96
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,660
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost…

97
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,997
was not alone.

98
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,834
He is not alone?

99
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,420
What does that mean?

100
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,671
Cheon Geum-hwi's grudge

101
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,924
and the grudges
of the villagers of Yongdam

102
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,968
from 100 years ago are intertwined.

103
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,262
Have you forgotten?

104
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,139
It is an ember ghost
who was burned to death.

105
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,516
However, that book does not mention
anything of the sort.

106
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,935
That means
something else happened afterward.

107
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,450
I cannot believe it.

108
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,203
How can a king sacrifice
his own people like that

109
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,788
just to save himself?

110
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,627
Not all kings were
like the one reigning now.

111
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,672
Especially, amidst warfare.

112
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,716
You were here 100 years ago,

113
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,177
you must have seen everything.

114
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,973
I was unaware of the execution
of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost,

115
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,351
but this place was truly hell back then.

116
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,480
Villagers were letting out bloody cries
as they burned in their fiery graves,

117
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,900
but the ones who fled to save themselves

118
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,487
remained unbelievably vile
and contemptible.

119
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,114
Thus,

120
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,326
that is why you loathed mortals so.

121
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,289
Do you

122
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,125
still loathe them now?

123
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,768
Yeo-ri.

124
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,783
My lord?

125
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,997
Lord Yoon Gap?

126
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,143
What is the matter?

127
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,735
What is wrong with you?

128
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:14,030
I just saw Lord Yoon Gap's soul.

129
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,408
- What?
- I am certain it was him.

130
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,535
He must have escaped
from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

131
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,912
It does not make any sense.

132
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,707
He has become even mightier
after devouring Bibi's luminous pearl.

133
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,876
Why release a soul he devoured
for no reason?

134
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,671
Unless he was spat out on purpose…

135
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,423
On purpose?

136
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,467
Why?

137
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,678
The fire energy
is especially strong tonight.

138
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,558
It would be an ideal night
for the Eight-foot-tall Ghost to act.

139
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,987
The Prince's chambers!

140
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,711
Your Highness!

141
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,340
- My goodness. Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

142
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,926
- Your Highness.
- The evil spirit…

143
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,345
- Is the evil spirit back?
- Your Highness.

144
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,767
Stay away. Stay away from me.

145
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,987
Your Highness! Your--

146
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,699
No!

147
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,544
Your Highness.

148
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,260
It is over now.

149
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,636
You are safe.

150
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,572
You are safe now.

151
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:29,975
<i>I have already prayed for half a day,</i>
<i>but Lord Yoon Gap has yet to appear.</i>

152
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,562
<i>Could I have been mistaken?</i>

153
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,688
<i>It does not make any sense.</i>

154
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,316
He has become even mightier
after devouring Bibi's luminous pearl.

155
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,693
Why release a soul he devoured
for no reason?

156
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,322
Unless he was spat out on purpose…

157
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,618
<i>I am sure I saw Lord Yoon Gap's soul.</i>

158
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:52,915
<i>I just need to find his soul first</i>
<i>and then, ask him what happened.</i>

159
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,877
<i>After that, his body…</i>

160
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,379
Yeo-ri.

161
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,884
<i>His body should be returned…</i>

162
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,351
Let us go.

163
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,361
Come on.

164
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,571
Where?

165
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,865
The lord's daughter prepared
tea and sweets for us.

166
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,878
I heard you saved me once again, my lord.

167
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,296
Thank you so much.

168
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,008
That was not me.
Yeo-ri was the one who saved you.

169
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,969
You would have been in big trouble
if it were not for her.

170
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,847
I am aware. I heard it from Mak-geum.

171
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,892
Thanks.

172
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,853
Sure.

173
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:01,233
I asked to see you
because I had a question for you, my lord.

174
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:05,195
I have been cured of my illness,
but there is still tension in the air.

175
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,283
Father remains silently grim.

176
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,577
And the steward is busy shushing everyone.

177
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,663
What in the world happened yesterday?

178
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,583
Well, you see, your father--

179
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,003
How would we know?

180
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,213
His Lord and I do not know anything.

181
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:33,057
I understand you two are like
siblings who grew up in the same village,

182
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,476
but why are you two always together?

183
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,688
Men and women should keep
a certain distance.

184
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,903
- What are you doing?
- It is my way of saying

185
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,989
His Lord and I go beyond a sibling bond.

186
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,995
Are you saying

187
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,664
His Lord gave you that?

188
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,500
Then…

189
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,631
My lord?

190
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:14,056
The caragana is about to bloom.

191
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,726
Yes. It is amazing, is it not?

192
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,353
Despite it being a spring flower,

193
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,147
it appears it is still trying to bloom
in the middle of winter.

194
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,619
Your Majesty. It is I, the Head Eunuch.

195
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,831
You may enter.

196
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,798
Your Majesty,
this report just arrived from the palace.

197
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,822
What does it say, Your Majesty?

198
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,576
Lord Kim Bong-in who fled
during his exile procession…

199
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,664
was found in the mountains
near the Capital…

200
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,547
as a slain body.

201
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,885
My goodness. How did that happen?

202
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:38,015
I did not mean anything by it
when I showed Her Lady this.

203
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,434
She asked about our relationship

204
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,603
and I could not tell her
we were patron deity and disciple.

205
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,687
That is why.

206
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,522
All right.

207
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,858
But…

208
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,319
why do you fret so?

209
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,989
Fret? Who is fretting? Not me.

210
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,116
Do not fret.

211
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,869
I have no interest
in Choi Won-u's daughter.

212
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,121
Not even in the slightest.

213
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,667
Do you just make flowers bloom
for a woman you have no interest in?

214
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,877
What?

215
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,797
I was not going to be
this petty and point it out.

216
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,633
Last time, you had
a warm breeze blow through

217
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,468
to make the wild chrysanthemums bloom.

218
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,846
And you dare use that move
to woo another woman?

219
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,265
While I watch, no less?

220
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,558
I was not behind that.

221
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,937
Then, why else would caragana bloom
in the dead of winter?

222
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,523
I actually wish

223
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,150
I was behind that.

224
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,610
What?

225
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,613
<i>This has been bothering me</i>
<i>for a while now.</i>

226
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,281
Why did you give us that plant?

227
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,034
Why else? Because it is pretty.

228
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,622
I am not dumb.
It emitted an auspicious energy.

229
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,249
I know it is not a typical plant.

230
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,133
The sorrow of a mighty, vengeful ghost,
like the Eight-foot-tall Ghost,

231
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,759
can only be relieved of its sorrow

232
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,263
by wholly expending
the energy of a luminous pearl.

233
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,765
However, if things go awry,

234
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,186
that scoundrel could snatch it up
before it is used on him.

235
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,688
You saw it for yourself.

236
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:11,066
You saw how he robbed your brother of his.

237
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:17,030
The flowers of the caragana
possess great water energy.

238
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,615
If you ingest it,

239
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,618
it will allow you to face him
and fend him off

240
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,620
to keep the luminous pearl
out of his grasp

241
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:27,666
while every last bit of its energy
is drained to be used against him.

242
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,171
However, the issue is that

243
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,923
that caragana has not once bloomed

244
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,843
in several decades.

245
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,264
<i>And now,</i>
<i>that damn caragana is about to bloom.</i>

246
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,935
<i>It just has to start flowering now,</i>
<i>as we expose the Ghost's true identity.</i>

247
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,855
Hey.

248
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,942
Let us go.

249
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,199
Hey, Grilled Abalone.

250
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,703
There you go
with that damn Grilled Abalone again.

251
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,539
- Now is not the time. Later.
- Do not be absurd.

252
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,042
You cannot deliver
any more devastating news to His Majesty.

253
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,628
Go get some real grilled abalones.

254
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,464
Is there something wrong with His Majesty?

255
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,347
They say Lord Kim Bong-in
was discovered as a corpse.

256
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,598
Pardon?

257
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,642
His Majesty remains quite distressed.

258
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,644
Take this Imugi away with you.

259
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:40,113
<i>It appears the Eight-foot-tall Ghost</i>
<i>tossed the useless card from his hand.</i>

260
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,591
Have you still not found him?

261
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,093
Forgive me, my lord.

262
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,137
That fellow, Pung-san,
simply disappeared without a trace.

263
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,556
Even the state troops
failed to locate him.

264
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,434
You should have located him
before they even had the chance to!

265
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,939
After Lord Kwak passed tragically,

266
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:18,860
I was the one who took you in
when you were left to drift aimlessly.

267
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,530
However, the thanks I get
for my selfless act

268
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,699
is for you to be completely useless?

269
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,367
Please, keep calm, my lord.

270
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:30,747
I shall dispatch more men
and continue the search with fervor.

271
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,919
<i>Pung-san…</i>

272
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,880
<i>Because of him,</i>
<i>even the almighty Lord Kim Bong-in</i>

273
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,091
<i>met his demise.</i>

274
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:46,013
<i>If the world finds out</i>
<i>that I had kept him close…</i>

275
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,433
<i>Forget the vacant seat</i>
<i>of the Chief State Councillor,</i>

276
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,060
<i>even my current position will be in peril.</i>

277
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,401
I shall return to the palace
as soon as day breaks tomorrow.

278
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,610
There,

279
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,572
I shall decide on your fate.

280
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

281
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:09,536
However, I shall deliberate only on
the murder of Book Merchant Jang Eon-su.

282
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,289
<i>The Anthology of Light and Darkness</i>
shall not be a factor.

283
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,628
Your Majesty. My great-great-grandfather…

284
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,049
wrote about the private affairs
of the royal family.

285
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,302
It was undeniably a blasphemous sin.
Are you really suggesting…

286
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,930
you wish to cover it up?

287
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,271
That was most certainly a blasphemous sin.

288
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,109
However, your great-great-grandfather
was truly a faithful subject.

289
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,323
If it were not for Lord Choi Gil-sang,
I may have never known…

290
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,536
such sorrowful grudges…

291
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,415
were buried here.

292
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,294
- Your Majesty.
- If anything…

293
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:05,383
you are guilty of knowing me so little
and having so little faith in me.

294
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,345
And those sins…

295
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,516
even led you to unnecessary murder.

296
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,851
Your Majesty…

297
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,154
Forgive me,

298
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,574
but may I speak, Your Majesty?

299
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,119
You may.

300
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:36,581
Please allow me to perform
a passage rite for the vengeful ghost

301
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,708
of Book Merchant Jang Eon-su.

302
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:43,630
Lord Choi Won-u must be the one
to send him off to cross over,

303
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,550
if His Lord wishes
to avoid further mishaps.

304
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,852
SPIRIT TABLET OF THE LATE JANG EON-SU

305
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,612
I know of your indignation.

306
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:52,032
Thus, I seek to provide you with solace
through an offering of your favorite food

307
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:56,578
and this prayer in hopes of lessening
the burden of your karmic hindrance.

308
00:24:56,661 --> 00:25:00,123
Please let go of your resentment
and cross over to the afterlife.

309
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,598
You know of my indignation?

310
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,185
What could a wench like you know?

311
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,604
You do not know anything.

312
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,857
Do you believe
that he will even get properly punished

313
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:29,069
for killing a lowly creature like me?

314
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,446
I will stay put where I am.

315
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:37,077
I will make that scoundrel suffer
a painful death as he did with me.

316
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,457
My lord, you must ask for his forgiveness.

317
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,961
If you do not,
his grudge will remain unresolved.

318
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,681
See?

319
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,183
He has no desire to ask for forgiveness.

320
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,269
Why would he?

321
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:06,690
There is no way the esteemed lord
would ever kneel

322
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,610
before a lowly creature like me.

323
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,195
Then,

324
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,447
you can tell him yourself.

325
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,158
What? Again?

326
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,243
You cannot!

327
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,805
You rotten scoundrel!

328
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,727
Yeo-ri… She has grabbed Lord Choi
by his collar, Your Majesty.

329
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,897
She is not Yeo-ri right now.
The vengeful ghost has possessed her body.

330
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,609
You shall die as well.

331
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,945
You ended my life,
now it is time to end yours!

332
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,364
- What do you think you are doing?
- Do you know…

333
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,576
how much I suffered and grieved?

334
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:04,414
I cannot leave before I annihilate you.

335
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,666
I refuse to leave!

336
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,858
I am sorry.

337
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,487
I am sorry.

338
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,158
I am truly sorry…

339
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,329
for taking your life.

340
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,809
My lord…

341
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,852
Father.

342
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:17,278
It was never my intention to kill you.

343
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,156
I was afraid.

344
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,784
I was filled with dread.

345
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,994
That is how I ended up doing that.

346
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,457
Life had been hell
for the past five years.

347
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,380
I shall take care
of your surviving family.

348
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,300
I shall atone for this sin
for the rest of my life.

349
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,386
So please…

350
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,099
Please forgive me.

351
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,811
I beg you…

352
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,527
Please forgive me.

353
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,894
Why, that is… Catch him!

354
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,938
Go! Catch him this instant!

355
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,607
Catch him! Damn it.

356
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,652
Why that rotten scoundrel… Catch him!

357
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,759
This lowly creature

358
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,137
offers his humblest greetings to His Lord,

359
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:52,141
second only to the King,
the Chief State Councillor.

360
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,812
What nonsense are you spewing?

361
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,231
Don't just stand there.

362
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,941
Cut his head off!

363
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,318
Yes, my lord.

364
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,613
Wait. Hold on.

365
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:13,037
Did you just refer to me
as the Chief State Councillor?

366
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,248
Yes, my lord.

367
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,876
Because you will become one, soon enough.

368
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:24,340
<i>This lowly creature's supernatural</i>
<i>abilities were always quite reliable.</i>

369
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,967
<i>Could he be telling the truth?</i>

370
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,513
However, your aura remains
as foul as ever.

371
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,016
You will soon be engulfed
by the floodwater.

372
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,684
What? What did you say?

373
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,770
Do you know why Lord Kwak Sang-chung
ended up like that,

374
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,355
despite the Haeilbu talisman?

375
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,735
It is because of the Imugi
inside Examiner Yoon Gap's body.

376
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:48,281
That Imugi will not go easy on you
because you are the Minister of Rites.

377
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,366
Then…

378
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,995
will I end up like the Minister of War?

379
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,288
I…

380
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,504
appear before you,
despite the threat of patrolling guards,

381
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,590
because I wish to protect you, my lord.

382
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:11,346
I wish to have you ascend
to the seat of the Chief State Councillor.

383
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,430
That is why I am here.

384
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:23,983
Ma'am!

385
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,444
My goodness. My precious kids are back.

386
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,696
Goodness me.

387
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,073
Have you been well?

388
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,700
With Venerable Gaseop
lodged near the palace,

389
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,369
I was worried about you being alone.

390
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,204
Gosh, why would you worry about me?

391
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,414
Well done on safely making
that long journey.

392
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,208
Is Yongdam Village still the same?

393
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,501
Yes.

394
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,837
Goodness. Look at my son.
He is a shell of his former self.

395
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,465
Tell the King
to stop making you work so much.

396
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:50,718
He may have traveled comfortably
on horseback and in palanquins,

397
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,096
but you two must have walked all that way.

398
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,263
Please, lower your voice.

399
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,892
You are right!
That King was the only one on a horse.

400
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,396
And he is so stingy.
Not even a bottle of booze after all that.

401
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,856
Did he now? How incredibly stingy of him.

402
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,984
Did you prepare anything tasty?

403
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,443
Right. You must be hungry.

404
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,612
Go and unpack.
I will whip something up in no time.

405
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,448
- Let me help you.
- No need. Gosh.

406
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,834
Stop it.

407
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,689
Father!

408
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,900
Gwang!

409
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,575
Did you have a safe journey?

410
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,494
I did. Have you been well?

411
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,957
Your Majesty.

412
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,709
Welcome back.

413
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,714
Queen.

414
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:16,387
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
appeared in the Prince's quarters?

415
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,182
Yes. I thought it was imperative
that you knew,

416
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,560
so I ran over here
when I heard you were back.

417
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,270
Is His Highness all right?

418
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:29,025
By heaven's grace, we were able to avoid
a disaster, thanks to the Ghostbane Stone.

419
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:33,071
However, all the preventive measures
we had taken proved to be useless.

420
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:39,619
It seems that Eight-foot-tall Ghost
became an even mightier evil spirit

421
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,121
after devouring
the Imugi's luminous pearl.

422
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,485
<i>My powers have grown weaker.</i>

423
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,656
<i>I will soon be no different from a mortal.</i>

424
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:21,786
<i>I might not be able</i>
<i>to protect Yeo-ri at this rate…</i>

425
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,084
Murder is subject
to the dictates of the law.

426
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,544
It cannot be taken lightly.

427
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,840
Choi Won-u deserves to be beheaded.

428
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,217
However, it was
an act of involuntary manslaughter,

429
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,553
incited by blackmail
from Book Merchant Jang Eon-su.

430
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,513
He is also a descendant
of a faithful escort

431
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,307
to the King 100 years ago during the war

432
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:47,270
and has spent his whole life fulfilling
his duties of loyalty and filial piety.

433
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,522
He shall be granted clemency

434
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,276
and be sentenced 50 strikes of the cane

435
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,528
and a funerary fine of 10 nyang.

436
00:35:55,611 --> 00:36:00,116
FUNERARY FINE: IMPOSED ON THE KILLER
FOR THE VICTIM'S FUNERAL EXPENSES

437
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,659
What is the matter?

438
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,787
Is your punishment too harsh?

439
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,040
No, Your Majesty.

440
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,793
Compared to the heinous crimes
that I have committed,

441
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,922
the punishment is too light.

442
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,676
Your benevolence is boundless,
Your Majesty.

443
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,066
Father.

444
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,821
Father…

445
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,157
I am all right.

446
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,118
Do not worry about me and go back home.

447
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,164
Do not just stand there.
Escort the lady away.

448
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,540
Yes, Your Excellency.

449
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,000
My lady.

450
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,460
Let us go.

451
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,301
Your Excellency…

452
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,231
My lord?

453
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,943
You mean that caragana?

454
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:21,572
I did bring it with me
to the Capital this time…

455
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,116
It appears your energy is
a good match for the caragana.

456
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,247
Its blossoms are elusive and rare,
yet it has become abundant with buds.

457
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:34,293
That is because I watered it well
and let it bask in the sun.

458
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,879
I put great effort into its care.

459
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,632
Because it was a gift from you, my lord.

460
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,676
When it is in full bloom,

461
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,719
you must let me know.

462
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,096
Why, my lord?

463
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,766
Well, you see…

464
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,770
Many days have passed
since the buds appeared,

465
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,939
but they have not budged since.

466
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,066
It is not wilting, either.

467
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,360
It is as if it is frozen in time.

468
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,905
May I ask where this is all coming from?

469
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,450
What is so special about that caragana?

470
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,553
CHEON GEUM-HWI

471
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,015
Your Majesty, is this not

472
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,267
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost's
identification tablet?

473
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,354
You said the ghost's mortal name
was Cheon Geum-hwi.

474
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,316
I checked for the name
in the military examination register

475
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,276
through the records
of King Yeonjong's reign.

476
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,821
Are you suggesting we do a passage rite
for the Eight-foot-tall Ghost?

477
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,822
Yes.

478
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,409
After seeing the one performed
for that book merchant last time,

479
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,662
I suspected such a tablet
would be necessary.

480
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,581
Hence, I had them produce a new one.

481
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,416
YEONHUI DIVISION
ROYAL GUARDS COMMAND

482
00:38:55,499 --> 00:39:00,671
Observing Lord Choi Won-u's recent ordeal
has led me to reflect on many things.

483
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,465
Hence, I have decided

484
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,510
for the sake of Cheon Geum-hwi,

485
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:11,640
his family, and all the villagers
who met tragic deaths due to my ancestors,

486
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,268
to carry out a passage rite.

487
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:18,731
Furthermore,
I shall offer my sincerest apologies

488
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,735
to them for the crimes
my ancestors have committed.

489
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,237
Can you do that for me?

490
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,242
I remain limited in my skills
and will not be able to perform it alone.

491
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,411
I will need Venerable Gaseop to lead it.

492
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,789
All right. You may have him do so.

493
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:42,755
Furthermore, the goal of a passage rite
is to provide solace for the spirit,

494
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,550
so it will be better to exclude
Imugi Gangcheori from the ceremony.

495
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,056
Yeo-ri, what are you talking about?

496
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,726
What will you do if
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost causes chaos?

497
00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:00,189
The only one who stands a chance
against that ghost is him.

498
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,816
I concur.

499
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:06,654
For His Majesty's safety,
Imugi Gangcheori must be present.

500
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,656
However…

501
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,742
As if anything around here
would go smoothly without me.

502
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,494
Do not worry.

503
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,706
I, too, must see the demise of
that abhorrent, evil spirit for myself.

504
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,960
I shall join you.

505
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,673
In ten days,

506
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,510
it will be the 100th anniversary
of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost's death.

507
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,513
Since heretical ceremonies are
outlawed within the Capital,

508
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,517
it shall be performed at Jinseung Temple,
past the fortress walls.

509
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,103
Hence, prepare accordingly.

510
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,397
Yes, Your Majesty.

511
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,775
<i>It will be the 100th anniversary</i>
<i>in exactly 10 days…</i>

512
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,652
<i>Damn it to hell.</i>

513
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,655
<i>Why is everything so perfectly timed?</i>

514
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:57,705
With His Majesty so determined,
the ghost will soon cross over.

515
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,542
I mean it, this time.

516
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,587
Grandma only failed the passage rite

517
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,714
because she did not know
the ghost's identity.

518
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,841
And you saw it for yourself.

519
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,510
Once Lord Choi Won-u
genuinely asked for forgiveness,

520
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,012
the ghost's grudge was relieved.

521
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,681
His Majesty, of all people,

522
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,184
is looking to earnestly ask
for forgiveness from the ghost.

523
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:22,104
Even that ghost's deep grudge
will be relieved.

524
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,606
What are you trying to say?

525
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,649
What I mean is…

526
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,527
There is no need
for you to try so hard as well.

527
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:29,945
What?

528
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,532
You did not even like coming
to the palace from the start.

529
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,076
You came because of me.

530
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:40,122
I am already plenty thankful
for all that you have done.

531
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,084
You are the one who begged me
on your knees to catch it

532
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,337
and now you want me to step aside?

533
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,088
You do not even have a Ghostbane Stone.

534
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,008
You expect me to send you off
to face that ghost alone?

535
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,802
Do you truly believe
I would be able to do that?

536
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,431
I just… What I meant was…

537
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,267
You…

538
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,358
What exactly are you thinking?

539
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,203
Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri.
Her Grace has summoned you.

540
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:20,996
Her Grace?

541
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,294
I summoned you to ask you a question.

542
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,507
I hear you accompanied
His Majesty to the hot spring recently.

543
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,468
Yes, Your Grace.

544
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,345
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost, was it?

545
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,890
Did you find out
who that evil spirit truly is?

546
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,017
That…

547
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,148
is not something
I am at liberty to divulge.

548
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,483
Forgive me, Your Grace.

549
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,114
Then…

550
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,162
can you answer me this?

551
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,500
My Yeongin…

552
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,838
Do you know where he is?

553
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,092
Did he safely cross
the River of the Afterlife?

554
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,683
His Highness, Prince Yeongin…

555
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,356
was devoured by the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

556
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,033
My Yeongin…

557
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:46,332
He is unable to rest peacefully,
even in death, because of me.

558
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,000
That evil spirit…

559
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,068
Your Grace.

560
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:18,447
I am an eyeglass artisan by trade,
but I am able to see ghosts.

561
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:22,660
A ghost who has long frequented
the inner palace told me

562
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:26,038
that an item His Highness cherished
during his lifetime

563
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,123
remains in his chambers.

564
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,918
An item he cherished?

565
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,002
Yes, Your Grace.

566
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:38,509
If you wholeheartedly pray for his return
with that object in front of you,

567
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:43,180
you will be able to help him free himself
from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

568
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,319
Your Grace, please let us look.

569
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,197
You might get hurt, Your Grace.

570
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,783
- Start searching.
- Yes, ma'am.

571
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:06,370
All of His Highness's personal effects
have already been cleared away.

572
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:36,608
Your Grace.

573
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,527
Those are…

574
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,739
the silk pouches Your Grace handmade

575
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,618
for His Highness, every Lunar New Year.

576
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,872
Yes.

577
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,791
They are.

578
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,378
I was worried
about the malevolence of spirits…

579
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:58,797
so, I…

580
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:03,760
They were very much cherished
by His Highness when he was alive.

581
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,806
He said he could feel
the warmth of Your Grace from them.

582
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,036
What was with all that fibbing?

583
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,123
If some prayer was all it took to free
a soul from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost,

584
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,043
then every ghost he devoured
should be free by now.

585
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:40,214
I worried something terrible might happen
if I even took prayer away from her.

586
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,050
And…

587
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,636
there is nothing
more tenacious in this world

588
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,096
than a mother's prayer.

589
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,767
We cannot say it will not have
any effect with certainty.

590
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,814
Hey, why are you crying?
I did not do anything to you.

591
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,150
My mother…

592
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,612
She also desperately prayed for me.

593
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:08,992
I wanted to see her
so badly before I died,

594
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:13,247
but the Chief Royal Physician
refused to give me permission.

595
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,458
He said he could not let

596
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:20,963
all the eunuchs go home
over a measly cold.

597
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,015
Did you stay by Her Grace's side

598
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,268
because you missed
your own mother's embrace?

599
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:35,852
Yeah.

600
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,731
I need to stop by the Royal Couturier.

601
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,441
Can you wait for me by the well?

602
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,386
I bought them a while ago
but I finally get to give them to you.

603
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,140
They are for you. Try them on.

604
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,357
They fit perfectly!

605
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:29,239
You have not been able to go
because you did not have shoes, right?

606
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,492
Go to your mother with those shoes on.

607
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,870
She must be waiting for you.

608
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:45,130
THE ANTHOLOGY OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS

609
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:57,601
That depressing face of yours
is even more unbearable in that state.

610
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,437
My goodness, when did you return?

611
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,148
More importantly, what did you just say?

612
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,776
How dare you make such rude remarks

613
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,862
about His Majesty's
glowing royal countenance?

614
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:13,033
Then? His face's been that mopey for days.
Should I just continue to feign ignorance?

615
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,119
Look here, Gangcheori.

616
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,457
I was not the least bit surprised.

617
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,793
Did you think a ghost
with that deep of a grudge

618
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,961
would not even have such a tale attached?

619
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:32,135
I have always been proud of
my heritage and bloodline.

620
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,430
The burden of the lineage
weighed heavily on my shoulders…

621
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,768
and I tried with all my might…

622
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,231
to become a king worthy of the dynasty.

623
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,483
However…

624
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:52,322
it appears I was on a fool's errand.

625
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:59,246
I realized this
after entering a mortal body.

626
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,582
For mortals,
the human body itself is the sin.

627
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,672
To fulfill the desires of the human body,

628
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,843
they seek out what is tastier,
garb that seems a bit nicer,

629
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,553
and a house that is a little bigger.

630
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,596
They remain so desperate
to climb up that ladder

631
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,890
and obsess over money.

632
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,560
What is this out of the blue?

633
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:22,644
However…

634
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,940
it turns out not all mortals
are like that.

635
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,484
Occasionally, there were those

636
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:32,070
who cared more about other things

637
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,615
besides trivial desires of the human body.

638
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,036
That is why I, the King, exist.

639
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,206
If I spread fitting
and righteous principles

640
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,292
to exercise people-centered governance,

641
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:49,212
the avarice of human nature
will eventually be suppressed

642
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,424
to lead the way for an age
of peace and prosperity--

643
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,428
So, do you think that is possible?

644
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,891
The state-owned slave reform plans
you showed me a while back…

645
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,894
"Life is short, why waste energy
on such a useless pursuit?"

646
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,021
You criticized it so, did you not?

647
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,525
You will achieve
that noble pursuit you seek.

648
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,486
After all,

649
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,821
you are one of those mortals…

650
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,284
I come across occasionally.

651
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:28,376
These are the words of
the exalted Gangcheori.

652
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,753
Feel free to believe them.

653
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,454
It has all been taken from me.

654
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,666
My body,

655
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,668
my life,

656
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,420
and all my people…

657
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,091
They have all been taken from me.

658
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,639
There you go.
You must feel such immense sorrow.

659
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:29,437
Foster that grudge.
That is what you must do.

660
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:33,441
Only then,
will you do as I say without protest.

661
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:57,799
I appear before you,
despite the threat of patrolling guards,

662
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,885
because I wish to protect you, my lord.

663
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:05,640
I wish to have you ascend
to the seat of the Chief State Councillor.

664
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,725
That is why I am here.

665
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,729
Then, what must I do?

666
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,320
You just need to lure out
Examiner Yoon Gap for me.

667
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:22,240
<i>I, Pung-san, will take care of the rest.</i>

668
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:26,119
I came because you said
you would treat me to tasty things,

669
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:27,996
but what did you want?

670
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,873
The nation is amidst a crisis.

671
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:35,754
Since you are the subject
who is most favored by His Majesty…

672
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,384
I thought we could become
good acquaintances

673
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,637
to discuss political affairs and such.

674
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,098
Let us see here…

675
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:50,018
You wish for me to pass on
this flattery to the King

676
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,978
so that he may look upon you favorably?

677
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,523
You must be after the empty seat
of the Chief State Councillor.

678
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,234
Why, you scoundrel!

679
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,529
You are really something else.

680
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:06,952
<i>That Imugi will not go easy on you</i>
<i>because you are the Minister of Rites.</i>

681
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:11,331
<i>I must remain calm. He is an Imugi.</i>

682
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,625
Let me see here…

683
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,420
Now, I remember.

684
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:21,758
You are that rascal who used to follow
Kwak Sang-chung around like fish poop.

685
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:29,724
I may be cutting my life short,
but I cannot stand this any longer!

686
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,565
We are still drinking.
Where are you running off to?

687
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,736
<i>Pung-san told me to keep him occupied</i>
<i>for as long as I could.</i>

688
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,905
Why did you bring me here?

689
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,618
Well, you see…

690
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,363
His Lord is not home yet?

691
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:10,366
No. I guess you just missed
each other on the way out?

692
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,619
It seems so.

693
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,957
<i>Where is he? I assumed he went home</i>
<i>when I could not find him anywhere.</i>

694
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:21,669
Who could that…

695
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,588
My goodness. Gap!

696
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,465
Goodness me. What happened to him?

697
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,008
It seems he drank a bit too much.

698
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:30,011
This is an all-too-common sight
at our courtesan house.

699
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:37,602
Gosh, I do not even smell any alcohol.
How did he drink too much?

700
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,064
My poor son.

701
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:45,151
Wait.

702
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,863
Oh, my. He is burning up.

703
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,699
Keep an eye on him for me.

704
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,910
- I will fetch a physician.
- All right.

705
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:22,856
That Imugi must already be weak
with his waning water energy.

706
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,400
After devouring a luminous pearl,

707
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:29,028
suppressing an Imugi like that
will be a breeze for our Warrior Deity.

708
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,361
Are you awake? How do you feel?

709
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,863
You were burning up all night.

710
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:14,782
You must be thirsty.
Have some water first.

711
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,041
Yeo-ri.

712
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,338
Yes.

713
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:30,548
It is me.

714
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,178
Lord Yoon Gap.

715
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,387
Gosh, Gap.

716
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,600
When did you wake up?

717
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,686
How are you feeling? Did the fever break?

718
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,189
Let me see…

719
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,359
Mother.

720
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,824
What did you just say?

721
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,701
Yes, Mother.

722
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,287
It is me.

723
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,917
It is Gap.

724
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:07,877
My goodness.

725
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:13,550
Goodness… Gap.

726
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:14,968
My word.

727
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:16,803
Are you my Gap?

728
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,930
Goodness.

729
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,224
I cannot believe this!

730
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,018
My word…

731
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,939
My dear child.

732
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,483
My dear child has come back to me.

733
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,235
My goodness. Gap!

734
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:36,573
I am so proud of you. Well done.

735
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:37,699
<i>It has returned.</i>

736
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:41,911
<i>The soul has returned</i>
<i>to its original body.</i>

737
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,999
- <i>His Lord has returned.</i>
- Thank goodness.

738
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,253
<i>Then, what happened to Gangcheori?</i>

739
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,006
<i>Where did he go?</i>

740
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,677
SPECIAL THANKS
TO LEE KYU-HAN AND SONG YOUNG-KYU

741
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,907
<i>It seems something is definitely going on.</i>

742
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,910
I am so afraid that
Gangcheori will also end up like Bibi.

743
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,913
<i>I have come back because there was</i>
<i>something I needed to tell you.</i>

744
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,915
How would you like
to live 100 years with me?

745
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,793
<i>The Yoon Gap that I cherished so</i>
<i>has returned to me.</i>

746
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,213
<i>As soon as I felt your royal frame,</i>
<i>I experienced unbearable pain.</i>

747
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:36,299
- Yeo-ri!
- Gangcheori?

748
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,760
That body will not remain yours.

749
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:41,846
Pour this on the King's Ghostbane Stone.

750
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,932
<i>Your Majesty,</i>
<i>please forgive this unfaithful servant.</i>

751
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,976
<i>My lord, you cannot.</i>

752
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:51,564
