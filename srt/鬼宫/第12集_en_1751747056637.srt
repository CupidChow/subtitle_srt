1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,210
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,420
WERE FILMED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

4
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,660
<i>When a mortal dies,</i>
<i>the soul remains behind.</i>

5
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,000
<i>However, when a divine entity</i>
<i>like an Imugi perishes,</i>

6
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,920
<i>not a single trace</i>
<i>of its existence is left behind</i>

7
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,050
<i>as if it never existed.</i>

8
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,300
<i>No even…</i>

9
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,390
<i>a single trace.</i>

10
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,290
Gangcheori.

11
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,750
Yeo-ri…

12
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,800
It hurts.

13
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,050
It hurts so much.

14
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,050
My heart…

15
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,140
My heart just hurts so much.

16
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,180
If I tear out this heart,

17
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,150
will the pain stop?

18
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,150
Please help me.

19
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,240
What in the world is wrong with me?

20
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,950
I'm sorry, Gangcheori.

21
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,370
Because of me, Bibi…

22
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,540
You should just hate and resent me.

23
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,880
Bibi ended up like that because of me.

24
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,380
So, Gangcheori…

25
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,550
just hate me, all right?

26
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,720
My lord, these are them.

27
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,190
What were you two doing
at the Association of the Blind?

28
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,850
The King's grandfather…

29
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,110
He is the true benefactor
of that scoundrel.

30
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,740
The Association
has already been shut down.

31
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,740
I asked why you two were there.

32
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,450
Answer me this instant.

33
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,290
Announcing His Majesty!

34
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,460
My lord, what is the meaning of this?

35
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,090
Your Majesty.

36
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,300
Last night, they trespassed
onto the grounds

37
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,550
of the now-defunct
Association of the Blind.

38
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,680
Hence, I had them apprehended.

39
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,230
What happened on the Association grounds?

40
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,650
Your Majesty. Why--

41
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,690
Your Majesty, Noble Elder Pung-san

42
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,690
was at the shrine on the grounds.

43
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,240
You wench.

44
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,610
A lowly creature's safety
is not guaranteed here.

45
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,330
You dare run that mouth?

46
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,540
Countless soldiers have searched
every corner of the Capital

47
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,540
but have failed to locate him.

48
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,460
Then, how could he have appeared
once more on the Association grounds?

49
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,130
However, I am certain it was him.

50
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,880
I had given them a royal command.

51
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,510
Your Majesty.

52
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,310
I commanded them to carry out
a closer inspection of the shrine.

53
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,180
They were just carrying out my command.

54
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,940
I see, Your Majesty.

55
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,850
You may leave now, my lord.

56
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,490
Yes. I shall now take
my leave, Your Majesty.

57
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,280
You may withdraw your troops.

58
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

59
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Leave us at once!

60
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,090
My goodness. What happened, Yeo-ri?

61
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,630
Sang-deuk.

62
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,140
What in the world happened?

63
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,890
And what is wrong with this fellow?

64
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,640
It was a trap.

65
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,520
I went to the shrine in search
of the ghost's identification pendant,

66
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,810
but Noble Elder Pung-san
and the Eight-foot-tall Ghost were there…

67
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,610
Your Majesty.

68
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,570
Now, I know

69
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,660
who the true benefactor
of the ghost and the Yapper is.

70
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,660
It is Lord Kim Bong-in.

71
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Did you…

72
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,970
just say Lord Kim Bong-in?

73
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

74
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,390
That is impossible.

75
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,220
How could he be?

76
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,480
You must be mistaken.

77
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,820
I, too…

78
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,240
pray I am mistaken.

79
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,300
It is impossible.

80
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,010
It cannot be.

81
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,720
Even if Yeo-ri is known to be trustworthy,

82
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,890
she may not be aware
of the entire situation.

83
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,270
Do you not agree?

84
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,690
She must have made a mistake.

85
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

86
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
Yes.

87
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,700
Yeo-ri must be mistaken.

88
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,040
What is this?

89
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,460
Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri
and Examiner Yoon Gap are still alive.

90
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,130
Explain yourself.

91
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,640
You scoundrel, how dare you!

92
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,810
Last night, the Warrior Deity

93
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,440
gained what he sought.

94
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,110
What do you mean by "what he sought"?

95
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,820
He devoured
the luminous pearl of an Imugi.

96
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,360
Thus, he has fully recovered
from the injury Gangcheori inflicted

97
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,320
and has gained stronger power
than ever before.

98
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,660
The Warrior Deity is no longer
just a vicious vengeful ghost.

99
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,120
He has truly risen
to the ranks of the gods.

100
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,450
Could it be money problems?

101
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,880
Could he be exhausted from eating
nothing but porridge recently?

102
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,390
My goodness.

103
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,980
<i>Shadow the Chief State Councillor.</i>

104
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,580
Wait. Hold on.

105
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,330
It should not be facing that way.
It should face this way.

106
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,670
There you go.

107
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,750
There you go.

108
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,930
Haetae has long been known
to be a deity that blocks fire energy.

109
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,560
Having Haetae sculptures
in all four cardinal corners

110
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,520
should definitely be helpful.

111
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,190
While Yeo-ri and Examiner Yoon Gap
are absent from the Capital,

112
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,990
I shall protect you
from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

113
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,290
But why is Examiner Yoon Gap not present?

114
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,080
He always played with me in the yard
when you visited the Queen's Palace.

115
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,800
He did not come to the palace today

116
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,050
because he was not feeling well.

117
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,220
Still?

118
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,430
Shall I send a physician?

119
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,060
No, Your Majesty.

120
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,810
It is not a physical issue…

121
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,020
Yes, I am sure a deep affliction
of the heart is to blame.

122
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,190
Did you say he lost a longtime comrade?

123
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Yes.

124
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,160
And the Eight-foot-tall Ghost is
now an even more vicious evil spirit.

125
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,250
Yes.

126
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,540
We must hurry.

127
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,050
We shall set out as soon
as day breaks tomorrow.

128
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Your Majesty.

129
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,660
Are you all right?

130
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Yeo-ri.

131
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,670
Yes, my lord?

132
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,920
Well…

133
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,550
Is he very sick?

134
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,050
Examiner Yoon Gap.

135
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,260
Yes, a bit…

136
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,270
Well, do not read into this too much.

137
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,860
I still cannot stand
how he behaves around His Majesty,

138
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,480
but what can I do?

139
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,940
His Majesty needs him

140
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,700
and sometimes,
His Majesty even enjoys his company.

141
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,240
Then, I cannot help but find myself
be concerned about him.

142
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,500
Sorry… I am afraid I do not understand.

143
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,540
Thus…

144
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,170
I have these.

145
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,420
They are <i>yugwa.</i>

146
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,760
I had them especially made

147
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,340
by a talented palace maid
at the Royal Confectionery.

148
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,060
There is nothing better
than sweet <i>yugwa</i> when you are blue.

149
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,680
Thank you.

150
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,230
I am sure Examiner Yoon Gap
will be thrilled.

151
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,610
Sure. Good.

152
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,480
Then, I should get back to it.

153
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,530
You know? All right?

154
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,600
Hey.

155
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,970
Why are you not eating?

156
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,230
After all your complaining
about side dishes recently,

157
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,440
I went out and got all this
from a big banquet.

158
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,850
Eat some more.

159
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,770
I do not have an appetite.

160
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
Why not?

161
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,110
My goodness. Gap…

162
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,120
Gosh.

163
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,330
What is with him recently?

164
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,080
Maybe he wanted a meat side dish?

165
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,130
Oh my…

166
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,630
Please enjoy.

167
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,890
Gap.

168
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,230
Come here.

169
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,280
Here, Gap.

170
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,120
Go ahead and eat it.

171
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,830
I managed to get two.

172
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,460
I could not put it on the table
because the monks do not eat meat.

173
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,210
I will give the other to Yeo-ri.
That one is for you.

174
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,130
What is the matter?
Is there something on my face?

175
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,760
Stop staring at me like that and eat it.

176
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,970
If you keep starving yourself,
you will end up collapsing.

177
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,100
You will have no energy!

178
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:06,890
I will eat it later.

179
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,360
Goodness me. Just eat it now…

180
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,260
You asked about who recommended
Pung-san to me.

181
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,230
It was Prince Yeongin's nanny.

182
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,770
After the late king passed,

183
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,190
I was going through a difficult time
and she introduced him to me

184
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,860
as someone whom I could trust.

185
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,830
However, after our recent conversation,

186
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,290
I summoned her once more.
After some pressing,

187
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,660
she admitted…

188
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,750
Lord Kim Bong-in threatened her
to do so back then.

189
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,090
I did not have the slightest idea…

190
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,180
and let myself be deceived by him…

191
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,940
Your Majesty, how much longer
must I await my punishment?

192
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,110
You know about everything.

193
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,110
I…

194
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,160
told Pung-san…

195
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,160
about the Queen's pregnancy.

196
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,370
Because of me,

197
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,750
Prince Yeongin died.

198
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,630
And because of me, the Queen…

199
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,800
Your Grace.

200
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,730
Thank you for telling me.

201
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,100
Your Majesty,
I followed after His Lord's bodyguard

202
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,470
<i>when he suspiciously</i>
<i>left his side late in the night.</i>

203
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,310
<i>I witnessed him</i>
<i>meeting with Pung-san's servant.</i>

204
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,440
<i>I attempted to catch Pung-san</i>
<i>by following that servant,</i>

205
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,690
but I ended up losing him.

206
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
Forgive me.

207
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,030
How should we proceed, Your Majesty?

208
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,870
Summon the Chief State Councillor.

209
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,970
Your Majesty.

210
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,050
The Chief State Councillor
is here for you.

211
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,540
Your Majesty.

212
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,960
I answer your summons.

213
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,850
Do you recognize this object?

214
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,180
Is this not…

215
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,690
the <i>tonggae</i> that was
once cherished by the late king?

216
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
Yes, you are correct.

217
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,520
TONGGAE: USED TO CARRY BOW
AND ARROWS

218
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,280
<i>After it became soaked</i>
<i>in blood due to the late king's mania,</i>

219
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,110
<i>you had…</i>

220
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,830
<i>carefully cleaned it</i>

221
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,120
<i>and conditioned its leather,</i>

222
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,660
<i>before bringing it to me.</i>

223
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,790
<i>How could I forget?</i>

224
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,920
<i>That day, Your Majesty let</i>
<i>these old arms embrace you</i>

225
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:51,350
<i>as you shed sorrowful tears</i>
<i>like a small child.</i>

226
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,480
<i>Yes.</i>

227
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,520
<i>It felt as though</i>

228
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,400
you were showing me your determination
to move past those horrific events

229
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,860
through that cleaned <i>tonggae</i>.

230
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,950
It felt like
you were promising to protect me

231
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,120
as I ascended to the throne
as the son of a deranged king.

232
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,790
I felt safe.

233
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,630
Then, how could you
have done such a thing?

234
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,680
I have spent my life studying

235
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,930
the duty of the people

236
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,480
and the obligation of the sovereign.

237
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,690
However, you used the voice
of a compassionate grandfather

238
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,520
and the face of the most faithful retainer

239
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,360
to kill your son-in-law,

240
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,910
and attempt to kill
both your grandson and great-grandson.

241
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,620
How am I to accept the beastly heart
that led you to summon a wicked ghost

242
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,370
to achieve your goal?

243
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,210
How can a person

244
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,210
commit such heinous, inhumane acts?

245
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,220
You only have yourself…

246
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,020
to blame for all that, Your Majesty.

247
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,060
What did you say?

248
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,730
I have mentioned it
to you countless times.

249
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,450
You must respect the natural order.

250
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,070
Do not make an enemy
out of the scholar-officials.

251
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,660
This old man's honest piece of advice

252
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:42,410
paved the path for a peaceful reign
and ensured safety for your heirs.

253
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Then…

254
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,710
why did you not heed my words?

255
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,050
My lord!

256
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,840
Do you have any evidence
that proves I summoned that wicked ghost?

257
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,520
Your Majesty will not be able
to prove anything of the sort.

258
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,810
You must have discovered
I wielded that ghost

259
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,860
through that shaman brat named Yeo-ri.

260
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,400
Please feel free to bear
the disgrace of heretical ceremonies

261
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,570
and sacrifice that brat

262
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,080
to produce such evidence.

263
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,620
Even if you do manage to do so,

264
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,950
things will not go your way.

265
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,500
How many followers
do you believe you have in that court

266
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,170
as the king with questionable legitimacy

267
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,630
who ascended as the son
of a deranged king?

268
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,480
I have no need for evidence.

269
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,220
After all…

270
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,350
you just presented your confession.

271
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Enter.

272
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,870
Kim Bong-in…

273
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,750
dared to order a blind fortune teller

274
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,130
to harm the late king and even attempted
to assassinate the Queen and the Prince.

275
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,140
There can be no higher treason.

276
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,430
He shall be
immediately stripped of his title,

277
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,430
have his assets confiscated,

278
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,890
and be exiled to Geoje Island!

279
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,480
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

280
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
Do not dawdle.

281
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,820
Drag that treasonous criminal away now!

282
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,520
<i>Gangcheori remains so distressed.</i>

283
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,310
<i>I cannot force him to go.</i>

284
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,440
<i>What should I do?</i>

285
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,700
<i>Maybe I can talk to His Majesty</i>
<i>and go without him?</i>

286
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,420
Gangcheori.

287
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,220
A long journey awaits us.
What took you so long?

288
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,430
I was thinking about
how I would go without you.

289
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,680
Have you lost your mind?

290
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,720
How could I send you alone
when that procession is swarming with men?

291
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,810
What?

292
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,400
Did you tell me to endure it
by hating and resenting you?

293
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,190
Do you think
that would be possible for me?

294
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,780
I may now have a fleeting grasp

295
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,700
of the mortal concept of loss…

296
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,790
but I am still Gangcheori.

297
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,370
I am not eternally foolish like mortals.

298
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,670
I have clear insight
into whom I should hate and resent.

299
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,090
Then?

300
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,670
That damn Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

301
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,930
I shall crush him.

302
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,430
I refuse to just idly stand by…

303
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,480
as he holds Bibi's luminous pearl.

304
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,320
Look at him. He deserves to die.

305
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,860
How could he do that to the Queen?

306
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,410
Who are you?

307
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,680
Yapper, you scoundrel.

308
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,560
What brings you here this late,
my lordship?

309
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,530
Did you say that Warrior Deity ghost
or whatever it is

310
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,650
is now stronger than ever?

311
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,400
Yes, I certainly did.

312
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,780
Then, command that ghost

313
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,490
to end the King's life right now!

314
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,790
Pardon? My goodness, my lordship…

315
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,420
I already told you, my lordship.

316
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,630
I do not know
what sort of protection he has,

317
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,680
but even the Warrior Deity
is unable to approach the King.

318
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,100
So, if you could just be
a little bit more patient--

319
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,180
My neck is already on the chopping block.

320
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,730
How much longer do you expect me to wait?

321
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,560
Stop wagging that silver tongue

322
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,610
and end the King's life

323
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,150
this instant!

324
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,950
You scoundrel.

325
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,250
How dare you…

326
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,970
There was a time when I needed you,

327
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,980
but I no longer do.

328
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,980
Hence,

329
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,520
I have no reason to hold back anymore.

330
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,280
You damn scoundrel, how dare you!

331
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
How--

332
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
That is…

333
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,310
Yongdam Village.

334
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,350
Such strange connections we share…

335
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,570
Yongdam Village serves as the hometown
for you and Yoon Gap.

336
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,820
It is where Imugi Gangcheori fell
to the ground amidst his ascension

337
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,620
and also the birthplace
of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

338
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

339
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,120
The connections are too strange
to be called a coincidence.

340
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,290
<i>I saw it.</i>

341
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,500
On the day I was born 100 years ago,

342
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,840
I saw you fall to the ground.

343
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,930
Then, why?

344
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,300
Why do you attack me and not them?

345
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,980
Head Eunuch, make your way
to the Ducheong-hyeon Magistrate

346
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:50,780
and see if there is
any useful information in the records.

347
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,650
Yes, Your Majesty.

348
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Your Majesty.

349
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,600
I am honored to have you grace us
with your presence

350
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,850
in our lowly corner of the world.

351
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,850
Despite the circumstances,
I am pleased to see you again.

352
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,980
Even if you are the man

353
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,990
who left a single letter behind
before abandoning the King.

354
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
Your Majesty…

355
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,030
I was merely jesting. Nothing more.

356
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,250
The physician recommended
I visit a hot spring,

357
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,880
so I stopped by on my way
to the auxiliary palace,

358
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,880
after Examiner Yoon Gap spoke so highly
of Yongdam Village's beautiful scenery.

359
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,970
I am very glad that you did.
Please, come inside.

360
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,700
How is she doing?

361
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,950
Mak-geum and the old maid are
diligently keeping an eye on her.

362
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
Do not worry.

363
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,540
Once His Majesty retires to slumber,

364
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,750
secretly let her out.

365
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,500
I must send her to my wife's family.

366
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,670
Yes, Your Excellency.

367
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,390
What are you looking for?

368
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,940
That girl, In-seon, is nowhere to be seen.

369
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:51,230
What? Are you curious
about where the girl who likes you went?

370
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,320
Green with envy again?

371
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,860
Do not worry.
You are more than enough maiden for me.

372
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,950
What?

373
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,910
We need to find out about Choi Won-u's
ancestor from 100 years ago.

374
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,910
If a member of his family
is willing to show us kindness,

375
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,330
that is a good thing, is it not?
It could even be helpful.

376
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,790
That was why I was looking for her.

377
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,040
Sure. Great. I see.

378
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,010
Maybe you should just ask someone
where Lady In-seon is.

379
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,760
Excuse me.

380
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,090
Has Lady In-seon stepped out?

381
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,220
I am not sure.

382
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,150
Is this the last of it?

383
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,440
Here. That is the last one.

384
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,870
These are what remains of the daily logs
after the war 100 years ago.

385
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:47,160
There was fire everywhere
and people were being dragged away.

386
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,620
That is all that remains.

387
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,000
Are you sure there is nothing else?

388
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,500
Do your ears not work?

389
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,920
I said that is all that remains.

390
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,010
Hold on.

391
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:06,310
Are you sure you came
with the King's procession?

392
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,940
I am the head eunuch.

393
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,020
Head… eunuch?

394
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,650
My goodness.
I never imagined such a title…

395
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,910
- Why? What were you thinking?
- Just some eunuch…

396
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,540
- "Just some eunuch"?
- Pardon me, my lord. My apologies.

397
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,580
My lord,

398
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,710
the whole village is abuzz right now.

399
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:36,590
Having the King visit this small village
is a rare sight indeed.

400
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,170
Speaking of,

401
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,550
it has been almost 100 years
since we had the King visit.

402
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,800
What did you say?

403
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,270
Are you saying the King
visited Ducheong-hyeon before?

404
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,640
Yes.

405
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,640
The story is passed down
like a legend of sorts.

406
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,480
During the war 100 years ago,

407
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,480
they say the King once
came here to take refuge.

408
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,950
I heard it from my late grandfather.

409
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
During the war 100 years ago…

410
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,910
Do you speak of King Yeonjong?

411
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,510
It appears Your Majesty cherishes
Examiner Yoon Gap.

412
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,560
He even accompanies you to the hot spring.

413
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,600
He is a peerless, loyal subject
with exceptional intellect

414
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,360
who always conducts himself properly

415
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,480
without ever deviating
from proper etiquette.

416
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,450
How could I not cherish him?

417
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:49,080
Your Majesty, you are
much too kind with your praise.

418
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,830
I am simply overwhelmed.

419
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,790
So, you do know how to be respectful
but you simply refused to be up until now.

420
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,710
Pardon?

421
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,590
It is nothing.

422
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,470
Your great-great-grandfather,
Lord Choi Gil-sang…

423
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,140
Since I have come all this way,

424
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:21,020
would you allow me to see some of the work
the literary master of his time produced?

425
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,700
My great-great-grandfather
left behind so many books.

426
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,830
Was there a particular title
you were interested in?

427
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,200
I heard when the northern barbarians
invaded 100 years ago,

428
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,670
Lord Choi Gil-sang acted
as a safeguard for King Yeonjong.

429
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,710
May I see the text he produced
during that time?

430
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,470
It appears Your Majesty…

431
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,020
did not come to Yongdam Village
for the scenery.

432
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,070
Her father did this to my legs

433
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,080
and even took my life.

434
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,210
<i>I definitely banished</i>
<i>that one-legged ghost last time.</i>

435
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,170
<i>Is he back?</i>

436
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,880
<i>I sense his energy, but I do not see him.</i>

437
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,680
My lady! My goodness!

438
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,140
My goodness, my lady!

439
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,680
My lady, you cannot! Please stop!

440
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,890
My lady!

441
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,100
Goodness me.

442
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,440
My lady!

443
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,570
<i>Has the one-legged ghost</i>
<i>possessed her again?</i>

444
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,660
My goodness! My lady!

445
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,740
My great-great-grandfather left behind
a great amount of texts,

446
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,660
but he did not leave behind any

447
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,710
on the war 100 years ago.

448
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,130
Is that so?

449
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,130
Who goes there!

450
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,060
Step back.

451
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,110
Stop!

452
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,730
She is my daughter.

453
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,490
My daughter is seriously ill.

454
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,820
Please…

455
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,240
- My lady!
- My lady!

456
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,870
My goodness. My lady!

457
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,710
Hey, it has been a while.

458
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,840
Let go of me!

459
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,510
She is suffering from a <i>dongti.</i>

460
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,430
DONGTI: SUPERNATURAL AFFLICTION
BROUGHT BY THE WRATH OF SPIRITS

461
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,970
<i>Dongti</i>?

462
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
Something has gone awry

463
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,730
and Her Lady has been possessed
by a vengeful ghost.

464
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,560
What exactly happened to her?

465
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,780
You are the wench
who got in my way last time.

466
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,240
Are you at it again?

467
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,360
You will pay for this!

468
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,570
What happened to her?

469
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,410
I can only cure her
if you tell me the truth.

470
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,960
If we just let her be,
Her Lady's life will be in danger.

471
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:32,130
She said His Excellency's ancestor
was angered.

472
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,760
Who said that?

473
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,140
The shaman from the upper village.

474
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:43,930
So, an ancestral appeasement rite
was performed?

475
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,570
His Excellency had no other choice.

476
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,070
He has been experiencing a string
of strange incidents recently.

477
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,700
However, the day
after the ancestral appeasement rite,

478
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,580
Her Lady became…

479
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,750
She became what you see now…

480
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,960
That shaman made a mistake.

481
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,000
This is not an ancestral issue.

482
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,340
This is a vengeful ghost.

483
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,720
A ghost with an amputated leg.

484
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,970
A one-legged ghost.

485
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,060
Did you just say it had

486
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,100
an amputated leg?

487
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,060
You are the scoundrel who killed me!

488
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,230
You did it!

489
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,360
You did this to my leg!

490
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,740
In-seon…

491
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,700
Is that true?

492
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,130
I asked if that was true.

493
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,650
I did not mean to kill him at first.

494
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,200
Who is the one you killed?

495
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:30,000
His name was Jang Eon-su.
He used to be my book merchant.

496
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,170
Book merchant?

497
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,340
He stole books
that were my family heirlooms.

498
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,010
I caught him
and wanted to teach him a lesson,

499
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,930
but I went a bit too far…

500
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,850
He ended up losing his life as a result.

501
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,970
When did that happen?

502
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,020
It happened five years ago.

503
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,400
Five years ago.

504
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:00,490
That was around the time
you stepped down from your government post

505
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,570
and returned to your hometown.

506
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,120
Let us try to save your daughter first.

507
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,790
It appears it will not be too late…

508
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,010
to have you pay for your murder later.

509
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,060
Your Majesty…

510
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,690
Your Majesty.

511
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,400
I reviewed all the records
at the magistrate,

512
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,200
but I did not find anything noteworthy
on the war 100 years ago.

513
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,910
However,

514
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,700
I did hear a strange tale.

515
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,700
What did it entail?

516
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,670
They say King Yeonjong

517
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:00,170
came to Yongdam Village to take refuge
from the war 100 years ago.

518
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,550
What did you say?

519
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,890
There is no official record of it.

520
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:09,720
It was a sort of legend
that was passed down by word of mouth.

521
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,850
The pieces of the fragmented narrative
are coming together.

522
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,020
It must mean King Yeonjong
and the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

523
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,650
experienced some sort of conflict
here in Yongdam Village.

524
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,940
The remaining missing pieces

525
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,700
are probably held
by that book merchant, Jang Eon-su.

526
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,030
Jang Eon-su?

527
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,660
Do you mean the ghost
that has possessed his daughter?

528
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,700
Did you not sense it earlier?

529
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:35,080
Choi Won-u was hiding something.

530
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,500
That secret is probably hidden
in one of the books the merchant stole.

531
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,880
- Where are you going?
- Why do you…

532
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,880
Yeo-ri asked me to do something.

533
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,890
I doubt she did.

534
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:52,390
Why that little…

535
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,120
You should drink some water.
You do not want to choke.

536
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,700
Here.

537
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,300
Did Yeo-ri not tell you?

538
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:27,380
This was made by a renowned palace maid
from the Royal Confectionery.

539
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,970
She only agreed to make them
because I asked her to.

540
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,520
Even the royal palace chef
could not do better.

541
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,730
Since they are so tasty,
you should have one, too, Grilled Abalone.

542
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:01,340
I, too, lost my sister when I was young.

543
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,960
Our family was so dirt poor,

544
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:07,050
we could not even afford to get her
any medicine before she passed.

545
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,140
I could not let the rest
of my siblings end up like that,

546
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,680
so I willingly decided to become a eunuch.

547
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:19,060
How do mortals endure it
every time someone dies?

548
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,190
Well, there are some regrets

549
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:23,730
and some guilt…

550
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,490
You miss them…

551
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,780
And before I realized it,
the years have passed by in a flash.

552
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:38,960
So tasty.

553
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,350
It is the hour of the rat now.

554
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,690
Are you sure
you can save Her Lady this way?

555
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,650
I need to try first.

556
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,790
FIRE

557
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:37,100
WATER

558
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,060
WATER

559
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,880
FIRE

560
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:13,970
<i>This is the remedy</i>
<i>that undoes the wrongdoing</i>

561
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:16,430
<i>to set it right.</i>

562
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:18,510
WATER

563
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,050
My lady.

564
00:46:58,850 --> 00:46:59,850
My lady!

565
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,110
You wench. You dare get in my way again?

566
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,980
I will make you pay!

567
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,170
Are you all right?

568
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:29,710
- Behind you.
- What?

569
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:31,130
- Behind you!
- Behind me?

570
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,130
We need to catch him.

571
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:40,350
That damn straw-stuffed punk…

572
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,270
That punk just has
to make things difficult.

573
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,170
- That little punk…
- Hold on. Just give me a moment.

574
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,340
Not yet.

575
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:25,430
You can slash me with a sword
or lock me up in that chest for eternity.

576
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,850
But still, I desperately desire

577
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,020
to get my revenge
on that old geezer first.

578
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,070
How can you even say that
after torturing that girl for so long?

579
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,360
What is it? What is your revenge?

580
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,200
The very thing

581
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,450
that old geezer dreaded the most…

582
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,620
I want that book to be revealed
for the world to see.

583
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,370
I want that book filled
with terrible royal secrets

584
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,250
to be released for all to see.

585
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,500
That is the revenge I seek.

586
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:59,090
What could possibly be in that book
for you to cause such a mess?

587
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,800
It is an extraordinary book.

588
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:04,550
A tale of the King
of this nation 100 years ago

589
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,680
and a certain military officer.

590
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:25,580
How did it go?

591
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,240
Were you able to exorcise that ghost?

592
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,830
Yes. We managed to catch
the one-legged ghost.

593
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:36,920
Then, the scoundrel
who has been tormenting for so long

594
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,880
is done for.

595
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,050
Yes.

596
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:47,640
However, the ghost told us
something quite strange.

597
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,720
What do you mean?

598
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:50,890
He abruptly told us "that book"

599
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,350
was hidden in the spot where he died.

600
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:56,610
Can you make any sense
of what he was referring to?

601
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,860
Did you not hear His Lord earlier?

602
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:08,240
He was a brazen book merchant
who stole precious books from him.

603
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:10,200
It must have been one of those books.

604
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,830
- Am I right, my lord?
- Your Majesty.

605
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,670
That book merchant died
while being flogged in this very yard.

606
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,340
How could he have hidden a book here?

607
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:22,220
Is that so?

608
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,550
How can we believe the words of a ghost?

609
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,760
He must have lied.

610
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,940
A few months ago,

611
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:24,150
you sold off a whole bunch of books to me.

612
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,240
I do not know how it got mixed in,

613
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,620
but I came across something
I should not have seen.

614
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,490
It was a book that looked
to be about 100 years old.

615
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,830
Now, you finally make eye contact.

616
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,670
Yes, that is right.
<i>The Anthology of Light and Darkness</i>.

617
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:44,710
The sentences are so elegant,
but the subject matter is quite intense.

618
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,430
Since it is a book filled
with such sensitive, royal secrets,

619
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,850
if that book was ever released
into the world,

620
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:53,220
it would greatly tarnish the reputation
of you and your family.

621
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,020
That book…

622
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,690
Where is it now?

623
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,770
Hand it over this instant.

624
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,320
Jeez. He has me waiting here forever.
What is taking him so long?

625
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,910
THE ANTHOLOGY OF LIGHT
AND DARKNESS

626
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,460
Finally, my lord.

627
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,220
So? Were you able to secure the money?

628
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,150
You know, I am surprised
by how little 200 <i>nyang</i>

629
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,610
actually weigh in real life.

630
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:32,820
- What?
- But I have some bad news.

631
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,700
I forgot to bring the actual book.

632
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,740
I will be sure to bring it next time,

633
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:40,040
so please prepare
another 300 <i>nyang, </i>my lord.

634
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,330
Why, you!

635
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:45,210
That is a small price to pay
to save the family name.

636
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,130
You damn vermin.

637
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,970
How dare you insult my family!

638
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:55,100
Please do not do this.

639
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,440
Why you old geezer…

640
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:17,490
You have until tomorrow.

641
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,910
It's 300 <i>nyang.</i>

642
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:22,870
Why, you rotten bastard!

643
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,880
Sniveling book merchant…

644
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,690
Who knew it would be hidden here?

645
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:31,330
THE ANTHOLOGY OF LIGHT
AND DARKNESS

646
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,380
Forgive me, Great-great-grandfather.

647
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,260
In order to save our family…

648
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:51,940
What are you doing?

649
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,020
Hot!

650
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,860
- What are you…
- Jeez.

651
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:01,820
Just look at it. The book is a mess now.

652
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:06,490
Well, at least the pages inside
are perfectly fine.

653
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,950
What do you think you are doing?

654
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,410
Hand it over this instant!

655
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,580
- I do not want to.
- Such impertinence!

656
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,670
Hand it over! Right now!

657
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:19,670
Your Majesty.

658
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:25,600
Everything is in this book.

659
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:32,900
THE ANTHOLOGY OF LIGHT
AND DARKNESS

660
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:36,360
How the Eight-foot-tall Ghost was born…

661
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,800
<i>Step forth and face me if you will.</i>

662
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,340
I will never back down.

663
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:07,310
I will never kneel before you.

664
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:13,560
I will look directly into your eyes

665
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:16,900
to face you and fight.

666
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,440
I refuse…

667
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,650
to bow down to you!

668
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:57,040
Warrior Deity…

669
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,920
<i>Is everything in this book true?</i>

670
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,790
<i>This place was truly hell back then.</i>

671
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,920
<i>The Eight-foot-tall Ghost…</i>

672
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,420
The grudges of the villagers of Yongdam
from 100 years ago are intertwined.

673
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,420
<i>The Prince's chambers!</i>

674
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:52,050
<i>Lord Yoon Gap?</i>

675
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,100
<i>It does not make any sense. Why release</i>
<i>a soul he devoured for no reason?</i>

676
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,230
On purpose? Why?

677
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:58,850
<i>It has all been taken from me.</i>

678
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,690
<i>Foster that grudge.</i>

679
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:04,520
<i>You just need to lure out</i>
<i>Examiner Yoon Gap for me.</i>

680
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:07,740
<i>I might not be able</i>
<i>to protect Yeo-ri at this rate…</i>
