1
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,917
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,421
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,179
RETURN

4
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,147
Yeo-ri.

5
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,652
I had palace attendants swiftly make this,

6
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,404
but…

7
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,615
will this be enough?

8
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,824
Yes.

9
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,410
I need this to break the curse.

10
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,245
My goodness. All right.

11
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,208
- Take it.
- Yes, my lord.

12
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,007
Are you sure you can make it there
in such a state?

13
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,926
I must.

14
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,304
Gangcheori will be in danger
if I do not go.

15
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,389
Then again,

16
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,518
it did seem like that rowdy Imugi
cared for you deeply.

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,688
You must go if it distresses you so.
Let us go.

18
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,233
- Let us prepare to leave.
- Yes, my lord.

19
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,742
<i>First, I need to save Gangcheori.</i>

20
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,252
Stand your ground!

21
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,222
Your Majesty!

22
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,062
- Stay back. You will only get in the way.
- But--

23
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,274
I do not need one more victim to save.

24
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,706
<i>That drowned ghost</i>
<i>will appear during the daytime.</i>

25
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:31,920
<i>Rotten water spreads easier</i>
<i>under the hot sun.</i>

26
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,504
<i>Gangcheori is in danger.</i>

27
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,394
<i>This water has a rotten stench.</i>

28
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,105
<i>I cannot…</i>

29
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,649
<i>I cannot breathe.</i>

30
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,363
<i>A member of the royal bloodline.</i>

31
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,949
<i>Come with me.</i>

32
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,743
<i>You will come with me!</i>

33
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,818
Your Majesty!

34
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,904
Do not just stand there! Take him now!

35
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,630
<i>It is not like last time.</i>

36
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,592
<i>This water reeks of decay.</i>

37
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,386
I cannot breathe…

38
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,931
Imugi, the cocky freshwater sovereign.

39
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,684
Not so cocky now in that mortal body.

40
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,814
How's the taste of rotten water?

41
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,858
Now, I end you!

42
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,535
<i>The curse…</i>

43
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,931
Your Majesty. He fell into the water.

44
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,057
Should we…

45
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,571
What are these?

46
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,198
Consider it a last-resort weapon.

47
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,785
Although I am sure we will not need it.

48
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,000
"Earth overcomes water."

49
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,753
Dirt will bind and trap water.

50
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,051
Dirty wandering spirit.

51
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,095
Let me show you the true power…

52
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,436
of the freshwater sovereign.

53
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,363
Oh, no! Your Majesty!

54
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,491
Your Majesty! Are you all right?

55
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,285
What is that on your neck?

56
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,828
I am fine.

57
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:04,835
However…

58
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,513
Gangcheori!

59
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,784
<i>He has been cursed. I must hurry.</i>

60
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,900
I call upon the guardians
of the Blue-East, White-West,

61
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,153
Red-South, Black-North,

62
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,404
and Yellow-Center…

63
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,033
Please return the curses
from all cardinal directions

64
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,827
back to their origins.

65
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,834
You rotten wench…

66
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,604
Gangcheori!

67
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,652
It looks like the curse was broken.

68
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,738
Why is he not waking up?

69
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,740
Gangcheori.

70
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,450
Wake up.

71
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,243
Gangcheori, wake up!

72
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,787
Wake up already!

73
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,879
Seeing how you are yelling
at the top of your lungs,

74
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,089
it seems you've recovered.

75
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,181
You're alive.

76
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,517
You are alive…

77
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,479
I was worried something might have
happened to you.

78
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:46,997
The curse…

79
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,625
was broken.

80
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,294
That is impossible.

81
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,380
You must be mistaken.

82
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,174
You were sure even that brat
was struck with the curse.

83
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,802
Then, how could it have been broken?

84
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,637
That wench…

85
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,848
hails from Yongdam Village.

86
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,183
Yongdam Village?

87
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,394
What is so special about that?

88
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,938
How dense and worthless you are.

89
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,108
Did you actually forget
about Yongdam Village?

90
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,492
But that happened a long time ago.

91
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,869
It must be a coincidence--

92
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,036
Coincidence?

93
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,623
You need more than an Imugi by your side
to confront the Warrior Deity

94
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,251
and break the drowned ghost's curse
with such swiftness.

95
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,211
You still think it's a coincidence?

96
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:36,797
But…

97
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,134
His Lordship did not mention anything.

98
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,553
How could His Lordship know?

99
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,890
<i>Take that deceased spirit</i>

100
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:50,269
<i>Cleanse the soul and purify the spirit…</i>

101
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,188
<i>You and I</i>

102
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,273
were the only ones
to visit Yongdam Village.

103
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,785
You…

104
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,503
- My goodness.
- Such behavior…

105
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,004
You seem perfectly fine now.

106
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,966
Of course, I am the almighty Gangcheori.

107
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,427
A drowned ghost is no match for me.

108
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,250
Your Majesty,
we should return to the palace.

109
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,253
We must swiftly get
your injuries looked at.

110
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:58,837
Let us return.

111
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,300
Go on.

112
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,596
Are you all right? Let me see.

113
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,931
I'm fine.

114
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,152
I have a bad feeling about this.

115
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,999
Your Highness,
His Majesty is here for you.

116
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,130
Your Majesty.

117
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,798
Your Majesty,

118
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,426
Her Highness has made a full recovery…

119
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,188
Your Majesty.

120
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,858
Forgive me for worrying you.

121
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,405
I am fine now.

122
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,118
They say the child in my womb
is also healthy.

123
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,542
Such wonderful news.

124
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,006
I was terrified that I might…

125
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,927
end up losing you.

126
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,350
Your Majesty.

127
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,230
Damn wandering spirit.

128
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,863
Do not bother wasting your energy.

129
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,367
Without a single drop of water around,
you will not be able to flee.

130
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,997
Who instigated this?

131
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,290
Answer me.

132
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,292
Or I shall seal you
in that puppet once more

133
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,169
and bury you in the ground.

134
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,254
Go on.

135
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,632
This punk…

136
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,220
Start talking! You wretched scoundrel.

137
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,312
We will not be able to get
this scoundrel to talk.

138
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,356
Seal him in the puppet once more.

139
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,318
I shall bury him deep
in the driest, most barren land.

140
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,279
There is no need

141
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,906
to rush his burial.

142
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,958
I heard you appeared
in the Queen's nightmares every night

143
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,460
to torment her.

144
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,295
But did you know

145
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,088
you are targeting the wrong person?

146
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,470
Seeing your current state,

147
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,181
the cause of your death
must have been drowning.

148
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,061
Instead of retrieving your head
from the water for a proper funeral rite,

149
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,354
an insidious individual placed it

150
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,273
in the Queen's pillow
for the sake of a curse.

151
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,444
Should you not expose them
so they may be punished?

152
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,784
I am sure they made you
a promise of some sort.

153
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,330
Tell me.

154
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,083
I shall grant you your wish.

155
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,005
My wish?

156
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,967
That is right. Your wish.

157
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,052
So tell me.

158
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,392
You need to grant my wish first.

159
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,103
After you do,

160
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,022
I will tell you who that individual is.

161
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,985
He is Bang Mak-dol, an off-site slave
from Goksan, Chungcheong-do.

162
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,822
He says he died ten years ago
due to a flood.

163
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,909
He has agreed to speak
if I deliver his remains to his daughter.

164
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,788
Then, you leave for Goksan immediately?

165
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,123
Yes.

166
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:48,127
I believe I will be able to meet
his daughter if I visit his former home.

167
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,343
Come closer.

168
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,141
Closer.

169
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,357
So, are you feeling better now?

170
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,985
I am fine now, Your Majesty.

171
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,487
Thank you for bestowing me
those precious medicinal herbs.

172
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,281
No need to thank me.

173
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,659
I will grant you the use of a horse.
Have a safe journey.

174
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,328
Clerk Officer.

175
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,166
You shall escort her there,
she has a rough journey ahead.

176
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,585
I shall do my very best to keep her safe.

177
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,964
Then, I shall take my leave.

178
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,508
All right. Safe travels.

179
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,764
What is the matter?

180
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,685
That queen woman remains reclined,
resting in her bed.

181
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,061
You suffered the same curse,

182
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,980
yet you are sent off
to some faraway place?

183
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,316
Is he just allowed to abuse
the lower class as he wishes?

184
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,736
Watch your tongue. His Majesty
generously provided her with a horse.

185
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,654
Horse? He should have
given her a palanquin!

186
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,325
- I must go back and argue with him.
- I told you I am perfectly fine.

187
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,701
Really?

188
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,874
Your Majesty.

189
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:13,170
Were you overly affectionate
toward that Yeo-ri on purpose?

190
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,755
Was it obvious?

191
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,633
Just a bit.

192
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,387
That Gangcheori
was steaming from his ears.

193
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,440
My word.

194
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,400
What? What is it?

195
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,986
What is it? Is there misfortune?

196
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,865
My goodness, say something.

197
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,452
Maybe it is because
of those awful rumors about the Imugi?

198
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,621
Not to mention,
officials are dropping like flies.

199
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,750
I am just a ball of anxiety.

200
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,794
A flood has broken out.

201
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,879
The trees are about to be uprooted.

202
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,756
Does that mean…

203
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,050
I am going to die?

204
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,721
Do not worry. I shall save you, my lord.

205
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,352
I shall craft this talisman for you
with the utmost care.

206
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,854
Always keep it with you at all times.

207
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,024
Do not go anywhere without it, all right?

208
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,612
<i>The almighty Imugi is</i>
<i>just a snake at the end of the day.</i>

209
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,532
<i>Hence, it must be stopped</i>
<i>by its </i>gluttonous <i>mortal enemy,</i>

210
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,992
<i>the pig.</i>

211
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,385
Take it back.
I do not believe in such things.

212
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,097
Just accept it for my sake.

213
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,311
I had it crafted by the noble elder
of the Association of the Blind

214
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,938
and even brought one for you.

215
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,483
Do you truly believe
this will make a difference?

216
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,277
We live in strange times.

217
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,655
Our colleagues
are dying one after another.

218
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,950
Almost as if someone is aiding the king.

219
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,164
Whether it is a ghost or an Imugi,

220
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,708
it is better to be safe than sorry.

221
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,463
Keep it with you.

222
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,617
Can I help you?

223
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,078
Is this the residence of Bang Mak-dol?

224
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,289
Yes. He is my father.

225
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,250
But he passed away a long time ago.

226
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,842
What is this?

227
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,179
They are your father's remains.

228
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,556
What?

229
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,685
What do you…

230
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,244
Father…

231
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,584
Please forgive me.

232
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,256
My father ended up like this
as he tried to save me.

233
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,843
Please forgive me.

234
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,223
My dear Kkeut-sun…

235
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,977
Kkeut-sun…

236
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,438
Hey.

237
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,275
We granted your wish,
now honor your promise.

238
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,194
I am beginning to get hungry.

239
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,655
Hey, Lady Shaman.

240
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,825
My daughter's heart has been shattered.

241
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:16,121
Can you lend me your body
so I can just tell her a few words?

242
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,748
That is a bit…

243
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,709
We pull you from the roaring river

244
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,211
and now you want to rob us?
This is not what we agreed upon!

245
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,504
Then, what?

246
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,215
Do you want my baby, my poor Kkeut-sun,

247
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,093
to live with that sorrow forever?

248
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,637
How can you be so heartless?

249
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,432
To hell with it!

250
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,309
If you refuse,

251
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,603
these lips will remain sealed for good.

252
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,354
What a rotten scoundrel…

253
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,191
I will beat you up
and teach you a mighty lesson.

254
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,450
Do you promise to answer our questions
if I let you briefly borrow my body?

255
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,452
I will tell you everything!

256
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,287
Every single little thing I remember!

257
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,915
Do you know how exhausting
being possessed can be?

258
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,249
And you just offer yourself up?

259
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,293
Did you forget your body is mine--

260
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,544
Just for a brief moment!

261
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,674
I just need to tell her one thing.

262
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,805
A very brief moment.

263
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:19,309
Do I just enter now? Yes? Now?

264
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,810
Do I?

265
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,229
You are entering nothing…

266
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,530
It worked. Golly gee!

267
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,698
Already?

268
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,825
That damn brat…

269
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,411
Have you lost your mind?

270
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,206
That is why I told you not to go!

271
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:45,085
If you had just listened to your father,
we could have avoided this mess! Well?

272
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,295
Father?

273
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,089
Father, is that you?

274
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,799
Yes, it is me.

275
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,177
Who else would I be?

276
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,721
Anyhow!

277
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,100
You just never listened
ever since you were a kid.

278
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,102
You just had to walk into the flood--

279
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,520
Then, what about you?

280
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,106
You would have yelled at me again
if I lost that fishing net!

281
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,565
And what about you?

282
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,110
You should have reeled it in
when I told you to!

283
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,407
My goodness.

284
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,618
Look at this little one.

285
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,870
Who does he get his handsome looks from?

286
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,417
Look at you, Kkeut-sun.

287
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,877
You even commendably birthed
this strapping lad.

288
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,129
Father!

289
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,463
She is a daughter!

290
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,758
Oh, a daughter?

291
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,056
She looks exactly like you
when you were a baby.

292
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,645
Wait.

293
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,647
Father!

294
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,482
Kkeut-sun.

295
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,485
It was not your fault.

296
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:56,031
It was just my fate. All right?

297
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,701
And on my ancestral rites table,

298
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,497
can you just place
a dried persimmon for me?

299
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,962
Father!

300
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,714
Father…

301
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,924
Dried persimmon and what else?

302
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,970
What else do you want to eat?

303
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,096
That will be enough.

304
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,848
Oh, Father…

305
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,726
- My sweet puppy…
- Father.

306
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,356
You better have a happy life.

307
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,193
Do not cry for me anymore.

308
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,904
Father…

309
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,411
But…

310
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,580
what is this "dried persimmon"?

311
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,586
A blind man?

312
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,922
Yes. He could not see.

313
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,007
After being swept away by the flood,

314
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,885
my skull that had been rolling around
the bottom of some still river water

315
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,012
was caught by a fisherman's net.

316
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,806
And that blind rascal

317
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,850
was delighted to find a spirit
with a bitter grudge

318
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,269
and bought it off him.

319
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,314
- And who was that man?
- Let me see…

320
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,067
His name was…

321
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,408
Yapper, that scoundrel!

322
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,702
I heard someone call him that.

323
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,913
- Yapper?
- Yes.

324
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:31,251
Then, the Association of the Blind
held me captive for all those years.

325
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,253
Only recently,
that blind rascal took me out

326
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,464
and told me
he would let me see my daughter

327
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,676
if I brought him royal blood.

328
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,886
<i>The Yapper…</i>

329
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,306
A character of your magnitude is rare.

330
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,768
Your spiritual energy is
certainly more enticing

331
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,564
than the energy of that lowly Yapper.

332
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,442
<i>The Eight-foot-tall Ghost</i>
<i>definitely mentioned that name before.</i>

333
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,777
<i>The blind Yapper…</i>

334
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,112
<i>Who could it be?</i>

335
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:13,418
Gosh. It has been over ten years
since I have been to the capital.

336
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,295
I do not know where anything is.

337
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,047
If I knew I would be here so soon,

338
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,633
I would have asked that Yoon Gap

339
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,344
where his house was beforehand.

340
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,721
I mean…

341
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,514
Master?

342
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,600
Master!

343
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,728
- Master--
- What are you doing, old man?

344
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,856
You cannot just pick up and eat
what does not belong to you!

345
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,150
Does it look like
I am running a charity here?

346
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,903
My goodness. My apologies.

347
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,072
My master was a bit hungry.

348
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,575
I will pay you for it.

349
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,745
Here.

350
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,916
I would appreciate
a discount on the rice cakes.

351
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,518
I only came to the capital because

352
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,231
you told me you managed to acquire all
the books that book peddler had bought up.

353
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,107
But what is this?

354
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,443
The book I am looking for is not here!

355
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,529
My lord,

356
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,156
I am just as frustrated.
Exactly which book are you looking for?

357
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,284
How can I find it if I do not know
what I am looking for?

358
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,915
Search again.

359
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,208
You must acquire

360
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:39,128
all the books that scoundrel
has ever touched, looked at,

361
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,090
or even walked past in the capital.

362
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,347
Is that how you do business?

363
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,099
I don't need your business!

364
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,247
Are you all right?

365
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,832
Yes.

366
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,712
You rotten scoundrel!

367
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,798
You better scram this instant!

368
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,217
Is there something up there?

369
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,011
I don't see anything.

370
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,388
- Do you see anything?
- Nothing but air.

371
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,309
I don't see anything.
Who is that fellow talking to?

372
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,356
Here you are, Master.

373
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,444
I was worried
how we would pay for the rice cakes.

374
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,738
Thank you for your generous offering.

375
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,407
Not at all. I owe you a great thanks.

376
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:55,288
I do not know why such things
have been happening to me recently.

377
00:31:56,456 --> 00:32:00,001
There is no smoke without fire.

378
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,211
Pardon?

379
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,881
I managed to chase it away for now,

380
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,551
but it seems you partook
in the formation of a deep grudge.

381
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,639
I am afraid I do not understand.

382
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,725
Not even in the slightest.

383
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,938
You must face your sin and repent

384
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,023
to guide the bad energy out

385
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,485
if you do not want this to repeat.

386
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,614
I take refuge in Amitabha.
May Avalokitesvara show us mercy.

387
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,034
Master, let us go now.

388
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,745
Here we go.

389
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,215
What?

390
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,676
We must swiftly return
and report back to His Majesty.

391
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,386
She is in no state to ride a horse.

392
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,012
Go on ahead if it is so urgent.

393
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,556
What are you talking about?
We need to catch this Yapper.

394
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,976
He must know
that the curse has been broken now.

395
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,310
We need to hurry back.

396
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,729
Do you even know how you look right now?

397
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,940
You were already weak
after that curse a few days ago.

398
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,401
And you even let
that trifling wandering spirit in today.

399
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,949
This will not do. I shall go on ahead.

400
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,911
Do you think the name Yapper
is enough to find him?

401
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,497
The Association of the Blind
should know something.

402
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,916
You get some rest.

403
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,668
Yes, my lord. Don't let me keep you.

404
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,849
Such great magnanimity you possess.

405
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,560
Did you already forget
his curse almost killed you?

406
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,397
Being possessed is beyond draining.

407
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,691
Why would you offer yourself up?

408
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:51,362
He put us through that hell,
just so he could scold his daughter again?

409
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,448
How pathetic.

410
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,492
He is not pathetic in the slightest.

411
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,745
Mortals do not even live to be 100.

412
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,914
That daughter of his will die
and join him in just a few years.

413
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,458
Why was he being so fussy?

414
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,796
What? What now?

415
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,465
Do you not understand?

416
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:15,178
The fact we cannot even live 100 years
makes the grief that much more poignant.

417
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,890
Just because you consider
fleeting mortal lives to be lowly,

418
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:23,186
do not call the love
between a father and daughter…

419
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,773
lowly.

420
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,698
My grandma said…

421
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,244
that everyone in the world

422
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,955
was pitiful and tragic behind it all.

423
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,794
I was hoping I would never find out
what she was feeling

424
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,838
as she lived
that foolishly obstinate life…

425
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,227
Noble Elder.

426
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,315
Burn it all.

427
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,235
Yes, sir.

428
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,378
With the curse broken,

429
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,756
who knows what
that drowned ghost will blab about?

430
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,176
They will soon investigate
the Association of the Blind.

431
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,178
Move it!

432
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,973
My goodness!

433
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,933
- Goodness me!
- What is going on?

434
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,978
Wait. Stop. Why are you doing this?

435
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,147
Hold on. What is going on?

436
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,276
My word.

437
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,486
My lord,

438
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,197
what brings you
to our squalid corner of the world?

439
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,826
Apprehend all the fortune tellers
in the Association of the Blind!

440
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,161
That is a royal order!

441
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,537
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

442
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,059
<i>All the fortune tellers</i>
<i>will be dragged out.</i>

443
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,020
Investigate every corner of that place.

444
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,190
You must find evidence.

445
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,020
My goodness!

446
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:14,065
Please, spare me, my lord.

447
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,399
Who are you?

448
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,570
I am just a mere servant here.

449
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,698
I swear I do not know anything!

450
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:28,120
My lord! I swear I do not know anything!

451
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,124
My lord.

452
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,960
- My lord!
- Take him to the State Tribunal.

453
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,212
- Yes, my lord.
- My lord…

454
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,967
Announcing His Majesty!

455
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,725
I, your lowly blind subject,

456
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,894
offer my humblest greetings

457
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,355
to Your Divine Majesty!

458
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,654
Do you know someone called Yapper?

459
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,282
Your Majesty, did you say the Yapper?

460
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,788
I have never heard
of such a name before, Your Majesty.

461
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,958
If I find that you speak
even a single lie,

462
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,003
you will deal with the harshest
of consequences.

463
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:22,550
Why would this pitiful creature
ever lie to His Majesty?

464
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:26,095
Then, it is true you have been frequenting
the Queen Dowager's Palace?

465
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,723
Answer me!

466
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,225
When did those visits start?

467
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,145
Are you asking when Her Grace,

468
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:38,065
the noble and exalted Queen Dowager,
began to show this pitiful creature

469
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,859
some favor, Your Majesty?

470
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,236
Let me think…

471
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:44,864
Yes.

472
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:49,243
It began when the late king passed,
during the Year of the Water Rabbit.

473
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,245
The Year of the Water Rabbit?

474
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,166
Her Grace married into the royal line
at the most tender age of 17

475
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,209
and experienced the greatest tragedy.

476
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,921
You must be aware
of it as well, Your Majesty.

477
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,049
That heinous evil spirit.

478
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,678
Your Majesty must be careful as well.

479
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,805
If you do not,

480
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,351
Your Majesty will not be able
to avoid great misfortune.

481
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,944
I thoroughly searched
the association grounds,

482
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,280
but I failed to procure any evidence.

483
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,366
I questioned the other fortune tellers,

484
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,035
but none were familiar
with this Yapper character.

485
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,080
Unbelievable…

486
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,040
Will this be all right, Your Majesty?

487
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,625
The Queen Dowager is involved.

488
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,960
Yeo-ri would not have spoken carelessly.

489
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,922
One of them must be the Yapper.

490
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,800
Imprison all of them
and continue the interrogation.

491
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,100
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

492
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,935
- Two soups with rice.
- Coming right up.

493
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,982
I feel much better after some warm food.

494
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,823
- Bring out one more.
- Coming.

495
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,033
- No, that will not be necessary.
- All right.

496
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,494
Why? I can easily finish another.

497
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,788
Stop eating already.
Do you know how much this costs?

498
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,332
I might not have enough…

499
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:23,629
You will end up with terrible regret
if you are stingy with your patron deity.

500
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,466
- We are done here. Let us go.
- What?

501
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,343
What?

502
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,512
What?

503
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,596
Take care.

504
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,392
You are going back now?

505
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:40,354
My stomach is full and I feel renewed.
There is no reason to delay.

506
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:48,988
My word.

507
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,699
You want to ride a horse
through the rain this late?

508
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,742
Not a chance.

509
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,911
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

510
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,670
My goodness. Look at it come down.

511
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,923
It looks like a passing shower.

512
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,967
We can go when it stops.

513
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,441
Why…

514
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,236
are you looking at me like that?

515
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,782
How am I looking at you?

516
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,660
You are looking at me as if I were

517
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,745
someone you longed for.

518
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,045
Yoon Gap did indeed have feelings for you.

519
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,966
Perhaps,

520
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,300
this heart races

521
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,555
at a dizzying speed when I look at you
because it belongs to him.

522
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,225
Or perhaps, it is just a cruel joke
being played on me

523
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,644
because I have been trapped
in this mortal body.

524
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,606
Truth be told, I am not sure either.

525
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,693
That is my current state.

526
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,195
What about you?

527
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,031
What do you mean?

528
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,950
I have always been curious.

529
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,202
When you smile at me,

530
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,246
is it for me to see? Or…

531
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,626
is it intended for Yoon Gap?

532
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,430
We need this rain to stop
if we want to leave.

533
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,601
But the rain just shows
no signs of stopping.

534
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,685
Hold on.

535
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,230
You are an Imugi,
a deity that governs the weather.

536
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,859
- Don't tell me…
- My goodness.

537
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:36,071
Do you think an Imugi can just control
the world's weather as he sees fit?

538
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,365
Even an Imugi has his limits.

539
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,759
Hear me!

540
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:01,263
I am about to die of thirst here.
Bring me a cup of water!

541
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,440
How dare an imprisoned criminal
give out orders?

542
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,067
Be quiet!

543
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,320
Does a mere constable
dare to speak down to me?

544
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,034
For your sake,

545
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,454
I suggest you go fetch it, unless
you want to be cursed in your sleep.

546
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,955
All right?

547
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,375
Water.

548
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,501
Damn it.

549
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,964
Noble Elder, what is to become of us?

550
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,218
You just had to go after
that wretched queen.

551
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,428
Look at this mess we are all in.

552
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,390
Noble Elder,
you should come up with a plan.

553
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,558
- Yes.
- Yes, please think of a good one.

554
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,228
Did you forget who we were?

555
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,271
Anyone who is anyone in the capital

556
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,816
has benefited from our association
at least once.

557
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,528
Buddhist temples are not allowed
in the capital

558
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,781
and shamanistic rituals are only permitted
ten li past the city walls.

559
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:02,991
No matter what anyone says,

560
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,662
we fortune tellers have managed
to survive all these years.

561
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,664
Am I wrong?

562
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,792
- Sure.
- You are right. Yes.

563
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,586
No one will be able to touch us.

564
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,132
Your Majesty, you cannot.

565
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,134
The orison of the blind

566
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,803
is not some ploy that seeks
to harm the people.

567
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,181
Your Majesty even showed benevolence
to the lowly slaves.

568
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,808
Without evidence, how could you imprison

569
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:32,396
the blind fortune tellers, the vulnerable
and destitute members of our society?

570
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,814
What are you saying?

571
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,443
Someone has committed
an unspeakable act of the mystical arts

572
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,652
against the Queen.

573
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,197
Yet, you suggest we just let them go
because we should pity their blindness?

574
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,324
The Chief State Councillor is right.

575
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,537
The Queen was in mortal danger
because of that incident.

576
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,372
If there is any truth to the allegations,

577
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,917
rationale dictates that
they should be properly investigated

578
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,378
to expose their crimes for all to see.

579
00:45:56,962 --> 00:46:00,090
However, all of you suggest
the association be freed

580
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:04,386
as if you had all conspired together.

581
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,140
Your Majesty.

582
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:12,352
Do you believe the Queen Dowager
utilized the association

583
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:16,607
to bring the Queen into harm's way?

584
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,736
I have yet to clarify as such.

585
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:25,657
Your Majesty.

586
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:31,663
I hear the blind fortune tellers visited
the Queen Dowager to recite scriptures

587
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,999
for the late Prince Yeongin.

588
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,001
How is that, Your Majesty?

589
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:39,963
Did that help clear the air for you,
Your Majesty?

590
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:46,303
They sure love to quote
the words of Confucius and Mencius,

591
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:50,474
but all the scholar-officials of this
nation secretly nudge their wives

592
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,894
to have talismans and hexes crafted
to ensure their good fortunes.

593
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,646
If we open our mouths,

594
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,689
their depraved secrets
will spill out one by one.

595
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,858
Should we be shaking like a leaf?

596
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,152
Or should they be?

597
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,238
It's clearly them.

598
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,124
Where in the world could he be?

599
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,349
Grilled Abalone.

600
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,393
If you have phlegm, just spit it out.

601
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,563
Must you do that?

602
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,566
Stop calling me Grilled Abalone.

603
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,943
I am the Head Eunuch.
You should address me as such.

604
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,821
I may have been

605
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,198
explicitly and overly irritated

606
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,534
about your conduct and manners recently,

607
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:54,454
but that was because I did not know
who was actually in your body.

608
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,166
You lacked the knowledge of etiquette
and propriety of the mortal world.

609
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,170
Now, I truly understand
where you are coming from.

610
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:06,216
Thus, that is enough
of that abalone business.

611
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,552
And just address me
as "my lord" or "Head Eunuch."

612
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,470
Do you understand?

613
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,763
Good.

614
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,766
Then, I shall see you around.

615
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,230
Tell Yeo-ri I am hungry
and to wrap it up so we can go home.

616
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,357
- Head--
- There we go.

617
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,318
Grilled Abalone.

618
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,779
Grilled Abalone.

619
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,990
Grilled Abalone!

620
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:39,458
Are you saying you were unable to find
the blind fortune teller named Yapper?

621
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,502
That's right.

622
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,047
We even questioned
the slaves at the association,

623
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,674
but no fortune teller had such a name.

624
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,761
Besides his name,

625
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,597
did the ghost give you any other clues?

626
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,849
Because he was also sealed
for all those years,

627
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:58,268
he did not know much.

628
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:02,439
Forgive me for my shortcomings,
Your Majesty.

629
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,693
No.

630
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,905
You have saved my family
several times already.

631
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,700
You saved the Prince and the Queen.

632
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,953
You also saved the baby
in the Queen's womb, did you not?

633
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,081
I thank you.

634
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:27,172
About your maternal grandmother…

635
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,467
Did you say her name was Neop-deok?

636
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,427
Yes, Your Majesty.

637
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,597
Did she ever mention
that she visited the palace?

638
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,266
No, she did not.

639
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,018
Not even once?

640
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:44,022
My grandmother passed away
in the Year of the Water Rabbit.

641
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,401
I was just a child when she passed.

642
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,819
The Year of the Water Rabbit…

643
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,698
Shaman Neop-deok died
in the Year of the Water Rabbit?

644
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,326
Yes. In the fifth month of the year.

645
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,703
How did she pass?

646
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,800
I asked you how she died.

647
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,317
<i>It was an accident.</i>

648
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,529
She fell into the sea during a ritual.

649
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,620
Your Majesty.

650
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,837
You may leave now.

651
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,660
My goodness. Do something.

652
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,496
I cannot believe this.

653
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,051
So clumsy.

654
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,488
What are you mad about now?

655
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,992
I also heard the news.

656
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,786
They failed to locate Yapper.

657
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,455
He managed to kill a prince
of this nation without hesitation.

658
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,041
Did you think
they would get him after one try?

659
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,919
They will find him soon.

660
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,672
Do not be too discouraged.

661
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,258
Yeo-ri.

662
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,052
Yeo-ri!

663
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:26,393
I went through hell catching that damn
drowned ghost because you asked me to.

664
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,312
I dealt with foolish mortals
even when they disgust me.

665
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:32,649
I did all that for you.
What could you possibly be mad at now?

666
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,651
Why are you treating me so coldly?

667
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,074
You are right. You did all those things.

668
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:42,701
However,

669
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:45,287
that was all
so I would accept you as my patron deity.

670
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,414
In order for you to ascend as a dragon.

671
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,499
And that is our deal.

672
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,377
Yes.

673
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,130
Thus, I am trying my best
to keep that promise.

674
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,550
I will also keep that promise,
no matter what.

675
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,678
I will properly serve you
as my patron deity,

676
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,180
and until the day you ascend as a dragon,

677
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,349
I shall pray with both hands and feet.

678
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,728
However, that is as far as I go.

679
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,814
I will do just that and nothing more.

680
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,984
Thus, you should do just
as much and nothing more.

681
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,903
Whether I am fatigued or not,

682
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,030
or whether I drop
my eyeglass chest or not,

683
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,073
do not meddle yourself.

684
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,410
Do not look at me like that either.

685
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:38,048
I am certain there is an instigator.

686
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,801
How else could they move
in such perfect unison?

687
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,721
However, it cannot be the Queen Dowager.

688
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:47,307
This is not how she operates.

689
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,017
Your Majesty.

690
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:53,605
You should release the members
of the Association of the Blind.

691
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,399
Chief State Councillor!

692
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:59,653
I, too, wish to punish the one responsible

693
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,364
in the most merciless way.

694
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,240
However,

695
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:08,620
there is no definitive evidence
to convince the court.

696
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,916
I put you in charge of that investigation
to find that very evidence.

697
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:18,171
In no way, am I trying to side
with the Queen Dowager.

698
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:23,593
If someone had conjured a nasty hex
against the royal bloodline,

699
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,554
then, the biggest victim
with the deepest wound

700
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,765
would be the Queen Dowager.

701
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,770
Her influence in the court
is quite formidable.

702
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,191
I fear this may lead…

703
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,236
to vicious backlash.

704
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,899
Your Majesty,
the Association of the Blind members

705
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,027
were just released
from the State Tribunal.

706
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:25,447
Are you certain
we should release them like this?

707
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,699
That is why evidence…

708
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:33,580
As of today, I am sure of it,
more than ever.

709
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:37,208
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost has a puppeteer.

710
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,213
But who could that be?

711
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,930
Investigate the association further.

712
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,975
I must catch the Yapper first.

713
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,200
Hey, grab me that towel.

714
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,884
It appears I have made a grave mistake.

715
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:32,013
Handing over of towels
is not a part of our deal. Our deal…

716
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:35,391
does not go that far.

717
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,310
I have committed a terrible breach.

718
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:38,645
I am truly, terribly sorry.

719
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,106
- Move.
- I am so sorry, I could die.

720
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,398
Move.

721
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,696
She could have just walked around me.
She just had to…

722
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:10,969
Grandma.

723
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:13,930
I…

724
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:18,726
was smiling at him.

725
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,318
<i>I was looking at the man who killed you</i>

726
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,737
<i>and smiling.</i>

727
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,285
I thought I was just confused.

728
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,289
I really believed that was why…

729
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,666
I'm sorry, Grandma.

730
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,464
Did Gangcheori really kill Neop-deok?

731
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,508
Hey, you were eavesdropping?

732
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:54,554
You were latched on to the Queen Dowager.
Why are you here now?

733
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,432
You promised to buy me new shoes
and you did not.

734
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,604
Thus, I will latch on to you

735
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:06,024
and torment you
with steadfast persistence.

736
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:07,984
Fine.

737
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,069
I hear you.
Can you just leave me alone now?

738
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,238
Leave now.
I will buy them for you tomorrow morning.

739
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,657
I am in no mood
to deal with you right now.

740
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,285
Hold on.

741
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,996
But how do you know my grandma?

742
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:21,539
Because I met her.

743
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,876
I told you I was older than your grandma.

744
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,169
Do you just not listen to me?

745
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,713
You met her? At the palace?

746
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:29,964
When?

747
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,216
So, that was…

748
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,386
Let me think.

749
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,097
Right. The fourth month
of the Year of the Water Rabbit.

750
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:42,143
That was a month before she passed away.

751
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:45,230
Was she really at the palace then?

752
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,940
That's what I said.

753
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,233
She came to the palace,

754
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,652
then left with some members
of the royal family.

755
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,320
So I followed them.

756
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,113
I hid nearby and saw everything.

757
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:58,785
Neop-deok and the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
made a mess in some temple courtyard.

758
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,496
What did you just say?

759
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:08,920
Ma'am, where did Gang…

760
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,338
I mean, where is Lord Yoon Gap?

761
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,215
He just left for some errand.
Did you not see him?

762
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,260
What is the matter?

763
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:18,054
I just remembered an urgent errand.
Please go ahead and sleep.

764
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,138
Where are you…

765
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,308
My goodness.
What if a night guard catches you?

766
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:30,316
<i>In the end, Neop-deok was able to</i>
<i>overpower the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.</i>

767
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,946
But I am pretty sure that ghost ended up
going after her to get his revenge.

768
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,328
The more I learn about a maiden's mind,
the less I know about it.

769
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,540
She is charming me
with her smile one moment

770
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:47,750
and bringing forth a blizzard the next.

771
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,920
The midwinter northern wind
has nothing on her.

772
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,881
Charming who? You?

773
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,341
As if you were mortal?

774
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,011
It is just a figure of speech.

775
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,056
Then, you can just stop here.

776
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,602
Just stop being that brat's patron deity.

777
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,563
What?

778
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,109
Do you regret it?

779
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:14,319
What are you talking about?

780
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:17,030
Back then, when you told that brat…

781
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,158
you killed her grandmother.

782
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,669
Geez. I told you no.

783
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:34,672
My goodness.

784
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,967
You cannot seek an audience
with him at this hour.

785
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,802
I must see His Majesty now.

786
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,763
It is regarding the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

787
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:42,847
Eight…

788
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:46,059
Did something else happen?

789
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:49,520
So…

790
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:51,939
what brings you here this late?

791
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,191
Your Majesty.

792
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,319
In the Year of the Water Rabbit,
the year you ascended the throne,

793
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,072
was the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
at the palace?

794
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,826
Was a member of the royal family back then

795
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,120
possessed by the Eight-foot-tall Ghost?

796
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,586
That is a private matter
of the royal family.

797
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,296
I cannot give you an answer.

798
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,674
No. I must know.

799
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,259
I must know when
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost first appeared

800
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,387
and who was responsible for its grudge.

801
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,597
I must.

802
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,850
Please, answer me, Your Majesty.

803
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,276
If you refuse to tell me the truth,

804
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,279
I will no longer be able

805
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,615
to assist Your Majesty.

806
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:48,788
Fine.

807
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:51,582
It was here.

808
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,503
During those horrific times…

809
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,296
Even back then…

810
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,926
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost was here.

811
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,638
That damn evil spirit…

812
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,100
took hold…

813
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,229
of the late king…

814
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,567
my father.

815
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,328
I believe that damn evil spirit…

816
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,583
also killed my grandmother.

817
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,548
<i>It was not Gangcheori.</i>

818
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:42,008
<i>It was the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.</i>

819
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:45,428
<i>The Eight-foot-tall Ghost</i>
<i>killed my grandma.</i>

820
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,269
Draw me a hot bath first.

821
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:57,106
My body stinks
after rolling around in that filth.

822
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,941
Yes, sir.

823
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,462
Yapper, you scoundrel!

824
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:23,174
My goodness! My lordship!

825
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:31,808
My goodness…

826
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:35,520
Please show me mercy, my lordship.

827
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,564
I know things
did not turn out well this time.

828
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,441
I am terribly upset about it as well!

829
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,779
Even in the afterlife,
I will not forget the great kindness

830
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,114
you have shown me
when you saved me this time.

831
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,951
But, you do not need to worry.

832
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,662
The Warrior Deity has a plan.

833
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:54,997
He has a brilliant plan to catch

834
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:58,709
those rascals and heal
all his injuries in one swoop.

835
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,804
Wait. You cannot.

836
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,597
No!

837
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,516
My lordship, you cannot!

838
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,602
Wait, my lordship! My lordship!

839
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,312
Please stop, my lordship!

840
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,647
Please stop!

841
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,193
Please stop, my lordship.

842
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:28,030
My goodness… No…

843
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:31,742
That will anger the Warrior Deity.

844
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,412
My lordship, you cannot…

845
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,205
My goodness. My lord…

846
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:39,458
I could not care less

847
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:40,918
about what a ghost does.

848
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:42,795
I pulled you from that nasty market

849
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,673
where you conjured hexes with the ghosts
of the children you starved,

850
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:48,092
and brought you all the way up here.

851
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:50,344
After making a complete mess
of everything,

852
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:53,139
you still seek out the Warrior Deity?

853
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,643
Who do you serve? Do you serve that ghost?

854
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,645
Or do you serve me?

855
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,273
Of course, I serve you, my lordship.

856
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,817
I will stay loyal

857
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,778
to your lordship until my dying breath.

858
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:11,157
My lordship. The month grace period

859
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,367
you granted me last time is not over yet.

860
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:17,330
I promise I will end
the prince's life by then.

861
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:19,457
Fine.

862
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:22,084
If you fail to take care of this by then,

863
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:25,212
I shall end your life with my bare hands.

864
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,767
My lordship!

865
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:38,976
That damn eyeglass artisan!

866
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,686
The wench who ruined everything!

867
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:44,690
She is of the same bloodline
as that shaman.

868
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,153
She shares a bloodline
with Shaman Neop-deok!

869
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,555
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM YOUNG-KWANG

870
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,660
<i>Why did you not tell me</i>

871
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:40,830
that it was the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
who killed my grandma and not you?

872
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,415
<i>I told you to keep your mouth shut.</i>

873
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,709
Why would you tell Yeo-ri that?

874
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,293
It appears you were worried about her.

875
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:47,878
<i>I am certain they like each other.</i>

876
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:51,882
If we can just briefly hold
that Imugi captive,

877
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:54,552
<i>we can easily take care of that Yeo-ri.</i>

878
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:57,388
<i>Every nobleman over 60 had</i>
<i>the same talisman with them.</i>

879
01:06:57,471 --> 01:06:59,807
<i>I cannot summon the wind?</i>

880
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,642
<i>I have your mother.</i>

881
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,561
<i>If you wish to save her,</i>
<i>come to the abandoned house.</i>

882
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:05,021
<i>What is the meaning of this?</i>

883
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,940
<i>Save me, Gangcheori. Please.</i>

884
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:11,986
