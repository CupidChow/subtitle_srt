1
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,650
Eww

2
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,910
That damn ghost, ugh!

3
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,700
Ugh, ugh

4
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Eww!

5
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,000
Eww!

6
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,090
Ugh

7
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,510
evil!

8
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,400
Eww!

9
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,370
eww!

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,460
Eww!

11
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
Ugh!

12
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,220
The water ghost is also to that cute girl

13
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,600
I'm going to kill you

14
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,930
Then that year is over

15
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,060
But

16
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,890
What if that damn bastard runs away?

17
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,480
I must bring back the royal bloodline even if it means killing myself.

18
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,700
I promised that I would avenge that bastard.

19
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,070
Be sure to bring it

20
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,120
Ha, ha, huh

21
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,090
it's okay

22
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,920
Ha, I threw up everything

23
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,420
under…

24
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,890
I'm telling you it's really okay

25
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,550
I said it was nothing

26
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,970
You missed that guy

27
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,600
What should I do now?

28
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,100
If you catch that guy, you'll catch the tail of the eight-foot-long ear.

29
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,770
If we had tried to catch it by force, we would both have been in big trouble.

30
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,610
That water demon

31
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,740
It smelled like rotten water

32
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,530
He gave you that water

33
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,660
Rotten water?

34
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,660
It must have been a water demon living in stagnant, stinking water.

35
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,960
The snake that lived in clean fresh water like me

36
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,000
An opponent I hate so much it makes me shiver

37
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,170
Ah, shoes

38
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,260
I guess I lost it in the water earlier

39
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,350
what are you doing?

40
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,390
It's a long walk to get home.

41
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,890
Are you going to go without a believer?

42
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,940
How can I carry you like that?

43
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,020
it's okay

44
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,780
under!

45
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,950
under…

46
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,530
Don't you know? You just got stabbed.

47
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,240
It's not something to be taken lightly.

48
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
Now put it down

49
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,220
Oh, and Yoon Gap's ankles aren't in good shape to begin with.

50
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,310
What if it gets crowded?

51
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,480
Just stay there

52
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,270
Even if it's the body of that pathetic bastard Yoon Gap

53
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,770
Can't you carry a little kid like me?

54
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,610
Get some sleep until we get there.

55
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,530
It's going to be tough

56
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,630
Ahem

57
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,550
Oh, this is crazy

58
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,420
Are you crazy? What did you say?

59
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,010
Ha, stop, stop

60
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,220
Ah, I'm getting off, I'm getting off!

61
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,260
Fall, fall, child

62
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,850
What are you doing? What if you get hurt?

63
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,350
Ah, because you keep doing this, I…

64
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,310
What am I!

65
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,600
under…

66
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,350
You know?

67
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,810
I've been stuck to you like a leech for 13 years

68
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,150
No one knows you better than you do

69
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,820
How much I love Yoon Gap Na-ri

70
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,400
How much I missed you

71
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,860
Hmm, but?

72
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,370
The person I've been missing for 13 years

73
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,780
It's right in front of you

74
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,500
We keep brushing up against each other and bumping into each other like this

75
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,830
It's natural for your heart to be moved

76
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm human too

77
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,460
I'm a woman too

78
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,420
under…

79
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,800
you

80
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,590
My heart is moved now because of me

81
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,720
Are you saying that so openly?

82
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,970
Without shame?

83
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,680
Oh, what's there to be embarrassed about?

84
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,020
You're not even Yoon Gap Nari

85
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,770
Oh, yeah

86
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,270
I'm not that guy Yoon Gap Nari

87
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,610
Why does my heart keep fluttering for no reason?

88
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,450
Oh, you're right.

89
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,080
All the five desires and seven emotions originate from this human body.

90
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,420
Because it is visible and tangible

91
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,460
Even though I know it’s not Nari, I keep doing this…

92
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,800
What am I talking about now?

93
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,220
therefore

94
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,760
You wanted it before too

95
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,300
We want it just like I want it now

96
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,680
Let's not get too close, within ten steps.

97
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,220
Beautiful street

98
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,390
You understand?

99
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,110
"Hwagi Hong"

100
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,450
So, five days ago

101
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,410
'Change the bedding in the palace'

102
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,870
Are you saying you gave the order?

103
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,580
Yes, that's right.

104
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,000
This is something I've always done once every ten days.

105
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,250
Who gave that order?

106
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,460
under…

107
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,880
Deokchun-ah

108
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,260
Who was on duty that day?

109
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,310
It's me, Yeom and Cherry.

110
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,520
I received that order

111
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,770
All three of you, stand up now.

112
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,110
hurry!

113
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,050
This is unfair, Your Majesty!

114
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,010
It's unfair

115
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,510
I am absolutely not a dwarf

116
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,720
It wasn't us who did it.

117
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,140
I'm not doing this just to take the life of a palace maid!

118
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,440
If you tell the truth about who ordered you to do it

119
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,570
You will spare my life

120
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,570
Honey, tell me, quickly!

121
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,290
This is it

122
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,420
uh!

123
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,670
I can't do it

124
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,920
How can something like this…

125
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,880
Are you telling me to die?

126
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,060
Even if you can't do it, you have to do it

127
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,180
or not

128
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,650
Four years have passed since I brought the affairs of the Central Palace to the Queen Dowager's Office.

129
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,310
I'll twist your balls for four years

130
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Aren't you drawing?

131
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,700
fizzle

132
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,990
I'm not criticizing you

133
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,370
Those who are as lowly as maggots

134
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,330
I have to crawl on the ground and do dirty things.

135
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,290
You little punk who even has a mouth for food, huh?

136
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,050
Is it heavy?

137
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,090
If you do well, I'll give you more.

138
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,220
Don't cry, huh?

139
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,190
No, you shouldn't say it.

140
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,650
The moment I open my mouth, I will die first.

141
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,650
I don't think he'll open his mouth easily

142
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,660
Put all three of them in jail

143
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,910
Don't give me a sip of water until I confess!

144
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,410
I will continue my study tomorrow

145
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Get everyone in jail!

146
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
yes

147
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,920
Take them all away!

148
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
greatness

149
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,760
under…

150
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,980
Gap-ah, are you sleeping?

151
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,610
Oh, you're sleeping, tsk

152
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh my, what a surprise!

153
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,080
I'm going to pretend to sleep again

154
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,420
Oh, how did you know?

155
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,040
How do you know? How do you know?

156
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,420
I wonder if my baby is really sleeping or not

157
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,840
Don't you know that? Get up, get up, tsk

158
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,430
Oh, my gosh

159
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,510
Okay~

160
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,300
Aichi hehehe, what, 'Aichi'?

161
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,010
They pulled out all the snake's tails and built a new one.

162
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,430
That's why I said I wouldn't eat it

163
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,140
Huh, is that what Yeo-ri said?

164
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,400
Oh, so you drink all of this?

165
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,020
Yogurt, yogurt, yogurt

166
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,070
Okay~ I'll give you this

167
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,400
Pumpkin candy, hehehe

168
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,030
Yeo-ri said that if you show her this, she will drink it

169
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,820
let's do it

170
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,500
Why is the hairpin shaped like that?

171
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,250
What about the old brass hairpins?

172
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,630
Oh, that one, sold out

173
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,340
Did you even sell your hairpin for this kind of medicine?

174
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,460
Oh, it's nothing

175
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,920
It's heavy, so I bought it. It's heavy, so I sold it.

176
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,300
You can buy it again next time

177
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,970
Okay, let's eat before it gets cold.

178
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,300
Ah~ oh my

179
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,770
Even after taking such expensive medicine

180
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,520
What if I can't go back to the past?

181
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,980
What should I do? What should I do?

182
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,200
My baby indie

183
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,870
Whether you've lost your mind or gone crazy

184
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,580
It's my baby, Delco has to live

185
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,830
Ah, I don't want to stay. I shouldn't stay.

186
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,500
He's just saying some stupid things about not wanting to take medicine.

187
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,080
Tsk

188
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,920
Oh my, you're eating well

189
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,590
Oh, you're eating well

190
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,970
oh my

191
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,760
What, what?

192
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,180
Oh, my, my

193
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,680
Oh my, come on, have some candy

194
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,770
'ah'

195
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,520
Whew

196
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,190
Is it tasty?

197
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,690
Oh my gosh

198
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,290
okay

199
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,420
If it was really flesh, something would have happened already

200
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,460
It will be okay

201
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,390
Until we arrive

202
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,640
Get some sleep

203
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,810
It's going to be tough

204
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,380
lily

205
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,090
It seems like Nari missed you so much

206
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,840
Please wait a moment

207
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,970
I will definitely save Nari

208
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,230
Ugh, ugh

209
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,680
That maid volunteered?

210
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,890
Yes, it looks like you swallowed poison.

211
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,560
Where did the sinner in Oksa get the poison?

212
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,730
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

213
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,060
This is an oversight on the part of the person in charge of the government.

214
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,360
Dead Queen Nine

215
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,410
Found in Cherry's place

216
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,580
There must have been someone who gave those things to me.

217
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,540
I will investigate further.

218
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,460
Someone I trust with my heart

219
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,800
There is nothing but video in the palace.

220
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,260
Those who were close to that court lady

221
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,090
Please investigate thoroughly.

222
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,680
Yes, Your Majesty

223
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,050
I will follow your orders

224
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,180
hmm

225
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,770
Hmm, good

226
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,860
This sticky, sticky poison

227
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,030
It's just vibrating

228
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,610
Oh, why did I come to the city so early?

229
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,410
No, this, this palace, you didn't think of coming in?

230
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,950
That's because you like the Samnam region better.

231
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,580
Wasn't that what it was?

232
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,790
I just made up my mind

233
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,920
What? Within this month

234
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,170
Fill this palace with a hundred people

235
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,340
That would be great

236
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,920
I will ascend soon

237
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,090
No

238
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,390
Just fill up ninety-nine people

239
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,270
Our poor Kangcheol and his brother are also a bit

240
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,100
I guess I'll have to go play with you

241
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,730
Oh, it's gross, go away

242
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,520
Oh, really, what are you going to do, hyung?

243
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,780
What fun would it be to live alone without my brother?

244
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,690
hmm

245
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,950
What is that woman's heart like?

246
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,870
How do you plan to capture him?

247
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:27,910
What should I do

248
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,660
For the time being, I'll have to pretend to do what that kid wants.

249
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,500
Are you sure it's okay?

250
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,340
I've heard the ghosts gossiping a few times.

251
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,720
I heard that the ghost with eight feet of hair isn't usually a headache.

252
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,220
Have you heard anything?

253
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,180
Could you please look into it for me?

254
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,310
Oh, are you being so serious?

255
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,690
You said it was a lie

256
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,770
greatness

257
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,900
I almost got fooled too, damn

258
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,280
Oh, over there

259
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,830
My banquet table is finally being walked away

260
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,120
If you do that, I'll stop here

261
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,470
An ugly object came out of the palace

262
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,220
Is that what you told me to do?

263
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,010
Contrary Mama

264
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,890
Isn't that what the Great Queen ordered?

265
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,310
Yeah you guy

266
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,690
When did I ever make you do something so dirty?

267
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,860
Prince Yeongin died so miserably.

268
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,280
Your Majesty has a new baby.

269
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,620
Knowing that fact, it is only natural that the new bloodline of the king should be

270
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,370
Didn't you want to kill me?

271
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,790
no

272
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,960
That's what I meant...

273
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,290
Your Majesty the King,

274
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,960
Because of that dirty mind that lurks deep down at the bottom

275
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,920
Didn't you kill Ji-ah so brutally?

276
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,550
Please straighten your mind

277
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,640
Even though it is so unfair and unfair

278
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,600
For the sake of our great prince, who is wandering without being able to cross the Samdo River,

279
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,520
You have to take revenge

280
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,290
majesty

281
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,790
These are items that came out while organizing the library.

282
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,000
What is that?

283
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,140
hmm…

284
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,820
I am not your people

285
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,650
I am

286
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,450
It's steel

287
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,380
Prosecutor Yoon Gap-eun

288
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,670
As a subject, I was loyal

289
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,880
Always keep your determination straight

290
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,510
The fruit is working hard

291
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,720
Even when it is difficult to discern right from wrong

292
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,930
He is a loyal word

293
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,850
made the king wake up

294
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,440
It is proper to hold a ceremony to mourn him.

295
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,610
His soul cannot reside in his body

296
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,610
Because I can't rest

297
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,620
It really hurts my heart

298
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,950
As a poor offering

299
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,910
Comfort his soul

300
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
mama

301
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,010
What that guy said was right.

302
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,770
Didn't you say that the person who entered the palace two weeks ago was a sorcerer?

303
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,320
In the meantime, there were no new court ladies or eunuchs who entered the palace.

304
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,990
There was a new artisan in the upper house.

305
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,240
Aeche craftsman?

306
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,700
She's a young girl

307
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,120
Recently, the palace and royal library

308
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,870
I heard you come and go often

309
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,460
what?

310
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,120
Let me ask you this

311
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,040
Find out about that damn guy

312
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,500
Ugh, I hate it

313
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,960
How do you deal with that guy who spews rotten water?

314
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,380
Do you think all water ghosts are the same?

315
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,390
I am a water demon who lives in a clean well where people drink.

316
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,600
Oh, you said you would grant me any request

317
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,600
You don't need my help

318
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,100
Why are you being so clingy now!

319
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,190
'Slimy'? Is this really...

320
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,690
Hey, why don't you come out here?

321
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:07,940
hey!

322
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,190
under…

323
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,860
under…

324
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,620
It's all back to square one again

325
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,790
Where should I start again?

326
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,910
I wish I could catch the one with the amulet attached

327
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,580
What kind of bitch keeps stealing my shoes?

328
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,750
Come on, confess

329
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,050
Hey, the soles of your shoes are all worn out.

330
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,420
Who takes that?

331
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,380
You lost it again

332
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,010
Are you doing that because you're afraid of getting scolded by your mom?

333
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,430
No!

334
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,350
Oh, it really disappeared overnight!

335
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,680
Oh, who the hell… Ah!

336
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,810
Ah… really

337
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,310
Nothing happens after you lose your shoes

338
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,110
Oh my, tsk tsk tsk

339
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,190
Are you okay?

340
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,270
uh?

341
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,650
Oh, be careful, I, oh my

342
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,990
Write

343
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,030
Come to think of it

344
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,830
Even when I was just you, my comrades' shoes kept disappearing.

345
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,950
My teacher is

346
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,790
You said it was the work of a ghost

347
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,870
her

348
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,000
Is this the work of a ghost?

349
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,010
Ha… okay

350
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,220
If it's that ghost, will he find the person who put the amulet on?

351
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
baboon?

352
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,850
ah…

353
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,520
That baby snake that turned the city upside down

354
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,610
You were here?

355
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,370
Okay, shall we begin?

356
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,080
Who will eat first?

357
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,460
That's the problem

358
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,710
oh!

359
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,920
Hey~

360
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,470
The poison is thick in the stomach

361
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,130
It's just overflowing

362
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,600
Should we start with this today?

363
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,680
Wow, sir

364
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,600
They said he was the king's maternal grandfather.

365
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,810
Your Majesty!

366
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,940
I hope you've been well

367
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,030
oh!

368
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,200
Weren't you the master of His Majesty's body art?

369
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,240
How have you been? What have you been doing?

370
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,990
Why don't you move over there?

371
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,620
Oh, yes, I've been doing well.

372
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,660
Get out of here quickly!

373
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,250
Huh? Yeah, yeah

374
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,420
Your Majesty, I appreciate the lotus flower you made for me.

375
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,170
He seemed very satisfied

376
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,170
Could you please make me some glasses too?

377
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,260
My eyes are really bleary these days.

378
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,010
Yes, I will see you soon.

379
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,010
Okay, see you soon then

380
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,430
Hehehe

381
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,470
hey!

382
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,810
This is real…

383
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,780
Do you think I would do the same just because my brother is looking after you?

384
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,950
How dare you do this in front of my eyes

385
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,910
Flip over my table!

386
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,320
It was spread over there too

387
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:47,950
Four banquet tables

388
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,290
Oh, is this really happening to you too, hyung?

389
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,830
Are you still doing this after seeing what that woman did?

390
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
uh?

391
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
So

392
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,010
Are you trying to touch my disciple right now, right in front of me?

393
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,100
Oh, my, where is my banquet table?

394
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,520
Is it over there?

395
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,060
Seriously, shit…

396
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,690
You are the one I really want to be someday…

397
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,820
Yeah, really…

398
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,870
Oh my god

399
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,580
ah…

400
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,500
In one year of the shaman

401
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,960
Two snakes

402
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,050
ah…

403
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,920
The late Kang Seung-ju, a minister of the Joseon Dynasty

404
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,680
You died last night?

405
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,180
Yes, it happened while you were sleeping.

406
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,270
The gentleman who was so polite when I saw him a few days ago

407
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,350
How come so suddenly?

408
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,650
From what I've heard

409
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:02,400
Similar things often happened in the Samnam region.

410
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,200
They only prey on noblemen over the age of 60

411
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,870
They say there was a snake

412
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,530
'A gentleman over 60'?

413
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,830
Hey, that guy! Ah

414
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,460
Are you over 60 this year?

415
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,010
Who are you?

416
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,060
I came to see Chief Choi Won-woo

417
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,180
Open the door now

418
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,680
The Great Gamma is currently ill

419
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,730
He told me not to let anyone in.

420
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,270
Oh, who are you talking to right now?

421
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,270
I can’t open the door right now…

422
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,870
Open the door later when you have something nice to say instead of the scenery.

423
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,000
Oh, no!

424
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,000
Why can't this guy understand what I'm saying?

425
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,090
What do you want to see?

426
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh, well, I said no

427
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,960
Oh my, this… open it!

428
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,590
I am saying that I will pay my respects to the Great Gamma.

429
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,800
What the heck, you punk!

430
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,220
This guy, this guy, where did he come from that he can’t understand what I’m saying…

431
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,810
What's going on?

432
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,390
Hey, I, these people here

433
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,640
Hey, what are you talking about, coming in all of a sudden?

434
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,070
My father is not meeting anyone right now.

435
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,660
This man is just following his master's orders.

436
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,080
Please go back now

437
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,540
Please tell your Majesty

438
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,500
The great master's long-time disciple

439
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,300
Lee Jeong came to see me

440
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,800
If you do that, your Majesty will meet you too.

441
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,220
Father, how many disciples do you have?

442
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,020
The disciples who came to see me

443
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,100
Since I've bitten them all…

444
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,850
huh?

445
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,100
'Lee Jeong'

446
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,230
Sigh…

447
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,570
Where have I heard that name…

448
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,780
Huh!

449
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,960
under…

450
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,460
cadet

451
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,760
Miss, who are you?

452
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,260
The Great Gamma is asking me to meet with you?

453
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,930
Makgeum-ah

454
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:37,060
I was just like a noblewoman

455
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,390
Be calm and polite

456
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,980
Did you respond?

457
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,560
Ah… yes

458
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,110
Miss, you did what you usually do.

459
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,400
under…

460
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,940
Who the hell are you?

461
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,110
Your Majesty

462
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,280
Oh, Your Majesty!

463
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Okay

464
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,290
What kind of bow would you give to someone who is sick?

465
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
majesty

466
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,090
Please forgive my disloyal beliefs.

467
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,590
I am still the lord

468
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,220
Are you a salaryman?

469
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,850
majesty

470
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,350
When you said you were resigning from office five years ago,

471
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,770
I tried to understand

472
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,690
The land reform caused chaos in the government.

473
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,820
I thought it was worth getting tired of

474
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,280
Haven't you had enough rest now?

475
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,490
majesty

476
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,620
I'm old now

477
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,790
I have no strength

478
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,210
You must have heard the general situation through Inspector Yoon Gap.

479
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,630
I need a lord

480
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,170
Slavery reform is different from land reform.

481
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,840
Biting and tearing

482
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,390
A terrible fight is about to begin.

483
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,640
Unfortunately

484
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,560
It's already started

485
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,730
That terrible fight

486
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,690
I don't plan on hesitating or backing down any longer.

487
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,770
So

488
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,610
I came here today to see you, my lord.

489
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,080
My, my, my, Your Majesty!

490
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,340
Your Majesty, are you okay?

491
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,680
I am fine

492
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,550
Your Majesty, are you okay?

493
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,720
Oh, yes

494
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,310
It's okay

495
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,060
I'm sorry

496
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,680
Oh my, oh my, I almost got in big trouble.

497
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,100
under…

498
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,660
This damn cat deserves to be punished

499
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,790
I'm going to step back now.

500
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,160
Yes, Your Majesty

501
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,460
under…

502
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,840
It's uncomfortable

503
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,550
We really need to save Yoon Gap and Na Ri as soon as possible.

504
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,510
that…

505
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,770
I mean Vivi

506
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,730
Can I just leave it like that? Shouldn't I stop it?

507
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,190
Vivi is a god like me

508
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,270
Are humans trying to interfere with God's work?

509
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,530
Oh, still

510
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,780
It’s a bit… to let them keep eating people like that.

511
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,360
What Vivi eats

512
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,160
Only the nobles who committed evil deeds out of greed

513
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,580
It's like eating a human being like that

514
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,580
It is a way to accumulate good deeds on this earth.

515
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,080
So thanks to that, you can ascend to heaven.

516
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,580
Oh, but

517
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,960
Earlier, they even tried to eat the king's maternal grandfather.

518
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,380
He is a warm and kind person.

519
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,930
How can you know everything about a person's heart?

520
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,510
under…

521
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,470
You go first

522
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,930
Aren't you going home?

523
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,690
I have some more work to do

524
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,830
What are you doing? The cold wind is coming in.

525
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,120
Hey, you should go to sleep. Yes, ma'am.

526
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,670
greatness

527
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,130
Obviously stealing a child's shoes

528
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,180
It must be the work of a ghost called the Night Light Ghost

529
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,800
Hang a fine mesh screen outside the door.

530
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,680
Keep your shoes hidden in the room.

531
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,490
Hey, no

532
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,580
There is no god

533
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,210
Even if you wash your eyes, it's not there

534
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,420
Ugh, this is too big

535
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:27,800
How can I go to my mother without a believer?

536
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,810
Huh? There are a lot of holes.

537
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,270
I'm good at counting

538
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,860
It's true

539
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,320
one

540
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,200
two

541
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,410
three

542
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,120
See, I'm good at it, again

543
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,830
one

544
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,670
two

545
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,210
three

546
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:05,220
Mr. Lee, my mother said I was good at counting.

547
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,340
three

548
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,260
four

549
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,220
Mr. Lee, I know everything, right?

550
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,600
four

551
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,390
Four and…

552
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,100
Five Lees

553
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,770
I didn't say anything either!

554
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,820
Let me go, let me go!

555
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,570
This ugly old hag

556
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,110
Release me now!

557
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,320
Just wait and see

558
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,950
I will be your descendant for generations to come

559
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,660
I'll take all your good luck away

560
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,370
Oh my, I'm scared

561
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,660
I'm afraid that when I get married later, I'll have a son like you.

562
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,120
It's really scary, huh?

563
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,000
Shut up, son

564
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,710
I've lived longer than your grandmother.

565
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,010
Oh, yes, yes, is that so?

566
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,760
it hurts

567
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,970
I'm sick

568
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,060
Seriously, it hurts so much

569
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,100
Does it hurt? Is that all?

570
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,640
Let me hear it

571
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,980
The shoes of the palace ladies you stole are piled up in a pile.

572
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,190
Their year's luck was stolen by you bastard

573
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,980
There have been so many hardships

574
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,650
Are you sick over something like this?

575
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,240
It hurts, so say it hurts

576
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,570
it hurts!

577
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,160
Be quiet! Tsk

578
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,160
hmm

579
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,000
You, have you been wearing the shoes of the palace maids in the civil war?

580
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,420
It seems like he mostly stole things

581
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,840
Did you happen to go to Prince Yeong-in's residence last night?

582
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,590
What are you curious about?

583
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,840
Tell me who put up the talisman at Prince Yeongin's residence at that time.

584
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,430
If you tell me

585
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,600
Let go of this too

586
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,350
I'll buy you new shoes

587
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,440
I don't know the name

588
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,730
He was a eunuch with scary eyes.

589
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,030
My fingertips are black

590
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,530
Your fingertips are black?

591
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,710
It's fun, it's fun

592
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,680
There are two snakes in one year of the shaman.

593
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,350
Did they make General Cheonji look like a tattered man?

594
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,640
But you also got hit by the flesh of the water snake

595
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,730
I'm going to leave soon

596
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,910
If you touch the ashes of the furnace, your fingertips will turn black.

597
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,030
I guess so

598
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,000
huh

599
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,710
Where are you going? Oh, look.

600
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,100
Ah, this, this edge, this is a bit stiff

601
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,600
His Majesty asked me to take a look at his hands.

602
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,690
Oh, yes, I understand.

603
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,350
Well, that, that, and that

604
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,610
I, I, I mean the author

605
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,570
In that body

606
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,530
A snake that can't be a dragon

607
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:19,080
Is it true that there is a person named Kangcheol in there?

608
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,160
Is it really true that he is a god and not a human?

609
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,420
Yes, among shamans

610
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,790
They call him a spiteful evil spirit,

611
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,050
Well, first of all, God is right

612
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,380
He is a god who mainly governs the weather.

613
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,840
greatness

614
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,050
Hey, Yeori

615
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,430
Is the author perhaps a bit long-winded?

616
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:43,430
What the hell is that, to a person who treats you rudely

617
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,600
Or give a punishment

618
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,810
Yes? What do you mean…

619
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,360
Oh, that's it

620
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
I…

621
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,530
Yeah, no

622
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,490
No, I didn't say anything, uh, uh

623
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, please, uh

624
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,620
no

625
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:05,000
Hey, what brings a court lady from the Daebijeon here?

626
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,500
Your Majesty

627
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,500
He asked me to bring the head of the upper house, Yeo-ri.

628
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,170
This child?

629
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,800
Write

630
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,680
Are you trying to get a craftsman for Aeche in Daebijeon?

631
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,190
Bring in His Majesty!

632
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,580
What is going on?

633
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,660
Yes, Your Majesty

634
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,250
High fever and persistent chills

635
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,790
I suspect it's a school problem

636
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,460
There are even blisters extending all the way to the lower abdomen.

637
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,670
I can't guarantee it because of the academic nature, Your Majesty.

638
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,760
underneath

639
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,880
What the heck is this disease?

640
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,100
majesty!

641
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,140
This is the first time I have seen such a disease.

642
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:07,060
I am just sorry, Your Majesty.

643
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,190
Uh, uh…

644
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,570
The royal physician should go out now.

645
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,610
yes

646
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,700
Oh, the court lady, tell me.

647
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,370
Do you know why the queen is like this?

648
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,290
I don't know if this is related

649
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,170
After falling down

650
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,050
You said you saw the ghost you saw in your dream again

651
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,380
under…

652
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,390
Call Yeori right now

653
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,350
hurry!

654
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,940
under…

655
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,740
Can you see this letter too?

656
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,620
Wasn't it 'bright Ryo'?

657
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,660
I am sorry to inform you, Your Majesty.

658
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:13,040
Mom, you can read letters from far away

659
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:16,210
You can see all the letters that are close by clearly.

660
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,170
You don't need any love

661
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,380
But

662
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,470
How can I

663
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,010
Is it impossible to complete this embroidery?

664
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,600
that…

665
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,310
Ah… that’s weird

666
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,110
My body feels heavy.

667
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,030
Is that a horn?

668
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,530
For what reason

669
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,780
Have you become His Majesty's beloved master?

670
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,160
ah…

671
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,540
I am originally

672
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,960
He was a craftsman of Aeche who lived in Yongdamgol, Ducheonghyeon.

673
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,920
I came to the palace at the recommendation of the inspector, Yun Gap.

674
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,340
It’s Yongdamgol…

675
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,670
That's funny

676
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,800
Create a font that will allow me to complete this embroidery.

677
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:10,060
She's just an ordinary girl

678
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,390
This woman made Yeong-in like that?

679
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,690
Pungsan

680
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,020
Can we really believe what he says?

681
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,990
This person doesn't want glasses

682
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,160
What on earth do you want?

683
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,680
Hey, why isn't he coming?

684
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,800
Ugh

685
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,050
Oh, come on, come on, come on!

686
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,600
Ugh!

687
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:54,350
Ugh

688
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,280
How come Yeo-ri hasn't come yet!

689
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,070
I feel like my feet are tied in the battle

690
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,740
His Majesty said he was looking for you urgently.

691
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,330
Coming soon

692
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:13,540
Hasn't it already been an hour since you heard me say that!

693
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,000
Oh my, oh my, oh my

694
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,000
It won't work

695
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,880
I will go to my own countermeasures

696
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,760
majesty

697
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,880
Me, Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

698
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,510
ah…

699
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,980
he

700
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,400
Oh, really

701
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,440
Oh, Mama Daebi

702
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,200
My talents are lacking.

703
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,530
Please call a more skilled artisan

704
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,620
There is no better artisan of love than you.

705
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,000
I know the king well

706
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,250
With a fussy temperament

707
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,250
A total perfectionist

708
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,340
That lord favors you so much

709
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,380
You call me to the library every now and then?

710
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,010
under…

711
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,890
Do you know my true identity?

712
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:14,470
Bring in His Majesty!

713
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:16,480
her

714
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,640
What are you guys doing?

715
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,730
Take away His Majesty! Oh my!

716
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,740
Welcome, Your Majesty

717
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,080
I don't think you came to say hello during a time when you're busy with government affairs.

718
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:35,830
What's going on?

719
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,550
I am borrowing the master's body artisan for a while.

720
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,380
The Great Queen uses my beloved craftsman to good use.

721
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,390
I am also very happy

722
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:53,470
one

723
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,890
I don't think now is the time for that.

724
00:44:58,930 --> 00:44:59,940
yes

725
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,440
Come on, this

726
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,440
hmm

727
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:17,790
What is this?

728
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:21,670
This is an item from the residence of a court lady who committed a terrible act in the palace.

729
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:26,040
How can you show me this unclean thing?

730
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,800
I'm saying this because the only thing that came out as a gift was this norigae.

731
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,220
If you are the Queen Mother who knows everything about the palace,

732
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,550
I think you know something

733
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,470
Your Majesty, what kind of rudeness is this?

734
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:41,390
Are you doubting me now?

735
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,650
How could that be possible?

736
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,770
Even though the Queen did not give birth to me

737
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,860
You are my mother

738
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,490
In the king's seat where all the people are watching

739
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,910
How could I be so unfilial to my mother?

740
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,950
Cancer, Your Majesty

741
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,160
That's the kind of person you are, my lord

742
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,000
You have never done anything wrong

743
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,960
So

744
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,340
By committing adultery that is prohibited by national law

745
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:15,050
I would never have killed my brother.

746
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,260
Contrary Mama

747
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,690
under…

748
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,190
I was too joking

749
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:30,400
In my heart

750
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,570
He must have been my half-brother whom I wanted to kill over and over again.

751
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:37,820
How could our great lord do such a thing?

752
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,540
The reason I came to Daebijeon now is

753
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:45,210
Because the queen's illness is very serious

754
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:47,670
Are you saying that the queen is sick right now?

755
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,290
According to the doctor

756
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,800
They say the possibility of infection cannot be ruled out.

757
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,920
Because this child was in the palace yesterday

758
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,180
I was worried that I might pass on a terrible disease to my mother-in-law.

759
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,140
I came running here

760
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,720
Please forgive me for taking you in a hurry.

761
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:09,520
As expected, our king's filial piety is worthy of being an example to all people.

762
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:12,900
Do that

763
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,610
under…

764
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,000
under…

765
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,970
Keep a close eye on the battlefield.

766
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:38,140
There will be some more movement

767
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,800
Yes, Your Majesty

768
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:41,760
under…

769
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,810
Oh my! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

770
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:47,890
What is this on your neck? What is this?

771
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,810
My title? Oh, here, here, what, hey

772
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,030
Hey, hey, hey

773
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,620
under…

774
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,720
Hey, Yeri!

775
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,760
Yeri! Oh!

776
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:25,520
Yeori, Yeori…

777
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,850
Why is this kid like this?

778
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:29,810
Why is this kid doing this?

779
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,520
Calm down, Chief Inspector Yoon.

780
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:35,190
Hey, it looks like he has a fever because his temperature is so high

781
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,320
There are even blisters that I've never seen before

782
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,450
They still haven't figured out what the disease is.

783
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:41,820
Blisters?

784
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,830
Those blisters

785
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:50,370
It goes down thinly along the neck line

786
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,880
It was connected to the lower abdomen below the navel.

787
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,750
fat…

788
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,340
To live

789
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,590
I ended up getting stabbed in the end

790
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,800
Fucking scorpion

791
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:06,100
I should have just thrown it away back then

792
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,230
Doctors and nurses, please leave now.

793
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:13,060
Okay, okay, uh, hurry, hurry, yes

794
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,030
yes

795
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,570
It was the same symptom as the heavy rain

796
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,450
What does it look like to you?

797
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,540
Is there any way?

798
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,370
under…

799
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:33,500
Yeriyah

800
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,130
under…

801
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,420
The arrow shot by the water spirit

802
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:40,840
I feel like I've been hit

803
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:43,220
And that flesh

804
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,350
Queen Mother

805
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:49,850
That evil spirit is targeting the unborn baby…

806
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,060
Stop, stop talking.

807
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,980
You look like this now

808
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,270
Who are you worried about now!

809
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,610
I have to catch that bastard

810
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,650
You can loosen up your body

811
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,110
Otherwise

812
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,490
The Queen Mother is in danger…

813
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,830
Yeori, Yeori, Yeori!

814
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,620
under…

815
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,840
What, what is that…

816
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:23,590
Your Majesty! No, that won't work.

817
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,340
This is absolutely impossible.

818
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:29,260
Yes, Your Majesty, this is an unjust and unjust thing.

819
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:30,520
Didn't you hear that just now?

820
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,770
There is only one way to loosen that flesh

821
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,980
Catching a ghost that shot flesh

822
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,110
But

823
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:40,570
Would someone who ran away come back so easily?

824
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,400
How can you do that?

825
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,320
You're saying you're going to use me as bait!

826
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,700
underneath!

827
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,870
Will you give me your son instead?

828
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,750
The scorpion is viciously targeting the unborn baby.

829
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,670
That means there's a devil behind it who's after the royal blood.

830
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:03,920
If you go with me

831
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:07,720
The smell of blood will surely bring that bastard closer again.

832
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:09,760
Just one more word

833
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:12,140
I won't let your tongue stay still!

834
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:17,480
Do you think I'll just be taking it in the meantime?

835
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,270
I'm in a dilemma too

836
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,650
If we delay like this, Yeo-ri will die.

837
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,400
If you don't cooperate

838
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:26,320
I'm saying that I'll even take your son by force.

839
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:28,110
Do you think I can't do it?

840
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,670
Put away your sword

841
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,840
Your Majesty! Quickly!

842
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:52,510
hmm

843
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,140
hmm

844
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,570
The queen is in critical condition

845
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,450
What would you need?

846
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,540
Ohora

847
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:20,540
Are you saying that the artisan of love was that sorcerer?

848
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,170
her!

849
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:25,380
But where the hell did that girl come from?

850
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,720
I heard you entered the palace upon the recommendation of the chief prosecutor, Yoon Gap.

851
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:31,930
They say he came from a place called Yongdamgol in Ducheonghyeon.

852
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:33,010
now

853
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,640
You said Yongdamgol?

854
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,230
Yeah, that's right

855
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:41,350
Why is that? Is there anything you can point out?

856
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:47,860
older brother

857
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:50,240
Oh, brother

858
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:51,990
Ah, Steel Brother!

859
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:53,870
Don't talk to me unless you want to help me.

860
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:55,330
ah…

861
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:58,790
Oh, you're saying that's a lie?

862
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:01,250
He said he would just match the rhythm appropriately

863
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:03,040
How can this be just a show now?

864
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,090
after

865
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:06,130
under…

866
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,590
You know I can't use my strength properly right now, right?

867
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:10,430
It's not like it used to be

868
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:13,800
That's because I've been trapped in a human body for a long time.

869
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:18,520
Ah, what will I do if I really can't ascend like this?

870
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,680
uh?

871
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:21,020
ah…

872
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,770
Let's save a dying woman

873
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,820
What are you doing for nothing? Tsk

874
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:31,490
kid

875
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:32,700
Shut your mouth

876
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:50,840
cadet

877
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,050
I almost peed myself when I didn't even have a pee

878
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,100
Oh, shit

879
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,060
That girl, Yeori

880
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:59,270
I'm starting to hate you more, really

881
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,170
You have the precious stone

882
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:33,680
That's not right

883
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,760
No, Your Majesty

884
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:38,100
Yeori, that child, that body is in the body of the king

885
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,560
He said that you should not let it go even for a moment.

886
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,930
Gyeonggwiseok is a stone that drives away ghosts.

887
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,650
To the bait to catch the ghost

888
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:47,150
Is this something you can afford?

889
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:48,230
No, it won't work

890
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,190
Knowing the power of that crystal ball, the gods also brought it here.

891
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,030
If your safety is not guaranteed

892
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:56,320
I can't follow the author's words any longer.

893
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,080
hmm

894
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,160
her

895
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:02,750
He followed me curiously

896
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:05,960
In the end, you end up being so cruel and selfish

897
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,210
Do you know why I am tolerating you right now?

898
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,960
If you're bait, act like bait.

899
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,550
Yeo-ri is now on the brink of death trying to save your wife.

900
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,590
If you do it carelessly and Yeo-ri dies

901
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,600
Become a demon worse than my eight-foot demon

902
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,850
I'll tear you to pieces

903
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:24,680
I will make you die in extreme pain

904
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,480
You have it

905
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:33,690
majesty

906
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:38,870
Me too

907
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,330
I really hate the sight of you.

908
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:51,170
Inspector Yoon Gap was my most beloved official.

909
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,550
But you took over that Yun Gap's body

910
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:54,840
With his face

911
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,720
How dare he treat me so rudely with his voice!

912
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:02,390
My feelings when I see that sight

913
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:05,180
How could you really know?

914
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,480
Me too

915
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:12,440
Just know that I am tolerating you with extreme patience.

916
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,900
I miss Nari so much

917
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:19,110
Nari's face and body are right here

918
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,660
It's not Nari

919
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,830
It's the most precious face to me

920
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,540
Inside it is you, the one I hate the most

921
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,420
This is

922
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,880
It's such a horrible nightmare

923
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:37,220
Because of you

924
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,260
I remembered it again!

925
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,560
majesty!

926
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:46,350
Are you okay?

927
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:48,270
Please give me your order, Your Majesty.

928
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:50,270
I will cut this guy down with one stroke of my sword.

929
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:00,740
I too would like to cut off this guy's head right now

930
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,620
If this guy dies, I won't be able to save the queen.

931
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:06,080
one!

932
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,710
Even when dealing with enemies like a pack of lynxes in the palace

933
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:10,790
I was the one who never changed my expression

934
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:12,330
Press and press

935
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,920
I was the one who held on strong

936
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:18,720
My you…

937
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,840
I can't stand you

938
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,720
I can't stand it!

939
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,220
under

940
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:31,390
her

941
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:36,150
I, I, Your Majesty

942
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:38,110
How dare you!

943
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,410
You are a hateful bastard

944
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,830
I want to kill you right now, but…

945
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,590
I'm holding back because it's bait

946
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:59,090
hmm

947
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,410
omg!

948
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,750
Master, sir!

949
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,880
Master, sir!

950
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,800
Merchant Adult

951
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:43,510
Merchant Adult

952
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:46,180
Merchant Adult

953
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,190
hmm…

954
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,900
Are you awake?

955
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,650
I woke up

956
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:02,360
Oh, okay, let's go, let's go

957
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,900
Oh, my, my

958
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,660
Ah… I told you not to move

959
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:07,240
Where do you wake up?

960
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,410
No, why are you trying to get up? Lie down again, lie down again.

961
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:10,830
Lie back down, huh?

962
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:13,290
Oh, how, is it okay?

963
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:14,790
Ha… Kangcheol

964
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,750
Where is Kangcheol?

965
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,590
Steel…

966
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,500
greatness

967
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:23,300
Oh, big, okay

968
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,380
yes

969
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,220
If it's... Imoogi

970
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,850
I went to catch that ghost

971
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:37,520
This is really driving me crazy

972
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,360
His Majesty also went along

973
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,730
under…

974
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,780
Hey, what are you doing?

975
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:45,740
Even though my body is not in good condition

976
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,910
If you do something wrong, I won't leave you alone.

977
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:51,330
That snake was so noisy

978
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:52,410
I have to go

979
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,120
We have to go and stop it

980
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:57,460
Everyone will be in danger

981
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:59,290
huh?

982
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,590
under…

983
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:24,570
hmm

984
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,720
Even though I myself became the bait

985
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,140
That ghost doesn't appear

986
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:54,010
Isn't your plan wrong?

987
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,060
under!

988
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:58,060
As soon as you came, I spread my arms wide.

989
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,480
Did you think I would welcome you?

990
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:02,860
Maybe I'm watching from somewhere

991
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:05,270
I will be waiting for the right time

992
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,990
hmm…

993
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:10,660
But it's strange

994
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,830
Ghosts usually appear at midnight.

995
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,580
How come you don't show up until daybreak?

996
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,080
That damn bait

997
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,380
Is it because it's sloppy?

998
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:28,510
But

999
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:31,340
I'm surprised you came all this way.

1000
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:34,390
Many men in the world do not value my wife.

1001
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:36,720
The queen

1002
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:40,180
She's not just an ordinary girl to me

1003
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:44,980
He entered the difficult royal family at a young age.

1004
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:49,190
He is the one who has endured many hardships with me.

1005
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,820
I must protect it

1006
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,790
Is that Jangmyeongru Yun Gap's?

1007
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:06,210
It's mine!

1008
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:09,550
This was made as a token that Yeo-ri had become my disciple.

1009
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,760
Yeori, that kid is not Yoon Gap

1010
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,720
Steel made it for you?

1011
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,970
okay

1012
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:18,260
It was made with sincere prayers, one by one, thread by thread.

1013
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,810
What's that? That creepy snort?

1014
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:25,310
It's nothing

1015
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,520
under…

1016
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,530
I am

1017
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:33,360
It's very unpleasant for you to even put that little girl in your mouth.

1018
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:34,910
Yeori and you

1019
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:38,330
Because it's a bad relationship that's been passed down through generations

1020
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,040
you

1021
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:48,130
Do you know everything?

1022
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:52,010
If you do that, the shaman’s work will be like that…

1023
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:54,010
Don't even open your mouth to Yeri.

1024
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,180
He's already a kid who doesn't care about water or fire.

1025
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:57,350
Once you know that

1026
01:02:58,550 --> 01:02:59,560
I don't know what to do

1027
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:07,940
under…

1028
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,110
The day is dawning

1029
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:27,670
I can't delay any longer.

1030
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:30,000
If you want my blood

1031
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:33,300
I will do it for you

1032
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:44,980
majesty

1033
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,580
Go quickly, go quickly!

1034
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:09,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1035
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,420
Go! Don't look back and go, go, go!

1036
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,670
go!

1037
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:19,430
Steel, no

1038
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:21,600
It's a trap, please

1039
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,520
Hang in there!

1040
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,440
Ugh!

1041
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:18,950
Eww!

1042
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,390
Come with me

1043
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,060
If I don't go, Kangcheol will be in danger.

1044
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,480
The whole place vibrates with rottenness

1045
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:58,150
I can't breathe…

1046
01:05:58,230 --> 01:05:59,280
Steel-ah

1047
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,570
Steel!

1048
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:04,200
Who did this to you?

1049
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,740
Arrest all the blind judges of Maengcheong.

1050
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:10,790
Even Your Majesty will not be able to avoid great trouble.

1051
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:13,170
That horrible demon

1052
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,290
You must find the evidence

1053
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:18,340
When did the eight-foot-long ghost begin?

1054
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:20,300
Please answer, Your Majesty.
