1
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,917
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,421
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,466
I am not your foe.

4
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,343
The King's royal bloodline is.

5
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,305
Then, why?

6
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,224
Why do you attack me?

7
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,318
That is a mighty crock of nonsense…

8
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,040
<i>He's fleeing?</i>

9
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,792
Stop right there!

10
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,765
The Ghostbane Stone.

11
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,145
We do not know when he will be back.
We must get out of here.

12
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,775
Gangcheori.

13
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,611
Never let go of that Ghostbane Stone.

14
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,246
These were discovered with Yeo-ri.

15
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,042
BONFIRE

16
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,422
It is the same one, Your Majesty.

17
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,844
<i>It is the same talisman</i>
<i>used to summon the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.</i>

18
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,512
Noble Elder Pung-san.

19
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,931
He is clearly the Yapper.

20
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,269
The evidence is undeniable.
Do not just stand there.

21
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,436
We must catch him now!

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,646
Because of him, Yeo-ri--

23
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,692
His Majesty already gave the command
to the Capital Garrison troops.

24
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,403
That cave and shrine area
are being searched as we speak.

25
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,406
Unfortunately, the cave is
much too vast and intricate,

26
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,533
so the search will take some time.

27
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,496
And the Association?

28
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,957
Yes, it has already been shut down.

29
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,128
All the fortune tellers and servants close
to Noble Elder Pung-san have been detained

30
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,548
and Chief State Councillor
is overseeing their interrogation.

31
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,138
Thank goodness you are safe.

32
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,849
Are you all right?

33
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,726
Yes, Your Majesty.

34
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,687
<i>Right. Thank goodness I am safe.</i>

35
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,814
<i>But it is odd.</i>

36
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,858
<i>Why did he not kill me?</i>

37
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,151
What are you doing?

38
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,158
Then, should I just let her go free?
She knows everything.

39
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,368
We cannot kill the bait.

40
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,914
Quietly take her out
through the drainage gate.

41
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,625
<i>He called me bait.</i>

42
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,044
<i>I am the bait.</i>

43
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,504
<i>What was he trying to catch</i>
<i>with me as bait?</i>

44
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,930
This place is crawling with soldiers.

45
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,348
What do I do now?

46
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,612
Noble Elder?

47
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,074
Warrior Deity?

48
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,413
Your Majesty.

49
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,708
Where is Pung-san's shrine?

50
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,377
It is this way.

51
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,252
This is it, Your Majesty.

52
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,797
This was the hidden passageway
to Pung-san's shrine.

53
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,191
Noble Elder.

54
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,568
Noble Elder!

55
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,403
Oh gosh.

56
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,324
What in the world is going on now?
I cannot believe this.

57
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,201
Noble Elder. Please wake up.

58
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,231
What is that?

59
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,316
Forgive me.

60
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,902
We tried sand and water to put it out,
but it was momentary.

61
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,029
The embers keep coming back to life.

62
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,739
All of you

63
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,241
may leave.

64
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,744
Your Majesty.

65
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,454
We cannot, Your Majesty.

66
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,331
We cannot leave you alone.

67
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,665
Leave me!

68
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

69
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,129
We will remain in the vicinity.

70
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,157
I will kill you all!

71
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,743
This bloodline will be

72
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,704
uprooted by my hand!

73
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,393
You scoundrel…

74
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,857
kept me in a choke hold for many years.

75
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,361
Where are you hiding?

76
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,155
Wicked spirit!

77
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,991
Reveal yourself at once!

78
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,494
I have come in person
because I have something to say to you!

79
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,293
I have denied your existence
time and time again.

80
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,044
I did not want to believe it.

81
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:46,466
I just thought it was all bad luck
and grievous tragedies!

82
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,510
I tried to believe it all happened
because my virtue fell short

83
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,013
as the King.

84
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,766
However, I now know without a doubt.

85
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,354
<i>You </i>are trying to massacre me
and my whole family!

86
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,400
These emotions that I have felt,

87
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,029
unyielding rage and unrelenting fear,

88
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,408
I now know that you have relished in them.

89
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,913
Reveal yourself this instant!

90
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,827
Step forth and face me if you will.

91
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,164
I will never back down.

92
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,085
I will never kneel before you.

93
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,005
I will look directly into your eyes

94
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,384
to face you and fight.

95
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,262
I refuse…

96
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,641
to bow down to you!

97
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,304
<i>I am not your foe.</i>

98
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,599
The King's royal bloodline is.

99
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,898
Then, why?

100
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,276
Why do you attack me?

101
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,708
You do not need to be concerned.

102
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,836
It is unnecessary.

103
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,839
What do you mean?

104
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,341
What am I not to be concerned about?

105
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,428
Ghosts are known for their cunning remarks

106
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,013
and their lies.

107
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,724
They use them to leave people distressed.

108
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,853
When would you have ever nurtured
ill will against the throne?

109
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,855
I know.

110
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,399
Then, why are you
so lost in your thoughts?

111
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,068
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost knew everything.

112
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,528
He knew I fell to the ground

113
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,782
while trying to ascend
during that war, a century ago.

114
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,534
As if…

115
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,538
he witnessed it himself.

116
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,831
Then,

117
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,210
he was really born the day
you fell to the ground?

118
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,387
The air is chilly.
You should go back inside.

119
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,739
That is the rascal.
The feast I had my heart set on.

120
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,658
The spite in his belly is just…

121
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,494
full to the brim.

122
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,330
Yes.

123
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,707
I can even smell

124
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,627
its potent stench from here.

125
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,644
What is the matter?

126
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,147
It is nothing, my lord.

127
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,024
Look here.

128
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,193
This is the procession
of Lord Hong Gwon-u.

129
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,903
Swiftly step aside.

130
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,032
What is wrong with him?

131
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,159
Move it!

132
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,577
Just look at you go.

133
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,538
You do not own this street,

134
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,292
yet you insist on telling me to move
when you can simply go around.

135
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,880
Just snipping away
at your own life thread…

136
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,800
Do not dawdle.

137
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,594
- Get rid of him this instant!
- Yes, my lord.

138
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,053
Move it!

139
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,655
What is he doing?

140
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,333
No!

141
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,338
Yeo-ri.

142
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,301
Forgive us for the inconvenience, my lord.

143
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,682
Yeo-ri!

144
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,357
Why that little…

145
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,946
Yeo-ri.

146
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,657
What was that just now?

147
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,286
Why do you ask when you saw everything?

148
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,372
He was setting the table for my feast

149
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,249
and you just barbarically flipped it over!

150
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,586
They say the recently deceased
Kwak Sang-chung

151
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,505
was also discovered with a torn talisman.

152
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,424
Was that… also your doing?

153
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,009
Was it?

154
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,679
That was…

155
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,269
Yes. I was behind that.

156
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,189
However, he even kidnapped
Yoon Gap's mother and tried to kill her.

157
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:21,110
What was so terrible about throwing Bibi
that heinous scoundrel as a snack?

158
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,445
That scoundrel was no different.

159
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,030
If it was not for that damn talisman,

160
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,491
Bibi would have devoured him ages ago.

161
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,535
I already told you.

162
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,746
Bibi devouring men
who habitually commit evil deeds

163
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,290
builds good karma for the land.

164
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,085
Why rage over a deity's affairs?

165
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,921
A deity's affairs…

166
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,632
Sure.

167
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,428
Ending a person's life must seem trivial
for deities like you.

168
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,846
But you see,

169
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,765
when a deity kills a mortal,
it is divine retribution,

170
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,934
but when one mortal kills another…

171
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,270
it is nothing more than murder.

172
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,400
- Murder?
- Yes, murder.

173
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,194
The one who stole my <i>myeongdu</i>
to destroy that talisman

174
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,572
is not Gangcheori

175
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,742
but Lord Yoon Gap, the mortal.

176
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,725
<i>I already told you.</i>

177
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,519
<i>Bibi devouring men</i>
<i>who habitually commit evil deeds</i>

178
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,396
builds good karma for the land.

179
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,484
Why rage over a deity's affairs?

180
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,235
A deity's affairs…

181
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,468
Thinking about it only fuels my anger.

182
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,221
Are you honestly angry
because I dared to end a mortal's life

183
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,223
with the sacred body of Lord Yoon Gap?

184
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,851
What happened to liking me?

185
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,687
You are so desperately worried
about that rascal?

186
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,565
Can you not sleep, either?

187
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,859
You startled me.

188
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,986
That is unlike you.

189
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,781
You used to blow the roof off
with your instant thunderous snoring.

190
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,536
I remain disturbed about what happened
to Yeo-ri earlier today.

191
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:22,833
It is odd that the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
just disappeared like that.

192
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,258
Listen.

193
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,552
Is that…

194
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,388
truly the only way?

195
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,852
You know…

196
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,481
The luminous pearl.

197
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,650
Is draining an Imugi's luminous pearl

198
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,071
the only way to guide
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost to cross over?

199
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,324
Is there no other way?

200
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,077
I am sorry.

201
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,789
I am just a mere quack monk
and I know of no other way.

202
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,583
Useless rascal.

203
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,359
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

204
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,569
They discovered letters and other objects

205
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,990
from the Queen Dowager
in the noble elder's underground shrine.

206
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:41,537
Then, do you mean that the Queen Dowager
is Noble Elder Pung-san's benefactor?

207
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,334
How amusing.

208
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,294
Not too long ago,

209
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:53,423
you argued that if anyone conjured
a nasty hex against the royal family,

210
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,426
its chief victim who would suffer the most

211
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,012
would be the Queen Dowager, did you not?

212
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,934
I do hope Your Majesty is not suggesting

213
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:07,688
that people can actually be killed through
hexes and heretical ceremonies.

214
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,483
Prince Yeongin met his unfortunate demise

215
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,528
due to excessive alcohol consumption.

216
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,946
After his death,

217
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:19,658
the Queen Dowager,
distraught with sorrow and grief,

218
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:23,537
must have been tricked
by that wicked blind fortune teller.

219
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,708
That is blasphemy.

220
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,586
Pung-san is a fortune teller
I have long kept by my side.

221
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,462
I am confident about his character.

222
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,175
Someone has framed him for all of it.

223
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,801
And who might that be?

224
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,722
Surely…

225
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,142
Your Majesty must know better than anyone.

226
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,768
Your Grace.

227
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,647
Who was the first
to recommend Pung-san to you?

228
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,692
Who is his benefactor?

229
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,776
Your Majesty!

230
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,987
It is time for you to open your eyes!

231
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,616
You were never an affectionate mother,

232
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,660
but you certainly were not a foolish one.

233
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,331
Yet you still have not realized it?

234
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,668
You led your own son to his death
by offering him up as a sacrifice.

235
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,257
How absurd…

236
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,969
What sort of nonsense--

237
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,847
Pung-san is a sorcerer
who serves an evil spirit.

238
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,270
That is right.

239
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,899
The very evil spirit who led
the late king to his demise.

240
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,747
That is Yeongin's undershirt.

241
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,338
No…

242
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,217
That cannot be true.

243
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,680
I do not consider you blameless,

244
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,184
but I will not make you pay
for your crimes.

245
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,271
You are already…

246
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,109
suffering the cruelest punishment.

247
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,950
No… That cannot be…

248
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,621
That cannot be true… No…

249
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,041
Perform a recitation ceremony
to ward off ghosts.

250
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,045
Make sure that ghost
cannot lay a finger on my Yeongin.

251
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,426
Get rid of this!

252
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,719
No…

253
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,306
No.

254
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,727
That cannot be.

255
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,355
No…

256
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,650
That cannot be…

257
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,951
Where did you ever find the audacity
to seek me out once more?

258
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:17,627
Do you know of the misery
I am going through to clean up that mess?

259
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,920
Please…

260
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,424
Please, just give me
one more chance, my lordship.

261
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,217
Your very existence

262
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,262
has become a great burden in my life.

263
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:28,972
My lordship…

264
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,807
Damn it.

265
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,350
My lordship.

266
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:56,124
Do you truly believe you can
seat a new king without my help?

267
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,626
What did you just say?

268
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,670
Secure a hideout
for this blind creature's body.

269
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:04,257
The world you seek is not far off.

270
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,682
Noble Elder!

271
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,060
My goodness. Noble Elder.

272
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,145
Are you all right?

273
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,481
Noble Elder!

274
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,238
This used to be the ancestral shrine
of His Lordship's family.

275
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,908
It remains out of sight for most.
Do not do anything foolish.

276
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,954
Yes. Sure. I understand.

277
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,469
Noble Elder.

278
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,181
Please, Noble Elder.

279
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,976
Please wake up now.

280
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,647
What is going on?

281
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,482
Se-won.

282
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,360
My goodness. You are awake.

283
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,411
You saw it for yourself just now,
did you not?

284
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:18,373
Did you see how the Warrior Deity
took hold of my body?

285
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,084
His Lordship did not dare put up a fight.

286
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,213
Yes. I saw it clearly with my two eyes.

287
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,299
Do you get it now?

288
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,885
If you have the Warrior Deity
standing behind you,

289
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,138
there is nothing to fear in this world.

290
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,932
Yes, you're right.

291
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:39,352
Is there a brazier nearby?

292
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:53,200
It is now time to pick
that fully ripe persimmon.

293
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:57,412
That is what the Warrior Deity proclaims.

294
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,727
Were the marked ones
killed by the Eight-foot-tall Ghost?

295
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,229
Yes, you are correct.

296
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,147
Yeo-ri once mentioned

297
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,317
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost must hold
a deep grudge against the royal bloodline.

298
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,988
These are the royal relatives
who met their sudden and strange deaths

299
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:35,450
for the past 13 years,
after the late king passed.

300
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,910
As expected,

301
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,746
not all members of the royal bloodline
were killed.

302
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,087
These must be the members
who avoided the ghost's attacks.

303
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,380
Yes.

304
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,132
Then, the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
must hold a grudge

305
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,718
against the one who lost
all his offspring to it.

306
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,721
It must be against him.

307
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,100
It appears the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
holds a grudge

308
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,477
against King Yeonjong,
my great-great-grandfather,

309
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,563
who was the sovereign
of this nation 100 years ago.

310
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,316
One hundred years ago…

311
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,195
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost mentioned
it was born 100 years ago as well.

312
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,281
This cannot all be a coincidence.

313
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,783
It knew Gangcheori failed to ascend
on the day of its birth.

314
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,743
I am certain he was
also in Yongdam Village

315
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,745
when he met his demise.

316
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,414
Yongdam Village?

317
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,332
It is a village in Ducheong-hyeon.

318
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,962
That place was experiencing
tumultuous warfare at the time.

319
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,047
No death that day
would have surprised anyone.

320
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,551
It means all of
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost's secrets

321
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,887
were buried in Yongdam Village,
100 years ago.

322
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,934
During the war
when the northern barbarians invaded,

323
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,770
there was a safeguard for King Yeonjong
in the royal procession.

324
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,231
Afterward, he was honored
as a meritorious subject

325
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,275
and his family settled in Ducheong-hyeon

326
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,111
to become a prestigious family
for generations to come.

327
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,612
His descendant…

328
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,157
might know something.

329
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,200
And who is that?

330
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,873
Lord Choi Won-u.

331
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,666
- Pardon?
- What?

332
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,960
I shall go to Yongdam Village in ten days.

333
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,339
There, I will expose the true identity

334
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,424
of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

335
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,475
Come on now.

336
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,648
I am on my way to a royal court assembly.

337
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,400
Stop following me and be on your way.

338
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,070
I need to go this way, too.

339
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,616
What is it this time?

340
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,242
What is the issue?

341
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,330
Well… Tell me…

342
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,208
What sort of character

343
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,543
was that Yoon Gap fellow?

344
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,128
Yoon Gap?

345
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,299
Yoon Gap was an unmatched loyal subject.

346
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,177
A true scholarly gentleman.

347
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,429
Scholarly gentleman? As if.

348
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,682
From what I saw,
he was cowardly and contemptible.

349
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,226
He tricked Yeo-ri

350
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,062
into coming to this dangerous palace
to go after this ghost.

351
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,607
Yet, you and Yeo-ri have nothing
but affection for that scoundrel.

352
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,567
"Lord Yoon Gap this"
and "Lord Yoon Gap that."

353
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,944
I am sick and tired of it.

354
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,487
What is the matter with you?

355
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,655
Are you jealous?

356
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,160
But you possess a talent

357
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,579
that surpasses Yoon Gap in every way.

358
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,749
Which is?

359
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,878
You have the ability to turn
the most solemn supreme sovereign

360
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,090
pettier than any commoner
on the market street.

361
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,509
Sure. Of course.
And does the most solemn supreme sovereign

362
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:42,846
possess enough knowledge to trip up
the corrupt government officials?

363
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,848
Did you really think I was unaware?

364
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,685
I will do whatever it takes to fight them

365
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:53,398
and ultimately punish them
to the fullest extent of state law.

366
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,944
The King shall take care
of the affairs in the mortal world.

367
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,697
The deity should just
stand aside and watch.

368
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,948
You should avoid

369
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:06,411
taking care of wicked old men
by yourself, for instance.

370
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,371
And so on.

371
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:35,356
That object shall protect Your Highness
from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

372
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,568
What a precious object.

373
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,903
I am truly grateful.

374
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,450
This is a Ghostbane Stone, is it not?

375
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,452
How did you know?

376
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,539
Father showed me his glasses
that were made with one.

377
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,083
I see.

378
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:58,004
Your Highness should also keep it
close by at all times.

379
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,182
What is with that King?

380
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,851
Does he know something?

381
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,645
- Know what?
- Sheesh!

382
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,730
I told you to stop popping up like that!

383
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,575
Bibi?

384
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,369
Are those two at it again?

385
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,583
I saw it.

386
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,169
I saw where Yeo-ri hid that <i>myeongdu</i>.

387
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,341
I also already figured out
where that nobleman I missed last time is.

388
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:48,471
He is drinking himself silly at a
courtesan house in the middle of the day.

389
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,099
Come on, let's go.

390
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,602
Let us speedily enjoy that feast
while Yeo-ri remains at the palace.

391
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,187
Bibi.

392
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,273
I am not going.

393
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,357
What?

394
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,608
Yeo-ri was right.

395
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,152
I should not have involved myself

396
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,196
in a deity's affairs
when I am in this mortal body.

397
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,865
Gangcheori.

398
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,950
Pung-san is on the run now
and he will not be able

399
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,244
to craft any more Haeilbu talismans
for the time being.

400
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,664
Fortunately, mortals diligently age
with every passing year,

401
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,666
so there will be a never-ending supply

402
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,460
of noblemen over the age of 60
with bellies full of spite.

403
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:23,506
I, too, am disappointed your ascension
has been delayed because of that Haeilbu.

404
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,092
But it will only be a few years.

405
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,927
If you are patient, in a couple of years--

406
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,345
Forget it!

407
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:32,849
Bibi.

408
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,684
At the end of the day,

409
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,312
you just do not want to upset that brat.

410
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,024
At this rate,

411
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,693
you will be offering up
your luminous pearl to banish that ghost.

412
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,322
How…

413
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,283
- How did you--
- I heard everything!

414
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,577
You have to drain your luminous pearl

415
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,871
if you want to banish
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

416
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,498
That means you have to die.

417
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,338
At the beginning, you told me

418
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,883
that you were just using Yeo-ri
to ascend as a dragon.

419
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,427
But look at you now.

420
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,888
Take a good look at yourself.

421
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,766
You are not occupying that body.

422
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,310
That body has swallowed you whole!

423
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,687
You have strayed too far

424
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,273
from Gangcheori the Imugi.

425
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,026
All because of that brat, Yeo-ri.

426
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,835
That dummy. Idiot.

427
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,630
Moron.

428
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,175
How could he abandon
his own brother for some brat

429
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,470
who cannot even live for 100 years?

430
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,101
He wouldn't…

431
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,357
Would he actually give up
his luminous pearl?

432
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,229
He does not have one.

433
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,689
No Haeilbu talisman.

434
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,260
Show yourself.

435
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,644
It appears you have figured it out.

436
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,480
So? Did you enjoy your meal,

437
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,564
Lord Imugi?

438
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,941
No wonder.

439
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,902
I did notice it reeked of fire energy.

440
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,862
My goodness, I am petrified.

441
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:19,033
My servant went through so much trouble
acquiring you that prey.

442
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,954
How could you glare at me so
for all the effort I put into this?

443
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,372
What are you scheming?

444
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,499
Oh, it is nothing special.

445
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,168
Just hand over that brat named Yeo-ri.

446
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,546
- What did you say?
- You know the shrine at the Association?

447
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,881
Just bring her there

448
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,259
and I will catch
these noblemen one by one

449
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,052
to serve them to you.

450
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,263
I crafted those talismans.

451
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,641
I have a clear roster
of who has them in their possession.

452
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,310
Catching and serving them to you
is no trouble at all.

453
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,895
Was this why?

454
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,398
Was this why you sold those talismans?

455
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,818
Neither the Warrior Deity nor I

456
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,989
harbor any ill will against the Imugis.

457
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,241
However, because
of that damn brat, Yeo-ri,

458
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,286
Imugi Gangcheori interferes
every other second

459
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,996
and it creates a giant headache for all.

460
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,750
So, if you just catch that brat
and bring her to the shrine,

461
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,211
I will offer her right up
to the Warrior Deity.

462
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,590
Then, Gangcheori will have
no reason to interfere anymore,

463
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,843
leaving us happy
and you happy to ascend.

464
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,596
This is a win-win situation
for both parties, is it not?

465
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,680
Right?

466
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,278
<i>I will hold it captive</i>
<i>with this talismanic iron net.</i>

467
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,907
<i>Then, you can use</i>
<i>the power of the luminous pearl</i>

468
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,367
to stab it with that crescent blade.

469
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,087
<i>That was why…</i>

470
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,051
<i>How could I have made</i>
<i>such a request of him?</i>

471
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,279
<i>But look at you now.</i>

472
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,822
Take a good look at yourself.

473
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,116
You are not occupying that body.

474
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,661
That body has swallowed you whole!

475
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,537
You have strayed too far

476
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,540
from Gangcheori the Imugi.

477
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,962
All because of that brat, Yeo-ri.

478
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:40,758
<i>It looked like Bibi was quite angry…</i>

479
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,719
<i>How can I make it up to him?</i>

480
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,808
- Listen…
- What?

481
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,102
Yes? Is something the matter?

482
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,732
I am sorry for taking what belongs to you.

483
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,112
Yes. All right.

484
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,289
The Ghostbane Stone…

485
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,165
What did you do with it?

486
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,294
Where is your Ghostbane Stone?

487
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,420
Well, I…

488
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,131
I gave it to the Prince.

489
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,299
What?

490
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,342
We are to go
to Yongdam Village in a few days.

491
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,970
What if the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
tries to harm the Prince and Queen

492
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,471
during our absence?

493
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,557
Then, what about you? What are you to do?

494
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:35,021
At least with that cursed thing
by your side, I could rest somewhat easy.

495
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,897
This will not do.

496
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,400
I will go and get it back
from that prince rascal.

497
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,155
What? Let go of me.

498
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,741
How can you laugh about this?

499
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,662
I mean, just a few months ago,
you despised it so

500
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,332
and tried everything
to separate it from me.

501
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,042
I almost forgot.

502
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,044
I believe you also possessed
Lord Yoon Gap's corpse

503
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,588
for the same reason. Am I wrong?

504
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,632
Things are different now.

505
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,430
Gangcheori.

506
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,434
I no longer need the Ghostbane Stone.

507
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,227
Do not need it?

508
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,729
What do you--

509
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,148
You are my protector now.

510
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,863
Back in Yongdam Village
and even in the capital,

511
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,615
it was always you.

512
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,744
You stayed by my side
and kept an eye on me when I was alone.

513
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,454
It was always you.

514
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,876
You are the Ghostbane Stone
that kept me safe.

515
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,716
So, I will not be confusing you

516
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,593
with Lord Yoon Gap.

517
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,350
And…

518
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,186
And?

519
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,816
I cannot do stuff like this
if I hold on to the Ghostbane Stone.

520
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,035
- Hey!
- What?

521
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,788
Why are you smirking over there
while you are eating?

522
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,957
Smirk? When did I ever smirk?

523
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,043
I am just agitated
by the lack of side dishes.

524
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:07,631
Stop it. This barley porridge is
so gentle on the palate and tasty.

525
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,341
I agree.

526
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,511
It is just so tasty,
I finished it in three spoon--

527
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,972
I mean, I finished it in three bites.

528
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:22,730
We are in this predicament
because you squandered your salary.

529
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:23,814
We have no choice.

530
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,067
Forgive me,

531
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,613
but going forward, we will only be serving
barley porridge in this house.

532
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:37,077
Ma'am, what about the money
I gave you last time?

533
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,496
That is too precious to spend.

534
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,499
I will keep it safe and give it to you
when you get married.

535
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,875
Do not worry.

536
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,877
Still going on about that damn salary.

537
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,881
I will just go to the King tomorrow
and have him pay that salary once more.

538
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,341
So let us get something tasty--

539
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,593
As if that makes any sense.

540
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,720
Do you think the King is your buddy?

541
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,478
Venerable, do you have a moment?

542
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,192
Yeo-ri. How do you know about that?

543
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,862
I thought you would have known.

544
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,991
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost can be banished
with an Imugi's luminous pearl.

545
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,788
Is there any other way?

546
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,626
His Majesty once told me

547
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,755
that Neop-deok was the only shaman
who was able to quell its energy.

548
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,216
How did my grandma do that?

549
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:36,011
Even back then, she tried every which way

550
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:40,641
and tried with all her might to expose
the ghost's true identity,

551
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,725
but she failed.

552
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,102
Hence,

553
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,272
she summoned the Grim Reaper.

554
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,817
But the shaman could suffer
sudden death if things go awry.

555
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,194
That is right.

556
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,863
It was only possible
because she was Great Shaman Neop-deok.

557
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,158
However, you already know that

558
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,452
that ended up failing as well.

559
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,748
But, back then, Grandma was in the dark

560
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:09,044
about the ghost's true identity
and Yapper's existence.

561
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:13,632
If I am able to expose its true identity
in Yongdam Village this time,

562
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,927
summoning the Fire Reaper might be enough.

563
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,930
Fire Reaper?

564
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,058
As in the reaper who takes away souls
who were burned to death?

565
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,285
What is it?

566
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,916
You will need one more thing
if you wish to summon the Fire Reaper.

567
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,628
What? Were you eavesdropping?

568
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,422
That is not important.

569
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,092
The ghost's identification pendant.

570
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,596
- You need it, do you not?
- Its identification pendant?

571
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,515
It would be useful to have,

572
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,850
but how could I ever find that?

573
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:06,852
Wait…

574
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,105
The Yapper might have it.

575
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,608
That explains how he could
summon it so easily.

576
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,196
I saw it at his shrine.

577
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,530
Did you really?

578
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,615
Yes, really.

579
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,035
You do not have to believe me.

580
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,162
Hold on.

581
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,959
What?

582
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,379
Do you want me to come with you?

583
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,217
Come with me.

584
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,846
Do not tell Gangcheori
that I know about the luminous pearl.

585
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,392
He must not find out.

586
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,270
I will make sure he is not sacrificed

587
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,357
to banish the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

588
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,151
<i>This girl…</i>

589
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,822
<i>genuinely holds Gangcheori dear,</i>
<i>deep in her heart.</i>

590
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,450
<i>That is exactly why.</i>

591
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,829
<i>That is why you are</i>
<i>an even greater danger to him.</i>

592
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,999
<i>If he wholly accepts your affection,</i>

593
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,710
<i>he will do whatever it takes…</i>

594
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,047
<i>to keep you out of danger.</i>

595
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,135
<i>Even if he cannot forgive me</i>
<i>for the next thousand years,</i>

596
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,303
<i>I have no choice.</i>

597
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,524
Tomorrow night.

598
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:39,027
I will bring Yeo-ri
to the shrine at the Association.

599
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,112
Excellent.

600
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,782
That is excellent.

601
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,661
<i>Hence,</i>

602
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,540
<i>I am sorry, but please die here and now.</i>

603
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,316
<i>What is he doing here?</i>

604
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,360
<i>Why should I care?</i>

605
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,363
<i>I just need to separate her</i>
<i>from Gangcheori</i>

606
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,699
<i>and accept my feast.</i>

607
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,327
<i>That is how I save Gangcheori.</i>

608
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,588
FORBIDDEN

609
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,952
You startled me.
Why must you always appear like that?

610
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,328
What took you so long?

611
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,456
Where is the ghost's
identification pendant?

612
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,125
Follow me.

613
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,357
I did not get a good look last time.

614
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,484
This shrine…

615
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,279
is quite something.

616
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,447
It was built to optimize

617
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,534
the gathering and harnessing
of fire energy.

618
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,871
The identification pendant
should be inside there.

619
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,826
Where in the world is it?

620
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,210
And we meet again.

621
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,380
How in the world are you here?

622
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:07,819
Bibi.

623
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,450
Did you deceive me?

624
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,911
Why?

625
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,205
Gangcheori changed because of you.

626
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,290
At this rate,

627
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,710
he will give up on what he has endured
all these long years for.

628
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,087
I will not let that happen.

629
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,048
I will never sacrifice him.

630
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,800
You heard everything.

631
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,718
I am here today to find another way--

632
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,011
Yes.

633
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,098
I am sure that is how you feel now.

634
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,557
However, that very desire…

635
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,103
will only encourage him to go further.

636
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,607
I do not care if he hates me for eternity.

637
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,359
As long as he is safe.

638
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,395
I know you…

639
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:35,133
<i>You just need to bring</i>
<i>that Imugi to the shrine.</i>

640
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,063
Yeo-ri.

641
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,612
It appears you are hell-bent on dying.

642
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,712
Bibi.

643
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:57,215
You will not get in my way this time.

644
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:01,261
Lord Imugi Bibi has agreed to help me.

645
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,056
What do you think you are doing right now?

646
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:06,975
Bibi!

647
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,477
What is the meaning of this?

648
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,855
This is all for your sake.

649
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,399
All because you have changed!

650
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,193
- What did you say?
- This is for the better.

651
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,405
I will kill that wench tonight

652
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,908
and get you out of that wretched body.

653
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:08,995
That is enough, Bibi.

654
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,247
I do not want to fight you.

655
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,916
I do not, either.

656
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,751
However,

657
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,252
this is how I protect you.

658
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,712
Bibi!

659
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:05,135
Bibi, stop here.

660
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,139
No. I must get you out of that body.

661
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,641
That body is not you!

662
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,445
<i>This whole shrine is</i>
<i>full of sweltering fire energy.</i>

663
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:24,696
<i>At this rate,</i>

664
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:27,991
<i>they will both be completely depleted</i>
<i>of their water-based energies.</i>

665
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,344
There we go. We are almost there.

666
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,138
<i>He…</i>

667
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,389
<i>was not after me.</i>

668
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,229
It is now time

669
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,023
for you to leave

670
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,150
that wretched body!

671
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:04,319
You cannot, Bibi! Please stop.

672
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,154
You two should not be fighting right now.

673
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,783
He is waiting for one of you two to die!

674
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,581
What?

675
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,249
What does that mean?

676
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,170
The luminous pearl.

677
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,881
He wants the luminous pearl!

678
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,509
Luminous pearl…

679
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,052
What?

680
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:37,143
No!

681
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,201
Bibi.

682
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,369
Bibi!

683
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,624
Bibi!

684
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,171
Bibi, you will be all right.

685
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:10,927
No.

686
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,095
No, Bibi!

687
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,601
I feel weird…

688
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,646
It's all right.

689
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:22,897
I<i>…</i>

690
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,944
No…

691
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,362
<i>The luminous pearl…</i>

692
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,732
No!

693
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,336
Gangcheori, we need to get out of here.

694
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,296
He devoured the pearl.
We don't know what will happen next.

695
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,589
Hurry.

696
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,198
The Warrior Deity

697
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,326
has devoured the luminous pearl!

698
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:56,884
Bibi, hang in there.

699
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:11,566
Gangcheori.

700
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,653
Stop.

701
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,196
You can let me down now.

702
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:22,785
Sit.

703
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:26,998
Bibi.

704
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,167
Bibi, you will be fine.

705
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,545
Serves me right.

706
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,048
I just let myself be tricked

707
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,675
by that blind scoundrel.

708
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,264
The King's grandfather…

709
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,685
He is the true benefactor
of that scoundrel.

710
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,146
Stop talking.

711
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:52,982
Your luminous pearl.
I will reclaim it for you.

712
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,109
Until then, just please…

713
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,406
Have you ever seen an Imugi…

714
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,410
without one?

715
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,329
Bibi…

716
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,790
I just…

717
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,584
wanted to protect you.

718
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,714
Seeing you stray so far away…

719
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:20,510
upset me

720
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:22,553
and scared me.

721
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:24,681
You know?

722
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,600
I do. I know, Bibi.

723
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:37,694
Bibi.

724
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,697
Bibi!

725
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,326
Bibi.

726
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,248
Bibi!

727
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,461
Bibi!

728
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,381
Bibi!

729
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,819
SPECIAL THANKS TO SONG JAE-HEE

730
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,257
My heart just hurts so much.

731
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,551
What in the world is wrong with me?

732
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:27,720
Now, I know

733
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,847
who the true benefactor of the ghost is.

734
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,474
<i>It is Lord Kim Bong-in.</i>

735
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:34,727
<i>That is impossible.</i>
<i>Yeo-ri must be mistaken.</i>

736
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:39,065
<i>The Warrior Deity has gained</i>
<i>stronger power than ever before.</i>

737
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:40,608
<i>We must hurry.</i>

738
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:43,027
<i>We shall set out as soon</i>
<i>as day breaks tomorrow.</i>

739
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:46,781
<i>Command that ghost</i>
<i>to end the King's life right now!</i>

740
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,533
Once His Majesty retires to slumber,

741
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,785
<i>secretly let them out.</i>

742
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:52,829
<i>Choi Won-u was hiding something.</i>

743
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:56,749
