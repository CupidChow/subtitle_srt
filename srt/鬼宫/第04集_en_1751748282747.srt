1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
(This story is purely fictional)

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,420
(Filming of child actors and animals follows safety regulations)

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,510
Something is wrong

4
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,380
I didn't see anything

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,800
I block the four directions with the rope of the barrier

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,470
He can't escape.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,720
Boundary rope...

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,060
Cut off

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,650
What?

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,200
That eight-foot ghost...

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,920
He is there

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,500
Eight-foot ghost

13
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,220
I took the Soul Stone

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,340
Let him be exposed to that eight-foot ghost

15
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,720
Your Highness's breath is stable

16
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,830
Do you want to die first?

17
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,170
Get out of the way

18
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,970
His Majesty

19
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,250
What is the origin of this eight-foot ghost?

20
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,960
Why is he so powerful?

21
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:33,254
When did your Majesty learn this sword technique?

22
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,421
No!

23
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,693
you…

24
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,279
You are not human

25
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,310
His Majesty

26
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,730
Is your majesty all right?

27
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,980
His Majesty

28
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,810
This is exactly...

29
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
His Majesty!

30
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,200
The east is blue, the west is white, the south is red, and the north is black.

31
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,540
The Name and Order of the Five Guardians of Zhonghuang

32
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,570
His Highness, what happened?

33
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,160
Prostrate

34
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,610
The prince seemed to have fainted briefly but his pulse was stable.

35
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,530
He should wake up soon.

36
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,040
How is your majesty? Is he injured?

37
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,370
No one is safe and sound

38
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,750
You back off.

39
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,840
Yes, sir.

40
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,010
Okay, let's talk.

41
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,520
What happened?

42
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,230
Please forgive me, Queen.

43
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,310
I don't know the specific situation.

44
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,980
I am also confused

45
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,530
His Majesty!

46
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,610
His Majesty!

47
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,830
The imperial physician had warned against strenuous activity.

48
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,230
Your Majesty? Your Majesty!

49
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,070
His Majesty…

50
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,140
Be patient

51
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,190
What?

52
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,020
This arrow must be pulled out.

53
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,520
Wait a minute

54
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,990
It's already painful and you still want to pull it out?

55
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,030
Aren't you the "omnipotent god"?

56
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,240
Are you scared?

57
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,530
Scared? Are you kidding?

58
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,870
Aren't you worried about Yin Jia's broken body...

59
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,170
you…

60
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,340
Don't move. I need to stop the bleeding first.

61
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,090
it hurts!

62
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,060
What are you doing? Wait...

63
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,880
It should be enough to stop the bleeding.

64
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,130
This is finally used on adults.

65
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Press and hold

66
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,600
Unexpectedly

67
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,560
Her hands are so warm and soft

68
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,620
here we go again!

69
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,330
Why is my heart beating so fast?

70
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,200
Damn Yin Jia

71
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,830
This human body is really useless.

72
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,440
What's wrong with you?

73
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,860
I bandaged your wound but you looked like you had seen the plague god

74
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,520
How can I not be startled when you get so close to me?

75
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,610
What? Do you still want me to stop the bleeding by pressing from a distance?

76
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,620
Listen to that eight-foot ghost

77
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,290
He is seriously injured and won't be back for a while.

78
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,450
But sooner or later I'll be back

79
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,370
We have to leave before then.

80
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,500
I'm not going anywhere

81
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,920
You can go if you want

82
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,010
What do you want if you don't leave?

83
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,180
Are you planning to deliver it yourself?

84
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,260
You've seen how vicious he is.

85
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,220
He will never rest until he takes revenge on those who wronged him.

86
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,230
You've been spotted by him

87
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,140
Still planning to stay?

88
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,270
So you want me

89
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,270
Play dumb and run away to save yourself?

90
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,730
Yin Jia used you!

91
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,030
You're willing to die for that kind of person?

92
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,450
How can you be so naive?

93
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,710
That was the first time

94
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,420
No one ever said it wasn't my fault

95
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,090
The adults were the first to say this.

96
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,340
Whether it is a flood

97
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,640
Drought, plague, or something happened to my grandmother?

98
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,270
They all blame me

99
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,940
They all blamed me.

100
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,190
He's the only one who says I'm innocent

101
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,780
I can finally breathe.

102
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,080
First time

103
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,450
Living no longer makes me feel guilty

104
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,790
I was able to survive those difficult years because of adults.

105
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,750
But the master died tragically because of a troublesome person like me.

106
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,260
Now you want me to pretend I know nothing and watch the evil spirit devour him?

107
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,720
I can't do it

108
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,680
I can't escape alone.

109
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,390
That would completely rot my heart.

110
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,440
I can't live like this anymore.

111
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,470
Your Majesty, I saw it with my own eyes

112
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,430
You are not Yin Jia

113
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,060
Who are you?

114
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,790
Guang Er

115
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,380
Are you awake?

116
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,010
Do you recognize me?

117
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,890
Mother

118
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,890
yes

119
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,520
I am your mother

120
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,270
That's right

121
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,980
Father...

122
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,730
I must see my father

123
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,740
Speak now!

124
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,410
Who are you?

125
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,910
I went through so much trouble to rescue him

126
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,870
How dare you do this?

127
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,580
What did you say? Yin Jia is dead

128
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,590
It was done by Guo Shangzhong before.

129
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,670
I didn't plan to

130
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,800
Stay in this broken body for a long time

131
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,010
What nonsense are you talking about?

132
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,510
Come on, tell the truth!

133
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,730
Your Majesty, what are you doing?

134
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,480
Your Majesty, please spare his life.

135
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,520
Get out of the way

136
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,570
How dare he touch the prince's body?

137
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,650
How dare he threaten the safety of the dragon vein!

138
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,990
No, Your Majesty, that is not the case.

139
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,240
It was he who brought His Highness back from the brink of death.

140
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,750
She is right

141
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,550
Guang Er

142
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,510
Father

143
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,640
Don't blame them

144
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,940
They saved me

145
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Guang Er

146
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,700
Are you okay?

147
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,080
fine

148
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,290
They are the ones who exorcised the thing that was entangled in my body

149
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,500
Cruelly tortured me for a long time

150
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,050
Evil Spirit

151
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,720
Evil spirit?

152
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,390
In compliance with your majesty's order, I have released the two men.

153
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,940
Are you sure, Your Majesty?

154
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,940
This person is extremely disrespectful in offending His Highness.

155
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,030
What I did just now in front of the Emperor was simply...

156
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,280
What did I look like when I drew my sword against him just now?

157
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,330
Your Majesty, please forgive me...

158
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,290
But His Majesty is like two different people

159
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,880
Does it remind you of how Guang Er looked when he was ill?

160
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
I…

161
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,850
I don't remember swinging my sword at him.

162
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,270
His Majesty

163
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,060
His Majesty?

164
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,030
Jiang Chaoli is right

165
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,700
The Eight-foot Ghost will come back

166
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,580
But I am alone

167
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,210
Can you really deal with that evil ghost?

168
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,800
What happened to you, Jiang Chaoli?

169
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,930
Could it be that he had lost too much blood previously?

170
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,640
water

171
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,850
water?

172
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,560
Are you thirsty? Want some water?

173
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,450
I actually forgot that he was a dragon.

174
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,000
River Lord

175
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,000
Even Jiang Chaoli, who is known as the invincible

176
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,750
It would be a great loss of vitality to deal with such a vicious evil spirit.

177
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,840
Finally got some strength back

178
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,620
Damn, that's embarrassing.

179
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,330
My reputation was ruined

180
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,080
Just because of a little evil spirit

181
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,210
Did you really mean what you said before?

182
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,840
Lord Yin Jia is really not

183
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,930
Killed by you?

184
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,310
I would like to give my body to you

185
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,560
Didn't you hear?

186
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,770
I said I would give you my body

187
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,240
That's right

188
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,700
I have granted your lifelong pursuit.

189
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,410
I would like to worship you as my patron saint.

190
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,200
I will pray with the most sincere heart

191
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,870
Until the day you turn into a dragon

192
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,090
What are you planning?

193
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
you're right

194
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,720
I tried

195
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,470
But I'm no match for that eight-foot ghost

196
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,770
I stole your majesty's soul-soothing stone and thought I could fight him.

197
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,060
But I was wrong

198
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,520
I don't even have a proper patronus.

199
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,150
There is no chance of winning

200
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,860
But maybe it can be done with your help

201
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,570
We just joined forces

202
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,820
Even the terrifying eight-foot ghost was frightened away

203
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,620
so

204
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,750
You want me to face him again?

205
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,710
You really saved my life today

206
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,960
But that doesn't mean I can forget all the anger and hatred towards you

207
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,920
but…

208
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,050
I am willing to obey orders

209
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,140
At your command

210
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,810
So please...

211
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,480
Save Lord Yin Jia

212
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,660
I begged you for 13 years

213
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,950
Now you're doing this for that bastard

214
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,500
Changing your mind so easily?

215
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,170
Hello

216
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,460
In the tide of the river!

217
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,220
“A family that accumulates good deeds will be blessed with good fortune”

218
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,850
In other words, people who do good deeds

219
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,350
Will bring lasting blessings to the family

220
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,030
Yes, Your Highness is really smart.

221
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,200
Do you know where this sentence comes from?

222
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,120
this…

223
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,830
I have no idea

224
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,540
In the Kun hexagram of the Book of Changes: Wenyan Zhuan

225
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,460
There is such a sentence

226
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,010
"A family that accumulates good deeds will be blessed with good fortune

227
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,760
A House of Evil

228
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,340
There will be more disasters.”

229
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,890
Your Majesty has done a very thorough examination.

230
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,980
The King has not forgotten

231
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,020
When the prince and I were of similar age, you were my strictest instructor.

232
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,320
Now in front of my great-grandson

233
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,030
Those rules are void.

234
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,620
How dare I act rashly in front of Your Majesty?

235
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,470
Your Highness has grown so fast in the past two months.

236
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,010
It seems that illness cannot stop the prince's growth.

237
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,930
yes

238
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,680
The Queen Consort has arrived

239
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,860
Meet the Queen Mother

240
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,710
Hearing that the prince has recovered

241
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,960
I really can't sit still

242
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,220
Is the prince really recovered?

243
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,930
That's right, Queen Consort.

244
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,470
Madam Lao is worried

245
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,850
Very good, very good

246
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,480
Prince Come Here

247
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,110
Sit here

248
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,870
The smell disappeared

249
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,250
The eyes are different too.

250
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,050
Did that thing really leave his body?

251
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,380
So sudden?

252
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,550
How come?

253
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,440
How could this be?

254
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,690
What happened?

255
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,690
Concubine

256
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,320
There are other beings in the palace

257
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,320
Other beings? What?

258
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,580
Uncertain at this time

259
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,910
But this existence hindered me and humiliated my queen

260
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,710
As a result, the ghost suffered severe damage.

261
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,290
What are you talking about?

262
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,960
Unlike the previous king

263
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,550
The current king strictly prohibits evil arts

264
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,050
The last time I was chanting in the Niangniang Palace

265
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,800
I also noticed something unusual.

266
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,680
But you don't need to worry too much, ma'am.

267
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,100
I will summon the ghost again

268
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,520
Completely cut off the fate of the prince

269
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,900
no

270
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,030
don't want

271
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,990
Concubine

272
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,360
At first, the evil spirits were used

273
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,700
It's because I hate the current king and want to protect Prince Yongin.

274
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,790
But I don't want to face that thing again.

275
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,840
That horrible stench...

276
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,760
I don't want to smell it anymore

277
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,430
This is Yongren's underwear.

278
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,810
Perform an exorcism for him

279
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,020
Don't let that evil ghost touch my Yongren

280
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,150
Do you understand?

281
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,900
clear

282
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:54,580
It seems that bitch is of no use.

283
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,310
She was obviously frightened out of her wits

284
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,890
Still holding a high and mighty attitude

285
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,560
How can she help her son?

286
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,940
Ascend to the throne?

287
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,880
No!

288
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,460
Your Majesty, the God of War! No!

289
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,420
No! Please!

290
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,510
Are you going to sleep on? Wake up!

291
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,970
How can you lie down for two days in a row? Do you want to get bedsores?

292
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,060
Ouch, wake up quickly

293
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,690
Did you just wake me up with your foot?

294
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,030
You said two days ago that you wanted to worship me as your patron saint

295
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,160
Is this how you treat your patronus?

296
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,830
You are not my guardian angel yet.

297
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,750
You didn't promise me

298
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,540
I knelt down but you still rejected me

299
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,050
What's the big deal about kneeling?

300
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,760
What did your grandmother teach you?

301
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,340
When the shrine maiden welcomed the guardian deity for the first time since ancient times

302
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,100
The true beginning must be made with a sincere offering.

303
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,720
You don't even have an offering...

304
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,000
Delicious, right? Pumpkin candy

305
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,290
I just bought

306
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,180
If you become my guardian angel, I will buy you this candy every day

307
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,480
Do you look down on me like this?

308
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,560
Just a piece of candy makes me want to...

309
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,060
So what?

310
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,320
Do we really need to set up an altar and offer sacrifices?

311
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,610
At least that! What else?

312
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,820
Longevity

313
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,950
What? Are you deaf?

314
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,290
Long life thread!

315
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,200
(The amulet bracelet made of five-colored threads symbolizes longevity)

316
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:45,870
You have to devote your heart and soul to compiling it yourself and give it to me

317
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,840
What? What do you want that for?

318
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,880
Didn't they live for more than a thousand years?

319
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,550
How long do you want to live?

320
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,880
presumptuous

321
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,720
Just do it. Where does all this nonsense come from?

322
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,520
I'll see how sincere you are.

323
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,310
And the pumpkin malt candy is offered every day.

324
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,150
You have to let me taste your sincerity.

325
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,070
Oh, I really want to slap him hard.

326
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,870
What did you say?

327
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,490
Someone petitioned to rectify customs?

328
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,660
Last year, the King ordered the Hancheng government

329
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,040
Drive all witches out of the capital

330
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,790
How could someone file a petition about this?

331
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,340
They said a few days ago

332
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,260
Traces of evil rituals were found in Beiyue Mountain

333
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,640
Beiyue Mountain?

334
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,310
Have you checked?

335
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,600
Yes, it is confirmed to be the same location

336
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,440
How is this possible?

337
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,110
Didn't you guarantee that Beiyue Mountain had already been cleaned up?

338
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,530
I assure your majesty that the place has been cleaned up.

339
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,450
It seems that she took the opportunity to perform another ritual.

340
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,210
Capture Yin Jia and that woman named Yeo Li immediately!

341
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,920
Go quickly!

342
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,180
This is ridiculous.

343
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,010
What use does he have for it?

344
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,480
Will only cause trouble for me

345
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,100
Then don't do it.

346
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,730
You don't have time to waste now.

347
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,280
Even running away is not enough.

348
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,410
You seem to be more beautiful

349
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,700
Thanks to you

350
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,700
The depression in my heart was relieved and my complexion improved.

351
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,210
But now is not the time to talk about this

352
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,250
You know that eight-foot ghost

353
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,420
How many souls have you swallowed?

354
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,300
Just sensing the aura from afar makes me shudder

355
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,470
Aren't you afraid of that eight-foot ghost?

356
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,600
Afraid

357
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,230
I've seen so many ghosts...

358
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,400
I've never seen anything so horrible.

359
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,650
I also

360
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,150
Very afraid of the eight-foot ghost

361
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,740
So why are you still doing this?

362
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,570
Just to save that man?

363
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,080
Oh my god, Ruli

364
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,880
Give me, I'll come

365
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,550
I can't eat and drink for free.

366
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,630
Hey, don't say stupid things.

367
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,010
Look at these oval glasses you made for me.

368
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,300
It's enough to cover ten years' worth of food expenses.

369
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,140
With this, sewing is effortless now.

370
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,270
It's a gift, not a reward.

371
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,230
Oh, you are so thoughtful.

372
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,860
Okay, I'll go prepare breakfast.

373
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,980
good

374
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,950
Make me some more chive pancakes

375
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,160
The ingredients used are poor

376
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,620
But you have a talent for cooking.

377
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,170
Yes, this is for you, sir.

378
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,630
You should learn something

379
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,010
When I first met her, she was still a vulgar wild woman.

380
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,220
But now she finally recognizes my dignity and worships me

381
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,890
What is this for?

382
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:34,770
Don't you have any sense? At least go chop wood and fetch water.

383
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,440
All you do is sit and point fingers all day

384
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,770
Do you think of her as a maid? Do you?

385
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,950
Your arrow wound

386
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,740
Are you okay? Let me go!

387
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,790
etc.

388
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:58,290
How come your shoes are covered in mud when you stay at home all day?

389
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,340
Did you sneak out last night?

390
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,460
This shoe has always been like this

391
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,060
Capture these two immediately! Yes, sir!

392
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,810
What does this mean, sir?

393
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,750
Didn't Your Highness forgive us for what happened that day?

394
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,130
Why did you suddenly arrest us?

395
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,710
The King has indeed forgiven you.

396
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,670
This is my mistake.

397
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,900
One night at the same place on Mount Beiyue

398
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,820
Someone discovered these witchcraft weapons

399
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,490
What?

400
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,660
Thanks to you, Prince, I was able to recover.

401
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,370
This is an indisputable fact.

402
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,790
This king is thinking about this merit

403
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,500
I have condoned your violation of the law.

404
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,590
But how dare you challenge my bottom line so brazenly?

405
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,800
These are not my things

406
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,840
It's not me who did it.

407
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,550
I shouldn't let you off the hook just because you saved my son's life.

408
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,100
According to national law, witches are not allowed to enter the capital

409
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,060
Dismissal of Yin Jia's post

410
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,560
Expel these two from the royal capital immediately!

411
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,320
Eight-foot ghost...

412
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,110
The Eight-foot Ghost will come back

413
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,160
Your Highness, do you really not understand?

414
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,670
That ghost not only wants to harm the prince

415
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,340
They will definitely come to demand your Majesty's order.

416
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:16,010
This ghost has a deep grudge against the royal bloodline

417
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,680
Although I was temporarily out of danger this time with the blessing of the gods

418
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,980
But the eight-foot ghost will definitely look for another chance

419
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,560
Devouring the Prince and His Majesty

420
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:42,790
How will you respond now?

421
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,500
You will be safe

422
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,960
The orders of the parents and children were openly violated

423
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,920
Is it the national law that you have always advocated?

424
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,090
Of course this will put you in a dilemma.

425
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,310
No matter how much you call yourself a king

426
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:03,020
You're just a human after all.

427
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,900
His Majesty

428
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,110
Immediately expel these two from the capital

429
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,360
His Majesty

430
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,990
His Majesty!

431
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,900
This is enough for you to settle down.

432
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,200
grown ups

433
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:00,240
Remember not to step into Wangjing again

434
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,450
Sir, wait a moment

435
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,580
Please tell His Majesty for me

436
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:11,500
You have to wear those glasses all the time.

437
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,550
The Soul-Calming Stone

438
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,840
It is the only thing that can ward off evil spirits.

439
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,400
true and false?

440
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,030
Just a small amount of money for being kicked out?

441
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,570
That king is as stingy as a rat!

442
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,780
How come you're not angry?

443
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,580
How could they drive us away like this?

444
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,450
What can we do when the national law is strict?

445
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,670
It's so frustrating. I didn't do any of that.

446
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,960
But I did not find any other traces of rituals there at that time.

447
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,840
Who did it?

448
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,410
Since I can't enter Wangjing

449
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,570
We have no choice.

450
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,200
How? Is there any place you want to go?

451
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,120
How about the view of Mount Kongtong?

452
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,920
How about we take this opportunity to go to Daqing for a visit?

453
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,010
What is Neifoshan? Where?

454
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,050
I'm going to Neifushan

455
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,970
Inner Buddha Mountain? Inner Buddha…

456
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:43,930
Don’t tell me…

457
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,390
Yes, I'm going to see Master Gaso.

458
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,690
My grandmother's witchcraft tools are buried there.

459
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,100
I need a handy magic weapon

460
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,940
I still find it strange how the king could have the soul-calming stone?

461
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,780
Master Gasuo must know the inside story

462
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,070
You still don't give up?

463
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,240
We have been expelled from the capital

464
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,910
This matter has nothing to do with you anymore

465
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,370
You said it yourself

466
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,120
The eight-foot ghost will

467
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,580
Revenge for the Wronged

468
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,170
I became one of his targets.

469
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,470
This is better

470
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,300
If he really comes to me

471
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,800
I killed him myself.

472
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,350
Rescue Lord Yin Jia

473
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,480
If you want to go, go ahead. I can go alone.

474
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:44,780
Concubine

475
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,420
I heard that you missed classes at Sungkyunkwan for several days.

476
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,930
Have you been hiding like this?

477
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,010
Mother

478
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,310
What trouble have you gotten into this time?

479
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,720
What good things have you done?

480
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:12,560
How many times have I cleaned up after you?

481
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,480
Just to prevent you from being blamed by the hateful king

482
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,230
Mother, how long will I have to worry about you?

483
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,940
Concubine

484
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,990
Your Highness is not at fault.

485
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,120
Just when playing Cuju

486
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,660
Something unexpected happened

487
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,410
Cuju?

488
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,080
Yes, mother

489
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,790
When I played Cuju

490
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,670
The female instructor who died in the well

491
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,500
Suddenly appeared and grabbed my neck

492
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,720
The female officer who threw herself into the well?

493
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,470
Murphy

494
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,060
You also provoked

495
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,640
Recently committed suicide in the Central Palace

496
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,770
Female training officer?

497
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,580
A cowardly person

498
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,580
He actually did such a beastly thing.

499
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,300
Since you are so afraid of ghosts

500
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,550
Why commit sin in the first place!

501
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,970
Mother

502
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,600
Please don't leave, mother.

503
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,480
I'm afraid that bitch will show up again

504
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,850
I'm afraid

505
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:38,940
It's so sad

506
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,730
Really useless

507
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,200
Mother

508
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,360
Mother!

509
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,700
Mother!

510
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,000
Mother!

511
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,830
You say I'm a coward?

512
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,800
Just wait and see!

513
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:05,670
Your Highness!

514
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
Stop it, Your Highness!

515
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,770
Listen carefully!

516
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,110
Is this the home of Lady Yuyi?

517
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,280
The one who committed suicide by jumping into a well?

518
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,120
May I ask who you are?

519
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,700
I am Yui's father

520
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,580
Did you know…

521
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,840
Dad!...What did your damn daughter do to me?

522
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,460
You are unworthy of being a father! Dad!

523
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,550
How dare she humiliate me?

524
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,970
I'll teach you a lesson first

525
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,140
Oh my god, do you know who I am?

526
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,680
Oh my God! My Lord! Let go!

527
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,020
Your Highness, you can't do this, Your Highness!

528
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,850
Let me go!

529
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,860
Do you know who I am?

530
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,980
presumptuous

531
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,480
Dare you humiliate me?

532
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,400
Oh my god!

533
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,610
Die

534
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,820
Go to hell!

535
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,050
He is surprisingly naive sometimes.

536
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:53,450
Where did he suddenly go?

537
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,680
Are you okay?

538
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,220
Just now... there was a tiger

539
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:01,220
Oh, that one?

540
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:03,730
A thunderbolt scared it away.

541
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,980
It ran away? It ran away after being struck by lightning?

542
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,580
Are you going to spend the whole day here?

543
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,500
We have to find a place to stay before dark.

544
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,110
That damned king didn't even give me any food.

545
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:58,200
What use is this bag of money in the mountains?

546
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,160
I shouldn't have let that tiger go.

547
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:04,750
It's time to catch it and roast it to satisfy hunger.

548
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:09,790
What's this?

549
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,290
Open it and you will know

550
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,430
Not enough to fill the gaps between teeth

551
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,800
Forget it, just eat it.

552
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:25,430
You make me offer pumpkin candy every day

553
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,060
This is the five-day preparation.

554
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:29,980
Master Jiaso's temple is nearby

555
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,650
You can eat these candies first.

556
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,070
I just don't want to disappoint the sincere offerings.

557
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:52,080
But don't think I agree to be your guardian angel

558
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,210
I will continue to see how you serve me

559
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,460
Don't be lazy

560
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:03,510
I think I've seen it once or twice before.

561
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:07,390
Thunder strikes from clear sky

562
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:11,400
That time I went to Jin Xueshi's house to sell glasses and passed by the mountain

563
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,730
Wasn't that also your doing?

564
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,700
You attract that thunder

565
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,570
To scare away the tiger?

566
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,620
This area has always been plagued by tigers.

567
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,120
People died in every village.

568
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,250
You were bold and fearless

569
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,590
Walking alone in the mountains foolishly

570
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,630
It's strange that it wasn't bitten.

571
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:46,970
Don't look at me like that

572
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,190
You are my only hope to become a dragon

573
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,230
You are alive and well

574
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,570
I can do what I want

575
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,730
That's why I'm like this

576
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,310
Gone! What? What's gone?

577
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:32,600
My Pumpkin Candy!

578
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,650
I guess you ate it all.

579
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:39,940
I only ate one piece and kept the rest. I put them here.

580
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,670
Dare you steal my pumpkin candy?

581
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,760
I'm going to kill you

582
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,720
Hey Jiang Chaoli!

583
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:31,080
Where's my pumpkin candy? Give it to me!

584
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,330
Not on me

585
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:36,790
Are you looking for a beating? How dare you steal Ruli's tribute?

586
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:38,670
Where are you hiding? Damn it.

587
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,420
Not on me

588
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,920
Not on me!

589
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,170
Not on me!

590
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:02,860
You crazy bastard!

591
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:12,990
What?

592
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:17,080
How can a mortal body have such spiritual power?

593
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,170
You are not human

594
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:21,600
No!

595
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,360
My Pumpkin Candy!

596
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:34,320
May Guanyin Bodhisattva have mercy on me

597
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,950
In the tide of the river!

598
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,900
mine…

599
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,110
My Pumpkin Candy!

600
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,030
I'll buy you ten more later.

601
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,910
You tried so hard to learn the ritual from me.

602
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,580
Just for this trouble?

603
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,000
It is the master

604
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,500
This is Jiaolongjiang Chaoli

605
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:32,220
But how could he

606
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:35,640
Trapped in a dead body?

607
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,140
None of your business

608
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:42,640
How offensive I was just now

609
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:46,150
You suddenly pounced on my master

610
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,520
I was so anxious that my eyes turned red

611
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:49,520
But thanks to you

612
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:53,110
I did get some exercise, it's been a long time since I last did.

613
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:59,030
Then my grandmother's magic weapon isn't here?

614
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,580
The great witch Ned is a person who has achieved success in spiritual practice

615
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,120
Those magical weapons also contain spiritual power as powerful as hers.

616
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:09,340
So I buried it on the top of Neifu Mountain.

617
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,630
We can pick it up tomorrow morning.

618
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:13,630
Good Master, that's good.

619
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,800
Oh, Master

620
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:19,390
Look at this saliva

621
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,980
Oh, it's so delicious?

622
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,810
Come here, nostril

623
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:27,230
Blow

624
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:29,270
Very good on the other side

625
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,330
Ouch

626
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,540
Please, Your Highness

627
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,500
If the Queen Dowager finds out...

628
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,210
What if we discover?

629
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:56,130
She'll just go crazy again.

630
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:02,970
My mother has always been like this

631
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:07,770
I've only been able to get angry since a long time ago.

632
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:11,820
When I was a kid

633
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,940
She is like that

634
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:20,120
Your Highness, let's go in.

635
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,030
No, I'm fine.

636
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,410
Leave me alone

637
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:25,540
But I still have to make your bed...

638
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,870
Didn't I tell you to stop bothering me?

639
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:29,620
Back off!

640
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:36,170
Yes, sir.

641
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,260
That

642
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:39,550
I'm backing off first.

643
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:05,200
That move should be scary enough for her.

644
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:06,950
So what if you're a ghost?

645
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,420
How dare you treat the royal family like that!

646
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:38,650
What?

647
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,860
You can stare at me

648
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,530
Come and try again if you have the guts.

649
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:49,660
This time I will definitely burn down your shabby hut

650
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,460
Wipe out your three generations together!

651
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,170
What's this?

652
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:05,680
What is all this?

653
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:10,230
What's this?

654
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:12,980
What? What is this?

655
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,560
Stand back!

656
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,690
Stop!

657
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:21,860
Don't come near!

658
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:05,660
Now that I have my grandmother's magic weapon, I have to confront him again.

659
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:07,030
Are you planning to leave?

660
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,030
Did you see a man and a woman passing by here?

661
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,790
What on earth do you want to do in there?

662
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,920
Preparing for the Ceremony

663
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,460
I will be your steadfast benefactor

664
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,710
Someone is looking for you urgently

665
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,630
Someone must have sacrificed the prince.

666
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:27,180
Did you attack Prince Yongin?

667
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,600
The prince will be sacrificed to the God of War tonight

668
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,310
I will lure out the eight-foot ghost there

669
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:39,400
