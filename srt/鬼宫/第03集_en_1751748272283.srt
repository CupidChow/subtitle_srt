1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
(This story is purely fictional)

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,420
(Filming of child actors and animals
All follow safety regulations)

3
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,680
(The shrine of my deceased brother and student Yin Jia)

4
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,480
Sir, are you really here?

5
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,400
Lord Yin Gap

6
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,580
Sir, please respond to me

7
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,830
Lord Yin Jia, please...

8
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,350
Guang'er, what's wrong with you?

9
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,470
Guanger!

10
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,490
Don't just stand there! Share it...

11
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,530
Send for the imperial physician! Now!

12
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,950
Yes, Your Majesty

13
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,540
grown ups

14
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,250
It's me, Ruli

15
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,380
Ruli...

16
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,220
What?

17
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,560
Guang'er, are you okay?

18
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,230
His Majesty

19
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,780
His Majesty!

20
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,960
What's wrong with you?

21
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,429
Come here quickly

22
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:55,944
grown ups

23
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,029
Lord Yin Gap

24
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,948
Where are you?

25
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,960
Are you saying that Lord Yoon was devoured by the eight-foot ghost?

26
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,170
Exactly

27
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,460
Where is he?

28
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,840
Where is that eight-foot ghost now?

29
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,660
Lord Yin Gap

30
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,450
Are you really here?

31
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,630
grown ups?

32
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
grown ups!

33
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,850
This is clearly

34
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,270
The stench of resentment

35
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,610
I've never seen such strong resentment.

36
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,590
grown ups

37
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,620
Don't talk

38
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,590
You bastard!

39
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,640
Do you want to be imprisoned by the vengeful spirit like Yin Jia?

40
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,270
What did you say?

41
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,600
The prayer just now only gave him a short-term relief.

42
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,020
The eight-foot ghost had already devoured him completely

43
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,240
No one can do anything at this moment

44
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,770
Concubine

45
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,570
The evil spirit is now deeply attached to your Highness' body

46
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,200
Unless His Majesty dies

47
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,070
Otherwise the evil spirit will never leave.

48
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,660
His Royal Highness

49
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,620
Are you serious?

50
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,330
You mean...

51
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,710
Will the prince eventually die because of this ghost?

52
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,630
What happened to the Queen Mother?

53
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,880
Are you feeling scared now?

54
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,720
Isn't this

55
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,930
Is this what you truly hope for, Queen Dowager?

56
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
presumptuous!

57
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,150
I spared your life because I thought you were a useful talent, but you dared

58
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,650
So rude?

59
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,320
Are you tired of living?

60
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,820
Oh, Queen Consort, please spare me.

61
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,030
The little ones are just lowly ants

62
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,660
If you don't understand the palace etiquette, you will commit a big taboo.

63
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,880
Please spare my life, Queen Dowager.

64
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,130
Back off

65
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,010
yes

66
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,260
The little one will leave first.

67
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,230
Slow down

68
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,480
After the evil ghost devours the prince

69
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,190
It will leave us, right?

70
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,450
My Yongren...

71
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,370
Can you be safe?

72
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,160
Exactly

73
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,410
certainly

74
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,920
You will be fine

75
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,850
Even if it's just for a moment
His Majesty the God of War also showed strong uneasiness

76
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,770
What is going on?

77
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,250
His Highness has fallen asleep

78
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,040
His Majesty

79
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,130
I will stay by the prince's side

80
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,170
Your Majesty, please go back to your bedroom and rest.

81
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,700
Unexpectedly, he was swallowed by the eight-foot ghost.

82
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,490
Although unexpected
But that idiot acted recklessly under the banner of the king's order

83
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,790
It's all your own fault that you ended up like this

84
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,170
You knew that a long time ago, right?

85
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,470
You knew there was a eight-foot ghost in the palace.

86
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,930
That's why you tried to stop me from coming here like crazy

87
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,060
Isn’t it?

88
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,060
Yes, I know

89
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,560
so

90
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,480
I think at least I can stop you from entering the palace.

91
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,440
What did you say?

92
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,280
Yin Jia also knows about the Eight-foot Demon

93
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,950
What do you mean?

94
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,740
Haven't you ever doubted it?

95
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,370
You know he brought you to the palace.
Not just to make glasses for the king

96
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,040
Could you give me a pair of glasses, too?

97
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,960
It's for your majesty.

98
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,710
No

99
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,590
impossible

100
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,260
He saw you drive away the one-legged ghost

101
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,760
That's why I brought you here

102
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,140
I want you to expel the eight-foot demon for the prince.

103
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,100
No

104
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,940
You fell into his trap.

105
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,070
He took advantage of you

106
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
It's up to you.

107
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,760
Pretending to be fine

108
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,850
Did you two have an argument?

109
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,770
No, of course not.

110
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,560
What are you holding in your hand?

111
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,320
I forgot to take Jia'er's clothes last time.

112
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,070
Sent from the government medical department

113
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,940
Wait, let me wash it.

114
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,280
Why bother you? I should wash this.

115
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,160
I was just feeling upset and looking for something to do.

116
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,140
This is…

117
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,680
That Day

118
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,280
Young master!

119
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,320
Young Master Jia!

120
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,070
Wait, isn’t that Ruli, the granddaughter of the Great Miko?

121
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,210
Ruli

122
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,590
I want to give you this

123
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,220
Isn’t this the thread of longevity?

124
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,840
Mothers will make this for their children during the Dragon Boat Festival

125
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,600
I hope my children live long and healthy...

126
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,430
But I really have nothing to give.

127
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,480
If you don't like it, come back

128
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,860
At worst, I can pawn it.

129
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,650
I love so much

130
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,410
Will wear it with you

131
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,160
I will come back to find you

132
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,290
I promise

133
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,370
We all need to be safe and sound...

134
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,750
Wait until we meet again

135
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,640
"Safe and sound"? Bullshit

136
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,680
Pointless

137
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,240
That should be harsh enough.

138
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,280
She should back off now.
I won't confront that eight-foot ghost again.

139
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,420
I was expecting you

140
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,170
Never know the evil ghost...

141
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,710
But you finally know

142
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,710
It’s time for Jiaer to have breakfast!

143
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,860
Where is Ruli?

144
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,200
Don’t you see your mother is here?

145
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,110
Where did Ruli go?

146
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,030
Where else can I go? Back to the palace.

147
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,910
She hurried out early in the morning

148
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,290
Why didn't you wake me up?

149
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,580
-What did you say?
-It's all your fault

150
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,880
The reason why I slept
It's all because you made the kang so warm

151
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,130
Ouch, it hurts!

152
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,550
You are wrong. Explain clearly.

153
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,340
As if treating me like a stranger wasn't chilling enough...

154
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,850
It's really chilling, you bastard!

155
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,640
How dare you glare at your mother!

156
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,560
I'm kind enough to prepare breakfast for you!

157
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,730
You bastard...

158
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,730
What are you doing?

159
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,770
I must teach you a lesson today.

160
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,310
Forget it. I don't have time to make trouble with you.

161
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,230
Oh my god, wait, Jiaer, stop!

162
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,390
Bring this

163
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,980
Braised bracken and chive pancakes

164
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,900
For your craftsmanship, I'll spare you.

165
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,280
I won't forgive you if you continue to be so presumptuous

166
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,700
I packed some extra and shared them with my friends.

167
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,170
OMG

168
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,590
If we could have been earlier

169
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,800
How nice it would be to have such a quarrel...

170
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,890
Isn’t it Jiaer?

171
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,530
grown ups!

172
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,320
Where is that girl's workstation?

173
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,450
But where? Got it

174
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,700
Yes, sir.

175
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,210
Where is Inspector Yin?

176
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:59,460
Jiang Chao...I don't mean
Why are you here looking for adults?

177
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,670
I heard he followed you all day yesterday.

178
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,050
Then he returned without even paying his respects to His Majesty.

179
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,050
Where is he?

180
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,680
He didn't come here today.

181
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,640
You didn't see him either?

182
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,230
No adults...

183
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,350
This kid...

184
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,320
How should I report this to His Majesty?

185
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,990
Your Majesty said that the temples of his glasses were too loose

186
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,250
Please make sure it is fixed when I come to pick it up in the evening

187
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,330
Yes, sir.

188
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,330
You have to be very careful
These glasses mean a lot to your majesty.

189
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,420
I see

190
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,010
These glasses

191
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,480
The King is very satisfied

192
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,200
Why did you summon me again?

193
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,910
Don't you want to take revenge on the culprit?

194
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,000
I will help you

195
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,830
As long as you help me

196
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,090
They said the training ground is right here.

197
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,310
That's right.

198
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,350
This way quickly

199
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,480
continue

200
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
Don't take it lightly

201
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,110
Here! This way!

202
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,860
Damn

203
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,570
Who are you?

204
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,370
Excuse me, I seem to be lost.

205
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,830
Damn untouchables!

206
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,910
I missed the ball!

207
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,830
Your Highness, what are you doing over there?

208
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,330
We're going to win if we keep going this way.

209
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,830
His Royal Highness Ball

210
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,630
You have a good face.

211
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,590
You stay here and don't move.

212
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,720
I'll teach you a lesson later.

213
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,600
Keep playing

214
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,810
Come soon

215
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,730
Kick this way

216
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,060
It must be him

217
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,820
Ruli isn't here?

218
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,900
So where did she go?

219
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,780
I have no idea

220
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,870
She was just

221
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,790
-Where did she go?
-That naughty girl...

222
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,670
She always disappears when she has time.

223
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,460
Next time I see her, I will definitely scold her.

224
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,510
Give him a good scolding!

225
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,440
"Scold him severely"?

226
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,910
What are you doing, sir?

227
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,500
If you dare to touch your finger

228
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,710
I will make your descendants

229
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,170
Wherever I go, I get struck by thunder and rain.

230
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,920
Difficult to move forward

231
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,050
Forgive me, sir.

232
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,720
I won't touch her.

233
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,480
Could it be…

234
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,610
Is she looking for that eight-foot ghost again?

235
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,780
Here it comes

236
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,450
continue

237
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,950
Ouch! Why didn't you receive this?

238
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,830
Come here

239
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,130
-there
-careful

240
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,920
- This way
-hurry up

241
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,090
This side

242
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,730
Ah! Your Highness!

243
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,190
Your pretty maid belongs to me.

244
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,740
The age of 15 is the right time to pick

245
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,410
You must dress me up beautifully!

246
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,960
Why is that slave girl standing there?

247
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,380
I heard that she committed suicide by jumping into a well.

248
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,630
hurry up!

249
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,970
continue

250
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,600
No, this is impossible.

251
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,430
This can't be...

252
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,230
I must be dazzled

253
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,360
It's just a hallucination

254
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,090
After I silently committed suicide, I saw you laughing crazily

255
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:19,300
The headaches you have will disappear on their own.
Is it worth playing music to celebrate?

256
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,220
Why do this?

257
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,590
Why do you treat me like this? Why?

258
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,100
presumptuous!

259
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,770
Your Highness

260
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,530
- Spare my life.
-Shut up!

261
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,950
Your Highness

262
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,780
Do not move!

263
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,330
open

264
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,340
Why do you treat me like this?

265
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:04,970
Because I felt that the maids in the palace were as lowly as ants.
Can you just trample on it at will?

266
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,310
I am also the daughter of a poor family.

267
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:13,390
Although not worth anything
But my life is also a precious life!

268
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,980
I will never let you go

269
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,400
Come with me

270
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,860
Come with me!

271
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,740
Your Highness!

272
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,910
-He's here!
-What…

273
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,070
Your Highness!

274
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,910
-Your Highness
-Your Highness

275
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,410
You have to pull your head out.

276
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,620
Your Highness!

277
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,910
Try harder

278
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,380
Your Highness!

279
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,630
pull!

280
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,050
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness, are you okay?

281
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,300
Are you okay?

282
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,700
Thanks

283
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,280
Seeing his stupid look

284
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,830
It relieved some of my hatred

285
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,580
Go to the Central Palace Bathing Room

286
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,460
Find a clothes cage with blue cloth

287
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,960
There is a close-fitting sweatshirt of the prince inside

288
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,300
Isn't that what you're looking for?

289
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:29,760
Exactly

290
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,430
to be honest

291
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,850
I didn't expect you to help me like this.

292
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,980
Royal murder

293
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,400
It's an adventure for you too

294
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,780
I hate this kind of scum too.

295
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,860
I think you are becoming more and more pleasing to the eye.

296
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,360
I'm in a good mood, but is there anything else I want?

297
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,280
Although I am a ruthless ghost

298
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,030
But I will help you in whatever way I can.

299
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,580
No need to help me anymore

300
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,460
But there is something I need to tell you

301
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,210
You must never approach him again.

302
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,880
- You can't touch him anymore
-What?

303
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,760
If you commit murder again,

304
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,180
Will become a complete evil spirit

305
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,350
Remember

306
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,980
This is the last time you interfere in the affairs of the living world.

307
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,950
Where could she run to?

308
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,870
Should I tie a bell on her?

309
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,860
Go to the Central Palace Bathing Room

310
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,740
Find a clothes basket tied with blue cloth

311
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,860
OMG

312
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,620
What's going on?

313
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,750
The stench of evil spirits?

314
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,370
Have you ever been close to that eight-foot ghost?

315
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,830
Absolutely not!

316
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,670
Wait, I noticed you recently
It's really disrespectful to Master Yin's body.

317
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,470
His ankle sprain has not yet healed.

318
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,220
You just let him jump over the wall.

319
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,090
-What?
- Let me see

320
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,940
Look at this ankle. It's swollen.

321
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,230
It's really heartbreaking.

322
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,020
Oh my god

323
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,360
Why is your face so red?

324
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,900
Could it be that he has a fever?

325
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,490
Not like a fever

326
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,040
Then why is your face so red?

327
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,460
It's not you who's angry.

328
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,760
Now that this precious body is exhausted

329
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,760
- We should go home quickly
- Wait a minute.

330
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,970
go home?

331
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,300
Why don’t you leave?

332
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,890
I…

333
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,140
I have work to do.

334
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,900
That's why I left him this morning.

335
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,690
How to get rid of this?

336
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,520
Oh my god

337
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,480
Where on earth is he?

338
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,610
Which way did he go?

339
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,650
Lord Yin Jia!

340
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,070
Don't worry, I'll just do some work and then go home.

341
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,990
Lord Yin Jia! You go ahead.

342
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,870
Sir, isn’t that Inspector Yin?

343
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,160
What did you say?

344
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,620
what you do?

345
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,420
Do you know that guy who is as stubborn as a grilled abalone
How annoying is it?

346
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,750
Why!

347
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,300
Hey Yin Jianxiao

348
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,590
I've been looking for you all day.

349
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,470
Unexpectedly, we met here by chance?

350
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,890
Let's go. His Majesty wants to see you.

351
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,640
Your Majesty? The King?

352
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,180
You...

353
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,600
Go ahead. I'll wait for you at the Clothing House.

354
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,810
Will you wait for me?

355
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,320
We have to go home together.

356
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,490
Okay, OK

357
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,870
In fact, I am also thinking

358
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,910
Why did the evil spirit suddenly cause a commotion in the palace?

359
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:25,000
I should see the true face of the owner of this mansion

360
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,420
-Hello
-What? What face?

361
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,040
I won't delay too long.

362
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,920
You wait obediently in the clothing store.

363
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,630
Let's go quickly.

364
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,510
Where is that king?

365
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,350
- You little bastard...
-Is it this way?

366
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,510
Is it over there?

367
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,970
It's you over here, kid!

368
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,650
Where is the king?

369
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,730
This stinky boy...

370
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,650
He should be okay, right?

371
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,650
You kid!

372
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,460
His Majesty

373
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,260
I'm afraid I don't understand your majesty's intention.

374
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,510
As Military Minister

375
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,810
I have no time to judge

376
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,430
The Case of the Young Inspector Encountering Bandits

377
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,940
You are in a high position, and I understand the heavy responsibility you bear.

378
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,860
However, if the person who hurt Lord Yin Jia was not a bandit

379
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,450
But he is a military general who has received rigorous training...

380
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,960
Is there any evidence for this?

381
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,830
You want evidence

382
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,210
some

383
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,340
Go faster

384
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,470
Get out of the way!

385
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,180
hurry up

386
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,760
His Majesty, Lord Yin Jia, is here to see you

387
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,480
It seems that the "evidence" has come by itself

388
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,440
Let Him In

389
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,840
You...Hey!

390
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,470
Why should I...

391
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,180
Come here quickly!

392
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,100
hurry up!

393
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,250
Look at this person wearing a red robe with dragon pattern

394
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,380
This guy must be the king

395
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,770
I am very pleased to see you recover.

396
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,610
The imperial physician said you have amnesia

397
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,110
So you really don't remember what happened that day?

398
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,160
You really don't remember

399
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,950
Who did this to you?

400
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,210
Military Affairs Minister

401
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:00,880
We will investigate this case thoroughly

402
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,130
You need to tell the truth about everything you remember.

403
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,560
I…

404
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,110
I don't remember at all

405
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,580
His Majesty

406
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,950
It seems that the rumors are true, Your Majesty, this witness

407
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,870
Not amnesia, but madness

408
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,040
Asking him again is useless...

409
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,310
What? What are you doing?

410
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,690
Don't move

411
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,150
This sword wound is the evidence

412
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,910
With your military skills

413
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,030
Do you really think this could have been caused by bandits?

414
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,130
Lord Yin Jia is following the king's orders.
This was an ambush during the mission

415
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,220
To hurt him is to hurt the king

416
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,220
I order you to take responsibility

417
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,480
Thoroughly investigate this case and find out the mastermind behind it

418
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,310
As you command, Your Majesty

419
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,990
I finally understand why humans are so eager to pursue fame and fortune.

420
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,200
These exquisite desserts

421
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,830
The room's breathtaking furnishings

422
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,370
And this velvet cushion

423
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,410
It's really far from being comparable to the bed in Yin Jia's house...

424
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
That guy calls himself the king

425
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,460
Enjoy such luxuries every day?

426
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,180
Prosecutor Yin, please show some respect to His Majesty

427
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,720
No problem

428
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,070
You lost your memory

429
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,400
But that helps you become

430
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,030
The talents of famous scholars and top scholars should still be there

431
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,870
A Plan for the Reform of National Slavery
It has been prepared during your absence.

432
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,370
Please give some advice after reading this.

433
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,050
He saw you drive away the one-legged ghost

434
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,890
That's why I brought you here

435
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,970
I want you to expel the eight-foot demon for the prince.

436
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,060
That fucking thing

437
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,400
Clearly a vicious god.

438
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,900
You fell into his trap.

439
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,820
He took advantage of you

440
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,700
How dare you slander my master with your clever words?

441
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,200
Stop dreaming.

442
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,080
I don't believe a word you say.

443
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,960
You must revive the master first.

444
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,080
Again…

445
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,050
Ask in person

446
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,360
Why do you...

447
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,410
Are you making fun of me?
What kind of ridiculous nonsense is this?

448
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,540
Yin Jianxiao is cautious in his words

449
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,330
You want to abolish slavery?

450
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,540
This is ridiculous.

451
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,500
This is the fate of mankind.

452
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,840
They are nothing in my eyes

453
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,630
But they insist on dividing themselves into high and low

454
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,760
No one lives past a hundred.

455
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,430
Some died prematurely due to overeating

456
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,260
Some starved to death

457
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,010
Never changed in thousands of years

458
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,520
This damn...

459
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,110
Now you are relying on your status as a "king"

460
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,690
Regardless of the nature of these people

461
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:01,070
I just want to scold them: "Stop it, this is evil."

462
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,490
Do you still expect them to kowtow and say "we will obey the imperial edict"?

463
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,450
Life is short, why waste your energy?

464
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,250
Yeah, you're right.

465
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,590
This is indeed human nature.

466
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,090
That's why I want to be their king

467
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,640
If I can teach people with the truth and benevolence

468
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,310
Leading the people to good

469
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:29,270
Human greed can be suppressed

470
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,310
There will finally be a peaceful and prosperous era...

471
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,940
Do you really think this is possible?

472
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,860
That's totally against human nature.

473
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:45,070
I have observed for thousands of years and have never seen it

474
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,120
so

475
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,910
What you said is just a foolish dream

476
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,000
You...

477
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:07,760
That damn...

478
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,060
Why!

479
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,360
The source of Hachikage's hatred is not in him.

480
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,780
It existed long before him

481
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:29,620
But…

482
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,870
Why he

483
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,460
Can you completely avoid his wrath?

484
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,090
What do you think?

485
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,970
I mean the matter of Yin Jia

486
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,640
His Majesty

487
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,980
According to the slaves’ observation…

488
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,480
What the Minister of Military Affairs said is absolutely true

489
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,270
He is not amnesiac

490
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,940
But completely crazy

491
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,740
The top scholar you valued has long since disappeared

492
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:10,740
Now I am just a fool who doesn't know etiquette.

493
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,290
He is not a fool

494
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,460
What?

495
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,960
Although he behaved in a rude manner

496
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,380
But the insight into the nature of human nature

497
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,430
But sharp as a knife

498
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,050
That is why the noble ideal that I am pursuing now

499
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,810
For some people

500
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,560
More dangerous than a murder knife

501
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,110
The problem is

502
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,400
After losing memory

503
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,410
Has his personality changed?

504
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,710
His Majesty

505
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,260
This is…

506
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,760
I have decided to abolish official slavery forever

507
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,760
Although this reform began with government slaves

508
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,600
But given time

509
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,640
Should be gradually extended to the general public

510
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,190
how?

511
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:25,480
Even you...

512
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,150
Do you also think this idea is ridiculous?

513
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,240
Would you also say this is wishful thinking?

514
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,040
Why are you crying?

515
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,260
I am a bastard...

516
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,470
I have had a rough life since I was young, with no hope

517
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,600
Your Majesty saved me.

518
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,100
I am willing to be the fuel that starts the fire.

519
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:02,310
Help Your Majesty to accomplish this goal

520
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,150
He is totally different now.

521
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,320
Yin Jia knows too much

522
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,620
Never let it go

523
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,790
Close monitoring is required

524
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:53,280
The God of War has taken up residence in the body of the Crown Prince

525
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:57,330
The prince's life hangs by a thread

526
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,160
But what happened yesterday?

527
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,960
What went wrong?

528
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,750
Since that incident 13 years ago

529
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,840
I've never seen him so out of control.

530
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,590
This is an ominous sign

531
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:16,220
Is there someone else in the palace?

532
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:39,540
Success or failure is still unknown

533
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:17,700
But I will never give up on Master Yin Jia

534
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:05,410
I will use my body as bait to summon the eight-foot ghost

535
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:25,140
How? Why?

536
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,520
How could this be?

537
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,190
How could this be! How could this be?

538
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:32,860
Why is this lens missing a piece?

539
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,070
Where did the mirror maker go?

540
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:39,070
Destroy this precious thing in an instant

541
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,410
But she disappeared?

542
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:42,490
Bring the person here immediately!

543
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:44,370
That girl...

544
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:45,370
What?

545
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,120
I haven't seen her for a while.

546
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,210
What did you say?

547
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,590
She's also the one who gives me a headache

548
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,840
She always runs away when she gets the chance.

549
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,090
It will only provoke the devil

550
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:01,590
Always asking about her whereabouts

551
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,180
What are you mumbling about? Speak back loudly!

552
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:10,310
So! Are you saying she was out all day?

553
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,770
That little girl...

554
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,900
So

555
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,110
You mean Ruli hasn't come back yet?

556
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,410
This kid...

557
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:27,290
I also said that she was particularly attentive today...

558
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:29,450
How dare she bully me?

559
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:33,460
No adults, I mean...

560
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,920
Get out of the way

561
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,590
How dare you...

562
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,680
Use your cheap feet without hesitation

563
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,840
Kick towards the imperial chariot?

564
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,760
fed up

565
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,810
Amnesia or madness

566
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:52,140
I have to punish you until you wake up.

567
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,230
Come here you bastard

568
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:58,190
My Lord! No!

569
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,570
Get out of my way

570
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,070
Take my move!

571
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,660
grown ups!

572
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,030
Ruli you...

573
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,040
Wait till I catch you

574
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,500
From now on

575
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,080
I stick to you like a piece of candy

576
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,920
I told you to stop.

577
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,510
Ouch

578
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:40,980
I offer this ownerless body to you, the former God.

579
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:09,510
I said get out!

580
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,770
Your Highness, please regain your sanity.

581
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:14,980
It's time to change your clothes, Your Highness.

582
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,350
I have worn this dress for three days.

583
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,650
I've clearly expressed my displeasure

584
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:20,980
You are still entangled!

585
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,610
Your Highness

586
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:30,910
ring…

587
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,660
I heard the bell ringing

588
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:38,880
What?

589
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,790
A bunch of idiots

590
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,170
Can't you hear this beautiful ringing sound?

591
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,880
It's calling me!

592
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:05,530
Ruli

593
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:16,830
Disciple Wish

594
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,960
We sincerely serve you

595
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,540
Please grant me a vision of God

596
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:25,340
I'm right here

597
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,800
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

598
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,340
Wait, Your Highness!

599
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:37,810
What's the matter?

600
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:43,570
What are you all standing there for?

601
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:44,980
-past
-yes

602
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,450
Wait for the light

603
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,580
Guang Er

604
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,580
Guanger!

605
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:09,050
Your Majesty, I deserve death.

606
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:14,390
How dare she steal the king's most prized glasses?

607
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,810
What a bold girl!

608
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,020
Your Majesty, I deserve death.

609
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,020
But it was the lens that corrected my vision...

610
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,610
His Majesty

611
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,620
The king went to the palace and asked for an audience with the lady-in-waiting of Wu

612
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,120
What's the matter?

613
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,250
Could it be that something happened to the prince again?

614
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:42,870
His Majesty

615
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,460
His Highness ran out of the palace

616
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:48,710
What did you say?

617
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,010
How could you let this happen?

618
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,070
It must be you

619
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,130
You summoned me?

620
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,220
He was just a little kid.

621
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,930
What a shameless evil spirit!

622
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:44,350
I'm asking if you summoned me.

623
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:48,360
My little god.

624
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,480
Always longing to serve

625
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,280
Powerful God

626
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,450
If you are willing to accept me as my patron saint

627
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:57,410
I will worship sincerely

628
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,430
It's rare to have such qualifications as yours.

629
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,970
Your spiritual power is better than that noisy and mean guy

630
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:26,140
Much more tempting

631
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,270
Noisy and lowly people?

632
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,150
Who could it be?

633
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,900
So are you willing to accept me as your follower?

634
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,700
I do

635
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:42,580
Then let's have some fun together.

636
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,010
If you want to save Lord Yin's soul

637
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,810
You must first drive the eight-foot ghost out of this body

638
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,220
What are you doing?

639
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,180
He caught

640
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,100
What a cunning little apprentice!

641
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,050
Who are you?

642
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:21,680
Who are you...

643
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:25,640
What deep hatred could cause one to act like this?

644
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,600
My life is over

645
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:49,660
Are you okay?

646
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:13,900
How dare you attack His Highness?

647
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,730
Why don’t you retreat immediately!

648
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,740
You crazy lunatic!

649
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:23,360
Stop it! No trespassing here!

650
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:25,990
His Majesty

651
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:29,200
For the safety of His Highness, please...

652
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,640
Guanger!

653
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,680
Don't do stupid things

654
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,770
Do you know that the blade in my hand has no eyes?

655
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:52,600
-You traitor!
-Your Highness!

656
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:55,060
Do you think I don't dare?

657
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,650
Do you think I will do this because he is the heir to the throne?

658
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:00,570
Are you afraid to take any action?

659
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,070
Obey sir!

660
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,210
No one is allowed to move rashly

661
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:20,000
Ruli

662
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:49,570
The Holy God can judge good from evil and ward off evil spirits.

663
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,540
Please send down your divine power to suppress the evil spirits

664
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,580
The Holy God can judge good from evil and ward off evil spirits.

665
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,290
Please send down your divine power to suppress the evil spirits

666
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,610
May your mind be at peace and your body be at peace

667
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:24,030
Follow the principles of the 100 classics and act as if the law were in force

668
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,790
Guang'er! Are you okay?

669
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,270
The eight-foot ghost escaped.

670
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,690
Guanger!

671
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:12,010
Something is wrong

672
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:13,760
I didn't see anything

673
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,550
I block the four directions with the rope of the barrier

674
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,600
He can't escape.

675
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,020
Boundary rope...

676
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:28,360
Cut off

677
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:29,940
What?

678
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:38,490
That eight-foot ghost...

679
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:51,340
His Majesty

680
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:59,390
He is there

681
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:00,930
Eight-foot ghost

682
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:39,430
Why is he so powerful?

683
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:42,220
What did I look like when I drew my sword just now?

684
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:44,480
Two different people

685
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,560
You are not Yin Jia

686
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,770
Who are you?

687
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:49,230
I would like to give my body to you

688
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:50,980
Please save Lord Yin Jia

689
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,940
You want me to face him again?

690
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:54,820
Aren’t you afraid of that eight-foot ghost?

691
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,030
I need a magic weapon. I'm going to see Master Jiaso.

692
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:00,530
How can a mortal body have such spiritual power?

693
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:02,700
You are not human

694
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:06,120
It seems that she took the opportunity to perform another ritual.

695
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,620
Expel these two people from the capital immediately!

696
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:13,710
