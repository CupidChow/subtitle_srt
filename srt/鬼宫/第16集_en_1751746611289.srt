1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,420
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,800
Step back, all of you.

4
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,010
I will take care of this Imugi myself.

5
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,720
Move it!

6
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,350
WATER

7
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Get him!

8
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,050
Noble Elder.

9
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,390
I offer you my congratulations
on reclaiming the shrine.

10
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,640
But my lord…

11
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,390
that damn Imugi managed to get away

12
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,390
and I hear the Warrior Deity…

13
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,440
I mean, His Majesty is quite enraged.

14
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,400
They bolted in a panic.

15
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,780
What could they possibly manage
to do now anyway?

16
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,200
The whole nation

17
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,450
is in the palm of the Warrior Deity.

18
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,850
Gangcheori.

19
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,850
It is cold. Why are you out?

20
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,520
I am going to do
a quick sweep of the area.

21
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,740
Let's go inside.

22
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
Your Highness.

23
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,250
Please try to have a spoonful.

24
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,600
Examiner Yoon Gap, what happens to us now?

25
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,600
Must we continue running from Father
who remains possessed by an evil spirit?

26
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,940
Answer me.

27
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,990
Your Highness.

28
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,450
We will figure out a method soon.

29
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,990
Please do not worry too much.

30
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,050
But, little boy,

31
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,050
why are you still so short?

32
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,760
You should eat more.

33
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,310
Do not worry.

34
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,470
You will return to the palace soon enough

35
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,440
and I will save your father
from that ghost.

36
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Do you mean it?

37
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,570
Of course.

38
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,490
Then, you should eat up now,
Your Highness.

39
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,040
What is the matter?

40
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,380
You…

41
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,340
What are you planning to do?

42
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
What do you mean?

43
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,680
This.

44
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,180
You consumed this caragana as tea,
did you not?

45
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,390
I know.

46
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,270
You need this flower
to wholly drain the luminous pearl.

47
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,150
I already told you.

48
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,400
You are an Imugi,

49
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,780
and this fight was not yours
from the start.

50
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,740
Then, you just want to do nothing
and wait for them to attack?

51
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,120
You know that the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
is after you as well.

52
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,290
A while ago, you asked me…

53
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,630
to run away with you.

54
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,880
Let us do that.

55
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,140
Do you mean it?

56
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,890
I cannot do this anymore.

57
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,890
I cannot continue to face
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

58
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,020
I wanted to see it through
for my grandma's sake,

59
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,310
but I am nowhere strong enough.

60
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,110
Do you expect me to believe that?

61
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,280
I have been by your side
for all these years.

62
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,160
Even after you rejected your shaman fate,

63
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,910
you could not help but aid
every wandering spirit you came across.

64
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,910
But now,

65
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,250
you suggest we turn our backs
on the King and Prince in peril…

66
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,210
and just run away?

67
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,880
The thought of the King, the Prince,

68
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,470
and even the late Queen breaks my heart…

69
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,310
but you are the most important to me.

70
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,980
I am terrified

71
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,900
something might happen to you

72
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,570
to make you end up like Bibi.

73
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,990
If something happened to you,

74
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,110
I would not be able to continue living.

75
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,680
Even if we run away,

76
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,050
he will continue coming after us.

77
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,930
I told you.

78
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,430
My longtime wish…

79
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,850
is to live an ordinary life
with the warmth of another.

80
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,270
I want to live that life with you.

81
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,940
Even if it is just for a few days.

82
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,490
So, Gangcheori…

83
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,990
Please…

84
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,170
A harsh road lies ahead of us,
but we must take the baby Prince along.

85
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,430
He will be devoured by the ghost
if we leave him behind.

86
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,600
All right. Let us do that.

87
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,930
Your mother. We must take her as well.

88
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,140
All right. I shall go and get her now.

89
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,530
Is there anything you want from the house?

90
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,530
How about Neop-deok's ritual robe?

91
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,080
I am in no place

92
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,330
to look after her robe
when I am on the run.

93
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,500
I just need you and your mother
to return safely.

94
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,090
I will be back in no time.

95
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,620
Yeo-ri.

96
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,210
How are you back in the palace?

97
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,380
What about His Highness? Is he all right?

98
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,590
Yes, he is safe.

99
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,880
What are we to do?

100
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,220
Chaos is afoot in the palace.

101
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,100
It is still His Majesty's body
and we cannot refuse him,

102
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,640
but his actions
are clearly led by the ghost.

103
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,110
This Eight-foot-tall Ghost is
about to devour everything in its wake.

104
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,360
Before that happens,

105
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,820
I shall finish him.

106
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,910
You will?

107
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,580
Where is Imugi Gangcheori?

108
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,490
I will be able to do it on my own.

109
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,290
As long as you help me, my lord.

110
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,290
What? Me?

111
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,100
My goodness. Why are you here?

112
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,350
The state troops just barged in here,
looking for you.

113
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,020
You need to flee now.
You are not hurt? Yeo-ri is fine as well?

114
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,140
Run away now.

115
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,270
We must leave at once. Pack lightly.

116
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,570
Is Yeo-ri inside?

117
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,660
The thing is…

118
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,500
Yeo-ri.

119
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,260
Where is Yeo-ri?

120
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,930
She said she and Court Lady Oh
had to step out for a moment.

121
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,850
She wanted you to wait for her here.

122
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,180
What sort of nonsense…

123
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,410
ASCENSION OF GANGCHEORI

124
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,330
<i>It might be granted if I wish hard enough.</i>

125
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,750
<i>The Big Dipper up there might.</i>

126
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,390
Tell me the truth.

127
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,180
Yeo-ri…

128
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,220
Where did she go?

129
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,680
The palace.

130
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,230
She went to the palace.

131
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,990
She said she knew of a method
and that you would only get in the way.

132
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,200
She told me to keep it secret.

133
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,790
Hold on.

134
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,830
Where are you off to now?

135
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,830
I am going to get Yeo-ri. You stay here.

136
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,670
Then, you will get her

137
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,290
and come back together, right?

138
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,130
Why are you not answering me? Well?

139
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,550
I am off.

140
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,770
He will be back.

141
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,360
He will be back with Yeo-ri.

142
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,570
<i>I tried to honor your wishes.</i>

143
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,900
<i>How could you…</i>

144
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,070
I told you.

145
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,780
My longtime wish…

146
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,290
is to live an ordinary life
with the warmth of another.

147
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,170
I want to live that life with you.

148
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,290
Even if it is just for a few days.

149
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,800
So, Gangcheori…

150
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,550
Please…

151
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,050
<i>You must be safe.</i>

152
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,640
<i>If you are not,</i>

153
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,680
<i>I will never forgive you.</i>

154
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,670
<i>My wish to live</i>

155
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,930
<i>an ordinary life filled</i>
<i>with the warmth of another…</i>

156
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,760
<i>was already granted.</i>

157
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,640
<i>Thanks to you, Gangcheori.</i>

158
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,110
<i>I did not lie to you.</i>

159
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,940
<i>I truly did want</i>

160
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,490
<i>to run away with you.</i>

161
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,240
<i>I am sorry, Gangcheori.</i>

162
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,370
<i>I did not keep my promise.</i>

163
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,700
<i>I am truly sorry.</i>

164
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,290
<i>Sorry…</i>

165
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,400
Pung-san should be on his way
back to his shrine by now.

166
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,190
I hear the Eight-foot-tall Ghost Majesty

167
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,530
does not let anyone into his chambers.

168
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,080
So, he should be alone right now.

169
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,540
Yes, my lord.

170
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,300
Are you all right, my lord?

171
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,300
I realized after tonight,

172
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,760
we might all end up dead.

173
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,390
It is making my knees grow weak.

174
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,860
Forgive me.

175
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,860
I brought this about…

176
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,860
No. How could you be to blame?

177
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,570
I have sworn an oath to always be ready
to give my life for His Majesty.

178
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,660
I, too, can no longer stand by

179
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,660
as that dirty, evil spirit continues
to occupy His Majesty's body.

180
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,330
Let us go.

181
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,350
Sang-deuk.

182
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,810
You cannot, my lord.

183
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,230
His Majesty forbade all from entering.

184
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,310
I know that,

185
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,150
but I have an urgent matter
that I must discuss with him.

186
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,740
I have acquired new intel on the Imugi
His Majesty is searching for.

187
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:26,580
You can tell me.

188
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,330
I will pass it along to His Majesty.

189
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:34,290
Well… this is something
I should personally deliver.

190
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,380
What is that?

191
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,630
Oh, that?
Some sweets that His Majesty enjoys…

192
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,180
And <i>sikhye</i>. That is all.

193
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,690
- Who are you?
- Are you not--

194
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,820
Step back.

195
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,490
Your Majesty.

196
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,760
Why that--

197
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,380
Take that.

198
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,890
Yeo-ri.

199
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,180
This is your chance.

200
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,370
You…

201
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,960
I am here, under the command
of the Ten Kings of the Underworld,

202
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,960
hurled forth like an arrow unleashed
through the path curved like a bow,

203
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,510
to escort you,
Cheon Geum-hwi of the Wood Dragon Year,

204
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,180
to the afterlife in merciless chains.

205
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,850
Follow without protest.

206
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,560
You wench.

207
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,980
How have you embodied the Fire Reaper?

208
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,730
FIRE REAPER: A GRIM REAPER THAT GUIDES
SOULS BURNED TO DEATH TO THE AFTERLIFE

209
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,370
What?

210
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,030
The Fire Reaper?

211
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
The Fire Reaper commands you,
born on the Fire Boar Day

212
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,370
of the Wood Boar Month,
in the Wood Dragon Year.

213
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,830
Cheon Geum-hwi shall follow
without protest.

214
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,300
I shall…

215
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,550
drag you to the afterlife!

216
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,870
What in the world are you?

217
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,210
How could some little brat
possess such power?

218
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,000
How do you wield power
over the Fire Reaper?

219
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,670
Unbridled rage brings forth
a fiery demise.

220
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,550
Unbridled rage brings forth
a fiery demise.

221
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,020
On this quiet day, with this prayer,
Vengeful Ghost Cheon Geum-hwi

222
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,810
shall follow the Fire Reaper
under the command of King Jingwang,

223
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,940
without protest.

224
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,150
The blades of
the Serrated Mountain of the Damned

225
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,900
shall bring reckoning upon your sins!

226
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,240
Se-won. You must hurry.

227
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,330
Now!

228
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,690
My goodness. The Warrior Deity
will be dragged in at this rate.

229
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,400
How is this possible?

230
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,520
Even her grandmother could not.

231
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,110
How did that fledgling wench manage that?

232
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,070
Great scornful Warrior Deity,

233
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,660
borne of grievance from a sea of blood,
with divine power and aid,

234
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,750
fueled by the might of his bitter grudge,

235
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,210
his thousand years of devoted wailing!

236
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,440
Warrior Deity!

237
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,090
You possess remarkable talent
for such a young wench.

238
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,050
After all your relentless interference,

239
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,260
I have wanted to shred you to pieces.

240
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,470
And here you are, of your own accord.

241
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,390
It would be a waste
of such spiritual energy,

242
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,610
but I will only find peace
after I kill you, wench.

243
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,710
Yeo-ri!

244
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,190
You cannot.

245
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,150
Do not do it, Gangcheori.

246
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,360
How could you…

247
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,570
Just leave.

248
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,280
Please leave.

249
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:01,990
Please.

250
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,620
You were wrong.

251
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,660
If you depart first,

252
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,210
how am I to endure
all those long years without you?

253
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,460
You cannot, Gangcheori.

254
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Please…

255
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:04,970
Gangcheori.

256
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,850
Damn wicked spirit.

257
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,100
You are right.

258
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,730
I am a maliciously evil spirit,
as you say.

259
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,440
But what does that make you?

260
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,990
What did you say?

261
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,280
A deity?

262
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,410
Did you call yourself a deity?

263
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,790
That gruesome night, 100 years ago,

264
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,460
as my kin and fellow villagers met

265
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,460
their tragic deaths, I cried out

266
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,840
a hundred,

267
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,510
a thousand times…

268
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,760
for anyone to help us.

269
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,760
I silently screamed out to the heavens.

270
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,310
However, you only ever cared
about your ascension.

271
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,900
Despite the mighty power you held,

272
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,860
you could not care less about us.

273
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,110
A deity…

274
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,660
You dare call yourself a deity?

275
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,790
I have no use for such deities.

276
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,790
I will be sure to end you myself!

277
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,700
Gangcheori.

278
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,670
No…

279
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,560
Gangcheori…

280
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,070
No!

281
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,090
Yes.

282
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,470
You are right.

283
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,810
Even with my divine powers…

284
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,640
I failed to save you all.

285
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,230
Thus…

286
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,280
I shall save you now.

287
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,240
No…

288
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,460
No!

289
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,720
The Warrior Deity…

290
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:41,970
has disappeared.

291
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,520
The Warrior Deity…

292
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,770
is gone.

293
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:57,110
The Warrior Deity!

294
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,890
Gangcheori!

295
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,560
Gangcheori!

296
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,890
Gangcheori!

297
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,850
Gangcheori!

298
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,820
No…

299
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,730
Gangcheori, no!

300
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,320
No… Gangcheori!

301
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,530
SPIRIT TABLET
OF THE LATE CHEON GEUM-HWI

302
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,280
CHEON GEUM-HWI

303
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,290
<i>The Paper Dance…</i>

304
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,630
<i>Symbolic paper money is offered</i>
<i>to the spirit of the deceased</i>

305
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,420
<i>to pray for the appeasement</i>
<i>of its unresolved grudge in this world</i>

306
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,590
<i>and for it to find passage</i>

307
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,630
<i>to eternal peace.</i>

308
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,100
<i>Furthermore,</i>

309
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,560
<i>it lights a lantern for the deceased</i>

310
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,600
<i>to show them the way.</i>

311
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,560
Cheon Geum-hwi…

312
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,560
Cheon Geum-hwi?

313
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,940
Is he with us now?

314
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,810
Yes…

315
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,150
Cheon Geum-hwi…

316
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,280
and the villagers of Yongdam are here.

317
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,150
I…

318
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,950
I saw everything.

319
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,160
I saw for myself why your grudge…

320
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,120
runs so deep.

321
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,420
The sins of my ancestor are grave.

322
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,880
Furthermore, my sin…

323
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,010
of ignorance is also quite grave.

324
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,720
I will never forget what sort of bloodshed

325
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,390
ensured the royal throne I sit on now…

326
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,690
not even for a moment…

327
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,730
until the day I die.

328
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,990
I will devote all of myself…

329
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,040
to ensure there is never another subject…

330
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,290
with a blood-wrought grudge like yours.

331
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,670
I offer you all

332
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,720
my sincerest plea for forgiveness.

333
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,260
For many long years…

334
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,930
I abhorred your bloodline.

335
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,100
The resentment of those
who died because of me

336
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,930
grew deeper by the day…

337
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,810
and the painful guilt
that weighed heavily on me

338
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,230
made avoiding
further bloodshed impossible.

339
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,860
However,

340
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,110
with a few measly words…

341
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,160
I feel as light as air.

342
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,920
How hollow it feels.

343
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,000
So very hollow…

344
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,670
Just…

345
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,880
a few measly tears…

346
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,470
was all it took.

347
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,660
An Imugi without a luminous pearl…

348
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,700
just disappears, right?

349
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,710
Gangcheori will now…

350
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,750
cease to exist in this world.

351
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,960
Yeo-ri.

352
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,930
<i>You feared you could not endure</i>
<i>the long years without me?</i>

353
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,100
<i>Rotten jerk.</i>

354
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,680
<i>Then, what about me?</i>

355
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,640
<i>How am I to survive without you?</i>

356
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,940
Yeo-ri.

357
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,440
My heart aches as well.

358
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,610
However…

359
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,860
I cannot help but think

360
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,990
that all of this was
the will of the heavens.

361
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,280
Perhaps, when the King
abandoned his people

362
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:50,120
and the Way of Heaven
collapsed to the ground,

363
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,960
the heavens sent the ascending dragon
back to the earth

364
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,800
in order for it to save

365
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,090
the poor people of Yongdam Village.

366
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,890
There is a chance that was

367
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,140
Gangcheori's purpose
in the world from the start.

368
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,060
What are you talking about?

369
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,060
Are you saying they were determined

370
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:21,570
to kill my son
to save others from the start?

371
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,990
What sort of wretched will
of heaven is that?

372
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,950
May Avalokitesvara show us mercy.

373
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:31,830
If you can kill my child twice
in the name of heavens' will,

374
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,540
bring him back.

375
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,880
Bring my child back to me!

376
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,340
May Avalokitesvara show us mercy.

377
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,970
My poor boy…

378
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,050
Gap…

379
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:56,270
My poor boy… Bring him back to me.

380
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,660
You will achieve
that noble pursuit you seek.

381
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,160
After all,

382
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,370
you are one of those mortals…

383
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,630
I come across occasionally.

384
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,600
You must have known, my Queen.

385
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,350
How much affection I had

386
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,520
for that brazen Imugi…

387
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:44,150
<i>You knew that every time I was</i>
<i>with that disdainfully haughty fellow,</i>

388
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,780
<i>funnily enough,</i>

389
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,780
<i>it felt like I had made</i>

390
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:52,490
my first companion in life.

391
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

392
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,260
I know all too well.

393
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,640
You are the strongest,

394
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:14,180
but you are also lonely
and the most gentle-spirited.

395
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:16,520
I…

396
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,440
was so very happy

397
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,900
to live as your maiden.

398
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,110
Please let go

399
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,200
of all your painful memories

400
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,490
and I hope…

401
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:34,580
I hope…

402
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,250
you find happiness.

403
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,470
My Queen…

404
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,590
Grandma.

405
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:28,760
Grandma!

406
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,680
Yes, my child. It is me.

407
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,800
My dear child.

408
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:35,890
Grandma…

409
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,730
You have…

410
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,520
been through so much.

411
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,770
How weary it must have been.

412
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,360
Thanks to you,

413
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,990
I was able to escape
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

414
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,240
and make my way here.

415
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,620
You have done well.

416
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,830
Well done.

417
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,590
Grandma, I…

418
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,340
To get here…

419
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,300
Gangcheori…

420
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,890
Gangcheori…

421
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:20,520
Yes.

422
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,480
I know.

423
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,440
I know.

424
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,280
Yes, Yeo-ri.

425
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,820
Cry.

426
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,110
Cry as much as you want.

427
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:40,200
Cry as much as it takes

428
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,500
to soothe that sorrow.

429
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,250
Without experiencing it for yourself,

430
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,300
how will you ever understand

431
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,880
the sorrow of countless others?

432
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,540
Yeo-ri.

433
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:31,460
It is time for me to go now.

434
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:34,880
You're leaving already?

435
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,640
Do not worry, Yeo-ri.

436
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,470
I will always

437
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,060
watch over you.

438
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:48,600
You must stay strong

439
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,270
and keep going with courage.

440
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:45,410
Noble Elder.

441
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,290
This way. Come this way.

442
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,130
This way.

443
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,590
Here. You can sit down.

444
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,180
Noble Elder, what do we do now?

445
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,760
We do not even have the Warrior Deity
watching over us now.

446
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,060
It feels like we are just sitting ducks.

447
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,520
It will be more dangerous
for us to stay together.

448
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,360
You should go back the way we came.

449
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,360
We will meet up at the tavern
outside the capital. All right?

450
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,240
But it was already crawling
with state troops.

451
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,160
They will not circle back.

452
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,370
But still… I think that is a bad idea.

453
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:30,580
How dare you.

454
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,170
Do you doubt me?

455
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,300
No, I do not.

456
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,420
All right.

457
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,010
Then, we will

458
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,890
reunite a little bit later.

459
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:45,970
All right.

460
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:52,690
- Stop!
- Get him!

461
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,980
What do you want? I do not know anything!

462
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,440
Noble Elder!

463
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,960
The Yapper…

464
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,210
cannot die like this.

465
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,840
I will find another great deity to serve.

466
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,180
If I attach myself to a powerful one,

467
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,890
it will be a breeze.

468
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:29,810
I need to get up.

469
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:33,390
<i>I promise you this.</i>

470
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,770
You will end up suffering
the most excruciatingly painful death.

471
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,940
Why…

472
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:42,490
that damn…

473
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,490
wretched Imugi…

474
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:23,610
<i>We wait three days to place</i>
<i>the body in the casket to be buried.</i>

475
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,570
<i>It is because the living</i>

476
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,990
<i>foolishly and piteously hope</i>

477
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,120
<i>the dead will come back to life</i>
<i>within that time.</i>

478
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,930
<i>Three days had passed,</i>

479
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,770
<i>but Gangcheori…</i>

480
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,020
<i>did not wake up.</i>

481
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:16,830
My goodness…

482
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,090
Why…

483
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,400
Why…

484
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:51,530
Gap…

485
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,700
My goodness!

486
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:55,990
What the?

487
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,120
What is that?

488
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,760
What is all this?

489
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,130
What is wrong with you?
You almost suffocated me to death.

490
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,800
Do not just stand there.
Come here and untie me.

491
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,470
You…

492
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,770
Yes, it is me.
Your sacred patron deity. Gangcheori.

493
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:32,610
Oh my!

494
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,240
My goodness…

495
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,160
My goodness.

496
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,210
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

497
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,720
A total of 160 volumes of slave registers
were gathered from the inner offices,

498
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,010
palace quarters,
and the official residences.

499
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:57,760
Furthermore, in those volumes,

500
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:01,520
a total of 36,974 slaves were recorded.

501
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,270
Have them burn

502
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,230
all the records
discovered near Donhwa Gate.

503
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,610
Yes, Your Majesty, I shall.

504
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:11,900
Does the Crown Prince understand

505
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:15,160
the true intentions behind my pursuit?

506
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

507
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,790
You wish to reform the slave system

508
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:23,460
because you do not wish to see
another subject

509
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,460
end up with a blood-wrought grudge,
is it not?

510
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,380
Your Highness.

511
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,340
You speak such truly wise words.

512
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,640
You do not want to go?

513
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,440
Her Grace is making a sincere plea
for forgiveness for what her son had done.

514
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:52,780
We even prepared all this.

515
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,650
What exactly is the issue?

516
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,030
There is no issue.

517
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,370
Then, what is it?

518
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,700
I want…

519
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,790
- to spend more time with you before I go.
- What?

520
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:08,630
- Is something wrong?
- No, Your Grace.

521
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:11,840
It seems her grudge
has been appeased, but…

522
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,470
there are spirits who take a bit longer
to cross the River of the Afterlife.

523
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:27,020
You do not need to continue…

524
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,150
Get back in there.

525
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,620
I replaced the cracked corrective lens.

526
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:58,260
They are perfect.

527
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:01,550
Let me see here…

528
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,560
A token of my appreciation.

529
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,650
No, Your Excellency.

530
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:12,150
We would not be here
if it were not for you.

531
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:14,480
Consider this a repayment
for your kindness.

532
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:15,740
Kindness?

533
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,990
I paid back a little of the moral debt
I owed His Majesty, thanks to you.

534
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,120
Then…

535
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:26,830
how about this, instead?

536
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,250
I shall spread word

537
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,920
about how amazing these glasses are
to the nobility of Bukchon.

538
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,130
Yes, please do.

539
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:52,360
My word. How incredibly natural of you.

540
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,400
Just call for her
if you want to say something.

541
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,650
It's freezing…

542
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:17,550
Help yourself.

543
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,430
You got yourself another ring.

544
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,140
You mean this?

545
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,980
His Lord got me another.

546
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,270
We are to wed soon.

547
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,360
You…

548
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,530
You picked up that teacup
like that on purpose to brag, did you not?

549
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,330
It is a talisman for destined love.

550
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:49,250
It will help you find a kindred soul
to share the next 100 years with.

551
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,630
Does that really work?

552
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,630
You do not have to believe me.

553
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,460
When?

554
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:00,510
When did I say I did not?

555
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,300
By the way…

556
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:13,350
is there no talisman that would help me
meet someone handsome?

557
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,150
I do not need this 100-year business.

558
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:18,480
I care more about looks.

559
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:20,820
Pardon?

560
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,290
Wait,

561
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:37,590
so you really met the Heavenly Sovereign?

562
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:39,210
How many times must I repeat it?

563
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,220
He must have felt a bit guilty,
after putting me through that hell.

564
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,550
So, that is why
he brought you back to life?

565
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,430
The Heavenly Sovereign up there did?

566
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:50,310
He summoned me and asked,

567
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,020
"Do you want to ascend as a dragon

568
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,980
or do you want to go live
amongst the mortals once more?"

569
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,400
He told me to choose.

570
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,480
Thus,

571
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:00,730
you chose to live with us?

572
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:01,860
"Us"?

573
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,280
Certainly not for you.

574
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,660
I came back to live with Yeo-ri.

575
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,660
- Why you… It is still His Majesty.
- Watch yourself.

576
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,830
Let it go.

577
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,620
Regardless, I am quite thankful.

578
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:18,000
If I am being honest,
after you left like that, I felt…

579
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:22,840
Goodness.
Who am I even speaking to right now?

580
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:25,630
This is important. How could you…

581
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,970
Listen, you should not wear

582
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,890
glasses in front of your superior.

583
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:34,310
His Majesty, no less. Take them off.

584
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:35,390
Hold on.

585
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,980
Who could be my superior here?

586
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,060
Watch it.

587
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,940
I did not know you owned colored glasses.

588
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:44,650
Yeo-ri made me a pair.
Basically, a wedding gift.

589
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,030
- I am off.
- All right.

590
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,990
Hey! Where are you going?

591
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:52,580
We are not here to have fun.

592
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:56,460
We came to secretly observe
the living conditions of the people…

593
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,380
Who am I speaking to now?

594
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:01,960
I have been listening, Your Majesty.

595
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:03,250
Why that…

596
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:10,760
I believe Gwang's favorite skewers
are sold over there.

597
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,640
Let us pick some up before we return.

598
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:14,930
Yes, Your Majesty.

599
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,100
This way.

600
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:26,070
Yeo-ri!

601
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:29,610
Do you have them on?

602
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:36,540
How pretty.

603
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:59,520
Such a good eater.

604
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,940
Are you a child?

605
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,730
Help yourself, Husband.

606
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,990
Come now. I am no ordinary husband.

607
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:11,160
I am the loftiest of husbands
and the most dignified patron deity.

608
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,040
- Is it good?
- Yes.

609
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,960
This will not do.

610
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,040
I let everything slide
because you were cute up until now.

611
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:27,510
I even let you sleep between
Yeo-ri and me every night…

612
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:30,760
You are old enough to be disciplined now.

613
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,800
It is time you know how scary

614
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,300
your father can be.

615
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:51,070
I hate you, Father! You're scary!

616
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,280
Stop it!

617
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:56,030
Why this rascal…

618
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:00,410
Stop it! I don't like it at all!

619
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,420
Enough!

620
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,050
Must you act like this at the table,
day in and day out? Pure chaos.

621
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:13,260
Let us eat.

622
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:16,720
I knew you would
finally get scolded today.

623
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:21,060
My goodness. What are you two pouting for?

624
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,640
Unbelievable.

625
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,610
The<i> sikhye</i> came out very well.

626
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,780
Let us all have a taste.

627
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,030
- That looks good.
- Yes.

628
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:31,990
Have a taste.

629
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,490
Go on.

630
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:39,580
Hear me, Examiner Yoon Gap
and Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri!

631
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,620
My goodness, look how you have grown!

632
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:46,080
Grilled Abalone!

633
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:48,670
Will you ever let that go?

634
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,250
Passing it down like a tradition…

635
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:54,380
Anyhow, His Majesty has summoned you two

636
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,930
to come to the palace immediately.

637
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:58,640
He summoned me as well?

638
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,310
- Yes.
- Did something happen at the palace?

639
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:08,310
I cannot go into details here,

640
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,400
but there has been
another strange incident at the palace.

641
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,360
Anyhow, His Majesty has summoned you both.

642
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:15,660
Just give me a moment.

643
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:18,740
What is the matter?

644
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:23,160
I must say something at this juncture
as the head of this household.

645
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,620
The line for glasses made by Yeo-ri,

646
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,670
the nation's top eyeglass artisan,

647
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:30,210
stretches far beyond the capital limits.

648
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:34,340
You are asking her to take time off
to clean up the King's mess.

649
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:37,130
It is only right
she is properly compensated.

650
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:40,140
Raising a child costs so much.

651
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,720
- Do you even know?
- Most certainly.

652
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:44,180
Well done.

653
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:47,730
That is true…

654
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:49,610
How much do you want?

655
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:51,150
As you well know,

656
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,610
officially, we are not allowed
to perform heretical ceremonies.

657
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,280
At least, ten pairs of glasses' worth.

658
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,160
Do not be like that.

659
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,410
Above all else,

660
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:03,490
I cannot just use
my Imugi powers on demand.

661
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,910
- Perhaps, 5,000 pieces of pumpkin taffy--
- Gosh.

662
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,250
Mother, can you look after Ga-won?

663
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:09,420
Sure. Come to Grandma, Ga-won.

664
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,500
Hold on.

665
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:13,960
Do not worry and go.

666
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,340
I am not done haggling.

667
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,050
Let us go, my lord.

668
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:19,390
All right.

669
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,640
Let us go!

670
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,510
I told you I was still haggling!

671
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,720
Come on.

672
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,520
Shall we?

673
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:28,870
