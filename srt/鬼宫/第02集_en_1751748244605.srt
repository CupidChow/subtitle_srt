1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
(This story is purely fictional)

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,420
(Filming of child actors and animals
All follow safety regulations)

3
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,820
Where am I?

4
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,320
Oh my god, you're awake.

5
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,700
Where am I?

6
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,830
Where? This is the palace.

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,290
In the palace?

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,420
How did I get here?

9
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,590
What about him?

10
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,590
What happened to the man I was with before?

11
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,260
He is receiving medical treatment but has not yet regained consciousness.

12
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,430
Don't move yet.

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,270
I'll get you some porridge.

14
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,130
grown ups?

15
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,840
No

16
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,390
Lying there is the river tide attached to the adult's body

17
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,930
This is my fault again.

18
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,950
I know Jiang Chaoli will not remain indifferent

19
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,450
But because of the desire to be with adults

20
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,450
Foolishly believed the omen

21
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:47,417
I just fooled myself into thinking everything was going to be alright

22
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,589
It's all my fault

23
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,465
My Lord, you are in this situation now because of me...

24
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,348
His Majesty has arrived!

25
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,690
What happened to Prosecutor Yin?

26
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,070
Didn't I tell you to keep a close eye on him?

27
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,110
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

28
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
He begged me to let him go somewhere

29
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,660
But he didn't show up at the agreed place.

30
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,870
I searched around and found him at the bottom of the cliff

31
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,870
Unconscious

32
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,670
Can he survive?

33
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,140
His life is safe for now, but his sword wound is very serious

34
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,800
Sword Wound

35
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,140
The sword pierced deeply

36
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,520
It's not easy to wake him up.

37
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,940
Could it be the work of bandits?

38
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,020
The sword wound was caused by a master swordsman.

39
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,980
We also found a few nearby

40
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,030
Man's footprints covered up in a hurry

41
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,620
Was he wounded by the sword?

42
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,450
No, it's not like that.

43
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,250
I didn't kill that guy.

44
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,330
Was he telling the truth?

45
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,960
Is it true that all this wasn't caused by Jiang Chao?

46
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,290
This person

47
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,840
This happened because you were doing something for me.

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,170
Heal at all costs

49
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,260
Yes, Your Majesty

50
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,090
He must survive

51
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,340
We will

52
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,010
Find the real culprit

53
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,350
Who is that woman?

54
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,770
We found this woman passed out beside him.

55
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,070
I brought her into the palace thinking maybe she could help

56
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,490
Identifying the Assassin Who Attacked Prosecutor Yoon

57
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,910
Can you see the person who hurt him?

58
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,240
I

59
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,450
Not seen

60
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,740
So you weren't with him at the time?

61
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,370
Yin Jianxiao injured his legs and feet, so I left for a short time

62
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,830
Find him a place to rest.

63
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,290
When he came back, he met with this accident.

64
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,050
We did have a look at his injured ankle.
Found a scrap of skirt

65
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,800
Why are you with him?

66
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,970
I am a mirror maker

67
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,770
Yin Jianxiao mentioned that His Majesty needed new glasses

68
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,480
We were on our way to the palace.

69
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,480
Mirror maker?

70
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,080
What did you say?

71
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,910
Yin Jia came back to life?

72
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,910
How ridiculous is this?

73
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,130
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

74
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,960
Yes, I can testify.

75
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,090
They said the cold body lying on the cart

76
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,430
Suddenly he jumped up and came back to life

77
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,390
- How come...
-That's not all.

78
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,930
His men tried to kill him again.

79
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,810
But he subdued her...

80
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,520
You expect me to believe this nonsense?

81
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,650
He is just a helpless nerd.

82
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,940
I know nothing about swordsmanship

83
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,860
Resurrection is ridiculous enough

84
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,530
What is going on?

85
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,610
What is going on?

86
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,700
They say the blind

87
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,000
Seeing what ordinary people cannot see

88
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,540
That's right

89
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,960
That was the monster from 13 years ago

90
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,170
That sickening stench...

91
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,970
How could I forget?

92
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,650
What should I do now?

93
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,320
Why remain silent?

94
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,620
Are you listening?

95
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,050
Concubine

96
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,560
I am as lowly as an ant, just a blind man

97
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,980
No need to separate with screens

98
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,310
I promise you

99
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,150
I can't see anything

100
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,120
Madam, what can I do for you?

101
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,080
Do you want to sit back and watch the prince become food for evil spirits?

102
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,210
To help Prince Yongin ascend the throne?

103
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,420
Or is it the Queen Mother?

104
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,390
Seems to be very painful

105
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,600
Why don't you just let me help you get rid of that evil spirit?

106
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,770
I…

107
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,480
I…

108
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,240
Yes, Queen Consort.

109
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,530
I know your thoughts very well.

110
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,790
Including those you don't even realize

111
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,470
I heard that the chief guard Xu Zaiyi sent Yin Jia to the Imperial Medical Bureau.

112
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,430
Before he wakes up

113
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,180
Get rid of him

114
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,180
If he wakes up

115
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,140
We're all screwed.

116
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,970
you…

117
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,360
What's going on?

118
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,780
Did it come from inside?

119
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,960
Ouch, what happened?

120
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,790
-What?
-Oh no, what happened?

121
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,290
Clean it up quickly

122
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,250
These precious medicinal herbs...

123
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,510
-Oh my god
- There are also

124
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,470
What should I do?

125
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,050
etc.

126
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,680
How do you...

127
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,930
Are you okay?

128
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,520
Do you know where you are now?

129
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,900
So uncomfortable

130
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,440
My eyelids feel like they are filled with lead

131
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,990
The body is also heavy

132
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,570
Look here, Prosecutor Yin!

133
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,740
Wake up!

134
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,830
I'm sore all over

135
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,750
Still itchy.

136
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,350
Why does it hurt so much?

137
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,100
You just caught a sword wound.

138
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,600
It will definitely hurt!

139
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,730
Really

140
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,850
Disinfect and re-bandage immediately!

141
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,060
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

142
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,010
This is just ordinary porridge.

143
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,260
What's this?

144
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,930
What's this alluring aroma?

145
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,720
Why don't you eat?

146
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,060
But the wound hurts?

147
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,550
What?

148
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,680
What's this?

149
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,260
What exactly was added here?

150
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,140
What do you mean?

151
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,140
It's just boiled rice

152
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,520
Only these two ingredients

153
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,980
Can it make your tongue leap with joy?

154
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,190
What?

155
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,070
It suits your taste

156
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,780
My taste...

157
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,700
taste…

158
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,550
Oh, I forgot that humans have five senses.

159
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,460
White porridge...

160
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,180
Touch, sight, smell, hearing
And this powerful taste

161
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,010
So even ordinary rice porridge

162
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,470
It can also make the human tongue dance with joy

163
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,370
What are you standing there for? Stop him!

164
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,040
I won't go! Otherwise I'll get beaten again.

165
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,790
He is obviously a dying person.

166
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,960
How did it become like this overnight?

167
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,590
this…

168
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,050
Oh my god, how is this possible?

169
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,130
I understand

170
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,220
He got...

171
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,480
Amnesia

172
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,060
Really?

173
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,270
Amnesia...

174
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,490
Although humans are an inferior race

175
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,750
But the five senses

176
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,420
Especially the taste

177
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,540
It is indeed extremely exquisite!

178
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,560
My thousand years

179
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,390
Just absorbing the essence of various foods

180
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,140
And humans

181
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,520
But can you taste this ultimate delicacy?

182
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,480
Because of a tongue?

183
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,110
These lowly creatures

184
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,530
You deserve to enjoy such delicious food!

185
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,240
I'm so furious.

186
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,460
It's him

187
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,340
Get out of the way!

188
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Damn

189
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,160
We have to take Ruli away before he finds out.

190
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,750
You can stay at my place tonight.

191
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,540
His Majesty will summon you at dawn.

192
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,000
good

193
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,470
What a bad smell

194
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,800
What does this smell like?

195
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,470
Like a burning smell?

196
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,230
But this palace

197
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,690
Why is it so gloomy?

198
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,570
Ruli...

199
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,070
Ruli...

200
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,570
Lord Yin Jia?

201
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,420
This is Ruli

202
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,630
Help me!

203
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,210
Help me!

204
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,380
grown ups

205
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,970
Hey! Where are you going?

206
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,640
You can't wander in randomly.

207
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,550
Hello!

208
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,310
Where is she running to?

209
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,030
Ruli...

210
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,910
The soul of the master is in the palace

211
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,040
That's right

212
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,380
This side

213
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,170
Coming Soon

214
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,240
Ruli

215
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,830
When you come, I will be in the well

216
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,330
Help quickly...

217
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,700
grown ups!

218
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,630
Got cheated

219
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,390
Damn

220
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,730
Why is this body so clumsy?

221
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,460
Follow me

222
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,250
You should come with me

223
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,670
I am lonely and angry

224
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,540
Hey! Wake up!

225
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,460
Awake…

226
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,550
Awake

227
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,470
Damn

228
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,930
Could it be these eyes that are to blame?

229
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,630
Are you awake?

230
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,380
grown ups?

231
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,090
I am not him

232
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,510
Since he has disappeared without a trace

233
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,060
I'm afraid Yin Jia has already passed away

234
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,350
-Don't be obsessed anymore
- You are wrong

235
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,650
The drowned ghost trapped in the well

236
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,200
Imitating Lord Yin's voice led me here

237
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,870
The drowned ghost knows adults

238
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,040
I am sure that the spirit of the Lord is in this palace.

239
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,370
So what?

240
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,420
I'm going to meet the drowned ghost again

241
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,090
Are you crazy?

242
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,970
Even the experienced witch

243
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,680
There is a possibility that you will lose your life when dealing with a drowning ghost.

244
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,060
There is neither a soul stone nor a guardian angel

245
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,020
You are just a fat sheep in the eyes of wandering ghosts!

246
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,480
The cat cries over the rat...

247
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,360
It's disgusting.

248
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,070
I spent 13 years chasing after you

249
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,200
How can I tolerate you?

250
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,030
Taken away by an unknown wandering ghost?

251
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,410
Ghost howl?

252
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,620
You can't stay here for long

253
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,460
Letting go

254
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,430
Damn

255
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,560
Yin Jia's damn...

256
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,350
Ruined Shell

257
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,460
The “joy” of “happiness”

258
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,470
Can you see this word too?

259
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,600
Can't see clearly

260
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,670
It is the “Huan” of “Huan” color

261
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,800
This young woman is truly gifted.

262
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,180
yes

263
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,850
This lens is a perfect match for me.

264
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,600
Then I will carefully polish this lens and present it to Your Majesty

265
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,650
This lens is ground into a concave shape

266
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,770
This is a concave lens

267
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,280
It is used to correct those who see things clearly at close range.

268
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,150
Glasses for blurry vision at a distance

269
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,530
How can Your Majesty know so clearly?

270
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,080
I have made glasses for countless people.

271
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,000
But no one has ever known the reason

272
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,500
Of course

273
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,380
So I am the king.

274
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,420
I have also read Tang Ruowang's "The Telescope"

275
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,590
After reading this book and understanding its mysteries

276
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,720
This king personally supervised the skilled craftsmen to make...

277
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,520
This mirror

278
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,860
Wait, that’s…

279
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,490
This pair of glasses is very satisfying to me

280
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,530
My eyes are not only clear again

281
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,210
This wonderful device can actually make the mind clearer

282
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,500
Could it be the soul-calming stone?

283
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,290
This is the soul stone.

284
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,170
You have to treat it as your own

285
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,680
This is the Yin Soul Stone

286
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,010
Although the shape of the frame is different

287
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,430
But I was not wrong

288
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,680
How come this thing is here?

289
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,730
therefore…

290
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,190
This king does not need a new mirror

291
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,110
What?

292
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,450
It's my fault.

293
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,280
The king summoned you today.

294
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,700
Because I heard that Lord Yin wanted to bring you into the palace

295
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,660
I'm curious about what's so special about you

296
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,410
Back off

297
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,710
What should I do?

298
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,550
I still have to interrogate the drowned man.

299
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,800
Need to find a reason to stay in the palace

300
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,140
His Majesty

301
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,310
Lord Yin Jia and I have just arrived after a long journey.

302
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,480
With joy in my heart, I only hope to offer my humble art

303
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,480
Presenting a pair of glasses to His Majesty personally

304
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,200
Even though the adults are still alive and dead

305
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
I also believe that he shares my heart.

306
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,910
I heard that Yin Jia had woken up last night.

307
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,620
Because the Imperial Medical Bureau only treats royal family members

308
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,210
So he has been transferred to the government hospital for treatment.

309
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,790
I see

310
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,050
This is great news

311
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,960
but…

312
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,680
What do you want?

313
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,310
I venture to ask Your Majesty to at least allow me to offer

314
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,020
Tinted lenses!

315
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,510
How dare you bargain with His Majesty?

316
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,640
I don't know if you are fearless or arrogant.

317
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,440
Please forgive me

318
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,230
His Majesty

319
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,820
The reason why I granted this was because I cared about Yin Jia.

320
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,990
Be careful with your words and actions

321
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,610
Yes, sir.

322
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,570
you

323
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,280
Hello!

324
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,540
Oh my God! My Lord!

325
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,580
Why did you come in person?

326
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,960
Make room for this girl to work for a few days.

327
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,880
Yes, sir.

328
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,630
- This way...
-etc

329
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,930
Can I go get the tools I need?

330
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,510
Will we start work tomorrow, sir?

331
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,890
It's up to you.

332
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,740
His Majesty will surely be pleased to see you.

333
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,040
He has had eye problems recently and is planning to get new glasses.

334
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,080
therefore…

335
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,120
This king does not need a new mirror

336
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,460
Your Majesty is in no hurry to change his glasses

337
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,630
Why did you bring me here, sir?

338
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,340
besides

339
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,800
How come grandma's soul-suppressing stone is here?

340
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,600
My beloved minister was attacked

341
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,270
It is said that the method is clean and neat

342
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,060
I don't think it was the bandits who did this.

343
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,730
We have to find out who is behind this. What do you think?

344
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,190
Your Majesty has

345
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,030
A doubter?

346
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,780
A man who uses the sword rather than words

347
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,830
This prince knew that this great plan would lead to bloodshed.

348
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,830
But he never expected that Yin Jia would become the first sacrifice

349
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,090
So

350
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,920
Why did Your Majesty summon the mirror maker into the palace?

351
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,680
There may be something fishy about this matter

352
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,220
Yin Jia must have a deep meaning in bringing her here at this moment

353
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,110
Who is coming?

354
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,660
Very unfamiliar

355
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,580
How dare you sneak around here?

356
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,620
I…

357
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,420
She looks like a person of extraordinary status.

358
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,130
Why is there a stench of evil spirits on your body?

359
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,550
Could it be left by the drowned ghost?

360
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,220
Unbecoming

361
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,590
It seems that you are determined not to speak

362
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,060
Someone drag her away

363
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,140
- It's the Queen.
- It's the Queen.

364
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,560
I am a mirror maker

365
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,770
The first time I entered the palace, I accidentally got lost

366
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,270
Please forgive me

367
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,110
stop

368
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,250
Are you the person recommended by Inspector Yin Jia?

369
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,960
That's right

370
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,380
Back off

371
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,680
yes

372
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,730
Your Majesty, why did you let her go?

373
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,610
Since he was brought by Inspector Yin Jia

374
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,980
It must be her.

375
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,940
Don't alert the enemy

376
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,160
I heard that Yin Jia had woken up.

377
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,780
Wait for me to confirm it with him personally.

378
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,490
Call her again

379
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,920
It turned out that it was the back of the Central Palace.

380
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,550
Forget about saving the dead souls. It's hard for me to even get close to them.

381
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,140
Could she be a female official?

382
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,100
Deep resentment

383
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,690
I really don't know why

384
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,190
Is Yin Jia really neither human nor ghost?

385
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,610
They say he's crazy

386
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,150
First you have to jump into the furnace

387
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
I want to jump off the roof again

388
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,200
He once ran around with a knife in his mouth

389
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,030
Maybe it's not amnesia at all

390
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,740
But crazy?

391
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,040
The official medical department has made such a judgment

392
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,500
But he wasn't that bad when he was with us.

393
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,790
That is to say

394
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,550
Living like this is too pitiful

395
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,260
grown ups!

396
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,470
-What are you going up there for?
-Come down quickly!

397
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,510
-Oh, Master! Come down quickly!
-What is he doing up there?

398
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,100
Please come down quickly, sir!

399
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,310
I tried three times but failed.

400
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,600
Try higher?

401
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,270
Or just close your eyes?

402
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,570
No! No!

403
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,150
Prosecutor Yin!

404
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,150
Come down quickly

405
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,200
Come down

406
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,120
Who are those guys?

407
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,670
It's just nonsense

408
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,670
Brothel?

409
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,590
He is the most upright and polite person.

410
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,840
Where did you say he was?

411
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,800
Listen

412
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,970
He was stabbed a few days ago and his life was hanging by a thread.
I ended up going to a brothel...

413
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,100
Who can believe this?

414
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,100
I thought so too!

415
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,720
But this is the person who was stabbed a few days ago

416
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,940
I heard there was good food and wine there.

417
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,600
He immediately ran out barefoot

418
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,610
What should I do?

419
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,230
Who? My Jia'er?

420
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,150
Sneaking out in broad daylight to get a drink?

421
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,990
- Still barefoot?
-yes!

422
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,530
- His shoes
-Oh my god

423
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,540
Look, the shoes he left behind are still here.

424
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,370
Oh my god...

425
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:56,340
Lord Yin also ate up all the food rations in the clinic.

426
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,880
The roof was covered with tiles that he jumped up and down...

427
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,220
He stepped on it and broke it into more than fifteen pieces.

428
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,220
Oh my god

429
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,470
So please make compensation

430
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,810
Is this enough money?

431
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,650
Where is that brothel?

432
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,020
That white porridge can't compare to this table of food

433
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,690
Grilled abalone, crab in soy sauce, and cold rice noodle soup

434
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,490
Salted mackerel, cucumber stuffed cinnamon, dried yellow croaker, scallion pancake

435
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,990
Imperial hot pot, stewed pork ribs, chrysanthemum wine, pine needle wine

436
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,780
And fried beef patties

437
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,200
It's a feast!

438
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,950
Another copy of this

439
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,500
This one needs that one and this one too.

440
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,540
What other wine is there besides this?

441
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,420
There are lotus leaf wine, pear blossom wine and azalea wine.

442
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,960
Just hearing the name makes me itch

443
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,380
One pot of each

444
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,680
- Go ahead, go
- It's an adult.

445
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:33,270
Are you sure the Minister of War will pay the bill?

446
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,600
Our salary can't afford this meal.

447
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,190
How about we sneak away?

448
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,070
What a great idea!

449
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,280
Ruli

450
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,160
Ruli is here!

451
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,550
Who are you, woman?

452
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,920
How dare you attack me?

453
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,970
Who is this woman Ruli?

454
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,760
This is not over yet

455
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,100
Damn

456
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,320
No! She is...

457
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,030
You little bastard

458
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,080
Your mother I

459
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,000
I thought you were going to die

460
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,540
Do you know how scared I was?

461
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,960
God bless you

462
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,750
Thank you for being alive.

463
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
Thanks

464
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,460
My son

465
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,930
Thank you so much...

466
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,970
Thanks

467
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,910
Another pot

468
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,670
Let me do it

469
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,970
No need, I've packed it all.

470
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,840
Of course, distinguished guests should stay in a clean room

471
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,510
Oh, I'm not a guest.

472
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,800
Ouch

473
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,600
This house is old

474
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,810
It is the warmest in the hospital.

475
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:42,400
Sorry to bother you.

476
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,400
Don't say that. It's really okay.

477
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:50,360
After so many years, I can see people from Longtan Village.
I'm so happy that I can't wait

478
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
Oh my god…

479
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,250
You've suffered a lot, haven't you?

480
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,670
You can also learn to be a mirror maker

481
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,290
Ruli, you did a good job

482
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,550
These things recently

483
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,930
It reminds me of what the great witch said back then...

484
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,060
My grandma?

485
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,680
right

486
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,060
I remember it was when Jiaer just turned one year old...

487
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,360
This child

488
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,150
I'm afraid it's hard to live past thirty.

489
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,700
Let's make a substitute sacrifice for him.

490
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,250
(Substitute Festival: a ritual in which puppets are used to ward off disasters on behalf of children)

491
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:14,160
(Wish you a long life)

492
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:23,370
(Abundance and Peace)

493
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,170
She was the officiating priest.

494
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,540
After her death

495
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,460
I've been worried

496
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,930
He can escape death.

497
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,350
Maybe it's all because of you

498
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,060
No ma'am, I didn't do anything.

499
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,390
You're wrong.

500
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,850
My Jiaer can survive

501
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,650
It's all because of you protecting me

502
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,860
Thank you Ruli

503
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,990
Almost done, just the last bit left

504
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,370
Sorry ma'am

505
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,200
But that person

506
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,750
Not Lord Yin Jia

507
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,590
(The shrine of my deceased brother and student Yin Jia)

508
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,440
It's all your fault!

509
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,150
You disaster star!

510
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,610
Get out of the way!

511
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,650
Stop it now!

512
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,450
My kids are starving to death.

513
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,030
It’s all this girl’s fault for bringing Jiang Chaoli to our village!

514
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,290
Admit it, you are just cowardly and venting your anger

515
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:27,040
Before Jiang Chaoli arrived

516
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,080
Our village also suffers from frequent floods, droughts and locust plagues!

517
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,920
These natural disasters are beyond human control.

518
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,420
It never stopped!

519
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,260
so

520
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,720
Why do you put all the disasters on her?

521
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,640
My mother and I are moving to Hanyang

522
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,400
When to leave?

523
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,360
Wait a few days until my bone injury is better before leaving

524
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,150
I want to ask

525
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,740
Would you like to go with me?

526
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,070
Go together?

527
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,910
right

528
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,910
Come with us

529
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,750
You must have had enough of this village, right?

530
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,000
If I'm not going, why should I go with you?

531
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,260
So you plan to continue living like this?

532
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,220
Let them trample on it at will?

533
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,050
Isn't it enough to break a leg?

534
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,510
I will only ruin your life!

535
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,310
I am the one cursed by the river tide, the one despised by the Dragon King

536
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,060
What curse is there?

537
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,600
My leg is injured

538
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,940
I fell accidentally while climbing a tree.

539
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,030
Don't blame you

540
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,290
Come with me, Ruli

541
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:03,220
Did he really cross the Yellow Springs?

542
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,680
No

543
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,220
It is impossible to do so before the 49th day.

544
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,810
He might still be hanging around his mother.

545
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,360
Don't waste your energy.

546
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,030
I have never seen him in the palace or around it.

547
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,530
You don't have to believe me

548
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,700
Even if I tell you that bean paste is made from beans, you won't believe it.

549
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:38,630
What? How?

550
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,800
Aren't you afraid?

551
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,380
how?

552
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,380
Do you want me to be your patron saint?

553
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,970
OK

554
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,600
If you can do it

555
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,430
-What?
- You can't do it

556
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,810
You are trapped in this body and cannot move

557
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,690
To escape from that body

558
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,320
You jumped off the roof and into the fire

559
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,110
Running around with a dagger in his mouth

560
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,440
Isn't that exactly why?

561
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,330
That's right.

562
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:13,620
I don't believe a word you say.

563
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:15,750
but…

564
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,500
This heart

565
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,670
Still beating

566
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,340
What are you doing

567
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,930
You are the most dignified woman in front of Yin Jia

568
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,310
How dare you touch me like this now?

569
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,060
I didn't touch you

570
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,310
I touched an adult's body.

571
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,100
A warm body with blood flowing

572
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,610
What are you planning?

573
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,240
That's right

574
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,820
Just as you guessed

575
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,910
Do you want to find his soul and return to his body?

576
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,790
This is ridiculous. His lifeline has already been severed.

577
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:00,000
Then is it reasonable for you to occupy this corpse?

578
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:04,090
I really miss you, my heart is broken

579
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,300
His face and body are close at hand

580
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,090
But it's not him

581
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,970
The thing I value most in this world is this face

582
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:19,600
But inside is you, the person I hate the most

583
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,560
This is simply

584
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,110
The worst nightmare

585
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,650
I…

586
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,200
Can't stand you

587
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,120
Don't use his face and voice anymore.

588
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,410
Tarnishing the reputation of the Lord

589
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,710
Before this body is safely returned to you

590
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,460
I will never sit by and watch someone smear his reputation.

591
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,630
OK

592
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,550
Even if you keep saying these vicious words till the end of time
I don't care

593
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:06,860
Ruli...

594
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,170
I've never met a human being like that.

595
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,390
Coexistence with Heaven and Earth

596
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,800
Natural

597
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:51,530
A child of this character

598
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,950
Enough to cleanse the curse brought to me by humans

599
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:08,800
In this case

600
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,840
How could I...

601
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,680
Give up you?

602
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:02,930
The king ordered Inspector Yin Jia to return to the palace immediately!

603
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,060
So what if he is the king?

604
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,520
The child had just been wounded by a sword

605
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,060
Am I going to be dragged up from my sickbed to do the job?

606
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:09,980
How do you talk like that!

607
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,690
presumptuous

608
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,990
You have really sharp ears. I was clearly just talking to myself.

609
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,700
I should go wake him up. I'm going right now.

610
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:22,160
Jia Er! Get up!

611
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,000
The king summons you to the palace

612
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,790
I'm so happy I'm dying of joy

613
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,340
The doctor said it was amnesia

614
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,050
Watch his movements carefully on the road

615
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,510
Is this the legendary floor heating?

616
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,180
Yes

617
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:45,640
Among the five senses, it is not just the taste that is worth enjoying

618
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,770
Wrapped in warmth...

619
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,570
It's melting.

620
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:53,860
It's amazing

621
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,530
stand up

622
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,580
I don't want

623
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:07,580
Didn't you hear?

624
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,630
The king wants you to return to the palace.

625
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:14,090
He is not my king, so why should I respond to his call?

626
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,260
Do you dare to disobey my order?

627
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,600
What's so scary? He won't live to be a hundred.

628
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,350
now

629
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:28,270
Enjoy floor heating for me

630
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:29,810
The most important thing

631
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,940
I said I would not let you tarnish my reputation.

632
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,940
Your persistence is really heartbreaking.

633
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:40,780
Why do you care so much about the person who tricked you into coming here?

634
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,620
Do you think he brought you here just to make a few pairs of broken lenses?

635
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,530
That stinky guy...

636
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:48,250
What's wrong with him?

637
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,920
Well, I'll continue sleeping.

638
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,380
What are you hiding from me?

639
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,920
You've been behaving strangely since Longtan Village

640
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:01,430
You must know

641
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:03,220
The reason why Lord Yin Jia brought me into the palace

642
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,430
Even if you know

643
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,600
Why should I tell you?

644
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,190
Even if I tell you that bean paste is made from beans, you won't believe it.

645
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,770
I should have expected that.

646
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,690
Asking you is stupid of me

647
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,030
I will find out the truth myself

648
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,260
It's so simple

649
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,180
He is so naive

650
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:49,180
I don't even want to listen to a word you say

651
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:51,520
I followed you just to protect you.

652
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,150
Being hit by a wandering ghost

653
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,230
After all, I have been watching you for 13 years

654
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,780
Hear me, shut up.

655
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,110
Everyone is watching us

656
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,450
Don’t ordinary people find it cumbersome to wear these every day?

657
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:10,080
This crown

658
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,000
All stuck with sweat

659
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,580
And this broken belt

660
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:16,330
Always wandering around and getting in the way

661
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,590
You...

662
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,220
You can go to the Clothing House now.

663
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:32,230
What?

664
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:34,900
Yes, sir.

665
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,360
What? Where are you going?

666
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:38,860
I'll go with you

667
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,980
where you go?

668
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,570
Don't just stand there and stop him!

669
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,450
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

670
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:50,950
Who allowed you to touch me?

671
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,120
Let me go

672
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,040
Let go!

673
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,750
I hope nothing will happen.

674
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,750
Don't resist like this!

675
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,550
Put me down quickly!

676
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:06,590
Put me down!

677
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,050
open!

678
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,720
I'm going to take that roasted abalone-like thing

679
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:13,270
Thrown back into the Jeju trench

680
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,940
Put him down now!

681
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,060
What happened again?

682
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,570
His Majesty!

683
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,780
- Lord Yoon Gap...
- I'll tell you later.

684
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:29,280
What are you doing?

685
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:32,870
I came here upon being summoned, and he dared to leave me alone?

686
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,620
presumptuous!

687
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,460
How dare you face...

688
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,340
Did you go this way?

689
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:45,300
Wait here and come back to me!

690
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,800
Why shouldn’t I?

691
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,930
Where did she just say she was going?

692
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,010
The Clothing House, right?

693
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,230
That madman...

694
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,030
Why does he...

695
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:06,030
You guards

696
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:07,860
Why does he...

697
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,050
Year of Bingchen

698
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:52,840
February 6th Xinwei Day

699
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:55,050
I wish to help a soul transcend

700
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,100
Please have mercy

701
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,940
The Supreme God in Heaven

702
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,690
I pray sincerely here

703
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:11,860
May you protect my heart from evil spirits.

704
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,240
And wish you...

705
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:16,620
Caught

706
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:37,930
The Holy One who speaks the way of justice

707
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:40,720
May you drive away evil

708
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:42,640
Give me wisdom

709
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:06,330
It's out

710
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,180
Jin Huan Emperor Dragon King Emperor

711
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:27,230
Standing like a mountain in this changing world

712
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:30,730
May you guide the living beings

713
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,990
Going the right way

714
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,030
Tell me where the adults are.

715
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,870
I will release the rest of your soul

716
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,400
Where is she if she is not in the Clothing House?

717
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,550
no!

718
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,600
You can't leave unless you tell me where the adults are.

719
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:52,150
Even if I tell you, you won't see him.

720
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:54,440
Why?

721
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,990
Once you see

722
00:56:58,070 --> 00:56:59,400
No one survived

723
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,520
What does this mean?

724
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:32,440
Tell me what this means!

725
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,270
He already...

726
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,230
Swallowed by that thing

727
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,240
"That thing?"

728
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,950
Eight-foot ghost

729
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:03,590
Guang Er

730
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:04,970
Guanger!

731
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:10,100
Eight-foot ghost?

732
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:25,780
It's him

733
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:29,330
Eight-foot ghost

734
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,940
(Special thanks to: Jin Yongguang)

735
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,000
I will never give up on Master Yin Jia

736
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:20,250
-grown ups!
- You fell into his trap

737
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,050
He took advantage of you

738
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,090
I don't believe a word you say.

739
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:27,050
I must revive the master first and then ask him in person.

740
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:30,390
Don't you want to take revenge on the culprit?

741
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:31,560
I will help you

742
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,850
As long as you help me

743
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:36,480
The source of Hachikage's hatred is not in him.

744
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,520
Yin Jia knows too much

745
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,110
Close monitoring is required

746
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:44,030
What the hell is going on?
