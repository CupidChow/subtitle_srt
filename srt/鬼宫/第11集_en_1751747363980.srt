1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,420
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,470
I am not your foe.

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,340
The King's royal bloodline is.

5
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,310
Then, why?

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,220
Why do you attack me?

7
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,320
That is a mighty crock of nonsense…

8
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,040
<i>He's fleeing?</i>

9
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,790
Stop right there!

10
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,770
The Ghostbane Stone.

11
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,150
We do not know when he will be back.
We must get out of here.

12
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,780
Gangcheori.

13
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,610
Never let go of that Ghostbane Stone.

14
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,250
These were discovered with Yeo-ri.

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
BONFIRE

16
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,420
It is the same one, Your Majesty.

17
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,840
<i>It is the same talisman</i>
<i>used to summon the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.</i>

18
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,510
Noble Elder Pung-san.

19
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,930
He is clearly the Yapper.

20
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,270
The evidence is undeniable.
Do not just stand there.

21
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,440
We must catch him now!

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,650
Because of him, Yeo-ri--

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,690
His Majesty already gave the command
to the Capital Garrison troops.

24
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,400
That cave and shrine area
are being searched as we speak.

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,410
Unfortunately, the cave is
much too vast and intricate,

26
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,530
so the search will take some time.

27
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,500
And the Association?

28
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,960
Yes, it has already been shut down.

29
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,130
All the fortune tellers and servants close
to Noble Elder Pung-san have been detained

30
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,550
and Chief State Councillor
is overseeing their interrogation.

31
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,140
Thank goodness you are safe.

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,850
Are you all right?

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

34
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,690
<i>Right. Thank goodness I am safe.</i>

35
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,810
<i>But it is odd.</i>

36
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,860
<i>Why did he not kill me?</i>

37
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,150
What are you doing?

38
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,160
Then, should I just let her go free?
She knows everything.

39
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,370
We cannot kill the bait.

40
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,910
Quietly take her out
through the drainage gate.

41
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,630
<i>He called me bait.</i>

42
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,040
<i>I am the bait.</i>

43
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,500
<i>What was he trying to catch</i>
<i>with me as bait?</i>

44
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,930
This place is crawling with soldiers.

45
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,350
What do I do now?

46
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,610
Noble Elder?

47
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,070
Warrior Deity?

48
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,410
Your Majesty.

49
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,710
Where is Pung-san's shrine?

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,380
It is this way.

51
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,250
This is it, Your Majesty.

52
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,800
This was the hidden passageway
to Pung-san's shrine.

53
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,190
Noble Elder.

54
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,570
Noble Elder!

55
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,400
Oh gosh.

56
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,320
What in the world is going on now?
I cannot believe this.

57
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,200
Noble Elder. Please wake up.

58
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,230
What is that?

59
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,320
Forgive me.

60
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,900
We tried sand and water to put it out,
but it was momentary.

61
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,030
The embers keep coming back to life.

62
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,740
All of you

63
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,240
may leave.

64
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,740
Your Majesty.

65
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,450
We cannot, Your Majesty.

66
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,330
We cannot leave you alone.

67
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,670
Leave me!

68
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

69
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,130
We will remain in the vicinity.

70
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,160
I will kill you all!

71
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,740
This bloodline will be

72
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,700
uprooted by my hand!

73
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,390
You scoundrel…

74
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,860
kept me in a choke hold for many years.

75
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,360
Where are you hiding?

76
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,160
Wicked spirit!

77
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,990
Reveal yourself at once!

78
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,490
I have come in person
because I have something to say to you!

79
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,290
I have denied your existence
time and time again.

80
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,040
I did not want to believe it.

81
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,470
I just thought it was all bad luck
and grievous tragedies!

82
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,510
I tried to believe it all happened
because my virtue fell short

83
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,010
as the King.

84
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,770
However, I now know without a doubt.

85
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,350
<i>You </i>are trying to massacre me
and my whole family!

86
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,400
These emotions that I have felt,

87
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,030
unyielding rage and unrelenting fear,

88
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,410
I now know that you have relished in them.

89
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,910
Reveal yourself this instant!

90
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,830
Step forth and face me if you will.

91
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,160
I will never back down.

92
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,090
I will never kneel before you.

93
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,010
I will look directly into your eyes

94
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,380
to face you and fight.

95
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,260
I refuse…

96
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,640
to bow down to you!

97
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,300
<i>I am not your foe.</i>

98
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,600
The King's royal bloodline is.

99
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,900
Then, why?

100
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,280
Why do you attack me?

101
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,710
You do not need to be concerned.

102
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,840
It is unnecessary.

103
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,840
What do you mean?

104
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,340
What am I not to be concerned about?

105
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,430
Ghosts are known for their cunning remarks

106
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,010
and their lies.

107
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,720
They use them to leave people distressed.

108
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,850
When would you have ever nurtured
ill will against the throne?

109
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,860
I know.

110
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,400
Then, why are you
so lost in your thoughts?

111
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,070
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost knew everything.

112
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,530
He knew I fell to the ground

113
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,780
while trying to ascend
during that war, a century ago.

114
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,530
As if…

115
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,540
he witnessed it himself.

116
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,830
Then,

117
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,210
he was really born the day
you fell to the ground?

118
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,390
The air is chilly.
You should go back inside.

119
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,740
That is the rascal.
The feast I had my heart set on.

120
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,660
The spite in his belly is just…

121
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,490
full to the brim.

122
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,330
Yes.

123
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,710
I can even smell

124
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,630
its potent stench from here.

125
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,640
What is the matter?

126
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,150
It is nothing, my lord.

127
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,020
Look here.

128
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,190
This is the procession
of Lord Hong Gwon-u.

129
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,900
Swiftly step aside.

130
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,030
What is wrong with him?

131
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,160
Move it!

132
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,580
Just look at you go.

133
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,540
You do not own this street,

134
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,290
yet you insist on telling me to move
when you can simply go around.

135
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,880
Just snipping away
at your own life thread…

136
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,800
Do not dawdle.

137
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,590
- Get rid of him this instant!
- Yes, my lord.

138
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,050
Move it!

139
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,660
What is he doing?

140
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,330
No!

141
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,340
Yeo-ri.

142
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,300
Forgive us for the inconvenience, my lord.

143
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,680
Yeo-ri!

144
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,360
Why that little…

145
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,950
Yeo-ri.

146
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,660
What was that just now?

147
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,290
Why do you ask when you saw everything?

148
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,370
He was setting the table for my feast

149
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,250
and you just barbarically flipped it over!

150
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,590
They say the recently deceased
Kwak Sang-chung

151
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,510
was also discovered with a torn talisman.

152
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,420
Was that… also your doing?

153
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,010
Was it?

154
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,680
That was…

155
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,270
Yes. I was behind that.

156
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,190
However, he even kidnapped
Yoon Gap's mother and tried to kill her.

157
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:51,110
What was so terrible about throwing Bibi
that heinous scoundrel as a snack?

158
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,450
That scoundrel was no different.

159
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,030
If it was not for that damn talisman,

160
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,490
Bibi would have devoured him ages ago.

161
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,540
I already told you.

162
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,750
Bibi devouring men
who habitually commit evil deeds

163
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,290
builds good karma for the land.

164
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,090
Why rage over a deity's affairs?

165
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
A deity's affairs…

166
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,630
Sure.

167
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,430
Ending a person's life must seem trivial
for deities like you.

168
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,850
But you see,

169
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,770
when a deity kills a mortal,
it is divine retribution,

170
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,930
but when one mortal kills another…

171
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,270
it is nothing more than murder.

172
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,400
- Murder?
- Yes, murder.

173
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,190
The one who stole my <i>myeongdu</i>
to destroy that talisman

174
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,570
is not Gangcheori

175
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,740
but Lord Yoon Gap, the mortal.

176
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,730
<i>I already told you.</i>

177
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,520
<i>Bibi devouring men</i>
<i>who habitually commit evil deeds</i>

178
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,400
builds good karma for the land.

179
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,480
Why rage over a deity's affairs?

180
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,240
A deity's affairs…

181
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,470
Thinking about it only fuels my anger.

182
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,220
Are you honestly angry
because I dared to end a mortal's life

183
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,220
with the sacred body of Lord Yoon Gap?

184
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,850
What happened to liking me?

185
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,690
You are so desperately worried
about that rascal?

186
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,570
Can you not sleep, either?

187
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,860
You startled me.

188
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,990
That is unlike you.

189
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,780
You used to blow the roof off
with your instant thunderous snoring.

190
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,540
I remain disturbed about what happened
to Yeo-ri earlier today.

191
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,830
It is odd that the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
just disappeared like that.

192
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,260
Listen.

193
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,550
Is that…

194
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,390
truly the only way?

195
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:11,850
You know…

196
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,480
The luminous pearl.

197
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,650
Is draining an Imugi's luminous pearl

198
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,070
the only way to guide
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost to cross over?

199
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,320
Is there no other way?

200
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,080
I am sorry.

201
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,790
I am just a mere quack monk
and I know of no other way.

202
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,580
Useless rascal.

203
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,360
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

204
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,570
They discovered letters and other objects

205
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,990
from the Queen Dowager
in the noble elder's underground shrine.

206
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,540
Then, do you mean that the Queen Dowager
is Noble Elder Pung-san's benefactor?

207
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,330
How amusing.

208
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,290
Not too long ago,

209
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,420
you argued that if anyone conjured
a nasty hex against the royal family,

210
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,430
its chief victim who would suffer the most

211
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,010
would be the Queen Dowager, did you not?

212
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,930
I do hope Your Majesty is not suggesting

213
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,690
that people can actually be killed through
hexes and heretical ceremonies.

214
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,480
Prince Yeongin met his unfortunate demise

215
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,530
due to excessive alcohol consumption.

216
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,950
After his death,

217
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,660
the Queen Dowager,
distraught with sorrow and grief,

218
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,540
must have been tricked
by that wicked blind fortune teller.

219
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,710
That is blasphemy.

220
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,590
Pung-san is a fortune teller
I have long kept by my side.

221
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,460
I am confident about his character.

222
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,180
Someone has framed him for all of it.

223
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,800
And who might that be?

224
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Surely…

225
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,140
Your Majesty must know better than anyone.

226
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,770
Your Grace.

227
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,650
Who was the first
to recommend Pung-san to you?

228
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,690
Who is his benefactor?

229
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,780
Your Majesty!

230
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,990
It is time for you to open your eyes!

231
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,620
You were never an affectionate mother,

232
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,660
but you certainly were not a foolish one.

233
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,330
Yet you still have not realized it?

234
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,670
You led your own son to his death
by offering him up as a sacrifice.

235
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,260
How absurd…

236
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,970
What sort of nonsense--

237
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,850
Pung-san is a sorcerer
who serves an evil spirit.

238
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,270
That is right.

239
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,900
The very evil spirit who led
the late king to his demise.

240
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,750
That is Yeongin's undershirt.

241
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,340
No…

242
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,220
That cannot be true.

243
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,680
I do not consider you blameless,

244
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,180
but I will not make you pay
for your crimes.

245
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,270
You are already…

246
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,110
suffering the cruelest punishment.

247
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,950
No… That cannot be…

248
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,620
That cannot be true… No…

249
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Perform a recitation ceremony
to ward off ghosts.

250
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,050
Make sure that ghost
cannot lay a finger on my Yeongin.

251
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,430
Get rid of this!

252
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,720
No…

253
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,310
No.

254
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,730
That cannot be.

255
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,360
No…

256
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,650
That cannot be…

257
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,950
Where did you ever find the audacity
to seek me out once more?

258
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:47,630
Do you know of the misery
I am going through to clean up that mess?

259
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,920
Please…

260
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,420
Please, just give me
one more chance, my lordship.

261
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,220
Your very existence

262
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,260
has become a great burden in my life.

263
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,970
My lordship…

264
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,810
Damn it.

265
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,350
My lordship.

266
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,120
Do you truly believe you can
seat a new king without my help?

267
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,630
What did you just say?

268
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,670
Secure a hideout
for this blind creature's body.

269
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,260
The world you seek is not far off.

270
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,680
Noble Elder!

271
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,060
My goodness. Noble Elder.

272
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,150
Are you all right?

273
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,480
Noble Elder!

274
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,240
This used to be the ancestral shrine
of His Lordship's family.

275
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,910
It remains out of sight for most.
Do not do anything foolish.

276
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,950
Yes. Sure. I understand.

277
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,470
Noble Elder.

278
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,180
Please, Noble Elder.

279
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,980
Please wake up now.

280
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,650
What is going on?

281
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,480
Se-won.

282
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,360
My goodness. You are awake.

283
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,410
You saw it for yourself just now,
did you not?

284
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:48,370
Did you see how the Warrior Deity
took hold of my body?

285
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,080
His Lordship did not dare put up a fight.

286
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,210
Yes. I saw it clearly with my two eyes.

287
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,300
Do you get it now?

288
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,890
If you have the Warrior Deity
standing behind you,

289
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,140
there is nothing to fear in this world.

290
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,930
Yes, you're right.

291
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,350
Is there a brazier nearby?

292
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,200
It is now time to pick
that fully ripe persimmon.

293
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,410
That is what the Warrior Deity proclaims.

294
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,730
Were the marked ones
killed by the Eight-foot-tall Ghost?

295
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,230
Yes, you are correct.

296
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,150
Yeo-ri once mentioned

297
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,320
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost must hold
a deep grudge against the royal bloodline.

298
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,990
These are the royal relatives
who met their sudden and strange deaths

299
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,450
for the past 13 years,
after the late king passed.

300
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,910
As expected,

301
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,750
not all members of the royal bloodline
were killed.

302
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,090
These must be the members
who avoided the ghost's attacks.

303
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,380
Yes.

304
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,130
Then, the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
must hold a grudge

305
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,720
against the one who lost
all his offspring to it.

306
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,720
It must be against him.

307
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:30,100
It appears the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
holds a grudge

308
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,480
against King Yeonjong,
my great-great-grandfather,

309
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,560
who was the sovereign
of this nation 100 years ago.

310
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,320
One hundred years ago…

311
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,200
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost mentioned
it was born 100 years ago as well.

312
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
This cannot all be a coincidence.

313
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,780
It knew Gangcheori failed to ascend
on the day of its birth.

314
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,740
I am certain he was
also in Yongdam Village

315
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,750
when he met his demise.

316
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,410
Yongdam Village?

317
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,330
It is a village in Ducheong-hyeon.

318
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,960
That place was experiencing
tumultuous warfare at the time.

319
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,050
No death that day
would have surprised anyone.

320
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,550
It means all of
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost's secrets

321
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,890
were buried in Yongdam Village,
100 years ago.

322
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,930
During the war
when the northern barbarians invaded,

323
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,770
there was a safeguard for King Yeonjong
in the royal procession.

324
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,230
Afterward, he was honored
as a meritorious subject

325
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,280
and his family settled in Ducheong-hyeon

326
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,110
to become a prestigious family
for generations to come.

327
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,610
His descendant…

328
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,160
might know something.

329
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,200
And who is that?

330
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,870
Lord Choi Won-u.

331
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,670
- Pardon?
- What?

332
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,960
I shall go to Yongdam Village in ten days.

333
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,340
There, I will expose the true identity

334
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,420
of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

335
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,480
Come on now.

336
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,650
I am on my way to a royal court assembly.

337
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,400
Stop following me and be on your way.

338
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,070
I need to go this way, too.

339
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,620
What is it this time?

340
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,240
What is the issue?

341
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,330
Well… Tell me…

342
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,210
What sort of character

343
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,540
was that Yoon Gap fellow?

344
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,130
Yoon Gap?

345
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,300
Yoon Gap was an unmatched loyal subject.

346
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,180
A true scholarly gentleman.

347
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,430
Scholarly gentleman? As if.

348
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,680
From what I saw,
he was cowardly and contemptible.

349
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,230
He tricked Yeo-ri

350
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,060
into coming to this dangerous palace
to go after this ghost.

351
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,610
Yet, you and Yeo-ri have nothing
but affection for that scoundrel.

352
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,570
"Lord Yoon Gap this"
and "Lord Yoon Gap that."

353
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,940
I am sick and tired of it.

354
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,490
What is the matter with you?

355
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,660
Are you jealous?

356
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,160
But you possess a talent

357
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,580
that surpasses Yoon Gap in every way.

358
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,750
Which is?

359
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,880
You have the ability to turn
the most solemn supreme sovereign

360
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,090
pettier than any commoner
on the market street.

361
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,510
Sure. Of course.
And does the most solemn supreme sovereign

362
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,850
possess enough knowledge to trip up
the corrupt government officials?

363
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,850
Did you really think I was unaware?

364
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,690
I will do whatever it takes to fight them

365
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:23,400
and ultimately punish them
to the fullest extent of state law.

366
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,940
The King shall take care
of the affairs in the mortal world.

367
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,700
The deity should just
stand aside and watch.

368
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,950
You should avoid

369
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,410
taking care of wicked old men
by yourself, for instance.

370
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,370
And so on.

371
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,360
That object shall protect Your Highness
from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

372
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,570
What a precious object.

373
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,900
I am truly grateful.

374
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,450
This is a Ghostbane Stone, is it not?

375
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,450
How did you know?

376
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,540
Father showed me his glasses
that were made with one.

377
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,080
I see.

378
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:28,000
Your Highness should also keep it
close by at all times.

379
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,180
What is with that King?

380
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,850
Does he know something?

381
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,650
- Know what?
- Sheesh!

382
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,730
I told you to stop popping up like that!

383
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,580
Bibi?

384
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,370
Are those two at it again?

385
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,580
I saw it.

386
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,170
I saw where Yeo-ri hid that <i>myeongdu</i>.

387
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,340
I also already figured out
where that nobleman I missed last time is.

388
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,470
He is drinking himself silly at a
courtesan house in the middle of the day.

389
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,100
Come on, let's go.

390
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,600
Let us speedily enjoy that feast
while Yeo-ri remains at the palace.

391
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,190
Bibi.

392
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,270
I am not going.

393
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,360
What?

394
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,610
Yeo-ri was right.

395
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,150
I should not have involved myself

396
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,200
in a deity's affairs
when I am in this mortal body.

397
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,870
Gangcheori.

398
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,950
Pung-san is on the run now
and he will not be able

399
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,240
to craft any more Haeilbu talismans
for the time being.

400
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,660
Fortunately, mortals diligently age
with every passing year,

401
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,670
so there will be a never-ending supply

402
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,460
of noblemen over the age of 60
with bellies full of spite.

403
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,510
I, too, am disappointed your ascension
has been delayed because of that Haeilbu.

404
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,090
But it will only be a few years.

405
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,930
If you are patient, in a couple of years--

406
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,350
Forget it!

407
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:02,850
Bibi.

408
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,680
At the end of the day,

409
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,310
you just do not want to upset that brat.

410
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,020
At this rate,

411
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,690
you will be offering up
your luminous pearl to banish that ghost.

412
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,320
How…

413
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,280
- How did you--
- I heard everything!

414
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,580
You have to drain your luminous pearl

415
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,870
if you want to banish
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

416
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,500
That means you have to die.

417
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,340
At the beginning, you told me

418
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,880
that you were just using Yeo-ri
to ascend as a dragon.

419
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,430
But look at you now.

420
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,890
Take a good look at yourself.

421
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,770
You are not occupying that body.

422
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,310
That body has swallowed you whole!

423
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,690
You have strayed too far

424
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,270
from Gangcheori the Imugi.

425
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,030
All because of that brat, Yeo-ri.

426
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,840
That dummy. Idiot.

427
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,630
Moron.

428
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,180
How could he abandon
his own brother for some brat

429
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,470
who cannot even live for 100 years?

430
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,100
He wouldn't…

431
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,360
Would he actually give up
his luminous pearl?

432
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,230
He does not have one.

433
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,690
No Haeilbu talisman.

434
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,260
Show yourself.

435
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,640
It appears you have figured it out.

436
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,480
So? Did you enjoy your meal,

437
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
Lord Imugi?

438
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,940
No wonder.

439
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,900
I did notice it reeked of fire energy.

440
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,860
My goodness, I am petrified.

441
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,030
My servant went through so much trouble
acquiring you that prey.

442
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,950
How could you glare at me so
for all the effort I put into this?

443
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,370
What are you scheming?

444
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,500
Oh, it is nothing special.

445
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,170
Just hand over that brat named Yeo-ri.

446
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,550
- What did you say?
- You know the shrine at the Association?

447
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,880
Just bring her there

448
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,260
and I will catch
these noblemen one by one

449
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,050
to serve them to you.

450
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,260
I crafted those talismans.

451
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,640
I have a clear roster
of who has them in their possession.

452
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,310
Catching and serving them to you
is no trouble at all.

453
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,900
Was this why?

454
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,400
Was this why you sold those talismans?

455
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,820
Neither the Warrior Deity nor I

456
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,990
harbor any ill will against the Imugis.

457
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,240
However, because
of that damn brat, Yeo-ri,

458
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,290
Imugi Gangcheori interferes
every other second

459
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,000
and it creates a giant headache for all.

460
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:39,750
So, if you just catch that brat
and bring her to the shrine,

461
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,210
I will offer her right up
to the Warrior Deity.

462
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,590
Then, Gangcheori will have
no reason to interfere anymore,

463
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,840
leaving us happy
and you happy to ascend.

464
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,600
This is a win-win situation
for both parties, is it not?

465
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,680
Right?

466
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,280
<i>I will hold it captive</i>
<i>with this talismanic iron net.</i>

467
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,910
<i>Then, you can use</i>
<i>the power of the luminous pearl</i>

468
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,370
to stab it with that crescent blade.

469
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,090
<i>That was why…</i>

470
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,050
<i>How could I have made</i>
<i>such a request of him?</i>

471
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,280
<i>But look at you now.</i>

472
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,820
Take a good look at yourself.

473
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,120
You are not occupying that body.

474
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,660
That body has swallowed you whole!

475
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,540
You have strayed too far

476
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,540
from Gangcheori the Imugi.

477
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,960
All because of that brat, Yeo-ri.

478
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,760
<i>It looked like Bibi was quite angry…</i>

479
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,720
<i>How can I make it up to him?</i>

480
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,810
- Listen…
- What?

481
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,100
Yes? Is something the matter?

482
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,730
I am sorry for taking what belongs to you.

483
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,110
Yes. All right.

484
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,290
The Ghostbane Stone…

485
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:43,170
What did you do with it?

486
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,290
Where is your Ghostbane Stone?

487
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,420
Well, I…

488
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,130
I gave it to the Prince.

489
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,300
What?

490
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,340
We are to go
to Yongdam Village in a few days.

491
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,970
What if the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
tries to harm the Prince and Queen

492
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,470
during our absence?

493
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Then, what about you? What are you to do?

494
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:05,020
At least with that cursed thing
by your side, I could rest somewhat easy.

495
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,900
This will not do.

496
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,400
I will go and get it back
from that prince rascal.

497
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,160
What? Let go of me.

498
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,740
How can you laugh about this?

499
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:21,660
I mean, just a few months ago,
you despised it so

500
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,330
and tried everything
to separate it from me.

501
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
I almost forgot.

502
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,040
I believe you also possessed
Lord Yoon Gap's corpse

503
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,590
for the same reason. Am I wrong?

504
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,630
Things are different now.

505
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,430
Gangcheori.

506
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,430
I no longer need the Ghostbane Stone.

507
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,230
Do not need it?

508
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,730
What do you--

509
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,150
You are my protector now.

510
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,860
Back in Yongdam Village
and even in the capital,

511
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,620
it was always you.

512
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,740
You stayed by my side
and kept an eye on me when I was alone.

513
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,450
It was always you.

514
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,880
You are the Ghostbane Stone
that kept me safe.

515
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,720
So, I will not be confusing you

516
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,590
with Lord Yoon Gap.

517
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,350
And…

518
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,190
And?

519
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,820
I cannot do stuff like this
if I hold on to the Ghostbane Stone.

520
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,040
- Hey!
- What?

521
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,790
Why are you smirking over there
while you are eating?

522
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,960
Smirk? When did I ever smirk?

523
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,040
I am just agitated
by the lack of side dishes.

524
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,630
Stop it. This barley porridge is
so gentle on the palate and tasty.

525
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,340
I agree.

526
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:42,510
It is just so tasty,
I finished it in three spoon--

527
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,970
I mean, I finished it in three bites.

528
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,730
We are in this predicament
because you squandered your salary.

529
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:53,810
We have no choice.

530
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,070
Forgive me,

531
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,610
but going forward, we will only be serving
barley porridge in this house.

532
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,080
Ma'am, what about the money
I gave you last time?

533
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,500
That is too precious to spend.

534
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,500
I will keep it safe and give it to you
when you get married.

535
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,880
Do not worry.

536
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,880
Still going on about that damn salary.

537
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,880
I will just go to the King tomorrow
and have him pay that salary once more.

538
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,340
So let us get something tasty--

539
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,590
As if that makes any sense.

540
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,720
Do you think the King is your buddy?

541
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,480
Venerable, do you have a moment?

542
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,190
Yeo-ri. How do you know about that?

543
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,860
I thought you would have known.

544
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:45,990
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost can be banished
with an Imugi's luminous pearl.

545
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:50,790
Is there any other way?

546
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,630
His Majesty once told me

547
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,760
that Neop-deok was the only shaman
who was able to quell its energy.

548
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,220
How did my grandma do that?

549
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:06,010
Even back then, she tried every which way

550
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:10,640
and tried with all her might to expose
the ghost's true identity,

551
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,730
but she failed.

552
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,100
Hence,

553
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,270
she summoned the Grim Reaper.

554
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,820
But the shaman could suffer
sudden death if things go awry.

555
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,190
That is right.

556
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,860
It was only possible
because she was Great Shaman Neop-deok.

557
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:28,160
However, you already know that

558
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,450
that ended up failing as well.

559
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:34,750
But, back then, Grandma was in the dark

560
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,040
about the ghost's true identity
and Yapper's existence.

561
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,630
If I am able to expose its true identity
in Yongdam Village this time,

562
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,930
summoning the Fire Reaper might be enough.

563
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,930
Fire Reaper?

564
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:53,060
As in the reaper who takes away souls
who were burned to death?

565
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,290
What is it?

566
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,920
You will need one more thing
if you wish to summon the Fire Reaper.

567
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,630
What? Were you eavesdropping?

568
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,420
That is not important.

569
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,090
The ghost's identification pendant.

570
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,600
- You need it, do you not?
- Its identification pendant?

571
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,520
It would be useful to have,

572
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,850
but how could I ever find that?

573
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:36,850
Wait…

574
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,110
The Yapper might have it.

575
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,610
That explains how he could
summon it so easily.

576
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,200
I saw it at his shrine.

577
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,530
Did you really?

578
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:49,620
Yes, really.

579
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,040
You do not have to believe me.

580
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,160
Hold on.

581
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,960
What?

582
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,380
Do you want me to come with you?

583
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,220
Come with me.

584
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,850
Do not tell Gangcheori
that I know about the luminous pearl.

585
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,390
He must not find out.

586
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,270
I will make sure he is not sacrificed

587
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,360
to banish the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

588
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,150
<i>This girl…</i>

589
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,820
<i>genuinely holds Gangcheori dear,</i>
<i>deep in her heart.</i>

590
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,450
<i>That is exactly why.</i>

591
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,830
<i>That is why you are</i>
<i>an even greater danger to him.</i>

592
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,000
<i>If he wholly accepts your affection,</i>

593
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,710
<i>he will do whatever it takes…</i>

594
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,050
<i>to keep you out of danger.</i>

595
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,140
<i>Even if he cannot forgive me</i>
<i>for the next thousand years,</i>

596
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,300
<i>I have no choice.</i>

597
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,520
Tomorrow night.

598
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:09,030
I will bring Yeo-ri
to the shrine at the Association.

599
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,110
Excellent.

600
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,780
That is excellent.

601
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,660
<i>Hence,</i>

602
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,540
<i>I am sorry, but please die here and now.</i>

603
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,320
<i>What is he doing here?</i>

604
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,360
<i>Why should I care?</i>

605
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,360
<i>I just need to separate her</i>
<i>from Gangcheori</i>

606
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,700
<i>and accept my feast.</i>

607
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,330
<i>That is how I save Gangcheori.</i>

608
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,590
FORBIDDEN

609
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,950
You startled me.
Why must you always appear like that?

610
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,330
What took you so long?

611
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,460
Where is the ghost's
identification pendant?

612
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,130
Follow me.

613
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,360
I did not get a good look last time.

614
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,480
This shrine…

615
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,280
is quite something.

616
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:17,450
It was built to optimize

617
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,530
the gathering and harnessing
of fire energy.

618
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,870
The identification pendant
should be inside there.

619
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:02,830
Where in the world is it?

620
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,210
And we meet again.

621
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,380
How in the world are you here?

622
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,820
Bibi.

623
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,450
Did you deceive me?

624
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:45,910
Why?

625
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:48,210
Gangcheori changed because of you.

626
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:50,290
At this rate,

627
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:53,710
he will give up on what he has endured
all these long years for.

628
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:55,090
I will not let that happen.

629
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,050
I will never sacrifice him.

630
00:48:58,590 --> 00:48:59,800
You heard everything.

631
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,720
I am here today to find another way--

632
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,010
Yes.

633
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,100
I am sure that is how you feel now.

634
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,560
However, that very desire…

635
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,100
will only encourage him to go further.

636
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,610
I do not care if he hates me for eternity.

637
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:17,360
As long as he is safe.

638
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,400
I know you…

639
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:05,130
<i>You just need to bring</i>
<i>that Imugi to the shrine.</i>

640
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,060
Yeo-ri.

641
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:07,610
It appears you are hell-bent on dying.

642
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:23,710
Bibi.

643
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,220
You will not get in my way this time.

644
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:31,260
Lord Imugi Bibi has agreed to help me.

645
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,060
What do you think you are doing right now?

646
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:36,980
Bibi!

647
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:39,480
What is the meaning of this?

648
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,860
This is all for your sake.

649
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:44,400
All because you have changed!

650
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,190
- What did you say?
- This is for the better.

651
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,410
I will kill that wench tonight

652
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,910
and get you out of that wretched body.

653
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,000
That is enough, Bibi.

654
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,250
I do not want to fight you.

655
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:42,920
I do not, either.

656
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,750
However,

657
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,250
this is how I protect you.

658
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,710
Bibi!

659
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,140
Bibi, stop here.

660
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:39,140
No. I must get you out of that body.

661
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:41,640
That body is not you!

662
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:53,450
<i>This whole shrine is</i>
<i>full of sweltering fire energy.</i>

663
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:54,700
<i>At this rate,</i>

664
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,990
<i>they will both be completely depleted</i>
<i>of their water-based energies.</i>

665
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:18,340
There we go. We are almost there.

666
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:20,140
<i>He…</i>

667
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,390
<i>was not after me.</i>

668
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,230
It is now time

669
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,020
for you to leave

670
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,150
that wretched body!

671
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,320
You cannot, Bibi! Please stop.

672
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,150
You two should not be fighting right now.

673
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,780
He is waiting for one of you two to die!

674
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,580
What?

675
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,250
What does that mean?

676
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:52,170
The luminous pearl.

677
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,880
He wants the luminous pearl!

678
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:57,510
Luminous pearl…

679
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,050
What?

680
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,140
No!

681
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,200
Bibi.

682
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,370
Bibi!

683
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:29,620
Bibi!

684
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,170
Bibi, you will be all right.

685
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,930
No.

686
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:42,100
No, Bibi!

687
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:48,600
I feel weird…

688
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:51,650
It's all right.

689
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:52,900
I<i>…</i>

690
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,940
No…

691
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:41,360
<i>The luminous pearl…</i>

692
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,730
No!

693
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,340
Gangcheori, we need to get out of here.

694
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,300
He devoured the pearl.
We don't know what will happen next.

695
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,590
Hurry.

696
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:07,200
The Warrior Deity

697
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,330
has devoured the luminous pearl!

698
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,880
Bibi, hang in there.

699
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,570
Gangcheori.

700
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,650
Stop.

701
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,200
You can let me down now.

702
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:52,790
Sit.

703
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:57,000
Bibi.

704
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,170
Bibi, you will be fine.

705
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,550
Serves me right.

706
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:05,050
I just let myself be tricked

707
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:07,680
by that blind scoundrel.

708
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,260
The King's grandfather…

709
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,690
He is the true benefactor
of that scoundrel.

710
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:20,150
Stop talking.

711
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:22,980
Your luminous pearl.
I will reclaim it for you.

712
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:25,110
Until then, just please…

713
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,410
Have you ever seen an Imugi…

714
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,410
without one?

715
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:36,330
Bibi…

716
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:38,790
I just…

717
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,580
wanted to protect you.

718
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:46,710
Seeing you stray so far away…

719
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:50,510
upset me

720
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,550
and scared me.

721
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:54,680
You know?

722
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,600
I do. I know, Bibi.

723
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:07,690
Bibi.

724
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:10,700
Bibi!

725
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:57,330
Bibi.

726
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,250
Bibi!

727
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:06,460
Bibi!

728
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,380
Bibi!

729
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,820
SPECIAL THANKS TO SONG JAE-HEE

730
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,260
My heart just hurts so much.

731
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,550
What in the world is wrong with me?

732
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:57,720
Now, I know

733
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,850
who the true benefactor of the ghost is.

734
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:01,470
<i>It is Lord Kim Bong-in.</i>

735
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,730
<i>That is impossible.</i>
<i>Yeo-ri must be mistaken.</i>

736
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:09,070
<i>The Warrior Deity has gained</i>
<i>stronger power than ever before.</i>

737
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:10,610
<i>We must hurry.</i>

738
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:13,030
<i>We shall set out as soon</i>
<i>as day breaks tomorrow.</i>

739
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:16,780
<i>Command that ghost</i>
<i>to end the King's life right now!</i>

740
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,530
Once His Majesty retires to slumber,

741
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,790
<i>secretly let them out.</i>

742
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:22,830
<i>Choi Won-u was hiding something.</i>

743
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:26,750
