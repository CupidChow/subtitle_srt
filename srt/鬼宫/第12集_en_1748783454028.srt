1
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,917
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,210
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS

3
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,421
WERE FILMED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

4
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,664
<i>When a mortal dies,</i>
<i>the soul remains behind.</i>

5
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,999
<i>However, when a divine entity</i>
<i>like an Imugi perishes,</i>

6
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,920
<i>not a single trace</i>
<i>of its existence is left behind</i>

7
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,048
<i>as if it never existed.</i>

8
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,303
<i>No even…</i>

9
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,390
<i>a single trace.</i>

10
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,292
Gangcheori.

11
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,752
Yeo-ri…

12
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,797
It hurts.

13
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,049
It hurts so much.

14
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,052
My heart…

15
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,139
My heart just hurts so much.

16
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,184
If I tear out this heart,

17
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,146
will the pain stop?

18
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,152
Please help me.

19
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,238
What in the world is wrong with me?

20
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,952
I'm sorry, Gangcheori.

21
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,372
Because of me, Bibi…

22
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,544
You should just hate and resent me.

23
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,881
Bibi ended up like that because of me.

24
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,383
So, Gangcheori…

25
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,554
just hate me, all right?

26
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,719
My lord, these are them.

27
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,185
What were you two doing
at the Association of the Blind?

28
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,854
The King's grandfather…

29
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,109
He is the true benefactor
of that scoundrel.

30
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,738
The Association
has already been shut down.

31
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,740
I asked why you two were there.

32
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,452
Answer me this instant.

33
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:50,290
Announcing His Majesty!

34
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,462
My lord, what is the meaning of this?

35
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,089
Your Majesty.

36
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,300
Last night, they trespassed
onto the grounds

37
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,552
of the now-defunct
Association of the Blind.

38
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,679
Hence, I had them apprehended.

39
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,229
What happened on the Association grounds?

40
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,647
Your Majesty. Why--

41
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,691
Your Majesty, Noble Elder Pung-san

42
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,693
was at the shrine on the grounds.

43
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,237
You wench.

44
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,614
A lowly creature's safety
is not guaranteed here.

45
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,325
You dare run that mouth?

46
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,536
Countless soldiers have searched
every corner of the Capital

47
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,538
but have failed to locate him.

48
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,459
Then, how could he have appeared
once more on the Association grounds?

49
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,128
However, I am certain it was him.

50
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,882
I had given them a royal command.

51
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,509
Your Majesty.

52
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,305
I commanded them to carry out
a closer inspection of the shrine.

53
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,183
They were just carrying out my command.

54
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,935
I see, Your Majesty.

55
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,854
You may leave now, my lord.

56
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,485
Yes. I shall now take
my leave, Your Majesty.

57
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,284
You may withdraw your troops.

58
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,369
Yes, Your Majesty.

59
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,038
Leave us at once!

60
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,088
My goodness. What happened, Yeo-ri?

61
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,632
Sang-deuk.

62
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,135
What in the world happened?

63
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,887
And what is wrong with this fellow?

64
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,639
It was a trap.

65
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,518
I went to the shrine in search
of the ghost's identification pendant,

66
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,813
but Noble Elder Pung-san
and the Eight-foot-tall Ghost were there…

67
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,609
Your Majesty.

68
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,569
Now, I know

69
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,656
who the true benefactor
of the ghost and the Yapper is.

70
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,664
It is Lord Kim Bong-in.

71
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,922
Did you…

72
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,967
just say Lord Kim Bong-in?

73
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

74
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,388
That is impossible.

75
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,224
How could he be?

76
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,479
You must be mistaken.

77
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,816
I, too…

78
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,236
pray I am mistaken.

79
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,299
It is impossible.

80
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,010
It cannot be.

81
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,724
Even if Yeo-ri is known to be trustworthy,

82
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,894
she may not be aware
of the entire situation.

83
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,270
Do you not agree?

84
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,689
She must have made a mistake.

85
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,775
Yes, Your Majesty.

86
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,737
Yes.

87
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,698
Yeo-ri must be mistaken.

88
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,037
What is this?

89
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,458
Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri
and Examiner Yoon Gap are still alive.

90
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,126
Explain yourself.

91
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,638
You scoundrel, how dare you!

92
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,808
Last night, the Warrior Deity

93
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,436
gained what he sought.

94
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,105
What do you mean by "what he sought"?

95
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,816
He devoured
the luminous pearl of an Imugi.

96
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,362
Thus, he has fully recovered
from the injury Gangcheori inflicted

97
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,323
and has gained stronger power
than ever before.

98
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,661
The Warrior Deity is no longer
just a vicious vengeful ghost.

99
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,121
He has truly risen
to the ranks of the gods.

100
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,454
Could it be money problems?

101
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,879
Could he be exhausted from eating
nothing but porridge recently?

102
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,385
My goodness.

103
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,983
<i>Shadow the Chief State Councillor.</i>

104
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,578
Wait. Hold on.

105
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:24,332
It should not be facing that way.
It should face this way.

106
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,666
There you go.

107
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,752
There you go.

108
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:41,932
Haetae has long been known
to be a deity that blocks fire energy.

109
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,561
Having Haetae sculptures
in all four cardinal corners

110
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,522
should definitely be helpful.

111
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:53,194
While Yeo-ri and Examiner Yoon Gap
are absent from the Capital,

112
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,989
I shall protect you
from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

113
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:04,288
But why is Examiner Yoon Gap not present?

114
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,084
He always played with me in the yard
when you visited the Queen's Palace.

115
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,796
He did not come to the palace today

116
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,048
because he was not feeling well.

117
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,221
Still?

118
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,431
Shall I send a physician?

119
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,058
No, Your Majesty.

120
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,811
It is not a physical issue…

121
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:31,023
Yes, I am sure a deep affliction
of the heart is to blame.

122
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,194
Did you say he lost a longtime comrade?

123
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,364
Yes.

124
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:42,159
And the Eight-foot-tall Ghost is
now an even more vicious evil spirit.

125
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,247
Yes.

126
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,544
We must hurry.

127
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,047
We shall set out as soon
as day breaks tomorrow.

128
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,358
Your Majesty.

129
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,655
Are you all right?

130
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,082
Yeo-ri.

131
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,668
Yes, my lord?

132
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,921
Well…

133
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,550
Is he very sick?

134
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,051
Examiner Yoon Gap.

135
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,263
Yes, a bit…

136
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:50,269
Well, do not read into this too much.

137
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:54,857
I still cannot stand
how he behaves around His Majesty,

138
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,484
but what can I do?

139
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,944
His Majesty needs him

140
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,697
and sometimes,
His Majesty even enjoys his company.

141
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,242
Then, I cannot help but find myself
be concerned about him.

142
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,497
Sorry… I am afraid I do not understand.

143
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,540
Thus…

144
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,167
I have these.

145
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,420
They are <i>yugwa.</i>

146
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,758
I had them especially made

147
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,344
by a talented palace maid
at the Royal Confectionery.

148
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:28,057
There is nothing better
than sweet <i>yugwa</i> when you are blue.

149
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,684
Thank you.

150
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,230
I am sure Examiner Yoon Gap
will be thrilled.

151
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,607
Sure. Good.

152
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,484
Then, I should get back to it.

153
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,528
You know? All right?

154
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,595
Hey.

155
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,973
Why are you not eating?

156
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,225
After all your complaining
about side dishes recently,

157
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,435
I went out and got all this
from a big banquet.

158
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,853
Eat some more.

159
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,774
I do not have an appetite.

160
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,236
Why not?

161
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,114
My goodness. Gap…

162
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,117
Gosh.

163
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,327
What is with him recently?

164
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,080
Maybe he wanted a meat side dish?

165
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,126
Oh my…

166
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,627
Please enjoy.

167
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,891
Gap.

168
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,227
Come here.

169
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,280
Here, Gap.

170
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,115
Go ahead and eat it.

171
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,826
I managed to get two.

172
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,455
I could not put it on the table
because the monks do not eat meat.

173
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,207
I will give the other to Yeo-ri.
That one is for you.

174
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,129
What is the matter?
Is there something on my face?

175
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,759
Stop staring at me like that and eat it.

176
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,970
If you keep starving yourself,
you will end up collapsing.

177
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,096
You will have no energy!

178
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,894
I will eat it later.

179
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,359
Goodness me. Just eat it now…

180
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,263
You asked about who recommended
Pung-san to me.

181
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,228
It was Prince Yeongin's nanny.

182
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,773
After the late king passed,

183
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,194
I was going through a difficult time
and she introduced him to me

184
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,862
as someone whom I could trust.

185
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,825
However, after our recent conversation,

186
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,286
I summoned her once more.
After some pressing,

187
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,663
she admitted…

188
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:43,752
Lord Kim Bong-in threatened her
to do so back then.

189
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,091
I did not have the slightest idea…

190
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,178
and let myself be deceived by him…

191
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,938
Your Majesty, how much longer
must I await my punishment?

192
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,108
You know about everything.

193
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,112
I…

194
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,157
told Pung-san…

195
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,161
about the Queen's pregnancy.

196
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,372
Because of me,

197
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,750
Prince Yeongin died.

198
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,629
And because of me, the Queen…

199
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,799
Your Grace.

200
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,728
Thank you for telling me.

201
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,095
Your Majesty,
I followed after His Lord's bodyguard

202
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,473
<i>when he suspiciously</i>
<i>left his side late in the night.</i>

203
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,309
<i>I witnessed him</i>
<i>meeting with Pung-san's servant.</i>

204
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,439
<i>I attempted to catch Pung-san</i>
<i>by following that servant,</i>

205
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,691
but I ended up losing him.

206
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,360
Forgive me.

207
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,033
How should we proceed, Your Majesty?

208
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,871
Summon the Chief State Councillor.

209
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,966
Your Majesty.

210
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,051
The Chief State Councillor
is here for you.

211
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,537
Your Majesty.

212
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,956
I answer your summons.

213
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,847
Do you recognize this object?

214
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,182
Is this not…

215
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,686
the <i>tonggae</i> that was
once cherished by the late king?

216
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,522
Yes, you are correct.

217
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,524
TONGGAE: USED TO CARRY BOW
AND ARROWS

218
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,278
<i>After it became soaked</i>
<i>in blood due to the late king's mania,</i>

219
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,114
<i>you had…</i>

220
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,826
<i>carefully cleaned it</i>

221
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,120
<i>and conditioned its leather,</i>

222
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,664
<i>before bringing it to me.</i>

223
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,792
<i>How could I forget?</i>

224
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,923
<i>That day, Your Majesty let</i>
<i>these old arms embrace you</i>

225
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:21,345
<i>as you shed sorrowful tears</i>
<i>like a small child.</i>

226
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,475
<i>Yes.</i>

227
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,519
<i>It felt as though</i>

228
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,398
you were showing me your determination
to move past those horrific events

229
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,858
through that cleaned <i>tonggae</i>.

230
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,946
It felt like
you were promising to protect me

231
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,116
as I ascended to the throne
as the son of a deranged king.

232
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,788
I felt safe.

233
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,631
Then, how could you
have done such a thing?

234
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,678
I have spent my life studying

235
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,931
the duty of the people

236
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,475
and the obligation of the sovereign.

237
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,687
However, you used the voice
of a compassionate grandfather

238
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,524
and the face of the most faithful retainer

239
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,360
to kill your son-in-law,

240
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,905
and attempt to kill
both your grandson and great-grandson.

241
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,619
How am I to accept the beastly heart
that led you to summon a wicked ghost

242
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,372
to achieve your goal?

243
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,208
How can a person

244
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,212
commit such heinous, inhumane acts?

245
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,224
You only have yourself…

246
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,020
to blame for all that, Your Majesty.

247
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,064
What did you say?

248
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,734
I have mentioned it
to you countless times.

249
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,445
You must respect the natural order.

250
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,073
Do not make an enemy
out of the scholar-officials.

251
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,659
This old man's honest piece of advice

252
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,414
paved the path for a peaceful reign
and ensured safety for your heirs.

253
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,999
Then…

254
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,712
why did you not heed my words?

255
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,047
My lord!

256
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,842
Do you have any evidence
that proves I summoned that wicked ghost?

257
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:31,516
Your Majesty will not be able
to prove anything of the sort.

258
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,812
You must have discovered
I wielded that ghost

259
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,858
through that shaman brat named Yeo-ri.

260
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,403
Please feel free to bear
the disgrace of heretical ceremonies

261
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,572
and sacrifice that brat

262
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,075
to produce such evidence.

263
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,619
Even if you do manage to do so,

264
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,954
things will not go your way.

265
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,500
How many followers
do you believe you have in that court

266
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,169
as the king with questionable legitimacy

267
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,630
who ascended as the son
of a deranged king?

268
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,480
I have no need for evidence.

269
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,218
After all…

270
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,347
you just presented your confession.

271
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,477
Enter.

272
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,873
Kim Bong-in…

273
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,751
dared to order a blind fortune teller

274
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:27,132
to harm the late king and even attempted
to assassinate the Queen and the Prince.

275
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,136
There can be no higher treason.

276
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,431
He shall be
immediately stripped of his title,

277
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,433
have his assets confiscated,

278
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,894
and be exiled to Geoje Island!

279
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,479
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

280
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,816
Do not dawdle.

281
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,819
Drag that treasonous criminal away now!

282
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,519
<i>Gangcheori remains so distressed.</i>

283
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,314
<i>I cannot force him to go.</i>

284
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,441
<i>What should I do?</i>

285
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,704
<i>Maybe I can talk to His Majesty</i>
<i>and go without him?</i>

286
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,418
Gangcheori.

287
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,215
A long journey awaits us.
What took you so long?

288
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,427
I was thinking about
how I would go without you.

289
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,680
Have you lost your mind?

290
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,724
How could I send you alone
when that procession is swarming with men?

291
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,810
What?

292
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,400
Did you tell me to endure it
by hating and resenting you?

293
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,194
Do you think
that would be possible for me?

294
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,781
I may now have a fleeting grasp

295
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,701
of the mortal concept of loss…

296
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,788
but I am still Gangcheori.

297
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,374
I am not eternally foolish like mortals.

298
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,669
I have clear insight
into whom I should hate and resent.

299
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,088
Then?

300
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,673
That damn Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

301
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,926
I shall crush him.

302
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,430
I refuse to just idly stand by…

303
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,476
as he holds Bibi's luminous pearl.

304
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,317
Look at him. He deserves to die.

305
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,862
How could he do that to the Queen?

306
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,410
Who are you?

307
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,684
Yapper, you scoundrel.

308
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,564
What brings you here this late,
my lordship?

309
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,525
Did you say that Warrior Deity ghost
or whatever it is

310
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,652
is now stronger than ever?

311
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,404
Yes, I certainly did.

312
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,782
Then, command that ghost

313
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,493
to end the King's life right now!

314
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,788
Pardon? My goodness, my lordship…

315
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,419
I already told you, my lordship.

316
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,630
I do not know
what sort of protection he has,

317
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:57,675
but even the Warrior Deity
is unable to approach the King.

318
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,095
So, if you could just be
a little bit more patient--

319
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,181
My neck is already on the chopping block.

320
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,725
How much longer do you expect me to wait?

321
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,562
Stop wagging that silver tongue

322
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,606
and end the King's life

323
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,149
this instant!

324
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,953
You scoundrel.

325
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,246
How dare you…

326
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,973
There was a time when I needed you,

327
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,976
but I no longer do.

328
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,978
Hence,

329
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,522
I have no reason to hold back anymore.

330
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,277
You damn scoundrel, how dare you!

331
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,361
How--

332
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,763
That is…

333
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,307
Yongdam Village.

334
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,353
Such strange connections we share…

335
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,567
Yongdam Village serves as the hometown
for you and Yoon Gap.

336
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,821
It is where Imugi Gangcheori fell
to the ground amidst his ascension

337
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,617
and also the birthplace
of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

338
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,202
Yes, Your Majesty.

339
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:52,123
The connections are too strange
to be called a coincidence.

340
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,293
<i>I saw it.</i>

341
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,504
On the day I was born 100 years ago,

342
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,840
I saw you fall to the ground.

343
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,926
Then, why?

344
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,303
Why do you attack me and not them?

345
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,981
Head Eunuch, make your way
to the Ducheong-hyeon Magistrate

346
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:20,777
and see if there is
any useful information in the records.

347
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,654
Yes, Your Majesty.

348
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,762
Your Majesty.

349
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,598
I am honored to have you grace us
with your presence

350
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,851
in our lowly corner of the world.

351
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,854
Despite the circumstances,
I am pleased to see you again.

352
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,983
Even if you are the man

353
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,986
who left a single letter behind
before abandoning the King.

354
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,281
Your Majesty…

355
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,034
I was merely jesting. Nothing more.

356
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,248
The physician recommended
I visit a hot spring,

357
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,876
so I stopped by on my way
to the auxiliary palace,

358
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:22,881
after Examiner Yoon Gap spoke so highly
of Yongdam Village's beautiful scenery.

359
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,967
I am very glad that you did.
Please, come inside.

360
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,698
How is she doing?

361
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,951
Mak-geum and the old maid are
diligently keeping an eye on her.

362
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,036
Do not worry.

363
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,539
Once His Majesty retires to slumber,

364
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,750
secretly let her out.

365
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,502
I must send her to my wife's family.

366
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,670
Yes, Your Excellency.

367
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,390
What are you looking for?

368
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,935
That girl, In-seon, is nowhere to be seen.

369
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:21,230
What? Are you curious
about where the girl who likes you went?

370
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,316
Green with envy again?

371
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,861
Do not worry.
You are more than enough maiden for me.

372
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,947
What?

373
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,909
We need to find out about Choi Won-u's
ancestor from 100 years ago.

374
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,913
If a member of his family
is willing to show us kindness,

375
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,332
that is a good thing, is it not?
It could even be helpful.

376
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,792
That was why I was looking for her.

377
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,044
Sure. Great. I see.

378
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:47,006
Maybe you should just ask someone
where Lady In-seon is.

379
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,758
Excuse me.

380
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,094
Has Lady In-seon stepped out?

381
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,222
I am not sure.

382
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,149
Is this the last of it?

383
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,443
Here. That is the last one.

384
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:13,866
These are what remains of the daily logs
after the war 100 years ago.

385
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,161
There was fire everywhere
and people were being dragged away.

386
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,621
That is all that remains.

387
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,999
Are you sure there is nothing else?

388
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,501
Do your ears not work?

389
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,919
I said that is all that remains.

390
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,008
Hold on.

391
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:36,305
Are you sure you came
with the King's procession?

392
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,937
I am the head eunuch.

393
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,024
Head… eunuch?

394
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,654
My goodness.
I never imagined such a title…

395
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,907
- Why? What were you thinking?
- Just some eunuch…

396
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,535
- "Just some eunuch"?
- Pardon me, my lord. My apologies.

397
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,579
My lord,

398
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,707
the whole village is abuzz right now.

399
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,586
Having the King visit this small village
is a rare sight indeed.

400
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,172
Speaking of,

401
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,550
it has been almost 100 years
since we had the King visit.

402
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,803
What did you say?

403
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,265
Are you saying the King
visited Ducheong-hyeon before?

404
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,641
Yes.

405
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,644
The story is passed down
like a legend of sorts.

406
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,480
During the war 100 years ago,

407
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,483
they say the King once
came here to take refuge.

408
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,947
I heard it from my late grandfather.

409
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,201
During the war 100 years ago…

410
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,912
Do you speak of King Yeonjong?

411
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,513
It appears Your Majesty cherishes
Examiner Yoon Gap.

412
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,557
He even accompanies you to the hot spring.

413
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,604
He is a peerless, loyal subject
with exceptional intellect

414
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,357
who always conducts himself properly

415
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,484
without ever deviating
from proper etiquette.

416
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,445
How could I not cherish him?

417
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,075
Your Majesty, you are
much too kind with your praise.

418
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,827
I am simply overwhelmed.

419
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:26,791
So, you do know how to be respectful
but you simply refused to be up until now.

420
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,710
Pardon?

421
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,587
It is nothing.

422
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:43,474
Your great-great-grandfather,
Lord Choi Gil-sang…

423
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,144
Since I have come all this way,

424
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:51,023
would you allow me to see some of the work
the literary master of his time produced?

425
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,696
My great-great-grandfather
left behind so many books.

426
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,825
Was there a particular title
you were interested in?

427
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,203
I heard when the northern barbarians
invaded 100 years ago,

428
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,665
Lord Choi Gil-sang acted
as a safeguard for King Yeonjong.

429
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,710
May I see the text he produced
during that time?

430
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,468
It appears Your Majesty…

431
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:24,015
did not come to Yongdam Village
for the scenery.

432
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,073
Her father did this to my legs

433
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,075
and even took my life.

434
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:47,205
<i>I definitely banished</i>
<i>that one-legged ghost last time.</i>

435
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,165
<i>Is he back?</i>

436
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,878
<i>I sense his energy, but I do not see him.</i>

437
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,675
My lady! My goodness!

438
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,138
My goodness, my lady!

439
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,683
My lady, you cannot! Please stop!

440
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,893
My lady!

441
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,104
Goodness me.

442
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,439
My lady!

443
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,569
<i>Has the one-legged ghost</i>
<i>possessed her again?</i>

444
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,655
My goodness! My lady!

445
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,742
My great-great-grandfather left behind
a great amount of texts,

446
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,662
but he did not leave behind any

447
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,706
on the war 100 years ago.

448
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,125
Is that so?

449
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,131
Who goes there!

450
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,058
Step back.

451
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,107
Stop!

452
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,734
She is my daughter.

453
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,487
My daughter is seriously ill.

454
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,823
Please…

455
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,243
- My lady!
- My lady!

456
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,869
My goodness. My lady!

457
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,710
Hey, it has been a while.

458
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,837
Let go of me!

459
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,512
She is suffering from a <i>dongti.</i>

460
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,431
DONGTI: SUPERNATURAL AFFLICTION
BROUGHT BY THE WRATH OF SPIRITS

461
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,974
<i>Dongti</i>?

462
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,559
Something has gone awry

463
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,728
and Her Lady has been possessed
by a vengeful ghost.

464
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,564
What exactly happened to her?

465
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,776
You are the wench
who got in my way last time.

466
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,236
Are you at it again?

467
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,363
You will pay for this!

468
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,574
What happened to her?

469
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,410
I can only cure her
if you tell me the truth.

470
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,959
If we just let her be,
Her Lady's life will be in danger.

471
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:02,131
She said His Excellency's ancestor
was angered.

472
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,759
Who said that?

473
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,139
The shaman from the upper village.

474
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,934
So, an ancestral appeasement rite
was performed?

475
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,568
His Excellency had no other choice.

476
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:27,073
He has been experiencing a string
of strange incidents recently.

477
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,701
However, the day
after the ancestral appeasement rite,

478
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,579
Her Lady became…

479
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,748
She became what you see now…

480
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,959
That shaman made a mistake.

481
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,003
This is not an ancestral issue.

482
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,339
This is a vengeful ghost.

483
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,716
A ghost with an amputated leg.

484
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,967
A one-legged ghost.

485
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,058
Did you just say it had

486
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,102
an amputated leg?

487
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,064
You are the scoundrel who killed me!

488
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,233
You did it!

489
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,361
You did this to my leg!

490
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,742
In-seon…

491
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,703
Is that true?

492
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,130
I asked if that was true.

493
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,654
I did not mean to kill him at first.

494
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,201
Who is the one you killed?

495
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:59,999
His name was Jang Eon-su.
He used to be my book merchant.

496
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,168
Book merchant?

497
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,337
He stole books
that were my family heirlooms.

498
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,007
I caught him
and wanted to teach him a lesson,

499
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,925
but I went a bit too far…

500
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,846
He ended up losing his life as a result.

501
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,973
When did that happen?

502
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,020
It happened five years ago.

503
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,397
Five years ago.

504
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:30,488
That was around the time
you stepped down from your government post

505
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,574
and returned to your hometown.

506
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,124
Let us try to save your daughter first.

507
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,793
It appears it will not be too late…

508
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,006
to have you pay for your murder later.

509
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,055
Your Majesty…

510
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,688
Your Majesty.

511
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,400
I reviewed all the records
at the magistrate,

512
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:12,196
but I did not find anything noteworthy
on the war 100 years ago.

513
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,906
However,

514
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,700
I did hear a strange tale.

515
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,703
What did it entail?

516
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,667
They say King Yeonjong

517
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:30,172
came to Yongdam Village to take refuge
from the war 100 years ago.

518
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,550
What did you say?

519
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,886
There is no official record of it.

520
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,723
It was a sort of legend
that was passed down by word of mouth.

521
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,851
The pieces of the fragmented narrative
are coming together.

522
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,021
It must mean King Yeonjong
and the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

523
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,649
experienced some sort of conflict
here in Yongdam Village.

524
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,944
The remaining missing pieces

525
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,697
are probably held
by that book merchant, Jang Eon-su.

526
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,031
Jang Eon-su?

527
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,659
Do you mean the ghost
that has possessed his daughter?

528
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,704
Did you not sense it earlier?

529
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:05,082
Choi Won-u was hiding something.

530
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,502
That secret is probably hidden
in one of the books the merchant stole.

531
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,881
- Where are you going?
- Why do you…

532
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,884
Yeo-ri asked me to do something.

533
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,887
I doubt she did.

534
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,391
Why that little…

535
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:41,118
You should drink some water.
You do not want to choke.

536
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:42,703
Here.

537
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,295
Did Yeo-ri not tell you?

538
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:57,384
This was made by a renowned palace maid
from the Royal Confectionery.

539
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,971
She only agreed to make them
because I asked her to.

540
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,515
Even the royal palace chef
could not do better.

541
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,729
Since they are so tasty,
you should have one, too, Grilled Abalone.

542
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,335
I, too, lost my sister when I was young.

543
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,962
Our family was so dirt poor,

544
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:37,049
we could not even afford to get her
any medicine before she passed.

545
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,136
I could not let the rest
of my siblings end up like that,

546
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,681
so I willingly decided to become a eunuch.

547
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:49,061
How do mortals endure it
every time someone dies?

548
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,189
Well, there are some regrets

549
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,732
and some guilt…

550
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,486
You miss them…

551
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,782
And before I realized it,
the years have passed by in a flash.

552
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:08,956
So tasty.

553
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,354
It is the hour of the rat now.

554
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,690
Are you sure
you can save Her Lady this way?

555
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,650
I need to try first.

556
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,785
FIRE

557
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:07,097
WATER

558
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,063
WATER

559
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,876
FIRE

560
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,967
<i>This is the remedy</i>
<i>that undoes the wrongdoing</i>

561
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,428
<i>to set it right.</i>

562
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,514
WATER

563
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,045
My lady.

564
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:29,846
My lady!

565
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,106
You wench. You dare get in my way again?

566
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,984
I will make you pay!

567
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,165
Are you all right?

568
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,710
- Behind you.
- What?

569
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,128
- Behind you!
- Behind me?

570
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,133
We need to catch him.

571
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,345
That damn straw-stuffed punk…

572
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,267
That punk just has
to make things difficult.

573
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:40,167
- That little punk…
- Hold on. Just give me a moment.

574
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,340
Not yet.

575
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:55,432
You can slash me with a sword
or lock me up in that chest for eternity.

576
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,851
But still, I desperately desire

577
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:02,022
to get my revenge
on that old geezer first.

578
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,067
How can you even say that
after torturing that girl for so long?

579
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,361
What is it? What is your revenge?

580
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,197
The very thing

581
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,449
that old geezer dreaded the most…

582
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,620
I want that book to be revealed
for the world to see.

583
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,374
I want that book filled
with terrible royal secrets

584
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,250
to be released for all to see.

585
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,504
That is the revenge I seek.

586
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:29,091
What could possibly be in that book
for you to cause such a mess?

587
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,802
It is an extraordinary book.

588
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,554
A tale of the King
of this nation 100 years ago

589
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,682
and a certain military officer.

590
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,575
How did it go?

591
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,244
Were you able to exorcise that ghost?

592
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,831
Yes. We managed to catch
the one-legged ghost.

593
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,920
Then, the scoundrel
who has been tormenting for so long

594
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,881
is done for.

595
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,050
Yes.

596
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:17,639
However, the ghost told us
something quite strange.

597
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,724
What do you mean?

598
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,892
He abruptly told us "that book"

599
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,353
was hidden in the spot where he died.

600
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,606
Can you make any sense
of what he was referring to?

601
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,863
Did you not hear His Lord earlier?

602
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:38,243
He was a brazen book merchant
who stole precious books from him.

603
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,203
It must have been one of those books.

604
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,832
- Am I right, my lord?
- Your Majesty.

605
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:47,669
That book merchant died
while being flogged in this very yard.

606
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,338
How could he have hidden a book here?

607
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,215
Is that so?

608
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,551
How can we believe the words of a ghost?

609
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,762
He must have lied.

610
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,941
A few months ago,

611
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:54,152
you sold off a whole bunch of books to me.

612
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,238
I do not know how it got mixed in,

613
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,615
but I came across something
I should not have seen.

614
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:01,493
It was a book that looked
to be about 100 years old.

615
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,831
Now, you finally make eye contact.

616
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:09,668
Yes, that is right.
<i>The Anthology of Light and Darkness</i>.

617
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:14,714
The sentences are so elegant,
but the subject matter is quite intense.

618
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,425
Since it is a book filled
with such sensitive, royal secrets,

619
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,845
if that book was ever released
into the world,

620
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:23,223
it would greatly tarnish the reputation
of you and your family.

621
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,018
That book…

622
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,688
Where is it now?

623
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,774
Hand it over this instant.

624
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,320
Jeez. He has me waiting here forever.
What is taking him so long?

625
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,914
THE ANTHOLOGY OF LIGHT
AND DARKNESS

626
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,464
Finally, my lord.

627
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:41,217
So? Were you able to secure the money?

628
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,150
You know, I am surprised
by how little 200 <i>nyang</i>

629
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,611
actually weigh in real life.

630
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,822
- What?
- But I have some bad news.

631
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,700
I forgot to bring the actual book.

632
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,744
I will be sure to bring it next time,

633
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,038
so please prepare
another 300 <i>nyang, </i>my lord.

634
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,331
Why, you!

635
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:15,210
That is a small price to pay
to save the family name.

636
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,132
You damn vermin.

637
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,968
How dare you insult my family!

638
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,095
Please do not do this.

639
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,440
Why you old geezer…

640
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,492
You have until tomorrow.

641
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,910
It's 300 <i>nyang.</i>

642
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,872
Why, you rotten bastard!

643
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,876
Sniveling book merchant…

644
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,690
Who knew it would be hidden here?

645
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,334
THE ANTHOLOGY OF LIGHT
AND DARKNESS

646
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:03,378
Forgive me, Great-great-grandfather.

647
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,256
In order to save our family…

648
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:21,938
What are you doing?

649
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,022
Hot!

650
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,861
- What are you…
- Jeez.

651
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,823
Just look at it. The book is a mess now.

652
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,494
Well, at least the pages inside
are perfectly fine.

653
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,954
What do you think you are doing?

654
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,414
Hand it over this instant!

655
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,583
- I do not want to.
- Such impertinence!

656
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,668
Hand it over! Right now!

657
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,674
Your Majesty.

658
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,597
Everything is in this book.

659
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,896
THE ANTHOLOGY OF LIGHT
AND DARKNESS

660
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,357
How the Eight-foot-tall Ghost was born…

661
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,799
<i>Step forth and face me if you will.</i>

662
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,344
I will never back down.

663
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:37,305
I will never kneel before you.

664
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:43,561
I will look directly into your eyes

665
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,898
to face you and fight.

666
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,441
I refuse…

667
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,654
to bow down to you!

668
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,040
Warrior Deity…

669
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:10,917
<i>Is everything in this book true?</i>

670
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,794
<i>This place was truly hell back then.</i>

671
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:13,920
<i>The Eight-foot-tall Ghost…</i>

672
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,422
The grudges of the villagers of Yongdam
from 100 years ago are intertwined.

673
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:18,424
<i>The Prince's chambers!</i>

674
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,053
<i>Lord Yoon Gap?</i>

675
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:25,098
<i>It does not make any sense. Why release</i>
<i>a soul he devoured for no reason?</i>

676
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,225
On purpose? Why?

677
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:28,851
<i>It has all been taken from me.</i>

678
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,687
<i>Foster that grudge.</i>

679
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,524
<i>You just need to lure out</i>
<i>Examiner Yoon Gap for me.</i>

680
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:37,735
<i>I might not be able</i>
<i>to protect Yeo-ri at this rate…</i>
