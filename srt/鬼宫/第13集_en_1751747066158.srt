1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,420
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,170
100 YEARS AGO

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,720
<i>Month of the Ox, Year of the Fire Rat.</i>

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,680
<i>The winter this year</i>

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,390
<i>has been especially cold.</i>

7
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,270
<i>On the day a bitter wind swept through,</i>

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,060
<i>the king set out of the palace,</i>
<i>garbed in the dragon robe.</i>

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,810
<i>Enemy forces were closing in</i>
<i>on the Capital</i>

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,900
<i>and the threat of it falling</i>
<i>was far too great to ignore.</i>

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,320
<i>This became known</i>

12
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,160
<i>as the flight of the King.</i>

13
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,300
<i>However, the enemy forces' pursuit</i>
<i>was relentless,</i>

14
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,180
<i>and the safety of the King resembled</i>
<i>a flickering candle in the wind.</i>

15
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,890
<i>That was when a military officer</i>
<i>stepped forward.</i>

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,560
Escort Officer Cheon Geum-hwi
of the Royal Guards Command

17
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,110
at your service, Your Majesty.

18
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,990
Yongdam Village is
a day's distance to the south.

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,530
It is my hometown.

20
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,990
It is known as the village
where dragons ascended from

21
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,660
and its mountain ridges tower above.
It would serve as an ideal refuge.

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,120
Yongdam Village…

23
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,710
All right. Let us go there.

24
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,380
Halt!

25
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,850
Your Majesty, you must flee this instant.

26
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,020
There are enemy forces encamped
at the foot of Mount Paltae.

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Your Majesty.

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,990
The foot of Mount Paltae is
just north of Yongdam Village.

29
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,400
He is right, Your Majesty.

30
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,530
It appears they have already
discovered our travel route.

31
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,410
We must change course, Your Majesty.

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,160
But where are we to go now?

33
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,250
Where do I go to stay alive?

34
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,500
Perhaps, we should swiftly make
our way south--

35
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,840
And what if they follow us?

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,130
What, then?

37
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,590
All right.

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,640
Send someone to Yongdam Village

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,350
and have them raise
the ceremonial flag high.

40
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,190
We must make our enemies think
that I am headed there.

41
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,820
That deception should give us
enough time to flee.

42
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

43
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,940
That is a great idea, Your Majesty.

44
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,120
You cannot, Your Majesty.

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,240
That will leave the inhabitants
of Yongdam Village in danger.

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,500
If you can just permit me one hour,

47
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,750
I will be able to evacuate them.
Please, permit me that time, Your Majesty.

48
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,130
You fool!

49
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,920
Our enemies will figure it all out
if the villagers are evacuated.

50
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,340
The greater cause demands sacrifice.

51
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,850
Your Majesty!

52
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,730
Yongdam Village is home
to my elderly mother and young son.

53
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,310
Please, Your Majesty!

54
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,540
He cannot be allowed to botch things up.

55
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,500
Bind him and ensure he cannot escape.

56
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,960
Let us go.

57
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,200
<i>That night, we survived</i>

58
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,250
<i>and they died in our place.</i>

59
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,500
<i>How will we ever pay</i>

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,460
<i>for this grievous sin?</i>

61
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,930
Is everything

62
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,940
in this book true?

63
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,560
Did King Yeonjong

64
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,480
truly sacrifice all the villagers here

65
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,780
to flee from enemy forces?

66
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,950
Thus, this Cheon Geum-hwi fellow…

67
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,120
harbored a great grudge
against the royal family…

68
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,000
and became the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,170
to get his revenge--

70
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,670
Your Majesty.

71
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,220
My great-great-grandfather

72
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,260
dared to write about
the private affairs of the royal family.

73
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,510
This blasphemous sin…

74
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,810
should never be forgiven.

75
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,980
I shall decide your fate later.

76
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,860
You may leave me now.

77
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

78
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,590
THE ANTHOLOGY OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS

79
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,600
Yeo-ri?

80
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,350
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

81
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,060
I have suddenly been struck

82
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,360
by an immense sadness
that is hard to bear.

83
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,820
Is it Cheon Geum-hwi's sadness?

84
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,030
I suspect

85
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,700
it might be, Your Majesty.

86
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,040
It appears Cheon Geum-hwi

87
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,590
was filled with bitter sorrow
and crushing guilt because he believed

88
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,130
his family and the villagers
all died because of him.

89
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,300
He was overwhelmed by sadness
and suffered immensely.

90
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,850
Thus, it appears that led him
to become that terrible, evil spirit.

91
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,230
However, it was not
just one person's sorrow.

92
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,940
It was dozens.

93
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,020
No, it was the sorrow
of even more than that.

94
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,070
And it swept over me, all at once.

95
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,620
Now, I understand
why his energy felt so chaotic.

96
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,660
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost…

97
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,000
was not alone.

98
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,830
He is not alone?

99
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,420
What does that mean?

100
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,670
Cheon Geum-hwi's grudge

101
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,920
and the grudges
of the villagers of Yongdam

102
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,970
from 100 years ago are intertwined.

103
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,260
Have you forgotten?

104
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,140
It is an ember ghost
who was burned to death.

105
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,520
However, that book does not mention
anything of the sort.

106
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,940
That means
something else happened afterward.

107
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,450
I cannot believe it.

108
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,200
How can a king sacrifice
his own people like that

109
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,790
just to save himself?

110
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,630
Not all kings were
like the one reigning now.

111
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,670
Especially, amidst warfare.

112
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,720
You were here 100 years ago,

113
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,180
you must have seen everything.

114
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,970
I was unaware of the execution
of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost,

115
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,350
but this place was truly hell back then.

116
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,480
Villagers were letting out bloody cries
as they burned in their fiery graves,

117
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,900
but the ones who fled to save themselves

118
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,490
remained unbelievably vile
and contemptible.

119
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,110
Thus,

120
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,330
that is why you loathed mortals so.

121
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,290
Do you

122
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,130
still loathe them now?

123
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,770
Yeo-ri.

124
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,780
My lord?

125
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,000
Lord Yoon Gap?

126
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,140
What is the matter?

127
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,740
What is wrong with you?

128
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,030
I just saw Lord Yoon Gap's soul.

129
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,410
- What?
- I am certain it was him.

130
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,540
He must have escaped
from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

131
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,910
It does not make any sense.

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,710
He has become even mightier
after devouring Bibi's luminous pearl.

133
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,880
Why release a soul he devoured
for no reason?

134
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,670
Unless he was spat out on purpose…

135
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,420
On purpose?

136
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,470
Why?

137
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,680
The fire energy
is especially strong tonight.

138
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,560
It would be an ideal night
for the Eight-foot-tall Ghost to act.

139
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,990
The Prince's chambers!

140
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,710
Your Highness!

141
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,340
- My goodness. Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

142
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,930
- Your Highness.
- The evil spirit…

143
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,350
- Is the evil spirit back?
- Your Highness.

144
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,770
Stay away. Stay away from me.

145
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,990
Your Highness! Your--

146
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,700
No!

147
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,540
Your Highness.

148
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,260
It is over now.

149
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,640
You are safe.

150
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,570
You are safe now.

151
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,980
<i>I have already prayed for half a day,</i>
<i>but Lord Yoon Gap has yet to appear.</i>

152
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,560
<i>Could I have been mistaken?</i>

153
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,690
<i>It does not make any sense.</i>

154
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,320
He has become even mightier
after devouring Bibi's luminous pearl.

155
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,690
Why release a soul he devoured
for no reason?

156
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Unless he was spat out on purpose…

157
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,620
<i>I am sure I saw Lord Yoon Gap's soul.</i>

158
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,920
<i>I just need to find his soul first</i>
<i>and then, ask him what happened.</i>

159
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,880
<i>After that, his body…</i>

160
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,380
Yeo-ri.

161
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,880
<i>His body should be returned…</i>

162
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,350
Let us go.

163
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,360
Come on.

164
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,570
Where?

165
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,870
The lord's daughter prepared
tea and sweets for us.

166
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,880
I heard you saved me once again, my lord.

167
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,300
Thank you so much.

168
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,010
That was not me.
Yeo-ri was the one who saved you.

169
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,970
You would have been in big trouble
if it were not for her.

170
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,850
I am aware. I heard it from Mak-geum.

171
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,890
Thanks.

172
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,850
Sure.

173
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,230
I asked to see you
because I had a question for you, my lord.

174
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,200
I have been cured of my illness,
but there is still tension in the air.

175
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,280
Father remains silently grim.

176
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,580
And the steward is busy shushing everyone.

177
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,660
What in the world happened yesterday?

178
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,580
Well, you see, your father--

179
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,000
How would we know?

180
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,210
His Lord and I do not know anything.

181
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:03,060
I understand you two are like
siblings who grew up in the same village,

182
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,480
but why are you two always together?

183
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,690
Men and women should keep
a certain distance.

184
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,900
- What are you doing?
- It is my way of saying

185
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,990
His Lord and I go beyond a sibling bond.

186
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,000
Are you saying

187
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,660
His Lord gave you that?

188
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Then…

189
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,630
My lord?

190
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,060
The caragana is about to bloom.

191
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,730
Yes. It is amazing, is it not?

192
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,350
Despite it being a spring flower,

193
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,150
it appears it is still trying to bloom
in the middle of winter.

194
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,620
Your Majesty. It is I, the Head Eunuch.

195
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,830
You may enter.

196
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,800
Your Majesty,
this report just arrived from the palace.

197
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,820
What does it say, Your Majesty?

198
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,580
Lord Kim Bong-in who fled
during his exile procession…

199
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,660
was found in the mountains
near the Capital…

200
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,550
as a slain body.

201
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,890
My goodness. How did that happen?

202
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,020
I did not mean anything by it
when I showed Her Lady this.

203
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,430
She asked about our relationship

204
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,600
and I could not tell her
we were patron deity and disciple.

205
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,690
That is why.

206
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
All right.

207
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,860
But…

208
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,320
why do you fret so?

209
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,990
Fret? Who is fretting? Not me.

210
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,120
Do not fret.

211
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,870
I have no interest
in Choi Won-u's daughter.

212
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,120
Not even in the slightest.

213
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,670
Do you just make flowers bloom
for a woman you have no interest in?

214
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,880
What?

215
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,800
I was not going to be
this petty and point it out.

216
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,630
Last time, you had
a warm breeze blow through

217
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,470
to make the wild chrysanthemums bloom.

218
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,850
And you dare use that move
to woo another woman?

219
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,270
While I watch, no less?

220
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,560
I was not behind that.

221
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,940
Then, why else would caragana bloom
in the dead of winter?

222
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,520
I actually wish

223
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,150
I was behind that.

224
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,610
What?

225
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,610
<i>This has been bothering me</i>
<i>for a while now.</i>

226
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,280
Why did you give us that plant?

227
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,030
Why else? Because it is pretty.

228
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,620
I am not dumb.
It emitted an auspicious energy.

229
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,250
I know it is not a typical plant.

230
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,130
The sorrow of a mighty, vengeful ghost,
like the Eight-foot-tall Ghost,

231
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,760
can only be relieved of its sorrow

232
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,260
by wholly expending
the energy of a luminous pearl.

233
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,770
However, if things go awry,

234
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,190
that scoundrel could snatch it up
before it is used on him.

235
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,690
You saw it for yourself.

236
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,070
You saw how he robbed your brother of his.

237
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:47,030
The flowers of the caragana
possess great water energy.

238
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,620
If you ingest it,

239
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,620
it will allow you to face him
and fend him off

240
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,620
to keep the luminous pearl
out of his grasp

241
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,670
while every last bit of its energy
is drained to be used against him.

242
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,170
However, the issue is that

243
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,920
that caragana has not once bloomed

244
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,840
in several decades.

245
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,260
<i>And now,</i>
<i>that damn caragana is about to bloom.</i>

246
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,940
<i>It just has to start flowering now,</i>
<i>as we expose the Ghost's true identity.</i>

247
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,860
Hey.

248
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,940
Let us go.

249
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,200
Hey, Grilled Abalone.

250
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,700
There you go
with that damn Grilled Abalone again.

251
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,540
- Now is not the time. Later.
- Do not be absurd.

252
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,040
You cannot deliver
any more devastating news to His Majesty.

253
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,630
Go get some real grilled abalones.

254
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,460
Is there something wrong with His Majesty?

255
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,350
They say Lord Kim Bong-in
was discovered as a corpse.

256
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,600
Pardon?

257
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,640
His Majesty remains quite distressed.

258
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,640
Take this Imugi away with you.

259
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,110
<i>It appears the Eight-foot-tall Ghost</i>
<i>tossed the useless card from his hand.</i>

260
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,590
Have you still not found him?

261
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,090
Forgive me, my lord.

262
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,140
That fellow, Pung-san,
simply disappeared without a trace.

263
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,560
Even the state troops
failed to locate him.

264
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,430
You should have located him
before they even had the chance to!

265
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,940
After Lord Kwak passed tragically,

266
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,860
I was the one who took you in
when you were left to drift aimlessly.

267
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,530
However, the thanks I get
for my selfless act

268
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,700
is for you to be completely useless?

269
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,370
Please, keep calm, my lord.

270
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,750
I shall dispatch more men
and continue the search with fervor.

271
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,920
<i>Pung-san…</i>

272
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,880
<i>Because of him,</i>
<i>even the almighty Lord Kim Bong-in</i>

273
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,090
<i>met his demise.</i>

274
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,010
<i>If the world finds out</i>
<i>that I had kept him close…</i>

275
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,430
<i>Forget the vacant seat</i>
<i>of the Chief State Councillor,</i>

276
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,060
<i>even my current position will be in peril.</i>

277
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,400
I shall return to the palace
as soon as day breaks tomorrow.

278
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,610
There,

279
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,570
I shall decide on your fate.

280
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

281
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,540
However, I shall deliberate only on
the murder of Book Merchant Jang Eon-su.

282
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,290
<i>The Anthology of Light and Darkness</i>
shall not be a factor.

283
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,630
Your Majesty. My great-great-grandfather…

284
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,050
wrote about the private affairs
of the royal family.

285
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:55,300
It was undeniably a blasphemous sin.
Are you really suggesting…

286
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,930
you wish to cover it up?

287
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,270
That was most certainly a blasphemous sin.

288
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,110
However, your great-great-grandfather
was truly a faithful subject.

289
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,320
If it were not for Lord Choi Gil-sang,
I may have never known…

290
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,540
such sorrowful grudges…

291
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,420
were buried here.

292
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,290
- Your Majesty.
- If anything…

293
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,380
you are guilty of knowing me so little
and having so little faith in me.

294
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,350
And those sins…

295
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,520
even led you to unnecessary murder.

296
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,850
Your Majesty…

297
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,150
Forgive me,

298
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,570
but may I speak, Your Majesty?

299
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,120
You may.

300
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,580
Please allow me to perform
a passage rite for the vengeful ghost

301
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,710
of Book Merchant Jang Eon-su.

302
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,630
Lord Choi Won-u must be the one
to send him off to cross over,

303
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,550
if His Lord wishes
to avoid further mishaps.

304
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,850
SPIRIT TABLET OF THE LATE JANG EON-SU

305
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,610
I know of your indignation.

306
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,030
Thus, I seek to provide you with solace
through an offering of your favorite food

307
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,580
and this prayer in hopes of lessening
the burden of your karmic hindrance.

308
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,120
Please let go of your resentment
and cross over to the afterlife.

309
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,600
You know of my indignation?

310
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,190
What could a wench like you know?

311
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,600
You do not know anything.

312
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,860
Do you believe
that he will even get properly punished

313
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,070
for killing a lowly creature like me?

314
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,450
I will stay put where I am.

315
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:07,080
I will make that scoundrel suffer
a painful death as he did with me.

316
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,460
My lord, you must ask for his forgiveness.

317
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,960
If you do not,
his grudge will remain unresolved.

318
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,680
See?

319
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,180
He has no desire to ask for forgiveness.

320
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,270
Why would he?

321
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,690
There is no way the esteemed lord
would ever kneel

322
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,610
before a lowly creature like me.

323
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,200
Then,

324
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,450
you can tell him yourself.

325
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,160
What? Again?

326
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
You cannot!

327
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,810
You rotten scoundrel!

328
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,730
Yeo-ri… She has grabbed Lord Choi
by his collar, Your Majesty.

329
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,900
She is not Yeo-ri right now.
The vengeful ghost has possessed her body.

330
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,610
You shall die as well.

331
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,950
You ended my life,
now it is time to end yours!

332
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,360
- What do you think you are doing?
- Do you know…

333
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,580
how much I suffered and grieved?

334
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,410
I cannot leave before I annihilate you.

335
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,670
I refuse to leave!

336
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,860
I am sorry.

337
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,490
I am sorry.

338
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,160
I am truly sorry…

339
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,330
for taking your life.

340
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,810
My lord…

341
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:37,850
Father.

342
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,280
It was never my intention to kill you.

343
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,160
I was afraid.

344
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,780
I was filled with dread.

345
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,990
That is how I ended up doing that.

346
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,460
Life had been hell
for the past five years.

347
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,380
I shall take care
of your surviving family.

348
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,300
I shall atone for this sin
for the rest of my life.

349
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,390
So please…

350
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,100
Please forgive me.

351
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,810
I beg you…

352
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,530
Please forgive me.

353
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,890
Why, that is… Catch him!

354
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,940
Go! Catch him this instant!

355
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,610
Catch him! Damn it.

356
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,650
Why that rotten scoundrel… Catch him!

357
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,760
This lowly creature

358
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,140
offers his humblest greetings to His Lord,

359
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,140
second only to the King,
the Chief State Councillor.

360
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,810
What nonsense are you spewing?

361
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,230
Don't just stand there.

362
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,940
Cut his head off!

363
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,320
Yes, my lord.

364
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,610
Wait. Hold on.

365
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,040
Did you just refer to me
as the Chief State Councillor?

366
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,250
Yes, my lord.

367
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,880
Because you will become one, soon enough.

368
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,340
<i>This lowly creature's supernatural</i>
<i>abilities were always quite reliable.</i>

369
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,970
<i>Could he be telling the truth?</i>

370
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,510
However, your aura remains
as foul as ever.

371
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,020
You will soon be engulfed
by the floodwater.

372
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,680
What? What did you say?

373
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,770
Do you know why Lord Kwak Sang-chung
ended up like that,

374
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,360
despite the Haeilbu talisman?

375
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,740
It is because of the Imugi
inside Examiner Yoon Gap's body.

376
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,280
That Imugi will not go easy on you
because you are the Minister of Rites.

377
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,370
Then…

378
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,000
will I end up like the Minister of War?

379
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,290
I…

380
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,500
appear before you,
despite the threat of patrolling guards,

381
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,590
because I wish to protect you, my lord.

382
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:41,350
I wish to have you ascend
to the seat of the Chief State Councillor.

383
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,430
That is why I am here.

384
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,980
Ma'am!

385
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,440
My goodness. My precious kids are back.

386
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,700
Goodness me.

387
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,070
Have you been well?

388
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,700
With Venerable Gaseop
lodged near the palace,

389
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,370
I was worried about you being alone.

390
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,200
Gosh, why would you worry about me?

391
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,410
Well done on safely making
that long journey.

392
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,210
Is Yongdam Village still the same?

393
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,500
Yes.

394
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,840
Goodness. Look at my son.
He is a shell of his former self.

395
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,470
Tell the King
to stop making you work so much.

396
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,720
He may have traveled comfortably
on horseback and in palanquins,

397
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,100
but you two must have walked all that way.

398
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,260
Please, lower your voice.

399
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,890
You are right!
That King was the only one on a horse.

400
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,400
And he is so stingy.
Not even a bottle of booze after all that.

401
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,860
Did he now? How incredibly stingy of him.

402
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,980
Did you prepare anything tasty?

403
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,440
Right. You must be hungry.

404
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,610
Go and unpack.
I will whip something up in no time.

405
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,450
- Let me help you.
- No need. Gosh.

406
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,830
Stop it.

407
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,690
Father!

408
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,900
Gwang!

409
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,580
Did you have a safe journey?

410
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,490
I did. Have you been well?

411
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,960
Your Majesty.

412
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,710
Welcome back.

413
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,710
Queen.

414
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:46,390
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
appeared in the Prince's quarters?

415
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,180
Yes. I thought it was imperative
that you knew,

416
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,560
so I ran over here
when I heard you were back.

417
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,270
Is His Highness all right?

418
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,030
By heaven's grace, we were able to avoid
a disaster, thanks to the Ghostbane Stone.

419
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,070
However, all the preventive measures
we had taken proved to be useless.

420
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:09,620
It seems that Eight-foot-tall Ghost
became an even mightier evil spirit

421
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,120
after devouring
the Imugi's luminous pearl.

422
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,490
<i>My powers have grown weaker.</i>

423
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:46,660
<i>I will soon be no different from a mortal.</i>

424
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,790
<i>I might not be able</i>
<i>to protect Yeo-ri at this rate…</i>

425
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,080
Murder is subject
to the dictates of the law.

426
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,540
It cannot be taken lightly.

427
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,840
Choi Won-u deserves to be beheaded.

428
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,220
However, it was
an act of involuntary manslaughter,

429
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,550
incited by blackmail
from Book Merchant Jang Eon-su.

430
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,510
He is also a descendant
of a faithful escort

431
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,310
to the King 100 years ago during the war

432
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:17,270
and has spent his whole life fulfilling
his duties of loyalty and filial piety.

433
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,520
He shall be granted clemency

434
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,280
and be sentenced 50 strikes of the cane

435
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,530
and a funerary fine of 10 nyang.

436
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:30,120
FUNERARY FINE: IMPOSED ON THE KILLER
FOR THE VICTIM'S FUNERAL EXPENSES

437
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,660
What is the matter?

438
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,790
Is your punishment too harsh?

439
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,040
No, Your Majesty.

440
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,790
Compared to the heinous crimes
that I have committed,

441
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,920
the punishment is too light.

442
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,680
Your benevolence is boundless,
Your Majesty.

443
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,070
Father.

444
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,820
Father…

445
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,160
I am all right.

446
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,120
Do not worry about me and go back home.

447
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,160
Do not just stand there.
Escort the lady away.

448
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,540
Yes, Your Excellency.

449
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,000
My lady.

450
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,460
Let us go.

451
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,300
Your Excellency…

452
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,230
My lord?

453
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,940
You mean that caragana?

454
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,570
I did bring it with me
to the Capital this time…

455
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,120
It appears your energy is
a good match for the caragana.

456
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,250
Its blossoms are elusive and rare,
yet it has become abundant with buds.

457
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:04,290
That is because I watered it well
and let it bask in the sun.

458
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,880
I put great effort into its care.

459
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,630
Because it was a gift from you, my lord.

460
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,680
When it is in full bloom,

461
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,720
you must let me know.

462
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,100
Why, my lord?

463
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,770
Well, you see…

464
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,770
Many days have passed
since the buds appeared,

465
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,940
but they have not budged since.

466
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,070
It is not wilting, either.

467
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,360
It is as if it is frozen in time.

468
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,910
May I ask where this is all coming from?

469
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,450
What is so special about that caragana?

470
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,550
CHEON GEUM-HWI

471
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,020
Your Majesty, is this not

472
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,270
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost's
identification tablet?

473
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,350
You said the ghost's mortal name
was Cheon Geum-hwi.

474
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,320
I checked for the name
in the military examination register

475
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,280
through the records
of King Yeonjong's reign.

476
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,820
Are you suggesting we do a passage rite
for the Eight-foot-tall Ghost?

477
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,820
Yes.

478
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,410
After seeing the one performed
for that book merchant last time,

479
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,660
I suspected such a tablet
would be necessary.

480
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,580
Hence, I had them produce a new one.

481
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,420
YEONHUI DIVISION
ROYAL GUARDS COMMAND

482
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,670
Observing Lord Choi Won-u's recent ordeal
has led me to reflect on many things.

483
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,470
Hence, I have decided

484
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,510
for the sake of Cheon Geum-hwi,

485
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:41,640
his family, and all the villagers
who met tragic deaths due to my ancestors,

486
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,270
to carry out a passage rite.

487
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:48,730
Furthermore,
I shall offer my sincerest apologies

488
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,740
to them for the crimes
my ancestors have committed.

489
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,240
Can you do that for me?

490
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,240
I remain limited in my skills
and will not be able to perform it alone.

491
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,410
I will need Venerable Gaseop to lead it.

492
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,790
All right. You may have him do so.

493
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:12,760
Furthermore, the goal of a passage rite
is to provide solace for the spirit,

494
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:16,550
so it will be better to exclude
Imugi Gangcheori from the ceremony.

495
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,060
Yeo-ri, what are you talking about?

496
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,730
What will you do if
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost causes chaos?

497
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:30,190
The only one who stands a chance
against that ghost is him.

498
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,820
I concur.

499
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,650
For His Majesty's safety,
Imugi Gangcheori must be present.

500
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:38,660
However…

501
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,740
As if anything around here
would go smoothly without me.

502
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,490
Do not worry.

503
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,710
I, too, must see the demise of
that abhorrent, evil spirit for myself.

504
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,960
I shall join you.

505
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,670
In ten days,

506
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,510
it will be the 100th anniversary
of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost's death.

507
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,510
Since heretical ceremonies are
outlawed within the Capital,

508
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,520
it shall be performed at Jinseung Temple,
past the fortress walls.

509
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,100
Hence, prepare accordingly.

510
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

511
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,780
<i>It will be the 100th anniversary</i>
<i>in exactly 10 days…</i>

512
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,650
<i>Damn it to hell.</i>

513
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,660
<i>Why is everything so perfectly timed?</i>

514
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,710
With His Majesty so determined,
the ghost will soon cross over.

515
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,540
I mean it, this time.

516
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,590
Grandma only failed the passage rite

517
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,710
because she did not know
the ghost's identity.

518
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,840
And you saw it for yourself.

519
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,510
Once Lord Choi Won-u
genuinely asked for forgiveness,

520
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,010
the ghost's grudge was relieved.

521
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,680
His Majesty, of all people,

522
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,180
is looking to earnestly ask
for forgiveness from the ghost.

523
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,100
Even that ghost's deep grudge
will be relieved.

524
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,610
What are you trying to say?

525
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,650
What I mean is…

526
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,530
There is no need
for you to try so hard as well.

527
00:40:59,110 --> 00:40:59,950
What?

528
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,530
You did not even like coming
to the palace from the start.

529
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,080
You came because of me.

530
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:10,120
I am already plenty thankful
for all that you have done.

531
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,080
You are the one who begged me
on your knees to catch it

532
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,340
and now you want me to step aside?

533
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,090
You do not even have a Ghostbane Stone.

534
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:21,010
You expect me to send you off
to face that ghost alone?

535
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,800
Do you truly believe
I would be able to do that?

536
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,430
I just… What I meant was…

537
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,270
You…

538
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,360
What exactly are you thinking?

539
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,200
Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri.
Her Grace has summoned you.

540
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,000
Her Grace?

541
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,290
I summoned you to ask you a question.

542
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,510
I hear you accompanied
His Majesty to the hot spring recently.

543
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,470
Yes, Your Grace.

544
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,350
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost, was it?

545
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,890
Did you find out
who that evil spirit truly is?

546
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,020
That…

547
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,150
is not something
I am at liberty to divulge.

548
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,480
Forgive me, Your Grace.

549
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,110
Then…

550
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:32,160
can you answer me this?

551
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,500
My Yeongin…

552
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,840
Do you know where he is?

553
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,090
Did he safely cross
the River of the Afterlife?

554
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,680
His Highness, Prince Yeongin…

555
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,360
was devoured by the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

556
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,030
My Yeongin…

557
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,330
He is unable to rest peacefully,
even in death, because of me.

558
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,000
That evil spirit…

559
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,070
Your Grace.

560
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:48,450
I am an eyeglass artisan by trade,
but I am able to see ghosts.

561
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:52,660
A ghost who has long frequented
the inner palace told me

562
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,040
that an item His Highness cherished
during his lifetime

563
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,120
remains in his chambers.

564
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,920
An item he cherished?

565
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Yes, Your Grace.

566
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,510
If you wholeheartedly pray for his return
with that object in front of you,

567
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:13,180
you will be able to help him free himself
from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

568
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,320
Your Grace, please let us look.

569
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,200
You might get hurt, Your Grace.

570
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,780
- Start searching.
- Yes, ma'am.

571
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,370
All of His Highness's personal effects
have already been cleared away.

572
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:06,610
Your Grace.

573
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,530
Those are…

574
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,740
the silk pouches Your Grace handmade

575
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:16,620
for His Highness, every Lunar New Year.

576
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:19,870
Yes.

577
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,790
They are.

578
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:26,380
I was worried
about the malevolence of spirits…

579
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,800
so, I…

580
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:33,760
They were very much cherished
by His Highness when he was alive.

581
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:37,810
He said he could feel
the warmth of Your Grace from them.

582
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:59,040
What was with all that fibbing?

583
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:03,120
If some prayer was all it took to free
a soul from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost,

584
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,040
then every ghost he devoured
should be free by now.

585
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,210
I worried something terrible might happen
if I even took prayer away from her.

586
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,050
And…

587
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:15,640
there is nothing
more tenacious in this world

588
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:18,100
than a mother's prayer.

589
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,770
We cannot say it will not have
any effect with certainty.

590
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,810
Hey, why are you crying?
I did not do anything to you.

591
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,150
My mother…

592
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:33,610
She also desperately prayed for me.

593
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,990
I wanted to see her
so badly before I died,

594
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:43,250
but the Chief Royal Physician
refused to give me permission.

595
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,460
He said he could not let

596
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,960
all the eunuchs go home
over a measly cold.

597
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:02,020
Did you stay by Her Grace's side

598
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,270
because you missed
your own mother's embrace?

599
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:05,850
Yeah.

600
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,730
I need to stop by the Royal Couturier.

601
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,440
Can you wait for me by the well?

602
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,390
I bought them a while ago
but I finally get to give them to you.

603
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:43,140
They are for you. Try them on.

604
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:52,360
They fit perfectly!

605
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,240
You have not been able to go
because you did not have shoes, right?

606
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,490
Go to your mother with those shoes on.

607
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,870
She must be waiting for you.

608
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:15,130
THE ANTHOLOGY OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS

609
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:27,600
That depressing face of yours
is even more unbearable in that state.

610
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,440
My goodness, when did you return?

611
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,150
More importantly, what did you just say?

612
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:35,780
How dare you make such rude remarks

613
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,860
about His Majesty's
glowing royal countenance?

614
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:43,030
Then? His face's been that mopey for days.
Should I just continue to feign ignorance?

615
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,120
Look here, Gangcheori.

616
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:50,460
I was not the least bit surprised.

617
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,790
Did you think a ghost
with that deep of a grudge

618
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,960
would not even have such a tale attached?

619
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:02,140
I have always been proud of
my heritage and bloodline.

620
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,430
The burden of the lineage
weighed heavily on my shoulders…

621
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:09,770
and I tried with all my might…

622
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:14,230
to become a king worthy of the dynasty.

623
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,480
However…

624
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,320
it appears I was on a fool's errand.

625
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:29,250
I realized this
after entering a mortal body.

626
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:32,580
For mortals,
the human body itself is the sin.

627
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,670
To fulfill the desires of the human body,

628
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,840
they seek out what is tastier,
garb that seems a bit nicer,

629
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:44,550
and a house that is a little bigger.

630
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,600
They remain so desperate
to climb up that ladder

631
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,890
and obsess over money.

632
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,560
What is this out of the blue?

633
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,640
However…

634
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,940
it turns out not all mortals
are like that.

635
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:59,480
Occasionally, there were those

636
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:02,070
who cared more about other things

637
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,620
besides trivial desires of the human body.

638
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,040
That is why I, the King, exist.

639
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,210
If I spread fitting
and righteous principles

640
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:15,290
to exercise people-centered governance,

641
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,210
the avarice of human nature
will eventually be suppressed

642
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,420
to lead the way for an age
of peace and prosperity--

643
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:26,430
So, do you think that is possible?

644
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,890
The state-owned slave reform plans
you showed me a while back…

645
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:33,890
"Life is short, why waste energy
on such a useless pursuit?"

646
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,020
You criticized it so, did you not?

647
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:40,530
You will achieve
that noble pursuit you seek.

648
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,490
After all,

649
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,820
you are one of those mortals…

650
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,280
I come across occasionally.

651
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:58,380
These are the words of
the exalted Gangcheori.

652
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,750
Feel free to believe them.

653
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,450
It has all been taken from me.

654
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:37,670
My body,

655
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,670
my life,

656
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:42,420
and all my people…

657
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,090
They have all been taken from me.

658
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:52,640
There you go.
You must feel such immense sorrow.

659
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,440
Foster that grudge.
That is what you must do.

660
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,440
Only then,
will you do as I say without protest.

661
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:27,800
I appear before you,
despite the threat of patrolling guards,

662
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,890
because I wish to protect you, my lord.

663
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:35,640
I wish to have you ascend
to the seat of the Chief State Councillor.

664
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,730
That is why I am here.

665
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:40,730
Then, what must I do?

666
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,320
You just need to lure out
Examiner Yoon Gap for me.

667
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,240
<i>I, Pung-san, will take care of the rest.</i>

668
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:56,120
I came because you said
you would treat me to tasty things,

669
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:58,000
but what did you want?

670
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,870
The nation is amidst a crisis.

671
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,750
Since you are the subject
who is most favored by His Majesty…

672
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,380
I thought we could become
good acquaintances

673
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:13,640
to discuss political affairs and such.

674
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:17,100
Let us see here…

675
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,020
You wish for me to pass on
this flattery to the King

676
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,980
so that he may look upon you favorably?

677
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,520
You must be after the empty seat
of the Chief State Councillor.

678
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:28,230
Why, you scoundrel!

679
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,530
You are really something else.

680
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:36,950
<i>That Imugi will not go easy on you</i>
<i>because you are the Minister of Rites.</i>

681
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,330
<i>I must remain calm. He is an Imugi.</i>

682
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,630
Let me see here…

683
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,420
Now, I remember.

684
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,760
You are that rascal who used to follow
Kwak Sang-chung around like fish poop.

685
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:59,720
I may be cutting my life short,
but I cannot stand this any longer!

686
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,570
We are still drinking.
Where are you running off to?

687
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,740
<i>Pung-san told me to keep him occupied</i>
<i>for as long as I could.</i>

688
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,910
Why did you bring me here?

689
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,620
Well, you see…

690
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,360
His Lord is not home yet?

691
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:40,370
No. I guess you just missed
each other on the way out?

692
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,620
It seems so.

693
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,960
<i>Where is he? I assumed he went home</i>
<i>when I could not find him anywhere.</i>

694
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,670
Who could that…

695
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,590
My goodness. Gap!

696
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,470
Goodness me. What happened to him?

697
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,010
It seems he drank a bit too much.

698
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:00,010
This is an all-too-common sight
at our courtesan house.

699
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,600
Gosh, I do not even smell any alcohol.
How did he drink too much?

700
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:11,060
My poor son.

701
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,150
Wait.

702
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,860
Oh, my. He is burning up.

703
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,700
Keep an eye on him for me.

704
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,910
- I will fetch a physician.
- All right.

705
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,860
That Imugi must already be weak
with his waning water energy.

706
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,400
After devouring a luminous pearl,

707
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,030
suppressing an Imugi like that
will be a breeze for our Warrior Deity.

708
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,360
Are you awake? How do you feel?

709
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:41,860
You were burning up all night.

710
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:44,780
You must be thirsty.
Have some water first.

711
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,040
Yeo-ri.

712
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,340
Yes.

713
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:00,550
It is me.

714
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,180
Lord Yoon Gap.

715
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,390
Gosh, Gap.

716
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,600
When did you wake up?

717
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,690
How are you feeling? Did the fever break?

718
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,190
Let me see…

719
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:19,360
Mother.

720
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,820
What did you just say?

721
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:28,700
Yes, Mother.

722
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,290
It is me.

723
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,920
It is Gap.

724
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,880
My goodness.

725
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,550
Goodness… Gap.

726
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:44,970
My word.

727
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:46,800
Are you my Gap?

728
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:48,930
Goodness.

729
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,220
I cannot believe this!

730
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:54,020
My word…

731
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:57,940
My dear child.

732
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:00,480
My dear child has come back to me.

733
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,240
My goodness. Gap!

734
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,570
I am so proud of you. Well done.

735
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:07,700
<i>It has returned.</i>

736
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:11,910
<i>The soul has returned</i>
<i>to its original body.</i>

737
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:16,000
- <i>His Lord has returned.</i>
- Thank goodness.

738
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:20,250
<i>Then, what happened to Gangcheori?</i>

739
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:23,010
<i>Where did he go?</i>

740
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,680
SPECIAL THANKS
TO LEE KYU-HAN AND SONG YOUNG-KYU

741
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,910
<i>It seems something is definitely going on.</i>

742
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:52,910
I am so afraid that
Gangcheori will also end up like Bibi.

743
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,910
<i>I have come back because there was</i>
<i>something I needed to tell you.</i>

744
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,920
How would you like
to live 100 years with me?

745
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,790
<i>The Yoon Gap that I cherished so</i>
<i>has returned to me.</i>

746
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:04,210
<i>As soon as I felt your royal frame,</i>
<i>I experienced unbearable pain.</i>

747
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,300
- Yeo-ri!
- Gangcheori?

748
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,760
That body will not remain yours.

749
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,850
Pour this on the King's Ghostbane Stone.

750
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:14,930
<i>Your Majesty,</i>
<i>please forgive this unfaithful servant.</i>

751
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,980
<i>My lord, you cannot.</i>

752
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:21,560
