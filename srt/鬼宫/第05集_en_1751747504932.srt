1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,420
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,810
What happened here?

4
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,440
Is he dead?

5
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Yes.

6
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,940
Your Majesty.

7
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,190
Who would do such a thing?

8
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,860
I am not sure, Your Majesty.

9
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,860
I came by in the morning
with basin water for washing his face…

10
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,160
There is no sign of
an outsider breaking in.

11
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,370
Then, who would dare to do such a thing?

12
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,590
It reeks the same
as the prince's chambers.

13
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,640
Make way.

14
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,360
No, this cannot be…

15
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
No…

16
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,980
This cannot be!

17
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,650
Get rid of this!

18
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,950
I refuse to accept this.

19
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,490
I refuse…

20
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,740
Wake up, my dear child.

21
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,040
Mother is here.

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,250
Please, wake up.

23
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,380
Open your eyes!

24
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,380
Do not just dawdle!

25
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,420
Do something! Bring him back to life now!

26
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,800
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost…

27
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,390
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost will return.

28
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,390
Just open your eyes!

29
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,380
Goodness. Goodness me.

30
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,060
What in the world?

31
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,060
You…

32
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,650
How long have you been up there?

33
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,150
Were you that worried about Yeo-ri?

34
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,980
Enough for you to stand guard
even before the morning dew sets?

35
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,070
That creature should not be taken lightly.

36
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,950
I assumed as much
when that remarkable child

37
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,910
came looking for
her grandmother's shamanic implements.

38
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,700
He must be quite formidable.

39
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
I hear…

40
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,670
you are most renowned
for your Restorative Offering Rituals.

41
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,220
Did Yeo-ri tell you that?

42
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,260
We are dealing
with an Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

43
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,600
I can fend him off briefly with my powers,
but eradicating him will be difficult.

44
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,100
Can you

45
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,270
guide that wicked spirit to the afterlife?

46
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,950
Do you ask because you truly do not know?

47
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,500
What?

48
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,460
There is only one way you can lift
the grudge of such a mighty evil spirit

49
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,130
and guide it to the afterlife.

50
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,010
The enchanted pearl of a dragon.

51
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,390
Or what an Imugi like yourself
holds deep in his body…

52
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,430
the luminous pearl.

53
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,040
There is no other way
to lift the grudge of an evil spirit.

54
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,280
MIRROR OF THE SUN, MOON, AND STARS

55
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,660
<i>Be gone.</i>

56
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,240
Thus, if you wish to truly guide
that ghost to the afterlife,

57
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,580
you have only one option.

58
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,410
You must

59
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,870
sacrifice yourself.

60
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,500
As you say,

61
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,500
you may briefly be able to fend it off
with the luminous pearl,

62
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,840
but that has its limits.

63
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,920
The luminous pearl in your belly
must be fully drained

64
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,430
and you must sacrifice yourself

65
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,350
for that mighty Eight-foot-tall Ghost
to be guided to the afterlife.

66
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,060
What do you say?

67
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,400
Would you like to try?

68
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,440
You quack monk…

69
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,280
It appears you are hell-bent on dying.

70
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,490
You want me to drain my luminous pearl

71
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,120
and kill myself to capture
some measly Eight-foot-tall Ghost?

72
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,640
Are you planning to leave?

73
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,850
Yes.

74
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,980
If I wait any longer, I might never
be able to save Lord Yoon Gap.

75
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,740
I have my grandma's implements now.
I need to confront him again.

76
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,080
What?

77
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,670
What do you want?

78
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,090
You are still unfit
to accept a patron deity.

79
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,760
What happened to all that boasting
about great offerings?

80
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,430
Offerings…

81
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,350
Then, are you granting my request now?

82
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,310
I shall decide
after I see the offering first.

83
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,540
I actually finished making it a while ago.

84
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,120
I have not been able to bring it up
because you have been

85
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,330
so cold to me recently.

86
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,840
I genuinely put a lot of care
and effort into making it.

87
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,260
With heartfelt care,
I braided thread by thread with prayer.

88
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,340
I did.

89
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,850
Are you really going
to become my patron deity?

90
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,480
Can you really defeat the
Eight-foot-tall Ghost and save His Lord?

91
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,780
Fine.

92
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,990
I shall do that for you.

93
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,030
Thus,

94
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,370
prepare for the ceremony.

95
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,910
- Ceremony?
- Since I am trapped in this human body,

96
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,960
a proper descent ritual
will not be possible,

97
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,790
but some semblance of it
should be observed.

98
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,800
Yes, you are right.
The ceremony is important.

99
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,130
We need a ritual meal and what else?

100
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,220
Hold on.

101
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,090
Bring my son back to life.

102
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,880
My son!

103
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,710
I trusted you,

104
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,630
but you failed to protect
my son in the end.

105
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,050
How could you let him die?

106
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,550
Your Grace.

107
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,890
I shall rip you apart
piece by piece, limb from limb.

108
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,020
I shall rip you apart!

109
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,940
Your Grace!

110
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,480
Your lowly servant failed
to protect His Highness!

111
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,150
Please end my life!

112
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,950
Most certainly.

113
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,580
I shall gladly end it for you.

114
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,250
I shall kill you

115
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
so you may…

116
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,090
accompany my dear son
on the road to the afterlife!

117
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,050
If such a thing were possible,

118
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,100
I would gladly die a hundred times over.

119
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,560
However, should we not first avenge

120
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,060
the tragic death of our beloved prince?

121
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,650
Avenge his death?

122
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,440
There is a powerful sorcerer in the palace

123
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,490
and I helplessly fell victim to them.

124
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,780
We must find that scoundrel!

125
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,030
If we fail to do so,

126
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,040
even Your Grace will be in grave danger!

127
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,790
My dear son…

128
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:07,090
died because of that damn sorcerer?

129
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,720
Yes, Your Grace.

130
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,850
There must be someone new
in the king's vicinity.

131
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,720
I am certain they must be the sorcerer.

132
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,230
Then, the king…

133
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:32,070
<i>Surely, at the end of the day,</i>
<i>that random sorcerer is the one to blame.</i>

134
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,290
<i>If that sorcerer did not leave</i>
<i>the Warrior Deity so battered,</i>

135
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,700
<i>he would not have gone</i>
<i>after Prince Yeongin.</i>

136
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,250
<i>But who is this sorcerer anyway?</i>

137
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,580
As a disciple,
I welcome you as my patron deity.

138
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,170
I shall serve you with reverence.

139
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,630
I, the Imugi Gangcheori,

140
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,880
shall accept you as my disciple

141
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,550
and become your steadfast benefactor.

142
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,950
Your hand.

143
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,400
When did you have time
to prepare such a thing?

144
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,230
When you were preparing the ritual meal,

145
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,610
I trekked down to the market to buy it.

146
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,370
Do you like it?

147
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,950
Well, it's not bad.

148
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,540
My hair will not go up just yet.

149
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,210
I will start wearing it up
after you save His Lord

150
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,340
from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
and leave his body.

151
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,380
Do as you wish.

152
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,520
That being said,

153
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,520
even if Yoon Gap's soul
fails to return to this body,

154
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,570
you will remain my disciple regardless.

155
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,900
What are you talking about?

156
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,820
You heard me.

157
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,740
Even if I leave this body,

158
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,450
there is no guarantee
his soul will return.

159
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,910
You must be aware of this as well.

160
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,710
Well, that is true.

161
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,630
Furthermore,

162
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,960
even if you successfully save his soul
and bring him back to life,

163
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,920
nothing will change
until I ascend as a dragon.

164
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,890
Even if you ardently hold him
in your heart,

165
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,010
I will never…

166
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,730
let you go.

167
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,350
I know.

168
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,690
So, you just focus on catching
that Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

169
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
Sure.

170
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,280
If you accept me as your patron deity,

171
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,370
I will gladly…

172
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,960
destroy that Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

173
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,010
Your Majesty.

174
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,720
I remain beyond stunned
by Prince Yeongin's passing.

175
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,470
I implore you to pause
the morning court assembly

176
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,560
and properly observe
traditional funeral rites.

177
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,270
You may do so.

178
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,740
Be sure to properly follow
the customs with the utmost care.

179
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,660
Furthermore, the chief royal secretary
will pay condolences…

180
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,800
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

181
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,900
Your Majesty!

182
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,490
Your Majesty, are you all right?

183
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,910
Chief State Councillor.

184
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,790
I must be suffering from severe fatigue.

185
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,840
How could I fall asleep like that
after summoning you?

186
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,720
You do not need to hide
such things in my presence.

187
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,470
Ever since the late king passed away
in such a manner,

188
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,310
Your Majesty

189
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,350
has painstakingly hidden your emotions,

190
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,020
time and time again.

191
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,820
It led you to become a remarkable king,

192
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,070
but it only broke
my old heart and pained me so.

193
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,660
I am well aware Your Majesty cherished

194
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,120
His Highness, Prince Yeongin.

195
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,920
The whole world…

196
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,250
whispered about him
being a threat to my position…

197
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:28,010
but I simply pitied that poor boy
who lost his father at a young age.

198
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,930
He may have lost his way and committed
distasteful acts as he grew up,

199
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,770
but despite all that,

200
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,690
I never once desired

201
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,030
for him to meet his end like this.

202
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,450
Your Majesty.

203
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,530
Could a ghost truly be behind all this?

204
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,370
Your Majesty, that is simply preposterous.

205
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,170
What ghost?

206
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,630
Yes. I am aware.

207
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,180
It is preposterous beyond words.

208
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,070
Yeo-ri.

209
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,570
Here you go.

210
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,490
Unfortunately, we have
a long journey ahead of us and--

211
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,160
It is caragana.

212
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,830
It will be very handy one day.

213
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,580
Be sure to take care of it.

214
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,750
Here.

215
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,920
I will use this someday?

216
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,250
How in the world…

217
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,670
You must not be lazy with the watering.

218
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,130
Water it when the topsoil dries.

219
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,220
Also…

220
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,390
What? What do you want?

221
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,100
I just wanted to look at your face.

222
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,980
I hope you continue your dull existence
by your lonesome self unscathed,

223
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,440
for hundreds, thousands of years to come.

224
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,110
- What did you say?
- Go on now.

225
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,490
The sun sets early in the mountains,
you should get going.

226
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,740
Off you go.

227
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,130
It is His Excellency.
Lord Choi Won-u is here!

228
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,840
Your Excellency.

229
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,430
Your Excellency!

230
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,690
Your Excellency, it has been five years.

231
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,530
Thank you for making the long journey.

232
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,650
My, my.

233
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,570
Why have you all gathered
as if I were some great man?

234
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,660
You are much too humble.

235
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,200
Every scholar throughout the land
holds you in high esteem.

236
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,370
I am only here because the nation
has experienced a great loss.

237
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,840
I do not wish to cause a commotion.

238
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,050
Please go home now.

239
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,890
Let me know
when the crowd outside disperses.

240
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,970
There is someplace I need to go secretly.

241
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,890
Stop by somewhere before the funeral?

242
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,560
You must be severely fatigued.

243
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,290
The capital is just past there.

244
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,120
We should try the capital gates first.

245
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,170
We can look for another way in
if we run into trouble there.

246
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,430
The five desires and seven emotions arise

247
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,350
from the five sensory organs
of the human body.

248
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,690
If I never see her,
I will feel no emotion or desire.

249
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,320
What are you doing?

250
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,190
Has our stay at the temple
led you to chant?

251
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,030
I was wondering why such devious humans
commit such crimes.

252
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,410
I was reflecting as your patron deity.

253
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,540
Yes, I see.

254
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,080
So, what have you found out?

255
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,460
My stay in this human body
has given me insight.

256
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,420
The human body itself
being the source of sin is the issue.

257
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,090
Sight, taste, hearing, and touch.

258
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,180
All of them bring forth desire.

259
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,140
That is why so many sins are committed.

260
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,480
See, even now, this touch

261
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,730
makes me feel something--

262
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,200
Hey!

263
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,040
Stop!

264
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,550
Stop, I say!

265
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,130
Stop moving! Stop!

266
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,860
See. I told you to go easy on the <i>yakgwa.</i>

267
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,030
The <i>yakgwa</i> is not to blame.

268
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,660
How could anyone not get sick
in such a shaky palanquin?

269
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,540
With such terrible motion sickness,

270
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,380
you should have just stayed home.

271
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,040
Why did you insist
on following him to the capital?

272
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,380
It has been a while
since I have visited the capital.

273
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,600
What was that?

274
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,220
Do you think I do not know?

275
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,270
You are here to see Yoon Gap
or whatever his name is.

276
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,230
I already looked into him.

277
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:12,150
He was born a bastard
and only holds a minor government post.

278
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,980
He is a mere examiner or something.

279
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,400
It is not like
I wanted to marry him or anything.

280
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,120
I just wanted to see his face.

281
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,950
Seeing a handsome face
will not hurt anyone.

282
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,130
Get inside. Go.

283
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,680
Wait,

284
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,100
that is my palanquin…

285
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,270
He says, "Shush."

286
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,620
Excuse me.

287
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,620
What are you planning
to do in there exactly?

288
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,550
Can you give me some space?

289
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,140
You are choking me here.

290
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,790
Did you not see a man
and maiden pass through here?

291
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,300
Let him know I have seen no such thing.

292
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,550
Hear that?

293
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,220
She's not seen anyone like that.

294
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,710
Have you already forgotten

295
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,920
His Majesty's royal command
to never step foot in the capital?

296
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,050
You show up this soon after your exile?

297
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,760
Hence, we did not enter
the capital grounds.

298
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,760
What?

299
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,430
Right. He has a point.

300
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,140
There was not a single reason
for us to flee with such urgency.

301
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,230
He forbade us from entering the capital.

302
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,900
Why would you scold us
for being outside the capital?

303
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,440
Yes, why would you?

304
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,650
Then are you saying
you never planned to enter the capital?

305
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,990
Yes. Well… That is basically right.

306
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,870
Then, you two should follow me.

307
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,120
To where?
Are you trying to drag us far away again?

308
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,290
Are you?

309
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,000
Someone is urgently looking for you.

310
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,460
Pardon?

311
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,590
DO NOT ENTER

312
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,900
Can you tell us now?

313
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,730
What happened?

314
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,690
We were exiled.

315
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,360
Should we be stepping foot
into the palace like this?

316
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,110
Follow me.

317
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,130
Where are we…

318
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:54,260
Do not tell me
the prince who resided here passed away.

319
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,930
How did you know that?

320
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,350
I had a vision of him a while ago.

321
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,440
You are correct.

322
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,690
He was discovered here dead
three days ago.

323
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,820
But something is not right.

324
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,160
If it was an unnatural death,

325
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,710
the grudge of his soul
should linger at the site of his death.

326
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
But I do not sense anything.

327
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:21,930
A talisman.

328
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,030
There is something here.

329
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,650
You…

330
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,190
Were you the one
who did that to Prince Yeongin?

331
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,280
No, I am not the one.

332
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,780
It is not you?

333
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,200
Then, why did you run away?

334
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,120
I thought you would suspect me like this.

335
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,870
- What did you say?
- Yes.

336
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,700
I did indeed come here
because I abhorred the scoundrel

337
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,710
who trampled my flesh and blood.

338
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,420
However, I did not do it.

339
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,630
I did not forget my promise to you.

340
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
Get off me!

341
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,520
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost did this?

342
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,030
He showed up here?

343
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,820
Damn it.

344
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,330
No wonder it reeks.

345
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,250
Why are you two here?

346
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,750
What are exiles doing inside the palace?

347
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,590
Did you do this?

348
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,130
Did you dare to defy the king's command

349
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,350
and bring those two into the palace?

350
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

351
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,310
I did bring them here.

352
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,100
I know I have committed a deadly sin,

353
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,230
but I believed that was the right thing
to do for your sake.

354
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,400
What did you say?!

355
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,150
I am responsible.

356
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,490
Queen.

357
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,750
I asked the clerk officer
to bring those two back to the palace.

358
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,590
Hence, do not punish him

359
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,880
and punish me, instead.

360
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,050
Queen.

361
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,050
He is a military officer
under the king's command.

362
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,260
How could you defy the law

363
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,260
and issue him a personal command?

364
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:07,850
It is because…

365
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,890
I cannot lose him.

366
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,860
I cannot lose

367
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,440
neither the prince…

368
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,610
nor Your Majesty.

369
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,240
I cannot stand idly by

370
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,580
to witness another tragic death

371
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,750
like the one that befell Prince Yeongin!

372
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,890
Your Majesty can continue
to be a sage king who upholds the law.

373
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,510
I shall…

374
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,310
become an immoral woman
who partakes in heretical ceremonies.

375
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,190
If this becomes a blemish
on your flawless reign,

376
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,150
you only need to banish me.

377
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,610
Even with such risks…

378
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,530
I must protect the two of you.

379
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,660
Thus, Your Majesty…

380
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,580
Please…

381
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,460
Stop it! Stop!

382
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:59,250
Listen! By chance,
did His Lordship send you?

383
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,670
My goodness. Please let me see him.

384
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,300
I will explain everything to him!

385
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,510
Please let me see him.

386
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,930
My lordship.

387
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,060
My lordship…

388
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:12,850
My lordship?

389
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,600
My lordship…

390
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,690
My lordship.

391
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,940
Oh, my lordship.

392
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,820
My lordship, please…

393
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,320
I was not behind
what happened to Prince Yeongin.

394
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,660
The Warrior Deity desired it,

395
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,910
so I had no other choice.

396
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,080
My lordship--

397
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,370
My lordship!

398
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:36,000
My lordship, you have heard
how Prince Yeongin died, have you not?

399
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,330
Going forward, the Warrior Deity

400
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,670
will stop all this possession nonsense

401
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:44,090
and just end his life, clean and simple.

402
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:47,630
Then, your lordship can reap
the benefits without lifting a finger.

403
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,720
So please, your lordship.

404
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,760
Please just give me one more chance.
Please. Your lordship!

405
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,480
Your lordship?

406
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,480
Your lordship!

407
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,150
Oh! My goodness!

408
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,280
He grants you one month.

409
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,820
If the prince does not die by then,

410
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,370
you shall be torn, limb from limb.

411
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,660
Yes.

412
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:15,910
I understand.

413
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
Yes, my lordship.

414
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,750
She discovered this

415
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,960
at His Highness's quarters.

416
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,060
This was written
with the ashes from a brazier.

417
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

418
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,400
Last time at Mount Bugak,

419
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,020
the sacred cord burned into charcoal

420
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:48,570
and the evil stench
also had a smoky quality…

421
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,370
I believe the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
is an ember ghost.

422
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,950
"Ember ghost"? As in the ghost of fire?

423
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

424
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,250
It moves through fire

425
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,500
and I witnessed it burn itself with fire.

426
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,380
The eight-foot-tall Ghost seems to be
a spirit that burned to death.

427
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,470
By chance, do you suspect anyone
who would hold such a grudge

428
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,930
against the royal bloodline?

429
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,060
I must know what sort of ghost it is
and the grudge it possesses

430
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,440
to properly guide it to the afterlife.

431
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,360
I do not know.

432
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,030
I cannot even fathom
a suspicion at this moment.

433
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Ow!

434
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,800
Hold it!

435
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,170
It is not hot at all.

436
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,260
Lift it up.

437
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,430
I cannot touch it because the ember ghost
and I are clashing elements.

438
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,520
Like this?

439
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,610
The handwriting is crude,
but the spiritual energy is formidable.

440
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,070
That damn Eight-foot-tall Ghost…

441
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,120
It has yet to fully recover.

442
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,660
It appears it has not been the same
since I stabbed him last time.

443
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,290
How can you tell all that
from a single talisman?

444
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,250
How frustrating you are.

445
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,420
Think about it.

446
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,550
He devours members
of the royal bloodlines to grow his power.

447
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,260
He requires an offering,

448
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,380
but is not strong enough
to make it happen.

449
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,510
Hence, he utilizes
this lock-opening talisman

450
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,930
to devour that rascal prince in one slurp.

451
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,400
Someone…

452
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,320
must have offered the prince up to him.

453
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,150
To the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

454
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,990
Do you mean to say

455
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,200
someone inside the palace is assisting it?

456
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,160
Finally, you are beginning to understand.

457
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,790
Who… would partake in such a heinous act?

458
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,080
That is not the only issue.

459
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,750
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
had possessed the young prince

460
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,000
and slowly drove him insane.

461
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:15,050
Up until now, he enjoyed the pain
its drawn-out torment inflicted.

462
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,390
However, it was different this time.

463
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,390
It killed without hesitation.

464
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:23,430
To heal the internal injury
we inflicted on Mount Bugak?

465
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,680
Yes, that is correct.

466
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:29,020
And it will continue to do so.

467
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,820
If you cannot stop it,
you will die instantly.

468
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,610
You…

469
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,900
and your son.

470
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,430
This is a nation built
on Confucian principles

471
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,060
and I am its king.

472
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,270
Thus,

473
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,400
I cannot approve of heretical ceremonies.

474
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,150
However, it appears there was
human intervention involved here.

475
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,490
As the king,

476
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,530
I say this now

477
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,870
despite all the beliefs and convictions
I have upheld until now.

478
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,170
Do you truly believe
you can stop that evil spirit?

479
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,840
I cannot guarantee anything.

480
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
However,

481
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,510
I must also stop
this Eight-foot-tall Ghost

482
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,010
in order to save someone.

483
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,940
Yoon Gap shall be reinstated
as an examiner

484
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,650
and stay close to my side
to carry out my secret orders.

485
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,280
Furthermore, Yeo-ri shall be stationed

486
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,700
at the Royal Couturier
as the royal eyeglass artisan

487
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,490
and make eyeglasses under my command.

488
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,590
Your Grace.

489
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,630
You must be
in an unbelievable state of grief.

490
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,970
When I heard the news…

491
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,220
I, too, found myself
overwhelmed with sorrow

492
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,140
as the earth disappeared beneath my feet.

493
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,230
Do you know…

494
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,690
what provides me
with the greatest anguish right now?

495
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,610
I gave birth to him…

496
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,820
but I did not show him any love.

497
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:45,990
No.

498
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,000
I actually showed him scorn.

499
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,960
Your Grace.

500
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,420
I never once embraced him.

501
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,960
I never once…

502
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,550
said his name with any affection.

503
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
That…

504
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,640
That…

505
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,430
pains me so much.

506
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,880
My lord.

507
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,470
I just saw Yoon Gap inside the palace.

508
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,140
What are you talking about?

509
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,850
You said he was exiled
from the capital recently.

510
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,270
It appears His Majesty
summoned him once more.

511
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,570
I saw him step out
of the royal library just now.

512
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,990
<i>That damn scoundrel…</i>

513
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,450
I do…

514
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,080
not remember anything.

515
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:13,910
<i>He claimed ignorance,</i>

516
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,330
<i>but the look in his eyes</i>
<i>told a different story.</i>

517
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,000
<i>Why did the king summon him again?</i>

518
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,920
Get rid of that this instant!

519
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,010
It is good for you.

520
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,680
My goodness.

521
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,810
Gap, drink up. My goodness! Gap.

522
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,310
- Oh, gosh.
- Do not come any closer.

523
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,480
I clearly told you I did not want it.

524
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,100
Do you know how much this cost?
How could you refuse this?

525
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,060
I had to ask around
to find a skilled physician

526
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,440
and I even had to travel
across the mountain pass to procure it.

527
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,360
You said it was made with cow brain,
snake tail, and dried centipede.

528
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,240
How do you expect me to drink that?

529
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,700
I can tell I will not like it
from the smell. You drink it.

530
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,620
It's long been proven
bitter medicine is good for the body.

531
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,500
He said you'd regain your sanity
if you'd just drink this.

532
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,870
My goodness…

533
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:03,750
Were you not kicked out of the palace
because of that amnesia-insanity business?

534
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,800
I cannot bear to feel
the way I did ever again.

535
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,930
Now drink up.

536
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,140
You spoiled brat…

537
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:17,850
Yeo-ri.

538
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,520
- Yes?
- Grab him.

539
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,150
- Yes, ma'am.
- How dare you!

540
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,150
Do not take another step.

541
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,030
Even you will not be exempt
from my whirlwinds--

542
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:32,570
Goodness, there you go again
about those darn whirlwinds.

543
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,660
You are hilarious.

544
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,910
How dare you speak
that way to your patron deity?

545
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,660
Goodness gracious.

546
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,120
Now, he is even talking
some nonsense about patron deities.

547
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,960
Yeo-ri, he needs to drink this now.

548
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,420
- Yes, ma'am.
- Forget it!

549
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:59,390
Down it goes.

550
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,520
Goodness. I cannot believe you.

551
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,530
What a waste! What are we going to do?

552
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:10,610
Yeo-ri, I am going to heat up
another batch. Hold on to him.

553
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,740
Yes, ma'am.

554
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,700
I cannot live here anymore.

555
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:19,000
I must move out.

556
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,460
What happened to enjoying
her decent cooking skills?

557
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,340
You could have just held
your breath and drank it.

558
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,920
Did you need to throw such a fit?

559
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,050
There is snake tail in there.

560
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,630
The snake is like a cousin to an Imugi.

561
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,050
How could I consume such a thing?

562
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,800
What can we do?

563
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:39,100
It seems she spent the little money
she had to procure it.

564
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,680
Let me see.

565
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:00,910
What now?

566
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,920
Starting now, you better stay
at least ten steps away from me.

567
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,210
What was that about?

568
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:12,090
That hurt…

569
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:20,390
What is wrong with me?

570
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:22,770
Whenever I am around her,

571
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,390
I feel something surging deep inside.

572
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,270
Maybe I want to devour her whole?

573
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:38,370
What in the world is wrong with me?

574
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,910
Seriously.

575
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,870
He acted like I had the plague.

576
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:46,120
Earlier, he acted like…

577
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:00,560
My goodness. No.

578
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,560
I was merely confused.

579
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,100
I mistook him for Lord Yoon Gap.

580
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,440
Right. That is what happened.

581
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,310
Exactly what happened.

582
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,730
How long do you plan to stay here?

583
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,690
Am I not allowed to be here?

584
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:50,610
But the king gave me permission.

585
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:52,520
That is not what I am asking.

586
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,780
As long as you are here,

587
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:03,370
that troublemaker examiner
will continue to hover nearby.

588
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:05,620
Do not mind him.

589
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,460
He lies there
because he is comfortable there.

590
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:13,050
How could I not mind him?

591
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:17,970
Here he comes.

592
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,070
How are you always lying down
or leaning on something?

593
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,200
What if his body really ends up
with bedsores?

594
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,240
It is because I used to live freely
without a physical body,

595
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:46,290
but now I am stuck
in this clunky human body.

596
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,870
Do you even know
how heavy this human body is?

597
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,180
Are you making a talismanic iron net?

598
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,390
You think you could trap that Eight--

599
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,320
Your Grace.

600
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,450
I have heard

601
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,160
that you have not eaten anything in days.

602
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,580
It is milk porridge.

603
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,500
Please try having a bite.

604
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,040
Milk porridge?

605
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,050
Is there a mother in this world

606
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:41,340
who could eat that

607
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,470
after burying her child?

608
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:47,720
His Majesty personally requested
for them to make it for you.

609
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:50,480
Please try to have a bite

610
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,730
for the sake of his sincerity.

611
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:56,940
I told you I do not want it!

612
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:08,370
Forgive me…

613
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,330
My stomach is a bit upset.

614
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,670
Please excuse me.

615
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,020
Your Grace, are you all right?

616
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:41,400
It seems…

617
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,860
the queen was not all right.

618
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,240
No.

619
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,990
Her face was sickly pale.

620
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,450
It seems she is suffering from an ailment.

621
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,290
The queen always had a weak constitution.

622
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:59,090
She was like that when she was
pregnant with the prince.

623
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:01,630
Her morning sickness was needlessly severe

624
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:04,970
and she had to be bedridden
because of her history of miscarriages.

625
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,800
Your Grace.

626
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,100
Could she be…

627
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,680
It seems the queen is experiencing
some bodily changes.

628
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:16,190
Look into it.

629
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:28,490
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
will come to harm the prince

630
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:30,660
on the upcoming day of the Fire Horse?

631
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,410
How can you be so sure?

632
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,210
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
is an ember ghost.

633
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:42,130
It will move on the day
when the energy of fire is strong.

634
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,510
He also attacked Prince Yeongin

635
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:46,050
when fire energy was strong,

636
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:47,930
the night of the Fire Rooster.

637
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,720
I have prepared

638
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:54,220
a means of defense to stop it
for His Highness's palace,

639
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,480
but if we fail to capture it,

640
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,690
the core issue will not be resolved.

641
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:01,020
How can I…

642
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,030
help you?

643
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,240
Please let all of the palace know

644
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,580
the prince will be in the royal library
until late into the night.

645
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,540
It will be easier to catch it

646
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,290
with a talismanic iron net
at the library than his chambers.

647
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,580
I shall lure
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost there.

648
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:49,200
Perhaps, we should consider
seeking out a more experienced shaman.

649
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,620
One with a proper patron deity,
not a greenhorn like you.

650
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:54,620
We cannot do that.

651
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,250
The shaman will only focus
on expelling the ghost.

652
00:52:58,330 --> 00:52:59,750
Doing so

653
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,670
may lead His Lord's soul
to the afterlife as well.

654
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,800
I might lose my chance
to save him forever.

655
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,760
I am sure the king would be thrilled
to know how dark your heart is.

656
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:19,940
Take it.

657
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,740
Grandma told me that the crescent blade
possessed divine powers.

658
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,070
It may not look like much,

659
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,660
but she used it to guide
countless spirits to the afterlife.

660
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,590
I have heard

661
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,090
that the luminous pearl inside an Imugi,

662
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,350
though not as powerful
as a dragon's enchanted pearl,

663
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:57,140
possesses immense power.

664
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,230
I saw it with my own two eyes
at Mount Bugak.

665
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:01,940
Even that mighty Eight-foot-tall Ghost

666
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,730
became powerless in the presence
of this luminous pearl.

667
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,400
I will hold it captive
with this talismanic iron net.

668
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,030
Then, you can use
the power of the luminous pearl

669
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:14,780
to stab it with that crescent blade.

670
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,430
BONFIRE

671
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:24,980
I hear the prince always spends his nights
in the royal library.

672
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,690
Place it there discreetly.

673
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,230
The prince shall be…

674
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:36,150
offered to the Warrior Deity tonight.

675
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,770
<i>If someone suspicious</i>
<i>approaches the library tonight,</i>

676
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:11,480
<i>just watch them from afar.</i>

677
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,320
You must capture them

678
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:15,740
when they leave the library grounds.

679
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,970
BONFIRE

680
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,240
It is the hour of the rat
that you specified.

681
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,820
HOUR OF THE RAT: 11 PM TO 1 AM

682
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:43,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

683
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:47,540
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
should appear soon.

684
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,040
Should an issue arise,

685
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,290
you just need to do what I said earlier.

686
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:10,020
Pick me up.

687
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:11,810
What?

688
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,690
There is no eunuch here.

689
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:15,610
And I cannot ask Father to pick me up.

690
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,610
Why would I pick you up?

691
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:19,820
As if standing guard
for your sake was not enough,

692
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,950
now you want me to be your parent?

693
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:27,030
Your Highness, let me.

694
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,040
Come here.

695
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,000
Your Highness.

696
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:39,420
Do you see that over there?

697
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,090
If the Eight-foot-tall Ghost appears,

698
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:44,510
it will mistake your undershirt
by that jade water bowl for you

699
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:46,140
and head over there.

700
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:48,560
I will, then, capture him

701
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,350
with that big net up there.

702
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:52,480
There is nothing to be afraid of.

703
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:57,650
I did not ask because I was scared.
Do you think I am a baby?

704
00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:58,770
Unbelievable.

705
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,150
Of course. Forgive me.

706
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:02,400
I mean it.

707
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:04,900
That ghost…

708
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:06,450
I know him well.

709
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,330
That ghost is not scary.

710
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:11,330
He is sad.

711
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:15,500
He is sad?

712
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,380
Yes.

713
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,250
I do not know why,

714
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,340
but he was sad.

715
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:24,670
Very sad.

716
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,800
Sad… How?

717
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:49,740
It is here.

718
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:24,150
Has the ghost come?

719
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,390
Gangcheori, now.

720
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:39,140
Do it!

721
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:42,540
Gangcheori!

722
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:47,340
Damn it…

723
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:49,380
<i>As you say,</i>

724
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:52,050
you may briefly be able to fend it off
with the luminous pearl,

725
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:53,590
<i>but that has its limits.</i>

726
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:03,060
The luminous pearl in your belly
must be fully drained

727
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,020
for that mighty Eight-foot-tall Ghost
to be guided…

728
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,100
Shut up.

729
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:10,190
Damn quack monk.

730
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:14,400
<i>Is Gangcheori's luminous pearl not enough?</i>

731
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,160
No.

732
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,830
The talismanic iron net is being torn.

733
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:59,120
Did you find out who that sorcerer is?

734
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:01,830
Are you all right?

735
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:03,910
That brat must be the one. She must be.

736
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:08,330
- Who are you even looking for?
- My younger brother.

737
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:10,750
<i>He is an Imugi.</i>
<i>There really was another one.</i>

738
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:11,840
Is that you, Gangcheori?

739
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,840
<i>That girl, Yeo-ri.</i>
<i>I think I might want to devour her…</i>

740
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:18,130
<i>See if you feel the same thing</i>
<i>about any other human.</i>

741
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:21,390
<i>What are you going to do</i>
<i>with that cursed thing?</i>

742
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:23,350
<i>The queen has been sowed</i>
<i>with the king's seed.</i>

743
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:25,640
<i>The Warrior Deity will have fresh prey.</i>

744
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,190
What about the queen?
Is the queen all right?

745
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:32,650
