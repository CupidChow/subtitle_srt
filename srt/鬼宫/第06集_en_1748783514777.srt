1
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,917
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,421
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,638
Gangcheori, now.

4
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,558
Do it!

5
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,038
Gangcheori!

6
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,960
Damn it…

7
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,007
Is Gangcheori's luminous pearl not enough?

8
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,764
No.

9
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,432
The talismanic iron net is being torn.

10
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,771
Stay back.

11
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,785
Your Majesty. You have to do it now.

12
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,273
Warrior Deity…

13
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,486
Out of the way!

14
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,198
Is it that scoundrel again?

15
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,368
The unknown sorcerer in the palace…

16
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,829
Who is this rascal?

17
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,498
Why must they mess with me every time?

18
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,293
Oh, Warrior Deity.

19
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,128
Warrior Deity…

20
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,142
You will not be able
to leave here on your own terms.

21
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:47,555
This is the medicine the queen
has been taking recently?

22
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,601
It does not come from the Royal Clinic.

23
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,978
It is secretly brought in
from outside the palace.

24
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,864
- Antaehwan?
Yes, Your Grace.

25
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,241
I secretly questioned
a court lady physician

26
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,536
and she told me it was medicine
prescribed to deter miscarriages.

27
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,541
I hear she also took it often
when she was pregnant with the prince.

28
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,420
The Royal Clinic seems to be
in the dark about it.

29
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,340
I do not know how she is hiding it.

30
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,390
Your Grace?

31
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,684
Summon Pung-san.

32
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,063
Your Grace, but he is--

33
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,272
I am well aware

34
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,274
that he is a vile snake.

35
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,694
However, my son has died.

36
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,865
That child…

37
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,827
and the bizarre way he died…

38
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,831
How am I to accept any of it?

39
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,716
As soon as day breaks,

40
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,262
I shall summon Fortuneteller Pung-san.

41
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,398
This is him.

42
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,109
He placed the talisman
near the Royal Library.

43
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,866
REPORT TO YOUR MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE
IF YOU HAVE SEEN A MAN OF THIS DESCRIPTION

44
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,993
We must find him first

45
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,745
if we wish to expose
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost's accomplices.

46
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,999
We are questioning every court eunuch.

47
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,959
It might not be a eunuch.

48
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,295
Expand the search
to outside the palace as well.

49
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

50
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,299
How is the security
at the prince's quarters?

51
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,467
As you have commanded,

52
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,011
It has been reinforced with
additional royal guards and stewards.

53
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,930
I dispatched dependable soldiers
who are skilled at combat.

54
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,808
Anyone would think twice
before trying to enter.

55
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,561
I installed bells

56
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,980
and a fresh talismanic iron net
at His Highness's quarters.

57
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,276
Even if someone manages to break in
and places another talisman for the ghost,

58
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,820
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
will get caught in the net

59
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,698
and the bells will ring
on their own to notify us.

60
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,165
But, where is he today?

61
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,086
It appears he became
a bit fatigued after yesterday.

62
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,506
He is resting at home
because he was feeling unwell.

63
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,468
I see.

64
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,859
But, this eyeglass lens…

65
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,445
Last time at Mount Bugak,

66
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,574
you confronted that ghost
with this lens after stealing it from me.

67
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,701
You also told me
to use this against the ghost

68
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,412
if things went awry this time.

69
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,832
What makes this so special?

70
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:06,087
That is… a Ghostbane Stone.

71
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:07,964
Ghostbane Stone?

72
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,132
It is referred to as the stone
of the Dragon King

73
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,842
and possesses mystical powers.

74
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,763
Your Majesty remained safe
from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

75
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:19,517
because you kept it with you up until now.

76
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,941
Your Majesty.

77
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,987
May I ask how you managed
to acquire that Ghostbane Stone?

78
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,159
It was…

79
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,539
By chance,
did Shaman Neop-deok present it to you?

80
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,750
Did you say Neop-deok?

81
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,172
I am certain
that female Ghostbane Stone once belonged

82
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,966
to Shaman Neop-deok.

83
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,178
Are you really not familiar
with Shaman Neop-deok?

84
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,026
Shaman Neop-deok…

85
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:15,406
was cherished by Queen Indeok,
my late grandmother.

86
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:20,202
I believe my grandmother summoned her
to the palace a few times.

87
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,581
Then…

88
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:27,543
That shaman gave me this corrective lens.

89
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,339
I did not believe in heretical ceremonies,

90
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:35,134
but I acknowledged the effort
that kind shaman put into refining it.

91
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,512
Hence, I used it to make these glasses.

92
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,847
But…

93
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,645
how do you know Shaman Neop-deok?

94
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:47,938
She is…

95
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,319
my maternal grandmother.

96
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,161
What a strange connection we have.

97
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,184
My grandmother was at this palace.

98
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,814
Did she foresee it then?

99
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,818
Did she know the royal bloodline
would be threatened by this ghost?

100
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:39,323
Is that why she gifted
the female Ghostbane Stone to him?

101
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,996
Unfortunately, this is

102
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,500
the only thing I can do for you
as a lowly subject who sympathizes

103
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,877
with His Highness's predicament.

104
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,803
If you keep this close,

105
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,306
it shall protect you.

106
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,698
I am even weaker than before…

107
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,410
This confrontation was
harder than the one at Mount Bugak.

108
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,871
How…

109
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,789
Damn it.

110
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,679
You claimed Prince Yeongin died because
of the sorcerer under the king's command.

111
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,308
Did you find out who that sorcerer is?

112
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,273
That Examiner Yoon Gap
you mentioned last time…

113
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,945
He was kicked out but returned
to the palace with a young girl.

114
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,864
I hear she has been frequenting
the Queen's Palace recently.

115
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,327
Who is she?

116
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,412
They say she is an eyeglass artisan.

117
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,457
Apparently, the king summons her
to the Royal Library frequently.

118
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,501
An eyeglass artisan?

119
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,754
I should look into that.

120
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:04,301
I cannot believe that some brat
could hinder the Warrior Deity so…

121
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,846
How dare you try to scheme before me!

122
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,766
Your Grace,

123
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,351
that is not true.

124
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,520
Then, what is the truth?

125
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,693
My son met such a tragic death…

126
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,698
but the king is expecting another child.

127
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,534
You claimed the king had a sorcerer.

128
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,453
You made a mockery of me
with this unverified claim.

129
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,372
Your Grace.

130
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,584
The energy inside the palace
shifted a fortnight ago.

131
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,044
I am certain the figure
who first entered the palace then

132
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,797
to stay by His Majesty's side

133
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,632
is the sorcerer.

134
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,677
A fortnight ago?
Yes, Your Grace.

135
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:50,014
However, did you just say

136
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,350
that His Majesty is expecting a new member

137
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,227
of the royal bloodline?

138
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,154
The queen has been sowed
with the king's seed.

139
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,615
The Warrior Deity will have fresh prey.

140
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,409
Are you all right?

141
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,704
Yes. I am fine. Just fine.

142
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,333
Should you not have a seeing guide?

143
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,253
Well, I do have a servant,
but something came up

144
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,880
and I could not bring him with me.

145
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:23,964
Hold on,

146
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,426
you have quite an extraordinary aura
for a young maiden.

147
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,969
Are you a court lady?

148
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,139
No. I am an eyeglass artisan
at the Royal Couturier.

149
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,603
The young maiden
possesses such remarkable talent.

150
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,981
Anyhow, thank you.

151
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,650
Not at all.

152
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,531
That brat must be the one.

153
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,450
She must be.

154
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,748
Is he a fortuneteller?

155
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,531
What are you going to do
with that cursed thing?

156
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,615
Well…

157
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,662
it seems the royal bloodline
is expecting a new member.

158
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,542
I will take that nascent fetus

159
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,669
to create the most restorative tonic

160
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,464
that will heal
the Warrior Deity's injuries.

161
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,633
A soul, not tainted by the grime
of the mortal world in the slightest.

162
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:36,597
It will be most helpful
in revitalizing the Warrior Deity.

163
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,494
Were you waiting for me?

164
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,872
Is it not obvious?
I am your patron deity, after all.

165
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,293
Because you are worried I might be jinxed
by some wandering spirit?

166
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,630
Yes. You are correct.

167
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,683
Are you feeling all right?

168
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:26,105
Last time, it seemed like
you recharge in clean, fresh water.

169
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,940
Maybe you should again?

170
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,526
I have already done so.

171
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,237
I see.

172
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,991
Listen, about what happened yesterday…

173
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,037
I guess I thought with your luminous pearl

174
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,539
and my grandma's implements,

175
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,585
we would be able to confront
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost without issue.

176
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,964
I was too hasty and rash…

177
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,591
and it made you overexert yourself.

178
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,097
So? Do you wish to give up
on being my disciple?

179
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,266
What?

180
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,435
You agreed to become my disciple
because you believed

181
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,521
that I could catch
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

182
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,315
However, when the chance arose,
I failed to do so.

183
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:15,028
Hence, you no longer have any reason
to serve me as your patron deity.

184
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,952
No.

185
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,248
An agreement
between a patron deity and a disciple

186
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,584
cannot be broken so easily.

187
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,588
I still hold some resentment
and contempt for you.

188
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,964
However, I also know

189
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,259
that for many years,
you did whatever it took

190
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,635
to keep me safe.

191
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,973
And you continue to do so to this day.

192
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,561
Am I wrong?

193
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,485
You are correct.

194
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,632
That is strange.

195
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,134
You are right here…

196
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,263
but I sense the aura
of an Imugi over there, too.

197
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,767
Bibi.

198
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,357
My lord, let me pour you a drink.

199
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,193
How nice.

200
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,237
Did you hear that rumor?

201
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,281
They say a ghost was responsible
for Prince Yeongin's demise.

202
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,660
I heard that rumor as well.

203
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:49,706
But you know, I believe those ghost rumors
have been around since the late king.

204
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,791
Yes.

205
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,877
For the past few years,
rumors of ghosts being responsible

206
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,587
for the sudden deaths of royal kin

207
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,090
have been swirling around
and making their rounds.

208
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:02,177
My goodness, so the ghosts
are wiping out the royals?

209
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,271
All that stuff

210
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,190
was just uselessly made up
by the court ladies.

211
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,277
Nothing more than silly rumors.

212
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,948
What is Lord Choi Won-u up to?

213
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,075
Well, apparently,

214
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,453
he simply offered
his condolences for Prince Yeongin

215
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,789
and left before even having
an audience with the king.

216
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,751
From what I hear,
he was bedridden from an illness

217
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,379
and did not meet with anyone.

218
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,096
I do not believe you need
to be concerned about him.

219
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,100
My lord, may I pour you a drink as well?

220
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,689
He is a childhood friend,
currently the magistrate of Gwacheon.

221
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:59,151
He was so desperate
for a chance to meet you

222
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,820
and begged me so incessantly…

223
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,114
Excuse me. I need to relieve myself.

224
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,450
Pardon?
Wait, my lord…

225
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,787
My lord…

226
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,586
Who are you even looking for?

227
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,837
My younger brother.

228
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,965
What? You have a younger brother?

229
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,010
Then, that Imugi aura I detected earlier…

230
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,817
How dare you!

231
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,695
How dare a measly examiner

232
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,199
display such impertinence to me,
the Minister of War!

233
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,578
Is it because you are
an ignorant, lowborn bastard?

234
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,414
Possibly.

235
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,124
Probably.

236
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,544
Why that scoundrel…

237
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,967
Rascal, did you pass
your 60th birthday this year?

238
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,803
What did you say?

239
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,554
You are fine if you did not,

240
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,474
but if you did,
you should be careful here.

241
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,310
One could argue
that I ended up in this body

242
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,187
and was able to welcome
Yeo-ri as my disciple,

243
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,855
all thanks to you.

244
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,565
That is why I kindly offer this advice.

245
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,568
My sword. Where is it?

246
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,863
How dare you insult me like this?
You scoundrel!

247
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,621
Heed my warning.

248
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,624
I am a bit busy
looking for my younger brother.

249
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,835
If you interfere once more,

250
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,586
I will not hold back.

251
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,056
Did I not warn you?

252
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,100
You scoundrel!

253
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,412
My goodness. You were telling the truth.

254
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,623
I thought you were bluffing
with that constant talk of whirlwinds,

255
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,167
but you just released a whirlwind

256
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,586
and blew him away.

257
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,213
That was nothing.

258
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,508
Yeo-ri, I am Gangcheori.

259
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,553
The most malicious malevolent deity
who humans fear the most.

260
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,806
Wait, how far did you send him away?

261
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,975
I am not sure.

262
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,060
Wind can be so unpredictable.

263
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,187
I cannot say.

264
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,815
Based on the direction,
it seems he will be riding the north wind.

265
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,567
Perhaps, he will land by the sea off Jeju?

266
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,945
Gosh!

267
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,697
Why did you hit me?
What now?

268
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,699
He is the Minister of War, a real bigwig!

269
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,784
Did you even consider
the possible consequences?

270
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,413
That man…

271
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,957
is Yoon Gap's killer.

272
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,752
What?

273
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,755
He was the one
who stabbed Yoon Gap to death.

274
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,175
Is that true?

275
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:16,640
Then, the Kwak Sang-chung
you mentioned last time…

276
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,100
Correct. That was him.

277
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,435
I saw it with my own eyes.

278
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,316
Good job.

279
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,360
Well done!

280
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:32,072
You should have just blasted
him off to Japan while you were at it.

281
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,785
Where?
Go.

282
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,453
A bit further.
Where?

283
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,621
It came from over here.

284
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,457
Lord Kwak's scream came from over here.

285
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,042
What in the world is going on?

286
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,507
Are you not Examiner Yoon Gap?

287
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,760
What are you…

288
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,638
doing here?

289
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,727
We just heard Lord Kwak scream.

290
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,146
By chance, did you do something to him?

291
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,231
What?

292
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,442
My lord, your jest goes too far.

293
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,988
As if Lord Kwak
with his exceptional combat skills

294
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,699
could even be ruffled
by this wimpy whippersnapper.

295
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,910
Where in the world is Lord Kwak?

296
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,745
A whirlwind just now--

297
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,580
We heard a whirlwind pass through

298
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,166
and the sound of a scream as well.

299
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,336
However, we did not see
a single person in the vicinity.

300
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,339
Right, my lord?
You did not see anybody, either.

301
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,175
My goodness.

302
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,969
What are we to do?

303
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,345
What is going on here?

304
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,972
How will we find him?

305
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,690
He is an Imugi.

306
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,610
There really was
another one besides Gangcheori.

307
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,340
That man is dead.

308
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,674
He killed that man instantly.

309
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,093
What is with that Imugi?

310
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,557
Where in the world could Lord Kwak be?

311
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,060
My goodness.
We must find him.

312
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,816
Look here, my lord.

313
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,527
What has gotten into you?

314
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,654
My goodness. What happened to him?
What is going on?

315
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,823
Wake up.
Why am I…

316
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,325
Open your eyes!

317
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,078
Go and fetch a physician.
Right.

318
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,246
Hear me! Is anyone there?

319
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,373
Hear me!

320
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,957
What is going on here?
Yes, my lord?

321
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,709
Let us hurry. Come on.

322
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,795
Quickly now.

323
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,964
Oh, goodness. My lord.

324
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,425
How terrible.

325
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,266
Oh my…

326
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,900
Who are you?

327
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:14,984
Me?

328
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,570
I am Imugi Bibi. I'm here to eat you.

329
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,865
Eat? Eat what?

330
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,284
Do not come any closer. Stop!

331
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,869
Stay back! Stop!

332
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,153
I have not been this stuffed in ages.

333
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,239
His belly was full of spite.

334
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,324
Quite tasty indeed.

335
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,743
He ate him.

336
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,578
He just devoured a man.

337
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,624
You have not changed one bit, Bibi.

338
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,209
What?

339
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:14,919
You see me?

340
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,808
Is that you, Gangcheori?

341
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,980
I just cannot believe this.

342
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,232
So, it is true.

343
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,068
The Gangcheori I know

344
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,820
is really inside this body.

345
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,864
Damn it.

346
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,993
Even when the wandering spirits
at the market street

347
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,245
yammered away about some clueless Imugi

348
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,748
being stuck in a human body, I…

349
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,001
I still had hope that it was not you.

350
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,337
But they were indeed
actually talking about you?

351
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,674
Geez.

352
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:07,138
Who knew the invincible, lofty Gangcheori
would end up in such a sad state?

353
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,474
Seeing as how emaciated you look,

354
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,434
your hunt for aristocrats
must not be going easy.

355
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,353
Maybe I ate too many of them?

356
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,022
The supply of aristocrats over 60
has been drained in the south.

357
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,816
That is why I have come to the capital.

358
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,528
There are bountiful feasts
all over the capital.

359
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,321
You can eat whatever you want.

360
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,990
How many more do you need?

361
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,993
I need 12. Once I eat 12 more,

362
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,954
that will make 100 aristocrats over 60.

363
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,373
Once I do, I shall ascend
into the sky as a black dragon.

364
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,709
I shall occasionally let you know
how I am doing from up there.

365
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,298
"Gangcheori!"

366
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,552
"The water up here is so nice!
Ascend so we can have some fun together!"

367
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,056
That is enough foolishness.

368
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,642
Come out now.
Where?

369
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,479
Come out of
that smelly human body already.

370
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,068
Do I look like I have a choice?
What?

371
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,029
What?

372
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,908
Are you kidding me?
Do you really not know how?

373
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,079
Do you?

374
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,873
It is so simple.

375
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,584
You need to destroy this body you are in.

376
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,044
Just kill this Yoon Gap
or whatever his name is.

377
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,922
As if there was anything easier
to kill than a mortal.

378
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,508
I need to…

379
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:27,802
kill this body?

380
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,766
Just jump off a cliff

381
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,351
or stab it in the heart.

382
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,271
It is so simple.
What are you complaining about?

383
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,233
Look. That would be perfect.

384
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,158
Grab it.

385
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,036
Damn it.

386
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,288
Turn it.

387
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,209
Just stab it.

388
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,755
Stab it?

389
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,300
Stop!

390
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,553
Who says you can kill His Lord?
Absolutely not.

391
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,306
It is that brat from before.

392
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,434
You locked eyes with me earlier.
Can you see me?

393
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,604
Yes.

394
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,230
Also,

395
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,566
we are already linked
as patron deity and disciple.

396
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,277
We agreed to keep
this body safe until we catch

397
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,404
that Eight-foot-tall Ghost
and save Lord Yoon Gap.

398
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,781
What?

399
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:30,865
Gap!

400
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,744
Move it.

401
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:35,828
Gap!

402
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,295
Gap!

403
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,714
Tell her I am sleeping.

404
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,132
I am asleep.

405
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,469
Gap!

406
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,891
I came in to borrow this,

407
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,727
but it seems His Lord is already sleeping.

408
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,229
He is sleeping already?

409
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,022
I thought I heard him talking outside.

410
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,565
Oh, that…

411
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,359
He kept talking in his sleep.

412
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,319
It must have been
a busy day at the palace.

413
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,114
My goodness.
What am I going to do with this punk?

414
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,365
What is the matter?

415
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,283
That expensive medicine I bought for him…

416
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,035
He dumped all of it in the outhouse.

417
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,496
What?
I cannot believe him.

418
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,748
You damn punk!
Do you know how much that costs?

419
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,084
How could you dump
that precious medicine out like that?

420
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,711
You could have just let me take it!

421
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:27,046
I am so upset, I could die!

422
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,756
I cannot believe you!

423
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,258
How can you even sleep?

424
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,719
This damn punk. How can you even sleep?

425
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,854
Going to the outhouse?

426
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,149
This is hilarious.

427
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,109
The almighty Gangcheori…

428
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,572
is now forced to use
that smelly, dirty outhouse.

429
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,493
That brat from earlier…

430
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,997
She is the one you used
to chase around and obsess over, right?

431
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:05,001
Are you really going to fight
that pesky Eight-foot-tall Ghost?

432
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,503
Just for that measly human's sake?

433
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,297
I already gave her my word I would.

434
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,883
Gangcheori.

435
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,509
Gangcheori…

436
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,553
Okay, fine.

437
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,347
Once a human with mighty spiritual energy
starts serving you

438
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,099
with great reverence as your disciple,

439
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,895
you get another chance to ascend.
I am also familiar with that legend.

440
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:24,979
However,

441
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,231
how can you trust those lowly mortals?

442
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,984
You know how fickle they can be.

443
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:34,989
Bibi.

444
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,451
I learned a few things while living
in this despicable mortal world.

445
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,495
Guess what the most useful thing is.

446
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,871
What is it?

447
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,457
Lying.

448
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,428
Gosh, who knew you were such a jerk?

449
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,139
The most malicious, malevolent deity.

450
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,851
I plan to go with how things play out
for the time being.

451
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,480
And there are so many dishes
I have yet to taste.

452
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:15,613
Once that girl fully opens her heart to me
and follows me wholeheartedly…

453
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,992
I shall kill this body and escape

454
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,745
to claim her for myself.

455
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:25,957
Yes, great.

456
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,959
Excellent.

457
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,128
You can just go right for it. Yes.

458
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,715
Hear me, you scoundrels!

459
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,137
Is anyone out there?

460
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,181
Get me down this instant.

461
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,392
Why these scoundrels…

462
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:48,437
I am Kwak Sang-chung, the Minister of War!

463
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,523
Get me down now! Go on!

464
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,151
Hear me, scoundrels!

465
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,869
Is there truly no one there?

466
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,038
Can someone get me down?

467
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,960
Those wretched lords.

468
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,922
I shall teach them
a painful lesson when I return.

469
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,007
I shall!

470
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,259
Wait. No.

471
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,345
Please.

472
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,515
Please, can someone just let me down?

473
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,310
Anyone, please just get me down from here.

474
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,752
Wait.

475
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,379
Just stay there. Let me step out first.

476
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,814
Damn it. This is insane.

477
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,691
What is insane?
Damn it!

478
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:20,071
You startled me.
Startled enough to blush like a peach?

479
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,033
What happened?

480
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,118
What is it?

481
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,329
Listen, Yeo-ri--

482
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,622
I mean, Listen, Bibi.

483
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:34,794
The desire to devour an aristocrat…

484
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,215
Does it make you want
to stare at them all the time?

485
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:43,177
Does it make your heart race
when they are near?

486
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,429
Does it make you want
to touch them and stuff?

487
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,514
No.

488
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,184
I am too busy gobbling them down.
Who has time for touching?

489
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,937
Are you like that?

490
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,690
That girl, Yeo-ri…

491
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,192
She has finally accepted me
as her patron deity.

492
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,945
But my heart strangely aches
whenever I am near her.

493
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,239
And sometimes,

494
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,450
I think I might want to devour her…

495
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,161
How strange…

496
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,830
What about other mortals?

497
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:12,999
Other mortals?

498
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,968
Does Lord Yoon Gap…

499
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,054
really live in this village?

500
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,432
Did you think
a low-ranking official born a bastard

501
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,475
would be living in fancy Bukchon?

502
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,691
Goodness.

503
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,494
I should have known.

504
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:55,541
I guess love that overcomes social classes
only exist in fairy tales.

505
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:59,545
Gosh, my lady! That is quite an epiphany!

506
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,796
My goodness!

507
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,425
All right. We should return now.

508
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,261
You will be in big trouble
with His Excellency if he finds out.

509
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,641
But still, we need to return this plant.

510
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,310
He may be looking for it.

511
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,868
Another mortal?

512
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,244
Yes.

513
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:36,332
See if you feel the same thing
about any other human.

514
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,877
Another mortal.

515
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,445
She is another mortal…

516
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,155
but I do not

517
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,365
feel…

518
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,200
anything.

519
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,579
My lord.

520
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:25,047
This is the plant
you entrusted me with last time.

521
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,799
I came here to return it.

522
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,593
The plant from that damn quack monk?

523
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,719
I do not need it.

524
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,013
Keep it or toss it.

525
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,765
Do as you wish.

526
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,566
Now, I understand…

527
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,571
I do not want to devour her as Bibi does.

528
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,707
Gosh.

529
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,171
I assumed you were staying home
when I did not see you.

530
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,964
What are you talking about?

531
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,383
You expect a patron deity to stay behind?

532
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,807
So, what choice do I have?

533
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:04,271
I cannot keep my promise to you
and defeat the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

534
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:09,068
Nor can I leave this body
and abandon your side.

535
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,322
I have no choice but to continue lying

536
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,617
and prolong the time we have together.

537
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,675
It's strange…

538
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,511
Something about His Lord has changed.

539
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,721
He is not the man I first met.

540
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,100
How did he change?

541
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:44,103
How shall I put it? He seems a bit wilder.

542
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,189
It makes him even more attractive.

543
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,193
Attractive? As if.
He just shoved you aside.

544
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,697
Hey, that was because he was embarrassed.

545
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,948
See?

546
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,866
He even gave me a gift.

547
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,786
Did you not hear him tell you to toss it?

548
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,706
You just do not understand.

549
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,417
His Lord may seem curt on the outside,

550
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,128
but he has a warm, tender heart
on the inside.

551
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,548
Such men are prevalent in fairy tales.

552
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,592
I see. Sure.

553
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,308
What? What is the matter?

554
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,102
What?
Shush.

555
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,233
Is that Father?

556
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:35,446
What is he doing with such ruffians?

557
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,372
Help yourself.

558
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,292
The Royal Confectionery
is known for its desserts.

559
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,003
Thank you.

560
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,638
By chance,

561
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,557
could I forgo them now
and take them with me later?

562
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,683
Why?

563
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,852
For Examiner Yoon Gap's sake?

564
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,188
No, I would not go that far.

565
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,151
He is waiting for me outside

566
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,153
for he is not allowed
in the Queen's Palace.

567
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,823
Do not worry and help yourself.

568
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,409
I shall have them pack some
for Examiner Yoon separately.

569
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,536
Thank you.

570
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,749
Instead of the yugwa,
you should send him dasik and yakgwa.

571
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,167
They are tastier.

572
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,712
It appears you have
some affection for Examiner Yoon.

573
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,506
Did he treat you well?

574
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,341
Well, what happened was--

575
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,259
I would not say he treated me well.

576
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,473
I find him comical.

577
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:48,018
I have never met a man like him
in the palace before.

578
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,478
What was that?

579
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,275
Your Highness.
Mother.

580
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:05,744
A vision?

581
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:08,997
My apologies.

582
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,585
It appears my stomach is a bit upset.

583
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,172
Your Highness, are you all right?

584
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,719
Perhaps, you should take your leave now.

585
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,888
Yes.

586
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,309
Your Highness, are you all right?

587
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,397
Why are you not leaving?

588
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,899
Your Highness, by chance,

589
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,485
have you dreamt of a nightmare recently?

590
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,196
How do you…

591
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,165
Escort the prince out
and give us the room.

592
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,026
How did you know about that?

593
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,738
Just a moment ago,
I had a vision of Your Highness.

594
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:26,825
You were suffering from a nightmare.

595
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,165
It has already been several days

596
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,584
since I started having that nightmare.

597
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,034
At first,

598
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,870
I thought it was
just an upsetting nightmare.

599
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,958
However, as the days passed,
the nightmare felt more real.

600
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,418
It felt as if I was
actually experiencing it.

601
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:24,174
Did you say he spat out
black water from his mouth?

602
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,390
Can you figure out the cause?

603
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:37,187
Please allow me to inspect
your chambers for a moment.

604
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,496
My goodness!

605
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,083
My lord!

606
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,419
Thank the heavens you are safe.

607
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,171
I would call this divine intervention.

608
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,382
It is indeed a great relief.

609
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,675
What happened to you?

610
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:10,095
The whole capital was
flipped inside out to look for you.

611
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,598
Where in the world have you been?

612
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,644
And what happened to your leg?

613
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,187
Yoon Gap.

614
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:22,107
Where is that scoundrel?

615
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,442
Pardon?

616
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,247
There you are!

617
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,376
Why you…

618
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:45,505
You rotten scoundrel.

619
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,007
You ghastly rascal.

620
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,634
How did you do it?

621
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,385
How did you do that to me?

622
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,638
You came sooner than I expected.

623
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,848
And you are surprisingly…

624
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:56,933
perfectly intact.

625
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,226
What did you say? Why you…

626
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:02,272
I will kill you someday.

627
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,816
I will pay you back
a hundred, a thousandfold!

628
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,526
What is all this commotion about?

629
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,238
Your Majesty.

630
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,825
Minister, what happened to you?

631
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,578
And what exactly

632
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,706
did Examiner Yoon do to enrage you so?

633
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,669
This scoundrel.
This scoundrel and his whirlwind…

634
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,048
His whirlwind…

635
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,690
I do not expect you to observe
proper etiquette towards me.

636
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,359
You are not Yoon Gap.

637
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,071
Therefore you are not one of my subjects.

638
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,283
Then, you should have
just kept on walking.

639
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,451
Why did you bring me here?

640
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,911
However,

641
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:00,956
once you draw attention to yourself
by acting out like this,

642
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,544
I will no longer be able
to protect you or Yeo-ri.

643
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,212
Would that be fine as well?

644
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:12,384
So, you order us to stop
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost,

645
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,553
but if things go awry,

646
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:18,932
you will simply play dumb
and leave us to take the fall?

647
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,686
Is that it?

648
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,481
Why this rotten little…

649
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,566
You scoundrel.

650
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,151
You are right.

651
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,027
I am not one of your subjects.

652
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,155
I am…

653
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,284
Gangcheori.

654
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,078
Gangcheori?

655
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,459
As in that wretched Imugi

656
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,086
who brings forth misfortune
wherever he goes?

657
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,422
You refer to
that malevolent deity from legends?

658
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:57,179
I believe I have heard
of him as well, Your Majesty.

659
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,723
He was on his way to ascend as a dragon,

660
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:03,226
but he was jinxed when a human spotted him
and he fell back down to earth.

661
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,729
Afterward, he spent
his time tormenting mortals.

662
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,773
That rotten Imugi…

663
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,442
And…

664
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,611
you are him?

665
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,128
It is perfectly clean.

666
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,507
Nothing seems out of place.
What could it be?

667
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:28,520
May I step up for a moment?

668
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,440
You may.

669
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,038
What is the matter?

670
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,769
My goodness!

671
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:12,647
Your Highness.

672
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,164
Do you finally understand?

673
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,251
Do you understand who I really am now?

674
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:38,882
Although I am unsure if feeble mortal eyes
can perceive such things.

675
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,594
Since we will be
spending some time together,

676
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:45,263
I shall graciously explain it to you.

677
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,140
So,

678
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:49,434
if the king is here,

679
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:52,312
I may be a malevolent deity
but a deity nonetheless.

680
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,440
I am here.

681
00:53:56,024 --> 00:54:00,403
Thus, who should observe
proper etiquette toward whom?

682
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,582
But,

683
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:16,378
what exactly happened
between you and the Minister of War?

684
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:20,507
From what I heard,
you were present when he went missing.

685
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,342
Were you the one responsible?

686
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,927
Oh, that?

687
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,679
He just kept yammering away,

688
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,764
so I sent him off with a whirlwind.

689
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,391
A whirl…

690
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,559
What?
A whirlwind.

691
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,605
I summoned a whirlwind
and sent him packing.

692
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:36,940
Blasted him right off.

693
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,192
What? What did you say?

694
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:43,238
What did you blast off with a whirlwind?

695
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,323
Must I repeat myself?

696
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,243
I hurled that fool into the sky.

697
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,997
But it seems in this human body,

698
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,456
I am weaker than I used to be.

699
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:58,169
I thought he would land by the sea
off Jeju and we would enjoy some quiet,

700
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,338
but seeing as how he returned
in just a few days,

701
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,841
it appears he did not go very far.

702
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,217
So, you are saying

703
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:08,430
you made the Minister of War
fly off with a whirlwind?

704
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,266
You? You did that?

705
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:30,994
Your Majesty.

706
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,787
Something terrible has happened.

707
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,422
Are you saying

708
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,383
this object was discovered
inside the queen's chambers?

709
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,472
What about the queen?
Is the queen all right?

710
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,391
Yes, Your Majesty.
She fainted for a moment,

711
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,019
but the royal physician
said she would be fine.

712
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,480
However…

713
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,444
Since she is with child,

714
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,446
he said she should be careful.

715
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,325
What are you talking about?

716
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,912
What do you mean the queen is with child?

717
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:18,208
Are you saying Her Highness is pregnant?

718
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:22,003
Your Majesty, I have sinned gravely!

719
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,589
Her Highness feared
something terrible would happen

720
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:27,300
due to the Eight-foot-tall Ghost,

721
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,385
so I remained silent on the matter.

722
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:37,060
Then, this skull…

723
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,367
What…

724
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,918
BONFIRE

725
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,253
What is that?

726
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,842
It was written by the same person

727
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,511
as the last talisman.

728
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,305
Then…

729
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:59,058
this is related
to the Eight-foot-tall Ghost?

730
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,727
Yes, Your Majesty.

731
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,062
And this talisman…

732
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,315
Speak!

733
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,817
It appears this talisman

734
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,695
targets the baby in Her Highness's womb.

735
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,887
Make no exception

736
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:39,098
and apprehend every attendant
in the Queen's Palace!

737
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

738
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,445
Just a moment.

739
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,614
Please let me inspect it a bit longer.

740
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,329
What are you trying to do?

741
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,790
I cannot just stand by and watch.

742
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,209
How could they target an unborn child?

743
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:08,503
I will get them.

744
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,047
Do you think you can find out who it is?

745
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:15,134
The ghost tormenting Her Highness
must be here,

746
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,346
but my powers feel blocked by something.

747
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,601
I must retrieve my myeongdu
from the Royal Couturier.

748
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:27,313
MYEONGDU: A MIRROR THAT REVEALS
SPIRITS TO A SHAMAN

749
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,722
Stop.

750
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,224
You must be more careful.

751
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,351
What did I tell you?

752
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,940
A myeongdu reveals spirits

753
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,736
and reflects the world
unseen by mortal eyes.

754
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,823
It is how a shaman finds their voice.

755
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:20,992
You must treat it like a part of your body

756
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,119
and cherish it.

757
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,167
Myeongdu, the mirror for spirits.

758
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,460
With this…

759
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,173
What is the matter?

760
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,281
I suggest you stop there.

761
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:03,326
His sword is powerful enough
to easily annihilate

762
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:05,620
and completely wipe out
a wandering spirit like yourself.

763
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:19,258
He was a drowned ghost.

764
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,760
What?

765
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,053
That makes no sense.

766
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,555
How did it manage to stay
out of water for that long?

767
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,142
It must have been thanks to that talisman.

768
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,938
That is how he managed
to brazenly stay on dry land for so long.

769
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,694
He escaped through this waterway.

770
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:38,861
We must catch him.

771
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,011
There he is.

772
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,140
That is where he is hiding.

773
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,960
Make sure you catch him.

774
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:45,386
Grant me mercy so that I may salvage
and guide this spirit to cross over.

775
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,197
Got you.

776
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,257
Are you all right?

777
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:29,430
What is wrong?

778
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,722
Damn wandering spirit…

779
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,655
If you tell me who instigated it,

780
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,283
I shall spare your life.

781
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:15,494
I thought you may know something.

782
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,039
Are you suspecting me right now?

783
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:21,250
Something feels off. My body feels heavy.

784
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,127
She ended up being struck by a curse
in the end.

785
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:24,837
The queen has similar symptoms.

786
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,673
That vicious drowned ghost
is targeting the unborn child.

787
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,508
Then, will you offer
your son in your stead?

788
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,511
There is only one way to break that curse.

789
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,597
You catch the ghost that placed it.

790
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,515
Yeo-ri will die if we waste any more time.

791
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,645
