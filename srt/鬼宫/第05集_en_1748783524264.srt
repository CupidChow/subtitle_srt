1
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,917
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,421
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,806
What happened here?

4
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,435
Is he dead?

5
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,520
Yes.

6
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,939
Your Majesty.

7
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,191
Who would do such a thing?

8
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,860
I am not sure, Your Majesty.

9
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,863
I came by in the morning
with basin water for washing his face…

10
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,158
There is no sign of
an outsider breaking in.

11
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,370
Then, who would dare to do such a thing?

12
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,590
It reeks the same
as the prince's chambers.

13
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,640
Make way.

14
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,355
No, this cannot be…

15
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,357
No…

16
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,984
This cannot be!

17
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,653
Get rid of this!

18
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,948
I refuse to accept this.

19
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,491
I refuse…

20
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,744
Wake up, my dear child.

21
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,037
Mother is here.

22
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,249
Please, wake up.

23
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,376
Open your eyes!

24
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,378
Do not just dawdle!

25
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,423
Do something! Bring him back to life now!

26
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,800
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost…

27
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,386
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost will return.

28
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,389
Just open your eyes!

29
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,383
Goodness. Goodness me.

30
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,055
What in the world?

31
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,058
You…

32
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,645
How long have you been up there?

33
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,148
Were you that worried about Yeo-ri?

34
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,984
Enough for you to stand guard
even before the morning dew sets?

35
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,070
That creature should not be taken lightly.

36
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,948
I assumed as much
when that remarkable child

37
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,909
came looking for
her grandmother's shamanic implements.

38
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,703
He must be quite formidable.

39
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,918
I hear…

40
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,673
you are most renowned
for your Restorative Offering Rituals.

41
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,217
Did Yeo-ri tell you that?

42
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,262
We are dealing
with an Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

43
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:26,599
I can fend him off briefly with my powers,
but eradicating him will be difficult.

44
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,104
Can you

45
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,274
guide that wicked spirit to the afterlife?

46
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,951
Do you ask because you truly do not know?

47
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,496
What?

48
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,458
There is only one way you can lift
the grudge of such a mighty evil spirit

49
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,127
and guide it to the afterlife.

50
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,007
The enchanted pearl of a dragon.

51
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,387
Or what an Imugi like yourself
holds deep in his body…

52
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,433
the luminous pearl.

53
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:28,036
There is no other way
to lift the grudge of an evil spirit.

54
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,277
MIRROR OF THE SUN, MOON, AND STARS

55
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,660
<i>Be gone.</i>

56
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,240
Thus, if you wish to truly guide
that ghost to the afterlife,

57
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,575
you have only one option.

58
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,410
You must

59
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,871
sacrifice yourself.

60
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,499
As you say,

61
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,502
you may briefly be able to fend it off
with the luminous pearl,

62
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,837
but that has its limits.

63
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,924
The luminous pearl in your belly
must be fully drained

64
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,427
and you must sacrifice yourself

65
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,349
for that mighty Eight-foot-tall Ghost
to be guided to the afterlife.

66
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,060
What do you say?

67
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,397
Would you like to try?

68
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,441
You quack monk…

69
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,277
It appears you are hell-bent on dying.

70
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,488
You want me to drain my luminous pearl

71
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,116
and kill myself to capture
some measly Eight-foot-tall Ghost?

72
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,644
Are you planning to leave?

73
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,854
Yes.

74
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,983
If I wait any longer, I might never
be able to save Lord Yoon Gap.

75
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,737
I have my grandma's implements now.
I need to confront him again.

76
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,077
What?

77
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,669
What do you want?

78
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,091
You are still unfit
to accept a patron deity.

79
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,760
What happened to all that boasting
about great offerings?

80
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,428
Offerings…

81
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,350
Then, are you granting my request now?

82
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,310
I shall decide
after I see the offering first.

83
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,536
I actually finished making it a while ago.

84
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,122
I have not been able to bring it up
because you have been

85
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,331
so cold to me recently.

86
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,836
I genuinely put a lot of care
and effort into making it.

87
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:52,258
With heartfelt care,
I braided thread by thread with prayer.

88
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,343
I did.

89
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,852
Are you really going
to become my patron deity?

90
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,481
Can you really defeat the
Eight-foot-tall Ghost and save His Lord?

91
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,777
Fine.

92
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,988
I shall do that for you.

93
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,032
Thus,

94
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,367
prepare for the ceremony.

95
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,913
- Ceremony?
- Since I am trapped in this human body,

96
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,957
a proper descent ritual
will not be possible,

97
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,792
but some semblance of it
should be observed.

98
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,795
Yes, you are right.
The ceremony is important.

99
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,132
We need a ritual meal and what else?

100
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,216
Hold on.

101
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,085
Bring my son back to life.

102
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,878
My son!

103
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,714
I trusted you,

104
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,634
but you failed to protect
my son in the end.

105
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,053
How could you let him die?

106
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,554
Your Grace.

107
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:24,892
I shall rip you apart
piece by piece, limb from limb.

108
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,019
I shall rip you apart!

109
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,938
Your Grace!

110
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,484
Your lowly servant failed
to protect His Highness!

111
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,154
Please end my life!

112
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:39,949
Most certainly.

113
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,576
I shall gladly end it for you.

114
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,250
I shall kill you

115
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,960
so you may…

116
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,090
accompany my dear son
on the road to the afterlife!

117
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,050
If such a thing were possible,

118
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:02,096
I would gladly die a hundred times over.

119
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,558
However, should we not first avenge

120
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,061
the tragic death of our beloved prince?

121
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,646
Avenge his death?

122
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,441
There is a powerful sorcerer in the palace

123
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,486
and I helplessly fell victim to them.

124
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,780
We must find that scoundrel!

125
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,031
If we fail to do so,

126
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:26,036
even Your Grace will be in grave danger!

127
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,790
My dear son…

128
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:37,089
died because of that damn sorcerer?

129
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,716
Yes, Your Grace.

130
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,845
There must be someone new
in the king's vicinity.

131
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,724
I am certain they must be the sorcerer.

132
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,231
Then, the king…

133
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:02,072
<i>Surely, at the end of the day,</i>
<i>that random sorcerer is the one to blame.</i>

134
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,285
<i>If that sorcerer did not leave</i>
<i>the Warrior Deity so battered,</i>

135
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,704
<i>he would not have gone</i>
<i>after Prince Yeongin.</i>

136
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,249
<i>But who is this sorcerer anyway?</i>

137
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,584
As a disciple,
I welcome you as my patron deity.

138
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,170
I shall serve you with reverence.

139
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,631
I, the Imugi Gangcheori,

140
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,883
shall accept you as my disciple

141
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,553
and become your steadfast benefactor.

142
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,953
Your hand.

143
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,397
When did you have time
to prepare such a thing?

144
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,233
When you were preparing the ritual meal,

145
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,611
I trekked down to the market to buy it.

146
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,365
Do you like it?

147
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,954
Well, it's not bad.

148
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,541
My hair will not go up just yet.

149
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,210
I will start wearing it up
after you save His Lord

150
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,339
from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
and leave his body.

151
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,384
Do as you wish.

152
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,515
That being said,

153
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,520
even if Yoon Gap's soul
fails to return to this body,

154
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,566
you will remain my disciple regardless.

155
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,902
What are you talking about?

156
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,821
You heard me.

157
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,740
Even if I leave this body,

158
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,451
there is no guarantee
his soul will return.

159
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,912
You must be aware of this as well.

160
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,706
Well, that is true.

161
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,625
Furthermore,

162
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,962
even if you successfully save his soul
and bring him back to life,

163
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,923
nothing will change
until I ascend as a dragon.

164
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,886
Even if you ardently hold him
in your heart,

165
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,013
I will never…

166
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,725
let you go.

167
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,353
I know.

168
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,690
So, you just focus on catching
that Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

169
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,902
Sure.

170
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,280
If you accept me as your patron deity,

171
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,367
I will gladly…

172
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,955
destroy that Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

173
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,005
Your Majesty.

174
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,719
I remain beyond stunned
by Prince Yeongin's passing.

175
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,471
I implore you to pause
the morning court assembly

176
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,559
and properly observe
traditional funeral rites.

177
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,271
You may do so.

178
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:07,735
Be sure to properly follow
the customs with the utmost care.

179
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,656
Furthermore, the chief royal secretary
will pay condolences…

180
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,802
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

181
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,898
Your Majesty!

182
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,488
Your Majesty, are you all right?

183
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,908
Chief State Councillor.

184
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,789
I must be suffering from severe fatigue.

185
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:06,835
How could I fall asleep like that
after summoning you?

186
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,715
You do not need to hide
such things in my presence.

187
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,469
Ever since the late king passed away
in such a manner,

188
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,305
Your Majesty

189
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,350
has painstakingly hidden your emotions,

190
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,018
time and time again.

191
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,815
It led you to become a remarkable king,

192
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:33,070
but it only broke
my old heart and pained me so.

193
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:39,660
I am well aware Your Majesty cherished

194
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,121
His Highness, Prince Yeongin.

195
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,915
The whole world…

196
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,254
whispered about him
being a threat to my position…

197
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:58,011
but I simply pitied that poor boy
who lost his father at a young age.

198
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,933
He may have lost his way and committed
distasteful acts as he grew up,

199
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,769
but despite all that,

200
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,690
I never once desired

201
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,026
for him to meet his end like this.

202
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,445
Your Majesty.

203
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,533
Could a ghost truly be behind all this?

204
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,373
Your Majesty, that is simply preposterous.

205
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,167
What ghost?

206
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,631
Yes. I am aware.

207
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,177
It is preposterous beyond words.

208
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,065
Yeo-ri.

209
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,568
Here you go.

210
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,487
Unfortunately, we have
a long journey ahead of us and--

211
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,156
It is caragana.

212
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,825
It will be very handy one day.

213
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,577
Be sure to take care of it.

214
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,745
Here.

215
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,915
I will use this someday?

216
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,249
How in the world…

217
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,669
You must not be lazy with the watering.

218
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,130
Water it when the topsoil dries.

219
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,216
Also…

220
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,388
What? What do you want?

221
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,099
I just wanted to look at your face.

222
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:30,979
I hope you continue your dull existence
by your lonesome self unscathed,

223
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,440
for hundreds, thousands of years to come.

224
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,108
- What did you say?
- Go on now.

225
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,486
The sun sets early in the mountains,
you should get going.

226
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,737
Off you go.

227
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,127
It is His Excellency.
Lord Choi Won-u is here!

228
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,837
Your Excellency.

229
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,425
Your Excellency!

230
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,690
Your Excellency, it has been five years.

231
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,526
Thank you for making the long journey.

232
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,653
My, my.

233
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,572
Why have you all gathered
as if I were some great man?

234
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,658
You are much too humble.

235
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:29,204
Every scholar throughout the land
holds you in high esteem.

236
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,374
I am only here because the nation
has experienced a great loss.

237
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,835
I do not wish to cause a commotion.

238
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,045
Please go home now.

239
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,887
Let me know
when the crowd outside disperses.

240
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,973
There is someplace I need to go secretly.

241
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,891
Stop by somewhere before the funeral?

242
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,560
You must be severely fatigued.

243
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,285
The capital is just past there.

244
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,120
We should try the capital gates first.

245
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,165
We can look for another way in
if we run into trouble there.

246
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,432
The five desires and seven emotions arise

247
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,350
from the five sensory organs
of the human body.

248
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:36,688
If I never see her,
I will feel no emotion or desire.

249
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,316
What are you doing?

250
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,194
Has our stay at the temple
led you to chant?

251
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,034
I was wondering why such devious humans
commit such crimes.

252
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,411
I was reflecting as your patron deity.

253
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,538
Yes, I see.

254
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,083
So, what have you found out?

255
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,461
My stay in this human body
has given me insight.

256
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:03,423
The human body itself
being the source of sin is the issue.

257
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,092
Sight, taste, hearing, and touch.

258
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,177
All of them bring forth desire.

259
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,137
That is why so many sins are committed.

260
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,475
See, even now, this touch

261
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,727
makes me feel something--

262
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,197
Hey!

263
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,043
Stop!

264
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,545
Stop, I say!

265
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,130
Stop moving! Stop!

266
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,863
See. I told you to go easy on the <i>yakgwa.</i>

267
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,032
The <i>yakgwa</i> is not to blame.

268
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,661
How could anyone not get sick
in such a shaky palanquin?

269
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,540
With such terrible motion sickness,

270
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,375
you should have just stayed home.

271
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,044
Why did you insist
on following him to the capital?

272
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,382
It has been a while
since I have visited the capital.

273
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,595
What was that?

274
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,221
Do you think I do not know?

275
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,266
You are here to see Yoon Gap
or whatever his name is.

276
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,226
I already looked into him.

277
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,147
He was born a bastard
and only holds a minor government post.

278
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,983
He is a mere examiner or something.

279
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,403
It is not like
I wanted to marry him or anything.

280
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,115
I just wanted to see his face.

281
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,951
Seeing a handsome face
will not hurt anyone.

282
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,132
Get inside. Go.

283
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,681
Wait,

284
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,100
that is my palanquin…

285
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,274
He says, "Shush."

286
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,617
Excuse me.

287
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:39,621
What are you planning
to do in there exactly?

288
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,549
Can you give me some space?

289
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,135
You are choking me here.

290
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,790
Did you not see a man
and maiden pass through here?

291
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,301
Let him know I have seen no such thing.

292
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,552
Hear that?

293
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,220
She's not seen anyone like that.

294
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,707
Have you already forgotten

295
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,919
His Majesty's royal command
to never step foot in the capital?

296
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,046
You show up this soon after your exile?

297
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:56,758
Hence, we did not enter
the capital grounds.

298
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,760
What?

299
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,428
Right. He has a point.

300
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,140
There was not a single reason
for us to flee with such urgency.

301
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,228
He forbade us from entering the capital.

302
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,897
Why would you scold us
for being outside the capital?

303
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,440
Yes, why would you?

304
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:17,654
Then are you saying
you never planned to enter the capital?

305
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,990
Yes. Well… That is basically right.

306
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,868
Then, you two should follow me.

307
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,123
To where?
Are you trying to drag us far away again?

308
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,292
Are you?

309
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,003
Someone is urgently looking for you.

310
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,464
Pardon?

311
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,594
DO NOT ENTER

312
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,895
Can you tell us now?

313
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,732
What happened?

314
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,692
We were exiled.

315
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,361
Should we be stepping foot
into the palace like this?

316
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,114
Follow me.

317
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,127
Where are we…

318
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:24,262
Do not tell me
the prince who resided here passed away.

319
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,931
How did you know that?

320
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,353
I had a vision of him a while ago.

321
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,440
You are correct.

322
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,693
He was discovered here dead
three days ago.

323
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,824
But something is not right.

324
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,160
If it was an unnatural death,

325
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:50,705
the grudge of his soul
should linger at the site of his death.

326
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,083
But I do not sense anything.

327
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:51,933
A talisman.

328
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,025
There is something here.

329
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,645
You…

330
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,190
Were you the one
who did that to Prince Yeongin?

331
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,276
No, I am not the one.

332
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,777
It is not you?

333
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,195
Then, why did you run away?

334
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,115
I thought you would suspect me like this.

335
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,868
- What did you say?
- Yes.

336
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,703
I did indeed come here
because I abhorred the scoundrel

337
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,705
who trampled my flesh and blood.

338
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:58,416
However, I did not do it.

339
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,628
I did not forget my promise to you.

340
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,841
Get off me!

341
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,523
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost did this?

342
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,029
He showed up here?

343
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,824
Damn it.

344
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,327
No wonder it reeks.

345
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,245
Why are you two here?

346
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,752
What are exiles doing inside the palace?

347
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,589
Did you do this?

348
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,134
Did you dare to defy the king's command

349
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,345
and bring those two into the palace?

350
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,222
Yes, Your Majesty.

351
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,307
I did bring them here.

352
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,101
I know I have committed a deadly sin,

353
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:01,229
but I believed that was the right thing
to do for your sake.

354
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,397
What did you say?!

355
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,150
I am responsible.

356
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,490
Queen.

357
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:21,749
I asked the clerk officer
to bring those two back to the palace.

358
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,585
Hence, do not punish him

359
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,878
and punish me, instead.

360
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,047
Queen.

361
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,050
He is a military officer
under the king's command.

362
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,261
How could you defy the law

363
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,264
and issue him a personal command?

364
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,849
It is because…

365
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,894
I cannot lose him.

366
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:45,857
I cannot lose

367
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,443
neither the prince…

368
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,613
nor Your Majesty.

369
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,243
I cannot stand idly by

370
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,580
to witness another tragic death

371
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,750
like the one that befell Prince Yeongin!

372
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,885
Your Majesty can continue
to be a sage king who upholds the law.

373
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,511
I shall…

374
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,307
become an immoral woman
who partakes in heretical ceremonies.

375
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,186
If this becomes a blemish
on your flawless reign,

376
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,146
you only need to banish me.

377
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,608
Even with such risks…

378
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,529
I must protect the two of you.

379
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,659
Thus, Your Majesty…

380
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,582
Please…

381
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,455
Stop it! Stop!

382
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:29,252
Listen! By chance,
did His Lordship send you?

383
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,672
My goodness. Please let me see him.

384
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,299
I will explain everything to him!

385
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,510
Please let me see him.

386
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,929
My lordship.

387
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,055
My lordship…

388
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,849
My lordship?

389
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,603
My lordship…

390
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,688
My lordship.

391
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:50,940
Oh, my lordship.

392
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,817
My lordship, please…

393
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,319
I was not behind
what happened to Prince Yeongin.

394
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,655
The Warrior Deity desired it,

395
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,907
so I had no other choice.

396
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,075
My lordship--

397
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,368
My lordship!

398
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,997
My lordship, you have heard
how Prince Yeongin died, have you not?

399
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,332
Going forward, the Warrior Deity

400
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,668
will stop all this possession nonsense

401
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:14,088
and just end his life, clean and simple.

402
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,633
Then, your lordship can reap
the benefits without lifting a finger.

403
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,719
So please, your lordship.

404
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,763
Please just give me one more chance.
Please. Your lordship!

405
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,475
Your lordship?

406
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,477
Your lordship!

407
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,148
Oh! My goodness!

408
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,277
He grants you one month.

409
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,821
If the prince does not die by then,

410
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,365
you shall be torn, limb from limb.

411
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,659
Yes.

412
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:45,912
I understand.

413
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,164
Yes, my lordship.

414
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,752
She discovered this

415
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,962
at His Highness's quarters.

416
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:09,060
This was written
with the ashes from a brazier.

417
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,394
Yes, Your Majesty.

418
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,396
Last time at Mount Bugak,

419
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,024
the sacred cord burned into charcoal

420
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:18,569
and the evil stench
also had a smoky quality…

421
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,365
I believe the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
is an ember ghost.

422
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,952
"Ember ghost"? As in the ghost of fire?

423
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

424
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,247
It moves through fire

425
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,499
and I witnessed it burn itself with fire.

426
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,377
The eight-foot-tall Ghost seems to be
a spirit that burned to death.

427
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:42,468
By chance, do you suspect anyone
who would hold such a grudge

428
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,929
against the royal bloodline?

429
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:54,063
I must know what sort of ghost it is
and the grudge it possesses

430
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,440
to properly guide it to the afterlife.

431
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,360
I do not know.

432
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,030
I cannot even fathom
a suspicion at this moment.

433
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:15,918
Ow!

434
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,796
Hold it!

435
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,173
It is not hot at all.

436
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,258
Lift it up.

437
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:25,428
I cannot touch it because the ember ghost
and I are clashing elements.

438
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,520
Like this?

439
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:39,608
The handwriting is crude,
but the spiritual energy is formidable.

440
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,073
That damn Eight-foot-tall Ghost…

441
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,118
It has yet to fully recover.

442
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:52,663
It appears it has not been the same
since I stabbed him last time.

443
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,291
How can you tell all that
from a single talisman?

444
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,251
How frustrating you are.

445
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,419
Think about it.

446
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,547
He devours members
of the royal bloodlines to grow his power.

447
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,257
He requires an offering,

448
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,384
but is not strong enough
to make it happen.

449
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,512
Hence, he utilizes
this lock-opening talisman

450
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,931
to devour that rascal prince in one slurp.

451
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,395
Someone…

452
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,315
must have offered the prince up to him.

453
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,151
To the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

454
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,986
Do you mean to say

455
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,198
someone inside the palace is assisting it?

456
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,158
Finally, you are beginning to understand.

457
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:33,788
Who… would partake in such a heinous act?

458
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,083
That is not the only issue.

459
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,752
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
had possessed the young prince

460
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,004
and slowly drove him insane.

461
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,049
Up until now, he enjoyed the pain
its drawn-out torment inflicted.

462
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,385
However, it was different this time.

463
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,387
It killed without hesitation.

464
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,432
To heal the internal injury
we inflicted on Mount Bugak?

465
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,684
Yes, that is correct.

466
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:59,021
And it will continue to do so.

467
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,817
If you cannot stop it,
you will die instantly.

468
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,610
You…

469
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,904
and your son.

470
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,431
This is a nation built
on Confucian principles

471
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,058
and I am its king.

472
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,268
Thus,

473
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,397
I cannot approve of heretical ceremonies.

474
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:47,153
However, it appears there was
human intervention involved here.

475
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,489
As the king,

476
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,534
I say this now

477
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,871
despite all the beliefs and convictions
I have upheld until now.

478
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,166
Do you truly believe
you can stop that evil spirit?

479
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,836
I cannot guarantee anything.

480
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:05,880
However,

481
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,507
I must also stop
this Eight-foot-tall Ghost

482
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,010
in order to save someone.

483
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,937
Yoon Gap shall be reinstated
as an examiner

484
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:26,650
and stay close to my side
to carry out my secret orders.

485
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,278
Furthermore, Yeo-ri shall be stationed

486
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,697
at the Royal Couturier
as the royal eyeglass artisan

487
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,492
and make eyeglasses under my command.

488
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,585
Your Grace.

489
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,630
You must be
in an unbelievable state of grief.

490
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,965
When I heard the news…

491
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,220
I, too, found myself
overwhelmed with sorrow

492
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,139
as the earth disappeared beneath my feet.

493
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,225
Do you know…

494
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,688
what provides me
with the greatest anguish right now?

495
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,610
I gave birth to him…

496
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,823
but I did not show him any love.

497
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:15,991
No.

498
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,995
I actually showed him scorn.

499
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,956
Your Grace.

500
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,416
I never once embraced him.

501
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,960
I never once…

502
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,547
said his name with any affection.

503
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,841
That…

504
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,635
That…

505
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,429
pains me so much.

506
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:15,884
My lord.

507
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:19,471
I just saw Yoon Gap inside the palace.

508
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,141
What are you talking about?

509
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,852
You said he was exiled
from the capital recently.

510
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,272
It appears His Majesty
summoned him once more.

511
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:31,567
I saw him step out
of the royal library just now.

512
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,987
<i>That damn scoundrel…</i>

513
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,449
I do…

514
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,077
not remember anything.

515
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,912
<i>He claimed ignorance,</i>

516
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,332
<i>but the look in his eyes</i>
<i>told a different story.</i>

517
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,002
<i>Why did the king summon him again?</i>

518
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,922
Get rid of that this instant!

519
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,007
It is good for you.

520
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,676
My goodness.

521
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,805
Gap, drink up. My goodness! Gap.

522
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,307
- Oh, gosh.
- Do not come any closer.

523
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,476
I clearly told you I did not want it.

524
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,103
Do you know how much this cost?
How could you refuse this?

525
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,064
I had to ask around
to find a skilled physician

526
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,442
and I even had to travel
across the mountain pass to procure it.

527
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:16,362
You said it was made with cow brain,
snake tail, and dried centipede.

528
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,238
How do you expect me to drink that?

529
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,699
I can tell I will not like it
from the smell. You drink it.

530
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,619
It's long been proven
bitter medicine is good for the body.

531
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:27,498
He said you'd regain your sanity
if you'd just drink this.

532
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,874
My goodness…

533
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,754
Were you not kicked out of the palace
because of that amnesia-insanity business?

534
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,799
I cannot bear to feel
the way I did ever again.

535
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:37,925
Now drink up.

536
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,136
You spoiled brat…

537
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,851
Yeo-ri.

538
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,520
- Yes?
- Grab him.

539
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,149
- Yes, ma'am.
- How dare you!

540
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,151
Do not take another step.

541
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,029
Even you will not be exempt
from my whirlwinds--

542
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,574
Goodness, there you go again
about those darn whirlwinds.

543
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,659
You are hilarious.

544
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,911
How dare you speak
that way to your patron deity?

545
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,663
Goodness gracious.

546
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,124
Now, he is even talking
some nonsense about patron deities.

547
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,959
Yeo-ri, he needs to drink this now.

548
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,419
- Yes, ma'am.
- Forget it!

549
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,393
Down it goes.

550
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,522
Goodness. I cannot believe you.

551
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,525
What a waste! What are we going to do?

552
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:40,612
Yeo-ri, I am going to heat up
another batch. Hold on to him.

553
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,738
Yes, ma'am.

554
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,702
I cannot live here anymore.

555
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,996
I must move out.

556
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,458
What happened to enjoying
her decent cooking skills?

557
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,336
You could have just held
your breath and drank it.

558
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,921
Did you need to throw such a fit?

559
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,048
There is snake tail in there.

560
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,634
The snake is like a cousin to an Imugi.

561
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,052
How could I consume such a thing?

562
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:05,804
What can we do?

563
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:09,099
It seems she spent the little money
she had to procure it.

564
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:10,684
Let me see.

565
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:30,913
What now?

566
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,916
Starting now, you better stay
at least ten steps away from me.

567
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,214
What was that about?

568
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,090
That hurt…

569
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,390
What is wrong with me?

570
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,768
Whenever I am around her,

571
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,394
I feel something surging deep inside.

572
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:58,273
Maybe I want to devour her whole?

573
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,367
What in the world is wrong with me?

574
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:11,912
Seriously.

575
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,872
He acted like I had the plague.

576
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,124
Earlier, he acted like…

577
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,556
My goodness. No.

578
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,558
I was merely confused.

579
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,101
I mistook him for Lord Yoon Gap.

580
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,435
Right. That is what happened.

581
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,312
Exactly what happened.

582
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,726
How long do you plan to stay here?

583
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,687
Am I not allowed to be here?

584
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,606
But the king gave me permission.

585
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,524
That is not what I am asking.

586
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,780
As long as you are here,

587
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:33,368
that troublemaker examiner
will continue to hover nearby.

588
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,621
Do not mind him.

589
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,457
He lies there
because he is comfortable there.

590
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,045
How could I not mind him?

591
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:47,966
Here he comes.

592
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:07,069
How are you always lying down
or leaning on something?

593
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,196
What if his body really ends up
with bedsores?

594
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:13,241
It is because I used to live freely
without a physical body,

595
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:16,286
but now I am stuck
in this clunky human body.

596
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,873
Do you even know
how heavy this human body is?

597
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,177
Are you making a talismanic iron net?

598
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,388
You think you could trap that Eight--

599
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,320
Your Grace.

600
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,447
I have heard

601
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,158
that you have not eaten anything in days.

602
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,577
It is milk porridge.

603
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,496
Please try having a bite.

604
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,040
Milk porridge?

605
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,046
Is there a mother in this world

606
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,341
who could eat that

607
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,469
after burying her child?

608
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,723
His Majesty personally requested
for them to make it for you.

609
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,475
Please try to have a bite

610
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,728
for the sake of his sincerity.

611
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,940
I told you I do not want it!

612
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,368
Forgive me…

613
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,334
My stomach is a bit upset.

614
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,671
Please excuse me.

615
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,024
Your Grace, are you all right?

616
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,401
It seems…

617
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,863
the queen was not all right.

618
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,240
No.

619
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,993
Her face was sickly pale.

620
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,454
It seems she is suffering from an ailment.

621
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,290
The queen always had a weak constitution.

622
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:29,085
She was like that when she was
pregnant with the prince.

623
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,630
Her morning sickness was needlessly severe

624
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:34,966
and she had to be bedridden
because of her history of miscarriages.

625
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:38,804
Your Grace.

626
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,097
Could she be…

627
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,683
It seems the queen is experiencing
some bodily changes.

628
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,186
Look into it.

629
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,490
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
will come to harm the prince

630
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,659
on the upcoming day of the Fire Horse?

631
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,414
How can you be so sure?

632
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,208
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
is an ember ghost.

633
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:12,128
It will move on the day
when the energy of fire is strong.

634
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,506
He also attacked Prince Yeongin

635
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,049
when fire energy was strong,

636
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:17,926
the night of the Fire Rooster.

637
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,721
I have prepared

638
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,224
a means of defense to stop it
for His Highness's palace,

639
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,476
but if we fail to capture it,

640
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,687
the core issue will not be resolved.

641
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,022
How can I…

642
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,026
help you?

643
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,237
Please let all of the palace know

644
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,575
the prince will be in the royal library
until late into the night.

645
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,535
It will be easier to catch it

646
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:46,288
with a talismanic iron net
at the library than his chambers.

647
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:50,584
I shall lure
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost there.

648
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:19,195
Perhaps, we should consider
seeking out a more experienced shaman.

649
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,616
One with a proper patron deity,
not a greenhorn like you.

650
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:24,618
We cannot do that.

651
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:28,246
The shaman will only focus
on expelling the ghost.

652
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,748
Doing so

653
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,667
may lead His Lord's soul
to the afterlife as well.

654
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,796
I might lose my chance
to save him forever.

655
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:42,761
I am sure the king would be thrilled
to know how dark your heart is.

656
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:49,935
Take it.

657
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:59,736
Grandma told me that the crescent blade
possessed divine powers.

658
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,072
It may not look like much,

659
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,658
but she used it to guide
countless spirits to the afterlife.

660
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:20,590
I have heard

661
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,093
that the luminous pearl inside an Imugi,

662
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,345
though not as powerful
as a dragon's enchanted pearl,

663
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,138
possesses immense power.

664
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:30,225
I saw it with my own two eyes
at Mount Bugak.

665
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,935
Even that mighty Eight-foot-tall Ghost

666
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,730
became powerless in the presence
of this luminous pearl.

667
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:39,401
I will hold it captive
with this talismanic iron net.

668
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:42,028
Then, you can use
the power of the luminous pearl

669
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,781
to stab it with that crescent blade.

670
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,431
BONFIRE

671
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:54,976
I hear the prince always spends his nights
in the royal library.

672
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,688
Place it there discreetly.

673
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,233
The prince shall be…

674
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,154
offered to the Warrior Deity tonight.

675
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,771
<i>If someone suspicious</i>
<i>approaches the library tonight,</i>

676
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,481
<i>just watch them from afar.</i>

677
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,316
You must capture them

678
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,735
when they leave the library grounds.

679
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,967
BONFIRE

680
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,237
It is the hour of the rat
that you specified.

681
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,822
HOUR OF THE RAT: 11 PM TO 1 AM

682
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:13,907
Yes, Your Majesty.

683
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,535
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
should appear soon.

684
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,038
Should an issue arise,

685
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:22,290
you just need to do what I said earlier.

686
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,016
Pick me up.

687
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:41,809
What?

688
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,686
There is no eunuch here.

689
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,605
And I cannot ask Father to pick me up.

690
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,607
Why would I pick you up?

691
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,817
As if standing guard
for your sake was not enough,

692
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,945
now you want me to be your parent?

693
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,033
Your Highness, let me.

694
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,036
Come here.

695
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,002
Your Highness.

696
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,420
Do you see that over there?

697
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,089
If the Eight-foot-tall Ghost appears,

698
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:14,509
it will mistake your undershirt
by that jade water bowl for you

699
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,135
and head over there.

700
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,555
I will, then, capture him

701
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,348
with that big net up there.

702
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,475
There is nothing to be afraid of.

703
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:27,647
I did not ask because I was scared.
Do you think I am a baby?

704
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,773
Unbelievable.

705
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,150
Of course. Forgive me.

706
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,402
I mean it.

707
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,904
That ghost…

708
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,447
I know him well.

709
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:39,325
That ghost is not scary.

710
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,327
He is sad.

711
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,498
He is sad?

712
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,375
Yes.

713
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,252
I do not know why,

714
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,337
but he was sad.

715
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,674
Very sad.

716
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,803
Sad… How?

717
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:19,741
It is here.

718
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,150
Has the ghost come?

719
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,389
Gangcheori, now.

720
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,142
Do it!

721
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:12,538
Gangcheori!

722
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:17,335
Damn it…

723
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:19,378
<i>As you say,</i>

724
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,048
you may briefly be able to fend it off
with the luminous pearl,

725
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,591
<i>but that has its limits.</i>

726
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:33,059
The luminous pearl in your belly
must be fully drained

727
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,020
for that mighty Eight-foot-tall Ghost
to be guided…

728
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,104
Shut up.

729
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,191
Damn quack monk.

730
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:44,403
<i>Is Gangcheori's luminous pearl not enough?</i>

731
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,160
No.

732
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,829
The talismanic iron net is being torn.

733
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:29,115
Did you find out who that sorcerer is?

734
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:31,826
Are you all right?

735
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:33,911
That brat must be the one. She must be.

736
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:38,332
- Who are you even looking for?
- My younger brother.

737
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,751
<i>He is an Imugi.</i>
<i>There really was another one.</i>

738
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:41,836
Is that you, Gangcheori?

739
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:44,839
<i>That girl, Yeo-ri.</i>
<i>I think I might want to devour her…</i>

740
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:48,134
<i>See if you feel the same thing</i>
<i>about any other human.</i>

741
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:51,387
<i>What are you going to do</i>
<i>with that cursed thing?</i>

742
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,347
<i>The queen has been sowed</i>
<i>with the king's seed.</i>

743
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,641
<i>The Warrior Deity will have fresh prey.</i>

744
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,185
What about the queen?
Is the queen all right?

745
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:02,648
