1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,420
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,400
Stay back.

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,570
Stop him!
Keep His Majesty safe!

5
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,260
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty…

6
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,510
Queen…

7
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,600
Queen.

8
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,980
My Queen!

9
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,570
Apprehend him!

10
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,820
You cannot, Your Highness.

11
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,990
Mother!

12
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,120
Please, Your Highness…
Mother!

13
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,490
Hear me! Summon a royal physician!

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,370
Summon a royal physician immediately!

15
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,510
The Warrior Deity…

16
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,520
has finally devoured

17
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,560
the unborn baby of the Queen!

18
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,200
I just do not understand
what is going on here.

19
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,880
I am able to touch them without trouble.

20
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,470
Both stones. The King's and the Prince's.

21
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,020
It is faint, but it smells of alcohol.

22
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,270
Someone poured alcohol
on the Ghostbane Stones.

23
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,320
Thus, the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
was able to attack the Queen

24
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,530
despite the fact that
she was holding the Ghostbane Stone.

25
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,030
No, that is not possible.

26
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,330
They were both very strict
about who they allowed to come near.

27
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,990
Your most trusted could be behind it.

28
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,290
Wait, hold on.

29
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Hand it over.

30
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,290
Was it you?

31
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,210
The Prince's Eunuch Lee
already confessed as well.

32
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,300
Were you really behind this?

33
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,630
Head Eunuch, please spare me.

34
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,590
Please forgive me.

35
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,640
He held my family captive
and threatened me. I had no other choice--

36
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,100
I cannot believe you.

37
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,640
You fool!

38
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,770
I took you under my wing
and raised you to be a eunuch…

39
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,490
It appears I have been raising
a wild beast.

40
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,740
I committed a heinous act of treachery
to His Majesty because of you.

41
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,790
You have tainted the honor of all eunuchs.

42
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,160
Take him away.

43
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,170
My lord. Please.

44
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,340
Head Eunuch! Please forgive me!

45
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,050
Your Majesty.

46
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,310
My shortcomings are deserving of death.

47
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,270
What does that mean?

48
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,440
Tell me you can heal her.

49
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,900
Tell me you can heal her right now!

50
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,860
I will not ask you to even save
the baby in her womb.

51
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,650
So, just save…

52
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,950
Just save the Queen, at least!

53
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,200
She has already lost
too much blood, Your Majesty.

54
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,290
This cannot be.

55
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,790
I refuse to accept this.

56
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,210
Tell me what I must do.

57
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,670
Tell me…

58
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,380
What must I do?

59
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,090
Please save her…

60
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,220
Your Majesty.

61
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,640
My Queen.

62
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,900
Mother.

63
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,980
Your Majesty.

64
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,650
I am…

65
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,830
beyond saving now.

66
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,620
No.

67
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,080
Do not say that.

68
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,790
Please do not say such things.

69
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,300
You cannot leave me.

70
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,050
You cannot leave me like this, my Queen.

71
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,430
Please…

72
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,720
Please forgive me…

73
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,640
for departing first.

74
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,650
Our…

75
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,860
Our Gwang…

76
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,950
Please…

77
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,880
Mother…

78
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Mother!

79
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,680
Mother!
Your Highness…

80
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,010
Mother!

81
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,060
Mother!

82
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,140
Mother…

83
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,810
Mother!

84
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,070
Mother…

85
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,160
Mother!

86
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,370
Mother…

87
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,620
My Queen.

88
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,210
It is my fault.

89
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,790
I should have checked
before the passage rite.

90
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,880
I was a fool.

91
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,760
It is not your fault.

92
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,880
We never stood a chance
against the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

93
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,430
He upended a passage rite
that was prepared with the utmost care.

94
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,850
A maniacal, wicked spirit.

95
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,310
Her Highness.

96
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,030
Her Highness has ascended
with royal grace!

97
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,070
Her Highness has ascended
with royal grace!

98
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,740
May Avalokitesvara show us mercy.

99
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,000
Her Highness has ascended
with royal grace!

100
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,540
Her Highness has ascended
with royal grace!

101
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,340
Her Highness has ascended
with royal grace!

102
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,360
Your Highness.

103
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,320
Her Highness…

104
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,870
Your Highness.
Your Highness…

105
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,450
Your Highness…

106
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,260
You scoundrel.

107
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,010
You…

108
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,270
You said if I just poured
alcohol on those things,

109
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,190
I would become the Chief State Councillor.

110
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,480
But look at this mess.

111
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,320
My steward suddenly went insane

112
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,610
and wielded his sword against the Queen.

113
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,650
Are you trying to get me killed as well?

114
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,450
How did you even know about this place?

115
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,240
I would be left in shambles
if you suddenly disappeared.

116
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,040
I had you followed
after our previous meeting

117
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,910
to uncover your hideout.

118
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,340
You have wasted your time.

119
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,800
You only hastened your demise.

120
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,800
What?
Are you sure

121
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,090
no one followed you all the way here?

122
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,180
Apprehend all of them!
Yes, sir.

123
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,480
Wait. I am innocent.

124
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,600
It was not me. I am innocent.
I did not do anything.

125
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,610
Is this the only way now?

126
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,280
But that means…

127
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,450
I could end up dying.

128
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,300
Hey! Everyone!

129
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,810
My goodness. Did you all hear the news?

130
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:57,020
They caught the scoundrels
who did that to the Queen!

131
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,270
I hear the interrogation hall is
in a frenzy right now.

132
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,780
My goodness.

133
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,190
Those rotten scoundrels.

134
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,080
I do not know anything.

135
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,040
I was only deceived by this man.

136
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,670
Please spare me, Your Majesty.

137
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,010
As soon as day breaks tomorrow,

138
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,140
behead them all.

139
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,180
Do I make myself clear?

140
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

141
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,810
Your Majesty…

142
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,560
You are no better than a beast!

143
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,690
Did you never fear
the judgment of the gods?

144
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,650
Judgment?

145
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,150
Give me a damn break.

146
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,610
I was struck by that damn divine judgment
the moment I was born.

147
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,030
Lowborn by birth

148
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,740
and cursed by blindness.

149
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,080
If all those years of being treated
less than a maggot

150
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,040
were not divine punishment,

151
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,040
then what is?

152
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,590
That would not even come close.

153
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,750
I promise you this.

154
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,510
You will end up suffering
the most excruciatingly painful death.

155
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,300
You should not be so cocky.

156
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,220
You are not even a threat
to the Warrior Deity now.

157
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,520
After all, he possesses
a luminous pearl, just like you.

158
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,770
You…

159
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,230
and that brat you care so much about

160
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,230
will soon be done for.

161
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
I should kill you!

162
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,900
That is enough.

163
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,780
Even His Majesty held back
from slaying him.

164
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,860
Gangcheori.

165
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,140
Stop right there!

166
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,440
My goodness. Look who it is.

167
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,570
Why, it is Her charming Grace,
the Queen Dowager.

168
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,290
You dared to trick me
into offering up my son as a sacrifice?

169
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,920
You committed that vile act
against the ever-gentle Queen

170
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,790
and used me

171
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
to defy the King?

172
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,970
Why did it have to be me?

173
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,300
Why did you target me?

174
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,390
That was because you, wench,

175
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,640
looked like the most terrified,
cornered rat.

176
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
What did you say?

177
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,110
Toying around with a terrified wench
in the palm of your hand

178
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,610
requires no effort at all.

179
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,820
Why, you scoundrel!

180
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,780
Your Grace. He is to be beheaded shortly.

181
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,240
Please try to remain calm.

182
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
Let us go.

183
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,350
Your Majesty.

184
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,400
These objects were delivered
by Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri.

185
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,770
A talisman that wards off ghosts

186
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,530
and eastern peach branches.

187
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,700
Your Majesty.

188
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,580
You cannot continue to refuse your meals

189
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,620
and reside in the royal library all day.

190
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Your Majesty.

191
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,420
I am the one who deserves death.

192
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,170
So please,

193
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,800
look after your sacred body.

194
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,970
Please look after your sacred body.

195
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,730
Your Majesty…

196
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,680
I will get you some more.

197
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,610
But she never drinks tea.

198
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,870
Why?

199
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,460
Does it look strange?

200
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,920
A pearl necklace on a pig's neck…

201
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,260
is what I was afraid of…

202
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,890
but it suits you quite well.

203
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,690
Do not be too disheartened…

204
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,110
because I am keeping my distance.

205
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,650
It is just that…

206
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,540
if I embrace you as I would my own child…

207
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,750
I would feel so sorry for my poor Gap.

208
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,960
I am aware.

209
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,760
Do not burden your heart.

210
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,760
Mortals are lowly creatures

211
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,970
and they sometimes behave revoltingly,

212
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,890
but they can also be charming at times.

213
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,230
I am certain…

214
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,190
that was thanks to mothers like you

215
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,770
who so tenderly looked
after their children.

216
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,120
Is Yeo-ri making a fresh batch of rice?

217
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,510
This is indeed caragana.

218
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,220
Did the plant I gave you flower?

219
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,770
Well… the plant is currently
with someone else.

220
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,810
However, I did see the buds
before they bloomed for myself.

221
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,520
Is that true?

222
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,190
Did that caragana actually bloom?

223
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,400
May I ask why you respond so?

224
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,410
What is so special about that caragana?

225
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,910
Well, the thing is…

226
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,130
Examiner Yoon Gap.

227
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,830
They say if the caragana blossom
is consumed,

228
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,130
one will be able to hold out

229
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,460
until the luminous pearl
is completely drained

230
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,340
while confronting
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

231
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,390
Does Gangcheori know about this?

232
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,150
Gangcheori…

233
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,940
what exactly are you planning to do?

234
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:57,930
Your Majesty.

235
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,160
Hear me.

236
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,370
Is anyone there?

237
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,620
Hear me!

238
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,510
You…

239
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,890
You must be the scoundrel.

240
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,100
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

241
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,090
You should have just killed me instead.

242
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,680
Why would you kill her?

243
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,010
I attempted to ask for your forgiveness.

244
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,310
With my sincerest intention,

245
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,980
I sought to atone.

246
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,310
Then, why…

247
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,480
Why would you kill
someone completely innocent?

248
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,320
She was beautiful and ever so gentle.

249
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,080
I understand your grudge runs deep,

250
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,080
but where does it end?

251
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,300
Tell me where it ends!

252
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,090
Why must I suffer so

253
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,890
because of the sins
of my ancestor long past?

254
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,600
His sins are not mine.

255
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,890
Do you say they are not your sins?

256
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,490
You do not know anything.

257
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,450
You do not know how I died.

258
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,200
How my family,

259
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,410
my kin,

260
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,750
and my neighbors

261
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,790
all met their demise.

262
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,010
You know not

263
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:40,130
of the vow I made with my last breath.

264
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,260
What could you possibly know?

265
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,180
You spent your life in these gilded halls,

266
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,810
draped in silks
and veiled behind the palace walls.

267
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,440
You do not know anything!

268
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,780
Seon-u…

269
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,050
Run. Hurry.

270
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,970
Cheers to Commandant Cheon
of Yongdam Village!

271
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,310
Cheers!
Cheers!

272
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,690
With the military exam behind him,
we should call him the deity of warriors!

273
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,480
The Warrior Deity!

274
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,900
Yes, of course.
He is the Warrior Deity, indeed!

275
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,740
Cheers to the Warrior Deity
of Yongdam Village!

276
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,870
Cheers to the Warrior Deity
of Yongdam Village!

277
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,660
Cheers to the Warrior Deity
of Yongdam Village!

278
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,370
Cheers to the Warrior Deity
of Yongdam Village!

279
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,540
Cheers to Yongdam Village!

280
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,840
Cheers to Yongdam Village!

281
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,670
It is my fault.

282
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,630
It is all my fault.

283
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,390
Everyone died because of me.

284
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,100
I will never forgive you.

285
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,150
I shall make you pay, even in death.

286
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,280
King…

287
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,860
I shall…

288
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,530
slaughter every member of your bloodline.

289
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,950
I shall never forgive you.

290
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,870
For all eternity!

291
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,400
Did you say these are not your sin,

292
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,860
but those of your ancestor?

293
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,610
This royal dragon robe you wear

294
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,330
was woven with the bloody sacrifices

295
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:06,000
of the villagers of Yongdam,
my family, and me!

296
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,790
The very throne your ancestor secured
through sacrificing our lives…

297
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,130
is where you sit, is it not?

298
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,510
However, I am sure you remained oblivious,

299
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,850
satisfied about what a sage king you are.

300
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,560
You must have prided yourself
on being a benevolent king

301
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,060
who embraced all his people.

302
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,190
Your very existence is a sin.

303
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,950
That blood only flows through your body

304
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,330
because it was saved

305
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,580
with our wretched, fiery deaths.

306
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
And yet, you shamelessly proclaim

307
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,630
that you are utterly without blame?

308
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,900
My grudge shall not be extinguished

309
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,610
until every last drop
of blood from your lineage…

310
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,910
has been eradicated from this land.

311
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,330
No…

312
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,370
You cannot…

313
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,710
Please…

314
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:43,050
I will let a part of you remain conscious,

315
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,720
so prepare your eyes
to fully bear witness…

316
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,890
what happens to your son,

317
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,560
that insufferable Imugi scoundrel
who always got in my way,

318
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,860
and even that wench, Yeo-ri.

319
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,070
You shall witness
how they all meet their demise,

320
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,410
just as I had met mine.

321
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,790
You cannot. No!

322
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,130
I was wrong.

323
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,470
I was wrong!

324
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,470
Please.

325
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,600
Please!

326
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,690
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

327
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,780
My goodness.

328
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,400
After all, he possesses

329
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,320
a luminous pearl, just like you.

330
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,570
You…

331
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,240
and that brat you care so much about

332
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,700
will soon be done for.

333
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,180
Oh, you scared me.

334
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,520
Sulking in utter desolation

335
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,230
is only making that ugly face uglier.

336
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,310
What?

337
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,270
Follow me.

338
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,490
What? To where?

339
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,410
I was sure it was around here somewhere.

340
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,000
What are you looking for?

341
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,380
There it is.

342
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,750
Welcome.

343
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,430
We will take this.
Sure. That will be three jeon.

344
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,890
Three jeon…

345
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,350
Come here.

346
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,800
Finally, somewhat acceptable.

347
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,970
What is?
You finally look somewhat acceptable,

348
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,590
after covering up some of that ugly face.

349
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,260
What? I'm taking it off.
No.

350
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,010
Your sacred patron deity
just bestowed this upon you. How dare you?

351
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,270
Make sure to wear it every day.

352
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,560
Maybe you will tremble
a little less with that on.

353
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,310
You always speak like that.

354
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,070
Just say you wanted to buy it for me.

355
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,690
Was calling me ugly necessary?

356
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,190
Well… I guess it is warm.

357
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,660
Wait, but you cannot squander
your salary again like last time.

358
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,410
Bring every last bit to your mother.

359
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,870
After I graciously used
my pumpkin taffy money to buy it,

360
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,500
must you nag like that?

361
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,340
But maybe…
I might like that one a bit more.

362
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,550
Which one?

363
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,130
This one? Or this one?

364
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,140
No. On a second look,
I think this one is the prettiest.

365
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,350
And you did choose this one for me…

366
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,980
You are still the fairest mortal
I have ever known.

367
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,490
Hence,

368
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,820
it breaks my heart.

369
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,870
Where are you taking me?

370
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,260
It is almost the first full moon
of the lunar new year.

371
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,180
It looks like people added wish papers
to be burned with the moon hut.

372
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,050
You could not care less about it
in Yongdam. What has gotten into you?

373
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,560
It was not that I did not care.

374
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,720
I just stayed away
because they were nasty and petty.

375
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,230
They used to shoot dirty looks
if I ever approached them,

376
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,690
worried I would end up
jinxing their holy wishes.

377
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,400
Seeing how angry you are now,

378
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,490
you must have had a wish
you wanted to write down.

379
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,660
I did.

380
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:00,200
I was so sick and tired of being alone.

381
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,370
I wanted to wish for someone
to share meals and tender warmth with.

382
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,790
I wished for it with all my heart.

383
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,080
That was it.

384
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,890
Are you trying to keep it a secret?

385
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,060
You will jinx me. Go over there.

386
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,400
Traditionally, they burned
moon huts with wishes

387
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,900
as a way of wishing on the Big Dipper.

388
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,940
However,

389
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,280
despite having
your patron deity right here,

390
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,330
you wish to pray
to some stars far, far away?

391
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,490
Who knows if it will ever be granted?

392
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,910
It might be granted if I wish hard enough.

393
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,960
The Big Dipper up there might.

394
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,340
So, what did you write down?
You will only jinx it.

395
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,710
Unbelievable.

396
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:57,170
Wait, what is that over there?

397
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,510
What?

398
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,220
What are you talking about?

399
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,640
No. All the way over there.

400
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,220
That?
Yes.

401
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,400
I heard…

402
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,900
Pung-san was scheduled
to be beheaded today.

403
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,880
Proceed with the execution!

404
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,660
He smiles?

405
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,080
Stop!

406
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,080
His Majesty commands
you to stop this execution at once!

407
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,380
Your Majesty,

408
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,930
did you just give a command to…

409
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,760
Your Majesty.

410
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,100
Why are you stopping their execution?

411
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,440
Those two, An Seok-ju and Pung-san,

412
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,190
assassinated Her Highness, the Queen.

413
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,650
They did not kill the Queen.

414
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,440
The ones who led me to perform
that heinous, heretical ceremony,

415
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,150
Examiner Yoon Gap

416
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,950
and Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri,

417
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,990
killed the Queen.

418
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,410
That is not true, Your Majesty.

419
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:51,290
They were merely trying
to aid Your Majesty.

420
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:56,460
Were you also an accomplice
in the assassination of the Queen?

421
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,510
Most certainly not, Your Majesty.

422
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,340
How could I ever dare--

423
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,470
Carry out my royal command properly!

424
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:08,180
Stop the execution of Noble Elder Pung-san
and the others immediately.

425
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:10,850
Apprehend Examiner Yoon Gap

426
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,940
and Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri,

427
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,770
and behead them immediately!

428
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,360
This is a royal command.

429
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,490
Apprehend Examiner Yoon Gap
and Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri.

430
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,070
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

431
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,330
Who is Yeo-ri?

432
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,830
What's going on?
My goodness!

433
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,170
Yeo-ri.

434
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,810
They could not have gone far.

435
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,900
Find them.

436
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,360
I already searched over here.
Search that way.

437
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,620
Yes, sir. Let's go!

438
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,050
My lord, what is going on?

439
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:24,670
Why is His Majesty coming after us?

440
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,380
His Majesty has changed.

441
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,930
He was definitely lost
in melancholy just before,

442
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,760
but he suddenly experienced
a surge of energy and gave the order.

443
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,100
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
has possessed him.

444
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,350
With the Ghostbane Stones gone,

445
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,440
there is no reason
for him to bide his time.

446
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,320
Come to think of it,
I detected on His Majesty

447
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,030
the stench that once came
from the Prince's quarters.

448
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:50,620
His Highness is in danger.

449
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,580
If His Majesty is possessed,

450
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,500
the Prince will be his first target.

451
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,080
However,

452
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:01,000
I cannot just openly defy His Majesty's
royal command to save His Highness.

453
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,340
That is Your Majesty in appearance only.

454
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,300
What will happen
when he is no longer possessed

455
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,630
and he finds out he killed his son
with his own two hands?

456
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,300
Considering his lofty character,
he is bound to give in to insanity.

457
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,890
We will be at Choi Won-u's residence.

458
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,480
Bring the baby Prince there.

459
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,900
What did you just say?

460
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,610
He stopped Pung-san's execution?

461
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,950
And he also commanded
for Examiner Yoon Gap

462
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,540
and Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri
to be apprehended?

463
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,990
Yes, Your Grace.

464
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:40,000
I heard Pung-san was
summoned to the palace.

465
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,420
How could the King give out
such an absurd command

466
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,460
if he has not gone mad?

467
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,440
Your mourning robe…

468
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,400
Your Majesty.

469
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:11,360
Have you already forgotten
what kind of creature he is?

470
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,950
He used a wicked spirit

471
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:17,950
to kill the Queen
and my son, Prince Yeongin!

472
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,630
Yet, you stopped his execution
and even summoned him to the palace?

473
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:28,670
Answer me, Your Majesty!

474
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,680
It has not even been a few days
since the passing of the Queen.

475
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,180
How could you change out
of your mourning robe already?

476
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,230
Did you forget
what the Queen meant to you?

477
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,020
You are much too noisy.

478
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,150
Shall I behead you as well?

479
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,280
What did you say?

480
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,610
What did you just…

481
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,380
You…

482
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,150
What could you possibly do
as you shake like a leaf?

483
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,690
I have no intention
of killing you as well.

484
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,610
You are not of his bloodline anyway.

485
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,290
However, if you act foolishly…

486
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,540
you shall lose your life as well, wench.

487
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,000
Your Grace!

488
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,340
Your Grace.

489
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,260
Your Majesty.

490
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,140
Your Majesty,
how could you treat Her Grace--

491
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,430
I do not want to hear it.

492
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:03,600
You two shall also leave my sight at once.

493
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,190
Unless you have a death wish.

494
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:16,450
And end the state mourning
for the Queen this instant!

495
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,700
Your Majesty.

496
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:21,490
But…

497
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,580
Your Majesty.

498
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,250
Your Majesty…

499
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,380
Your Grace!

500
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:39,930
Are you all right, Your Grace?

501
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,160
Who goes there?

502
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,040
Are you not that eyeglass artisan?

503
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,840
Can you please invite us in?

504
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,390
What are you saying?

505
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,060
What do you mean His Majesty
is possessed by an evil spirit?

506
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,440
He stopped the execution
of the Queen's assassins,

507
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,730
Lord An Seok-ju and Noble Elder Pung-san,

508
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:33,360
before calling for our arrest.

509
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,690
Royal Guard Seo Jae-il

510
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,400
also mentioned His Majesty
suddenly started acting strangely.

511
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,490
Yes…

512
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,780
It does indeed seem strange,
based on what you told me.

513
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:52,540
However, I cannot just blindly believe
what you two tell me.

514
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:57,260
Something else could have happened before
to warrant His Majesty's actions.

515
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,630
I cannot welcome
an unnecessary misunderstanding

516
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,050
by taking you two in
when you are on the run.

517
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,390
I will not report you to the state troops…

518
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,770
but you must leave at once.

519
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,770
Have you already forgotten
your daughter was once possessed

520
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,070
by that book merchant's vengeful ghost?

521
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:20,070
The same thing is happening right now.

522
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:22,030
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost,

523
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:24,320
the vengeful ghost of Cheon Geum-hwi,

524
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:26,330
has now possessed him.

525
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,830
Yet, you still do not believe us?

526
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,580
You…

527
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,420
Your tone and conduct last time
at Yongdam Village was quite irritating,

528
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,500
but I held back
because His Majesty let you be.

529
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,720
How dare you refer
to His Majesty in such a manner!

530
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,800
It is "His Majesty"!

531
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,090
You dare refer to him as "that King"?

532
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:46,680
Damn it.

533
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,970
Let us go, Yeo-ri.
We are talking to a wall here.

534
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,190
I hope you do not kick out the baby Prince
once he flees and makes his way here.

535
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:55,480
What did you say?
Wait. Hold on…

536
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,610
Father, these two saved both you and me.

537
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:02,450
This is no way to repay them
for their kindness.

538
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:08,950
You may stay the night. However,

539
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,000
leave once day breaks.

540
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,050
Take them off.

541
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:22,260
Stop it.

542
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,340
Come now.

543
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:25,510
Shall I do it for you?

544
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:26,720
What is wrong with you?

545
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,560
Take them off already.

546
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,940
I told you I am fine.
They do not hurt anymore.

547
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,900
I saw you wincing as you walked.

548
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,690
That is enough already.
I will take care of my own ankles.

549
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,990
We are coming in.

550
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,710
Sure. Come in.

551
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:07,390
It is late and I could not ask them
to prepare a feast.

552
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,510
I had them prepare something light.

553
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,270
Thank you, my lady.
And for welcoming us earlier as well.

554
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:16,650
We would be lost right now
if we were turned away like that.

555
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,940
You are the one who saved me.

556
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,270
I, also…

557
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,280
am someone who knows
how to repay kindness.

558
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,450
Yes, I am sure you are.

559
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,040
But…

560
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,080
this room is quite small.
Will you be all right?

561
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,340
I had them prepare another room.
You should stay there, my lord.

562
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,090
Your meal is waiting
for you there as well.

563
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,930
It is not small at all.
This is even bigger than our house.

564
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:01,110
I should help you with a hot compress--

565
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,020
Stop. Enough.

566
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,250
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
has possessed His Majesty?

567
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,080
Are you sure
that is what Imugi Gangcheori said?

568
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,960
Yes, my lord.

569
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,840
But what are you two doing in here?

570
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,590
Why are you not in the Grand Hall?

571
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,640
We were kicked out.
Pardon?

572
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,220
Way to brag.

573
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,930
How ridiculous.

574
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,020
His Majesty… I mean,

575
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,060
His Eight-foot-tall Ghost Majesty
has already figured out

576
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,060
that we had our suspicions.

577
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,440
How is this just in any way?

578
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,820
We were kicked out
after a lifetime of service

579
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,190
to have Sang-deuk, that traitor,

580
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,700
and the steward who stabbed Her Highness
serve His Majesty.

581
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,030
I cannot believe this.

582
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,080
What should we do about this?

583
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,790
Yeo-ri and Imugi Gangcheori were worried
about His Highness, the Prince.

584
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:02,290
What? His Highness? Why?

585
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,630
They said
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost's first target

586
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,010
would be His Highness.

587
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,260
Are you asking about the caragana blooms?

588
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,800
Yes. Do you have any more?

589
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,970
I came here today specifically
to acquire some more.

590
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,390
Providing more will not be an issue,

591
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:24,940
but you must tell me
what those blooms exactly are.

592
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,490
I am observant in my own ways.

593
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:31,400
Just like how Yeo-ri is not
a mere eyeglass artisan,

594
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:34,450
I had figured out your lord

595
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:36,200
was not just a mere examiner.

596
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,290
I am sure the caragana
that bloomed in the middle of winter

597
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:43,080
is not just an ordinary flower.

598
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:44,580
So please, answer me.

599
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:48,000
Is that not the least amount
of etiquette you could show me

600
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:50,970
after I took care of it this whole time?

601
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,800
You are right.

602
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,680
To protect the one I wish to keep safe,

603
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,270
I need that flower.

604
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,230
By "the one you wish to keep safe,"

605
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,530
do you mean Yeo-ri?

606
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,120
What are you doing here?

607
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,750
It is nothing.

608
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,210
By chance, can I borrow
some yellow soil and salt?

609
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,590
To do what with them?

610
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,760
How much do you need?

611
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,100
As much as I can get.

612
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,100
I suspect they will come in handy soon.

613
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,900
Open them!

614
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,270
Where is that damn Prince?

615
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,020
Your Grace, where are you going?

616
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:32,610
First, to my quarters.

617
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,030
Once His Majesty realizes
His Highness is missing,

618
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:39,450
that is where he would go next.

619
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:44,540
How is there not

620
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,790
a single place to hide the Prince
in this vast palace?

621
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,150
Your Grace.

622
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,000
Did you look into it?

623
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:34,130
Yes, she was speaking the truth.

624
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:39,260
The Capital is crawling with state troops
looking for the two of them.

625
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:43,560
Your Excellency, it is Mak-geum.

626
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,850
What is it?

627
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:50,940
Your Highness!

628
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,610
My lord.

629
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:04,870
We have confirmed His Highness is residing
at Lord Choi Won-u's residence.

630
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,000
How did you know
His Highness would flee in advance?

631
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:15,250
When drive hunting, the prey
are bound to look for hiding spots.

632
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,300
I am sure that brat

633
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,930
and that rotten Imugi are there as well.

634
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:22,930
I shall hunt them all at once.

635
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:34,110
No! You cannot!

636
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:36,690
Please!

637
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:47,990
Why, this is…

638
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:51,000
Her Grace's dragon-head hairpin,
is it not?

639
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,130
She asked me to deliver this to you.

640
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:58,710
To ask you to keep me, the Prince, safe.

641
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,090
His Highness was able to make it out
safely, thanks to Her Grace's assistance.

642
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:09,430
Then, is His Majesty
truly possessed by an evil spirit?

643
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,440
You refused to listen to us.

644
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,570
Now, do you believe us?

645
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:23,820
Your Excellency!

646
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,240
Your Excellency,
there is great trouble afoot.

647
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:30,660
State troops are gathering outside!

648
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,830
Your Highness.

649
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,340
You will be all right.

650
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,510
Get the boy out of here with Yeo-ri.

651
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,550
I will buy you some time.

652
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,890
No.

653
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:52,770
I shall step outside.

654
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,160
Look after His Highness.

655
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:54,290
Open these gates.

656
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:56,830
His Majesty awaits outside!

657
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,540
Knock down the gates.

658
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,730
Your Majesty.

659
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:22,190
What brings you by to my residence,
this early in the morning?

660
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,290
Your Majesty.

661
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:37,460
Now, I finally know who you are.

662
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,000
Your cowardly ancestor

663
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:42,630
was there as well.

664
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,590
Your Majesty.

665
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:47,840
Just as your ancestor had done,

666
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,930
remain quiet and do nothing.

667
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:55,680
If you interfere once more,
I shall slay you first!

668
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,200
Let us go.

669
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:13,870
Halt!

670
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:19,620
Go on ahead.

671
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:34,700
Step back, all of you.

672
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,990
I will take care of this Imugi myself.

673
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:42,660
The whole nation is
in the palm of the Warrior Deity.

674
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,120
What happens to us now?

675
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:48,710
Must we continue running from Father
who remains possessed by an evil spirit?

676
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,880
You are the most important to me.

677
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,090
So, let us run away, Gangcheori.

678
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:53,170
Do you mean it?

679
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,550
I have sworn an oath to always be ready
to give my life for His Majesty.

680
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,680
I can no longer stand by
as that dirty, evil spirit continues

681
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,680
to occupy His Majesty's body.
Where is Yeo-ri?

682
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:02,060
You must be safe.

683
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,190
You…

684
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:05,900
I am here, under the command
of The Ten Kings of the Underworld,

685
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:07,480
to escort you to the afterlife.

686
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,070
Follow without protest.

687
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:12,740
