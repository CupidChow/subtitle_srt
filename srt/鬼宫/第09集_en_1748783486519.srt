1
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,917
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,421
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,434
Please…

4
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,770
My lordship! Please spare--

5
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,193
My lordship…

6
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,031
Grandfather, perhaps that is enough now.

7
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,699
At this rate, what if he really dies?

8
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,117
No, Your Highness.

9
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,578
That man conjures
the most despicable hexes.

10
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,831
He kidnaps young children and starves them
to death to turn them into ghosts.

11
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,834
And then, he uses those ghosts
to swindle money from others.

12
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,170
He is the vilest of the vile.

13
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,172
He was just trying
to survive as a blind man.

14
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,257
You should stop now.

15
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,094
You should head inside.

16
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,556
You are here for convalescence.
You should not see such sights.

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,641
But…

18
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,143
Please return inside now.

19
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,012
A vengeful ghost
with the most bitter grudge…

20
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,391
Your lordship!

21
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,101
Your lordship!

22
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,853
The royal family…

23
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,814
A vengeful ghost with a bitter grudge…

24
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,524
Hold on.

25
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,109
Stop.

26
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,870
- What did you say?
- A vengeful ghost…

27
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,998
with a deeply bitter grudge

28
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,250
has latched onto the royal family.

29
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,335
You must flee.

30
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,920
Or everyone will die.

31
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,923
You must flee!

32
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,723
Did you say there was a ghost
harboring a grudge

33
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,892
against the royal family?

34
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,351
Yes, my lordship.

35
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,436
If you just let it be,

36
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,730
that man earlier… No.

37
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:12,692
All the esteemed members
of the royal family will perish.

38
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,905
My lordship, if you just spare my life,

39
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,158
I will do whatever it takes
to stop that ghost.

40
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,409
That will not

41
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,662
be enough to spare your life.

42
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,248
Then…

43
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,002
what must this lowly creature do
to earn your forgiveness?

44
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,379
What must I do?

45
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,383
I hear you are quite gifted
with the starving-children hexes.

46
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,010
Never…

47
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:42,430
Never will I commit
such a monstrous deed again.

48
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,266
So please, just spare my life…

49
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,643
Do you think

50
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,103
you could summon that ghost?

51
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,234
What?

52
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,656
Neop-deok?

53
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,782
Yes.

54
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,325
The wretched shaman

55
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,829
who overpowered the Warrior Deity
after he had possessed the late king.

56
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,166
Yeo-ri, that brat,
is of the same bloodline.

57
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,962
I sent someone to Yongdam Village
and confirmed it beyond doubt.

58
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,922
Are you saying that measly brat

59
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,842
is the one responsible for this mess?

60
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:24,722
You can just get rid of her
like you did with that old shaman wench.

61
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,766
I was able to do that then.

62
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:31,938
<i>Watch over the prince with favor</i>

63
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,900
<i>Our hope grows with every word</i>

64
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,821
Fire!

65
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,787
<i>Back then, I was able to escort</i>
<i>the Warrior Deity there</i>

66
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,164
and help him devour her.

67
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:54,335
However, this time
the situation is not as simple.

68
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,962
She is not alone.

69
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,633
Examiner Yoon Gap's body
is actually possessed by an Imugi.

70
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,677
- Imugi?
- Yes.

71
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,848
I cannot, for the life of me,
figure out why that Imugi is helping her,

72
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,977
but because of him,
getting close to her is no easy feat.

73
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,693
<i>Are you saying</i>

74
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,154
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost did that
to Shaman Neop-deok?

75
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,747
<i>How could I not have known?</i>

76
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,457
<i>Idiot.</i>

77
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,293
<i>Why did I not figure it out?</i>

78
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,713
<i>The fire spread</i>
<i>from the ritual table candle.</i>

79
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,091
<i>And Grandma fell into the sea</i>
<i>because of that fire.</i>

80
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,011
Grandma!

81
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,015
<i>An ember ghost was obviously responsible.</i>

82
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,315
Your Majesty was already aware of this.

83
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,192
Earlier,

84
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,487
you were shocked to hear my grandmother
died in the Year of the Water Rabbit.

85
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,115
You must have
already figured it all out by then.

86
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,204
I was hoping that my assumption was wrong.

87
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,081
Neop-deok…

88
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,501
was the only shaman
who managed to provide…

89
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,340
my father with momentary relief
from his mania.

90
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,211
I will…

91
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,880
I will kill you all!

92
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,550
This bloodline will be

93
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,427
uprooted by my hand.

94
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,269
Resume!

95
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,015
Father!

96
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,317
<i>I thought that was the end of it.</i>

97
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,153
I did not believe in heretical ceremonies,

98
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,363
but after that day,

99
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:13,701
my father had returned
to his former, virile self.

100
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,373
However…

101
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,312
Fa… Father.

102
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,348
I was in denial for all these years,

103
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,643
but now I know for certain.

104
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,062
That was not…

105
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,733
Father who stood before me.

106
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,738
After my father passed away,

107
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,826
I thought it was finally all over.

108
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,832
But similar symptoms manifested…

109
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,044
once again in my young son.

110
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,009
What sort of grudge
does that Eight-foot-tall Ghost harbor

111
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,678
to commit such heinous acts?

112
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,348
Why did you

113
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,310
keep this from me until now?

114
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,234
The palace was in a state of turmoil

115
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,237
after the erratic behavior
of the king who was possessed by a ghost.

116
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,992
There were even threats of a coup
led by those who held military power.

117
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,786
Addressing that incident once more

118
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,581
would have even endangered my legitimacy.

119
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,834
Furthermore,

120
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,794
a king…

121
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,007
must place his trust in no one.

122
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,093
My grandma

123
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,055
fought for someone
who did not even believe in her

124
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,849
and as a result,
ended up tragically losing her life.

125
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,481
Yeo-ri.

126
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,485
I am the King of this nation.

127
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,864
I am responsible
for all that happens on this land

128
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,283
and be involved in all matters.

129
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,453
No matter what happens,

130
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,039
I shall endure any hardship
that comes my way

131
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,459
for the sake of the nation I dream of.

132
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,045
However,

133
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,923
when it comes to matters
that drift between life and death…

134
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,051
I remain clueless.

135
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,554
I must seem shameless…

136
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,183
and it breaks my heart…

137
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,816
but I need your help.

138
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,491
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

139
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,744
Please excuse me.

140
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,436
<i>I get it now.</i>

141
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,774
<i>The Eight-foot-tall Ghost</i>
<i>must have devoured Grandma's spirit.</i>

142
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:20,489
<i>That is why she has</i>
<i>never been able to visit me.</i>

143
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,704
<i>How could I be such an idiot?</i>
<i>Just completely in the dark…</i>

144
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,586
Talk to me.

145
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,799
I asked if you regret lying to that brat
about killing her grandmother.

146
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,176
I do not.

147
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,510
I knew it.

148
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,220
I told you back then.

149
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,432
Pompous mortals like her need to be shown
the mighty, intimidating powers

150
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,267
of deities like us.

151
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,187
My regret lies elsewhere.

152
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,066
Back then, I noticed early on that

153
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,070
Neop-deok brought the vile Eight-foot-tall
Ghost with her from the capital.

154
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,158
I wanted to warn her then, however…

155
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,662
I resented that girl
for refusing to open her heart to me,

156
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,998
so I did not.

157
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,210
I only regret failing

158
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,462
to give her that warning.

159
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,546
And if you had?

160
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,799
Would she have lauded you
and accepted you as her patron deity?

161
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,009
At the very least,

162
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,887
Neop-deok could have
avoided such a tragic end.

163
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,013
And if she had,

164
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,099
Yeo-ri would not be forced to confront
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost now.

165
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,022
Gangcheori!

166
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,373
What are you doing here?

167
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,125
You should not be out alone this late.

168
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,716
I forgot such concern
is not allowed in our arrangement.

169
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,344
I shall go on ahead.

170
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,555
Follow me if you wish.

171
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,641
- Or not.
- Why have you kept silent?

172
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,314
- What are you talking about?
- Why did you not tell me

173
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,943
that it was the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
who killed my grandma and not you?

174
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,361
Why would you keep that from me?

175
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,864
You knew everything.

176
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,575
You were not responsible at all.

177
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,077
How did you find out?

178
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,038
After I repeatedly told him not to…

179
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,915
That rotten scoundrel, I shall--

180
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,750
How could you not speak up?

181
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,254
You were subject to
my resentment, rage, and loathing…

182
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,382
Why did you never say anything?

183
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,386
Because it was easier for me.

184
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,848
What did you say?

185
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,727
You were just 13 years old back then.

186
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,563
Too young to even take care of yourself.

187
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:01,609
What would have happened if you foolishly
confronted the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

188
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,193
to save Neop-deok's devoured soul?

189
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,614
You would have ended up as his prey

190
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,866
and I, who was looking
to use you to ascend,

191
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,701
would come up empty-handed…

192
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,588
What I meant was…

193
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,988
Are you leaving already?

194
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,658
You got in really late last night.

195
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,826
They barely pay examiners enough.

196
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,954
It cannot be much different
for eyeglass artisans.

197
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,873
Why are you up so early?

198
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,249
I slept enough.

199
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,669
But why are you whispering?

200
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,713
- To avoid waking Gap up?
- No.

201
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,509
Excuse me, I have a busy day today.

202
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,137
You should still have
some breakfast before you go.

203
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,264
My goodness.

204
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,975
You need a full belly to work.

205
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,522
Gap. Are you awake already?

206
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,274
You should have let me know if you were.

207
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,027
Hold on.

208
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,989
What the…

209
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,741
Sleeping with your eyes open?

210
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,082
I guess something happened
between these two again.

211
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,668
I don't want to!

212
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,671
I'm not that brat's nanny.
Why would I follow her around?

213
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,964
I refuse.

214
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,758
Yeo-ri found out.

215
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,678
She was already hotheaded and reckless.

216
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,889
Now, she knows the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
devoured her grandmother.

217
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,100
Who knows what she will do now?

218
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,396
Just stay by her side
and let me know if she is ever in danger.

219
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,109
Are you in any position
to worry about her?

220
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,113
I confirmed it when you dealt
with that drowned ghost, Bang Mak-dol.

221
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,823
You are not as strong as you used to be.

222
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,034
Really?

223
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,368
Were you watching me from afar?

224
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,872
I'm so worried about you,
it's just killing me inside!

225
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,958
What if you never get
to ascend because of her?

226
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,418
No, I refuse!

227
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,754
<i>Hold on.</i>

228
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,631
<i>If I follow her around,</i>
<i>it might be easier to split them up.</i>

229
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,467
Does it repulse you that much?

230
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:36,930
It does…

231
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,642
but I am sure lugging
that heavy body around

232
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,811
to chase after her cannot be easy for you.

233
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,146
What choice do I have?

234
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,398
The younger brother

235
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,777
must lend a hand to his older brother.

236
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,655
Thank you. Thank you so much, Bibi.

237
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,491
Thank you. I shall put my faith in you.

238
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,078
You are the best Imugi!

239
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,377
<i>If you did not show this time,</i>

240
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:11,256
I was planning to have you pay dearly
for refusing a royal summons.

241
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,593
Your Majesty.

242
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,303
Have you decided?

243
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,305
I have been fearing

244
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:22,810
that I might become a hindrance
in your noble mission.

245
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,939
And that fear remains even now.

246
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,482
I, too, am afraid.

247
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,442
I fear my mission

248
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,655
will cause all my vassals
to turn their backs on me.

249
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:40,119
I fear it may only make
the lives of the people harder.

250
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,870
I fear my supporters…

251
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,083
will be brought into harm's way.

252
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,254
Your Majesty.

253
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,464
However, that will not stop me.

254
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,927
Thus, you must help me.

255
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,696
What are you doing?

256
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,327
Are you mad at me?

257
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,706
What was I supposed to do?

258
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:32,254
I am nothing more than a poor water ghost
who lives in a well.

259
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,132
Even the almighty Gangcheori

260
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,176
struggled against that drowned ghost.

261
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,763
Just imagine what would have happened
if I also confronted him.

262
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,432
Were you there?

263
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,728
Well, you know…

264
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,980
I was a bit worried.

265
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,316
You made sure of that!

266
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,360
So, what is it now?

267
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,154
What?

268
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,741
Why aren't you at the Royal Couturier
and pouting the day away here?

269
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,665
Geez.

270
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,876
Where is she?

271
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,341
And what is that thing?

272
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,636
So? You just ran out of there?

273
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,055
Because you were scared
to face Gangcheori?

274
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,432
As if.

275
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,143
It just feels a little awkward.
That is all.

276
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,647
I mean, for the past 13 years,

277
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,982
I explicitly hated him nonstop.

278
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,776
I was relentless.

279
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,778
Loathing him was like breathing.

280
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,989
He was the bane of my existence
who ruined my life and killed my grandma.

281
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,619
But…

282
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,331
it turns out he did not kill her.

283
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,168
So, what do I do now?

284
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,129
Is it not obvious? Just stop hating him.

285
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,048
But still…

286
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,900
Is your heart wavering?

287
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,860
Worried you might fall for Gangcheori?

288
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,698
Wavering? How absurd.

289
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,036
Then, why are your cheeks so flush?

290
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,166
No, they're not.

291
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,295
Yes, they totally are.

292
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,379
No, you're wrong.

293
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,093
"Those who harm others for gain
will harm themselves in time."

294
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:46,221
It means if you cause suffering to others
for the sake of personal benefit,

295
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,975
you will ultimately end up
blighting yourself.

296
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,978
Well done, Your Highness.

297
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,983
Your progress has been steady
since you regained your health.

298
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,403
I hear that

299
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,782
Examiner Yoon Gap has been
frequenting your quarters.

300
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,077
Perhaps, he has been aiding
in your studies?

301
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:14,124
Father told me he is a great scholar
who will be of great help to me.

302
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,878
And that eyeglass artisan as well?

303
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,964
Well…

304
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,591
She is…

305
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,970
That was… because I was curious
about how glasses were made.

306
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:32,684
She had some corrective lenses
that were wondrous and--

307
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,061
That is quite all right.

308
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,982
It seems His Majesty commanded you
to not speak on this matter.

309
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,526
Thus, you do not need to trouble yourself.

310
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:48,617
There is nothing I detest more
than to see Your Highness distressed.

311
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,915
<i>So, the Yapper was right.</i>

312
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,169
Your Highness, Eunuch Song
from the Grand Hall seeks an audience.

313
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,253
Let him in.

314
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,179
What is a eunuch from the Grand Hall
doing here?

315
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,014
Did Father send you?

316
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,307
Yes, Your Highness.

317
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,310
He asked me to escort
the Chief State Councillor back.

318
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,274
Your Majesty wishes to appoint Lord
Choi Won-u as the Left State Councillor?

319
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,651
Yes, I plan to do so.

320
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,778
What are your thoughts on the matter?

321
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:32,077
I believe you also once mentioned
that Lord Choi Won-u was far too gifted

322
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,287
to be wasting his years
as a hermit scholar.

323
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,790
Yes, I did indeed say that.

324
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,127
However, your vassals
will understand his appointment

325
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:45,090
as a sign of Your Majesty
actively pursuing slavery reform.

326
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,135
We have yet to capture
the heinous individual responsible

327
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,178
for the egregious act committed
against the Queen.

328
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:54,933
Thus, if Your Majesty once again summons
Lord Choi Won-u to your side,

329
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:59,396
the opposing parties will only grow
more beastly in their hearts.

330
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,108
I am prepared for as much.

331
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:07,070
You must be aware of it as well.

332
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:11,616
The late king departed
in such a manner to protect me.

333
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,788
On that rare day when his mania subsided,

334
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,624
he became aware
of the stirrings of a rebellion…

335
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,878
and he…

336
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,923
was felled by his own hand for my sake.

337
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,466
Your Majesty.

338
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,887
In his heart, the late king also desired
to bring forth slavery reform.

339
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,848
On behalf of the late king as well,

340
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,267
I plan to properly carry out
my sovereign duties.

341
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,853
Please help me do so.

342
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,231
Your Majesty.

343
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,693
If that truly is your desire,

344
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:50,488
this elderly subject will wholeheartedly
carry out your command.

345
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,993
Your Majesty,
Examiner Yoon Gap seeks an audience.

346
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,370
Yes! Let him in.

347
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,248
You may be dismissed now.

348
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,541
Yes, Your Majesty.

349
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,720
Hold on. What are you doing?

350
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,971
<i>She is not alone.</i>

351
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,974
Examiner Yoon Gap's body
is actually possessed

352
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,059
by an Imugi.

353
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:21,937
What are you doing?

354
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,607
- Let me go.
- Look here.

355
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,567
I said, let go of me, Grilled Abalone!

356
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,653
Stop calling me Grilled Abalone!

357
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,082
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

358
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,584
Why would you tell Yeo-ri that?

359
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,878
I did not tell her that.

360
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:47,963
What?

361
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:52,092
I never knew that Neop-deok fell victim
to the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

362
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,636
However, it appears you did.

363
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,013
That…

364
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:01,059
is because I am a deity
with almighty power beyond mortal reach.

365
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,979
However, you must have hid
that fact from Yeo-ri

366
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,064
to keep her safe.

367
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,237
It appears you were worried about her.

368
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,697
I did so

369
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,824
because I need that girl to ascend.

370
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,993
So, you hold her dear in your heart.

371
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,959
Even the omnipotent Imugi

372
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:29,421
knows to blush when speaking
of the maiden he harbors affection for.

373
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,758
Do not laugh.

374
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,135
Affection? Nonsense.

375
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,262
Getting a grasp
of her emotions is impossible.

376
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,390
When I think about her
a searing rage surges from deep within.

377
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,642
Not even the slightest clue
as to what she is thinking.

378
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,977
Fine.

379
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,145
I understand she is upset

380
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,689
upon learning her grandmother died
because of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

381
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,984
However, if she cries such sorrowful,
heartrending tears,

382
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,485
what am I to do?

383
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,742
There is nothing scarier in this world
than a maiden's tears.

384
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,078
That is quite true.

385
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:06,207
I also used to become
very flustered when the Queen cried.

386
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,627
However, I most certainly know better now.

387
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,881
I know what a man must do
in those situations.

388
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,508
And what…

389
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,511
could that be?

390
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,307
What is it?

391
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,147
You just need to offer a warm embrace

392
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,650
and listen to her with an open heart.

393
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,082
<i>Offer a warm embrace</i>
<i>and listen to her with an open heart?</i>

394
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,382
<i>How could I when she will not</i>
<i>even lock eyes with me?</i>

395
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,656
Goodness me, they are still at it.

396
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:23,076
I wonder what terrible thing Gap did
to make Yeo-ri act like that.

397
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,412
Gangcheori did nothing wrong.

398
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,164
Yeo-ri just has a nasty temper.

399
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,791
No way.

400
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,128
And here I thought I could get
him married off this year. Guess not.

401
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,712
Right?

402
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,214
I concur.

403
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,008
The yearning heart of a mortal
has long been

404
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,512
mere fleeting lust necessary
for the continuation of the species.

405
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:46,391
The mortal heart is fickle
and flips easier than a hand.

406
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,059
No.

407
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,271
Fickle human hearts
may flip easier than hands,

408
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,565
but one cannot flip feelings
that are not there.

409
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:55,942
What the…

410
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,445
Can this mortal hear me?

411
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,447
I am certain they like each other.

412
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,456
Geez…

413
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,314
You are clearly distracted.

414
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,899
Are you all right?

415
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,317
What are you scheming?

416
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,110
Why do you keep following me around?

417
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,404
Do you think I want to be doing this?

418
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,580
I could share this if you would like.

419
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:54,834
Why Gangcheori lied and told you
that he killed Neop-deok.

420
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:02,133
You see, Gangcheori has always considered
mortals to be lowly since the olden days,

421
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,511
and never felt the need
to be honest with them.

422
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,722
Are you not curious
about how many lies he has weaved

423
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,225
throughout your history?

424
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:11,976
For example,

425
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,897
when he claimed he would defeat
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost for you…

426
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,024
Why are you telling me this?

427
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:20,902
What?

428
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,570
Well…

429
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,239
because…

430
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,282
I just feel bad for you falling…

431
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,409
for such tricks.

432
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,746
Don't you dislike me?

433
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,124
Should you be sharing
Gangcheori's secrets with me like this?

434
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,043
Does he know about this?

435
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,671
You

436
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,173
are doing this to separate us,
are you not?

437
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,600
Leave already.

438
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,978
How despicable! I just loathe them.

439
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:58,231
Mortals make my skin crawl.
I just hate them.

440
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:02,318
And clever ones like that one,
I despise even more and then some!

441
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:08,992
I just need to ascend as soon as possible
and get away from these damn mortals.

442
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,126
And right on cue is my next feast.

443
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,298
I believe it has been quite a while
since we've met like this, my lord.

444
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,258
What sort of urgent matter

445
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,678
led you to summon me like this
when you value your privacy so?

446
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:18,436
The King wishes to appoint Lord Choi Won-u
as Left State Councillor.

447
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,898
In the end,

448
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,359
does the king wish to pursue
this slavery reform business?

449
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,197
How could you have just let things
proceed this far?

450
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,203
During the rebellion we led 13 years ago,

451
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,914
we should have taken care
of the crown prince as well.

452
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:43,127
My lord,
your temperament is far too fiery.

453
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,674
You were also too rash
when you tried to kill Examiner Yoon Gap.

454
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:51,803
How do you know--

455
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,389
The haphazard execution
of your reckless pursuits

456
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,725
will end up hindering us.

457
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:02,105
You should abandon
such pursuits as soon as possible.

458
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,357
However,

459
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,151
he is no longer the Yoon Gap of the past.

460
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,446
His behavior has been strange,
almost inhuman at times.

461
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,365
Where there is a will, there is a way.

462
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,200
From what I hear,

463
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,329
he is a son quite devoted
to his filial duties.

464
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:39,100
How was that fellow's fortune?

465
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:45,064
He appeared to be in peril
like a candle against the wind.

466
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:49,318
I do not believe the Minister of War
will stand a chance against that Imugi,

467
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,820
no matter what he does.

468
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,906
That was not what I was hoping for.

469
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,368
If we can just briefly hold
that Imugi captive,

470
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,370
we can easily take care of that Yeo-ri.

471
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,247
It will be no trouble at all.

472
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,502
You focus on the Queen Dowager
and get her to act.

473
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,130
We must…

474
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,133
first stop Choi Won-u.

475
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,597
The King is bringing
someone new into the court?

476
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,723
Who is it?

477
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,099
I do not know.

478
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:24,353
However, Your Grace will soon find out.

479
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,731
You must stop it.

480
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,441
Once he enters the palace,

481
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,485
His Majesty's power
will only grow stronger

482
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:34,155
and you will forever lose your chance

483
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,949
to get vengeance
for Prince Yeongin's death.

484
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,396
It appears you have had a change of heart.

485
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,900
I am certain you told me last time

486
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,861
that you had no intention
of becoming a supporter of the King.

487
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,656
I, too, wish to stay in the countryside

488
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,868
and spend the rest of my days
teaching the next generation of scholars.

489
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,953
However…

490
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,416
I wish to provide His Majesty
with what little help I can

491
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,878
as he embarks on his lone battle.

492
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,591
- Your Grace--
- I was born

493
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,762
to a noble family
suffering abject destitution.

494
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:43,599
I sometimes sought out aid
from a distant uncle on my mother's side.

495
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,519
I was embarrassed
about asking for his help

496
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,606
and I used to stall for no reason
by wandering around that big house.

497
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,899
Once, I ended up in the study

498
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,819
and discovered a very amusing book.

499
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,656
I believe it was called
<i>The Anthology of Light and Darkness.</i>

500
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,244
Was it not?

501
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,540
The book written by Lord Choi Gil-sang,
my uncle's great-great-grandfather,

502
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:11,127
as he safeguarded the king in the royal
procession during the war a century ago.

503
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,962
What are you trying to say?

504
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,887
I…

505
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,639
have nothing else to lose now.

506
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,643
My unwavering desire to destroy the King

507
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,645
is all I have.

508
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,232
That is to say
I am not the least bit afraid

509
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,818
of the contents of that book
being released into the world.

510
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,739
However, you have a lot to lose,
do you not, Uncle?

511
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,826
If you wish to avoid that,

512
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,746
go back to Yongdam Village.

513
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,919
That is where
you are meant to be, my lord.

514
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,191
- Are these all the books?
- Yes.

515
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,778
- Hurry it up.
- Yes, sir.

516
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,574
Hello, my lady.

517
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,909
Did something happen?

518
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,495
Why is everyone packing up?

519
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,873
His Excellency said we are
to head back to Yongdam Village.

520
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,583
What?

521
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,878
Do not just stand there.
Pack up her lady's belongings.

522
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,592
My lady…

523
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,896
Your Majesty.

524
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,650
This letter from Lord Choi Won-u
just arrived.

525
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,610
Did you say Lord Choi Won-u?

526
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,752
<i>My fidelity to the sovereign</i>
<i>and sense of duty toward him</i>

527
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,379
<i>remain fervent in my heart.</i>

528
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:22,508
<i>However, I am unqualified</i>
<i>to answer Your Majesty's summons</i>

529
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:26,095
<i>and meet the lofty expectations</i>
<i>laid upon me.</i>

530
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,477
Send a messenger to escort
Lord Choi Won-u back this instant.

531
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,979
Yes, Your Majesty.

532
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,315
No.

533
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,818
I shall go myself.

534
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:37,041
She should be back now.
Where could she be?

535
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,183
Lady Choi In-seon?

536
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,145
What brings you here, my lady?

537
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:02,191
Have you been staying here
this whole time?

538
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,695
- A talisman?
- Yes.

539
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,116
Every nobleman over 60 in the capital
had the same talisman with them.

540
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,410
What sort of talisman?

541
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,039
A Haeilbu talisman.

542
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,541
Haeilbu?

543
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,750
As in a pig talisman?

544
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:21,794
Seriously?

545
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,255
What sort of lunatic
is trying to ward us off

546
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,048
as if we are serpents?

547
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,428
That measly talisman

548
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,638
stopped the almighty Bibi
from gobbling up a nobleman?

549
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,182
I told you it was not
some measly talisman.

550
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,559
I never saw anything like it.

551
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,019
It possessed indomitable spiritual energy.

552
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,359
Hey. You have a guest.

553
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,532
A guest?

554
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,826
My lord.

555
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,202
It has been a while.

556
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:09,008
My lady is here today
because it would be reprehensible

557
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:12,970
to forgo a gesture of gratitude
to the savior who saved her life twice.

558
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,181
Hence, we stand before you now.

559
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,390
"Saved your life"?

560
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,934
I saved your life?

561
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,356
Remember? Back in Yongdam Village,

562
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,776
you saved her once
when she collapsed in the silk store.

563
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,113
And last time, there was that collision
where she was about to fall on her behind…

564
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,702
I mean, she was about to fall

565
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:40,039
when you reached out
to save her, just in time.

566
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,416
So, that makes two.

567
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,251
That is the argument.

568
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,837
Not mine, but Her lady's.

569
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,881
That is right.

570
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,094
Not to mention,

571
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:58,015
you also gifted me
that lovely potted plant last time.

572
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,144
Potted plant?
The one that Venerable Gaseop gave us?

573
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,773
Are you familiar with it?

574
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,236
I am not sure. It could be the same one

575
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,113
or that lord over there
could have picked one up from the street.

576
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,243
Go on, Mak-geum.

577
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,619
Yes, my lady.

578
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,885
I purchased them all from the
most renown confectionery in the capital.

579
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,845
A small gesture of my thanks.

580
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,906
Please try this one as well.

581
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,501
But

582
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,296
how did that girl come to stay here?

583
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,339
"That girl"?

584
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,096
You must have taken her in out of pity.

585
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,141
Did you not say she was
like a sister to you,

586
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,476
who grew up in the same village?

587
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,021
Well, you could say that.

588
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:31,317
We grew up in the same village together
as if we were siblings.

589
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,695
That is the extent of our relationship.

590
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:39,617
You are ever so compassionate, my lord.

591
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,286
Well, you never know with people.

592
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:45,998
I have seen friendly acquaintances
become newlyweds once or twice before.

593
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,082
Hey!

594
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,544
How noisy.

595
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,464
You there.

596
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:57,301
Perhaps, if that task is not so urgent,

597
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,053
you could give us some privacy?

598
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,264
There is something I wish
to discuss privately with His Lord.

599
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:12,566
Sure. I was actually about to go out
to look for the lady of the house

600
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,942
who should have been home by now.

601
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,653
I see.

602
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,529
Then you should get going.

603
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,540
Try this, too.

604
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,632
What was that about?

605
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,593
What is that esteemed daughter
of a nobleman doing here anyway?

606
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,762
He saved her life twice?

607
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,723
It looked like they were close.

608
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,518
When did that start?

609
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,311
Did it start with Lord Yoon Gap?

610
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,063
Or after Gangcheori's possession?

611
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:00,030
Are you Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri?

612
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,574
Yes, I am.

613
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,579
His Lord, Chief State Councillor
Kim Bong-in, wishes to meet you.

614
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,040
He wishes to have
some glasses made by you.

615
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:35,441
I just need to grab
something really quick.

616
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,994
Why am I making excuses for myself?

617
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,418
Well.

618
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,342
I am leaving for real now.

619
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,136
Please feel free to do whatever you wish.

620
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,889
All right. Go on.

621
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,200
This one is tasty as well.

622
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,410
No, thanks.

623
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,621
All these sweets are making me thirsty.

624
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,263
<i>I have your mother.</i>

625
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,932
<i>If you wish to save her,</i>

626
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,768
<i>come to the abandoned house</i>
<i>next to the slaughterhouse near Seosomun.</i>

627
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,938
<i>Yoon Gap's mother was kidnapped?</i>

628
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,564
What does it say?

629
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,484
It is nothing.

630
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,656
<i>Yes, this is nothing.</i>

631
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,201
<i>That woman is just Yoon Gap's mother.</i>

632
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,870
<i>She was useful</i>
<i>for her above-average cooking skills,</i>

633
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,372
<i>but that was all. Nothing more.</i>

634
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,044
<i>But, why do I have this nagging feeling?</i>

635
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,340
Right.

636
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,509
These sweets pale in comparison

637
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,345
to that woman's garlic chive pancakes.

638
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,723
Where are you going?

639
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,600
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

640
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,769
Just a moment, my lord.

641
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:40,691
I will be leaving the capital
to return to Yongdam Village today.

642
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,901
Before I do,

643
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,363
there is something I must tell you.

644
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,447
No need.

645
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,784
But you do not even know
what I am about to say.

646
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,330
You come off scatterbrained,
but you are actually quite clever.

647
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,250
You must also be well aware
of what the future holds for you.

648
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:02,254
You will marry the man your parents choose
and give birth to his children.

649
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,715
As your mother and sisters
have done before you,

650
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,508
you shall quietly live out your days

651
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,553
as a nobleman's wife within the confines
of your walled-off home.

652
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,932
I am sure thinking about that
only left you frustrated beyond belief.

653
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,726
It must have made you want to rebel.

654
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,687
However,
I am not the sort of man you seek.

655
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,648
Nor do I have any desire
to fulfill your wishes.

656
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,734
My lord, I just--

657
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:24,860
Furthermore…

658
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,907
if you wish to order Yeo-ri around
like some handmaiden,

659
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,452
you are not welcome in my presence.

660
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,288
My lord.

661
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,403
Where is Lord Choi Won-u?

662
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:13,992
Yes. His Lord took everyone
and left about one hour ago.

663
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,702
Was he headed to Yongdam Village?

664
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,537
Yes, he was.

665
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,668
He could not have gone far if
he is traveling with his whole household.

666
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:48,485
Are you sure this is the way
to Lord Kim Bong-in's residence?

667
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,696
Yes, of course.

668
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:54,366
I told you His Lord is
waiting for you right now.

669
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,410
<i>I heard Lord Kim Bong-in</i>

670
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,496
<i>was the King's maternal grandfather</i>
<i>and the Chief State Councillor.</i>

671
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,708
<i>Why would he reside</i>
<i>in such a secluded area?</i>

672
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,672
What is the meaning of this?

673
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,686
It appears you foolishly misplaced
your sense of fear.

674
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,563
Shall I send you flying
with another whirlwind?

675
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,899
Try it if you can.

676
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:13,403
However, it appears your mother's blood
will stain the floor before you do.

677
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,946
Will you be okay with that?

678
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,582
I guess even a ghastly scoundrel like you
grows fearful before your flesh and blood.

679
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,044
I just could not make any sense of it.

680
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,923
I most certainly stabbed you
in the abdomen.

681
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,384
I even confirmed
you were dead beyond doubt.

682
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,012
Who are you?

683
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,766
Did you create this mess to find that out?

684
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,936
If you were so curious,
you should have just asked.

685
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,396
I would have gladly provided an answer.

686
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,775
I am…

687
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,897
You ghastly scoundrel.

688
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:34,651
Behind you!

689
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:42,200
Gap…

690
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,834
<i>I told you it was not</i>
<i>some measly talisman.</i>

691
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,586
I never saw anything like it.

692
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,921
It possessed indomitable spiritual energy.

693
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,147
Damn it. How annoying.

694
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,472
What are you doing?
Run before they wake up.

695
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,641
Right.

696
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,878
Why, you damn wench.

697
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:36,398
<i>I cannot summon the wind?</i>

698
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:47,742
Bibi.

699
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,011
My lord!

700
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,530
<i>Save me, Gangcheori. Please.</i>

701
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,577
Stop!

702
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,163
Your Majesty.

703
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,127
What do you think you are doing?

704
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:25,298
Yeo-ri. Are you all right?

705
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,969
Whom do you serve?

706
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,531
Your Majesty!

707
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,379
Your Majesty, are you all right?

708
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:07,465
Your Majesty was injured because of me.

709
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,719
It is nothing serious. Just a scratch.

710
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,931
Who do you think instigated them?

711
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,434
They displayed exceptional swordsmanship.

712
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:20,770
It seems someone found out
about her true identity.

713
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,772
We must return to the palace.

714
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:23,898
Your Majesty.

715
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,109
What shall we do about Lord Choi Won-u?

716
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:30,029
If her true identity has been exposed,

717
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,740
I cannot leave the palace vacant for long.

718
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,120
Escort Yeo-ri back.
They may try to attack her once more.

719
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,247
Yes, Your Majesty.

720
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,925
Will His Majesty be all right?

721
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,385
He lost a lot of blood.

722
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,221
His Majesty will be fine.

723
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,306
More importantly,

724
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:59,267
it appears someone is targeting
you and Examiner Yoon Gap.

725
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,977
You must be even more careful now.

726
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,438
Yes, I shall.

727
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,532
Where is everyone?

728
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,702
Ma'am?

729
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,914
Gangcheori?

730
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,545
Gangcheori!

731
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,601
What in the world happened?

732
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,478
How did she end up like this?

733
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,396
Should we not call for a physician?

734
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,067
It was nothing serious.

735
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,401
She is just sleeping.

736
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:53,446
There were no serious injuries.

737
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,739
It looks serious to me.

738
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,742
Just what happened?

739
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,661
And what happened to you?

740
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,080
I am fine.

741
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,457
I ran into some trouble,

742
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,126
but His Majesty saved me.

743
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,630
And he got injured in the process.

744
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:14,425
The King got hurt
while trying to save you?

745
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,530
Where were you in the middle of the…

746
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,535
Did you leave to retrieve this?

747
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,869
This late?

748
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,710
- Let me.
- It is fine. I can do it.

749
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,253
Just stay still.

750
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:57,802
Don't…

751
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,929
Stay still, I say.

752
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,848
You could barely wipe it due to the pain.

753
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:04,851
Gosh.

754
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,686
Just stop it!

755
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,399
Do you know
what the most infuriating thing is?

756
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:16,279
My grandma must be suffering right now
within the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

757
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,991
Her futile death still breaks my heart.

758
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,243
Yet…

759
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,580
deep in my heart…

760
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,125
I am relieved.

761
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:34,047
So relieved that you were not the one

762
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,799
who did that to my grandma.

763
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,887
That was the first thought I had.

764
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,642
I was relieved to find out

765
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,896
that I no longer have to feel guilty
about being attracted to you.

766
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:51,898
That thought was all…

767
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:56,194
- You--
- How can I be like this?

768
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,780
How can someone be so wretched?

769
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:36,025
SPECIAL THANKS TO SONG JAE-HEE

770
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,005
<i>She saw me for the first time.</i>

771
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,674
<i>That is what I will be</i>
<i>focusing on for now.</i>

772
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:02,468
What could you possibly expect
from a mortal?

773
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,262
Could I take you returning here today

774
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:07,181
to mean you will continue
helping me with my undertaking?

775
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,392
<i>He is unusually quiet.</i>

776
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:12,937
<i>Yoon Gap, you scoundrel,</i>
<i>what are you scheming?</i>

777
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,564
<i>Do not tell Yeo-ri.</i>

778
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:17,108
You knew about this
from the start, did you not?

779
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:21,112
<i>Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri</i>
<i>was not at the Royal Couturier.</i>

780
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,865
<i>Someone dragged Yeo-ri out of the palace.</i>

781
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,700
Yeo-ri!

782
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:31,664
