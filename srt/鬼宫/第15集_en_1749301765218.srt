1
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,917
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,421
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,395
Stay back.

4
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,566
Stop him!
Keep His Majesty safe!

5
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,264
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty…

6
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,507
Queen…

7
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,601
Queen.

8
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,978
My Queen!

9
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,566
Apprehend him!

10
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,821
You cannot, Your Highness.

11
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:35,989
Mother!

12
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,116
Please, Your Highness…
Mother!

13
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,493
Hear me! Summon a royal physician!

14
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,373
Summon a royal physician immediately!

15
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,514
The Warrior Deity…

16
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,517
has finally devoured

17
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,561
the unborn baby of the Queen!

18
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,202
I just do not understand
what is going on here.

19
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,882
I am able to touch them without trouble.

20
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,468
Both stones. The King's and the Prince's.

21
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,016
It is faint, but it smells of alcohol.

22
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,269
Someone poured alcohol
on the Ghostbane Stones.

23
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,316
Thus, the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
was able to attack the Queen

24
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,527
despite the fact that
she was holding the Ghostbane Stone.

25
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,030
No, that is not possible.

26
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:03,326
They were both very strict
about who they allowed to come near.

27
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,994
Your most trusted could be behind it.

28
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,293
Wait, hold on.

29
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,236
Hand it over.

30
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,290
Was it you?

31
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,210
The Prince's Eunuch Lee
already confessed as well.

32
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,296
Were you really behind this?

33
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,632
Head Eunuch, please spare me.

34
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,592
Please forgive me.

35
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,638
He held my family captive
and threatened me. I had no other choice--

36
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,099
I cannot believe you.

37
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,643
You fool!

38
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:15,773
I took you under my wing
and raised you to be a eunuch…

39
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,485
It appears I have been raising
a wild beast.

40
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,740
I committed a heinous act of treachery
to His Majesty because of you.

41
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,785
You have tainted the honor of all eunuchs.

42
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,162
Take him away.

43
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,165
My lord. Please.

44
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,335
Head Eunuch! Please forgive me!

45
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,053
Your Majesty.

46
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,306
My shortcomings are deserving of death.

47
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,266
What does that mean?

48
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,435
Tell me you can heal her.

49
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,896
Tell me you can heal her right now!

50
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,858
I will not ask you to even save
the baby in her womb.

51
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,651
So, just save…

52
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,946
Just save the Queen, at least!

53
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,201
She has already lost
too much blood, Your Majesty.

54
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,287
This cannot be.

55
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,789
I refuse to accept this.

56
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,208
Tell me what I must do.

57
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,668
Tell me…

58
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,378
What must I do?

59
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,091
Please save her…

60
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,224
Your Majesty.

61
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,644
My Queen.

62
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,896
Mother.

63
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,984
Your Majesty.

64
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,653
I am…

65
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,826
beyond saving now.

66
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,620
No.

67
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,083
Do not say that.

68
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,794
Please do not say such things.

69
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,296
You cannot leave me.

70
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,050
You cannot leave me like this, my Queen.

71
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,427
Please…

72
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,722
Please forgive me…

73
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,643
for departing first.

74
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,648
Our…

75
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,860
Our Gwang…

76
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,949
Please…

77
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,880
Mother…

78
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,964
Mother!

79
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,675
Mother!
Your Highness…

80
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:51,012
Mother!

81
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,056
Mother!

82
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,143
Mother…

83
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,814
Mother!

84
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,069
Mother…

85
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,155
Mother!

86
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,367
Mother…

87
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,619
My Queen.

88
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,206
It is my fault.

89
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,792
I should have checked
before the passage rite.

90
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,878
I was a fool.

91
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,755
It is not your fault.

92
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,884
We never stood a chance
against the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

93
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,429
He upended a passage rite
that was prepared with the utmost care.

94
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,848
A maniacal, wicked spirit.

95
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,309
Her Highness.

96
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:46,025
Her Highness has ascended
with royal grace!

97
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:50,071
Her Highness has ascended
with royal grace!

98
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,740
May Avalokitesvara show us mercy.

99
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,995
Her Highness has ascended
with royal grace!

100
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,542
Her Highness has ascended
with royal grace!

101
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,338
Her Highness has ascended
with royal grace!

102
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,357
Your Highness.

103
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,317
Her Highness…

104
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,867
Your Highness.
Your Highness…

105
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,453
Your Highness…

106
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,261
You scoundrel.

107
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,014
You…

108
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,267
You said if I just poured
alcohol on those things,

109
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,185
I would become the Chief State Councillor.

110
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,479
But look at this mess.

111
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,316
My steward suddenly went insane

112
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,610
and wielded his sword against the Queen.

113
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,654
Are you trying to get me killed as well?

114
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,448
How did you even know about this place?

115
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:19,243
I would be left in shambles
if you suddenly disappeared.

116
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,038
I had you followed
after our previous meeting

117
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,914
to uncover your hideout.

118
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,335
You have wasted your time.

119
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,795
You only hastened your demise.

120
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,798
What?
Are you sure

121
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,092
no one followed you all the way here?

122
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,181
Apprehend all of them!
Yes, sir.

123
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,475
Wait. I am innocent.

124
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,603
It was not me. I am innocent.
I did not do anything.

125
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,612
Is this the only way now?

126
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,283
But that means…

127
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,452
I could end up dying.

128
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,303
Hey! Everyone!

129
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,807
My goodness. Did you all hear the news?

130
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,019
They caught the scoundrels
who did that to the Queen!

131
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:32,274
I hear the interrogation hall is
in a frenzy right now.

132
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,776
My goodness.

133
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,194
Those rotten scoundrels.

134
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,077
I do not know anything.

135
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,037
I was only deceived by this man.

136
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,667
Please spare me, Your Majesty.

137
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,009
As soon as day breaks tomorrow,

138
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,137
behead them all.

139
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,181
Do I make myself clear?

140
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,515
Yes, Your Majesty.

141
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,810
Your Majesty…

142
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,562
You are no better than a beast!

143
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,689
Did you never fear
the judgment of the gods?

144
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,649
Judgment?

145
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,151
Give me a damn break.

146
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:25,614
I was struck by that damn divine judgment
the moment I was born.

147
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,032
Lowborn by birth

148
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,742
and cursed by blindness.

149
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,078
If all those years of being treated
less than a maggot

150
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,038
were not divine punishment,

151
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,040
then what is?

152
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,586
That would not even come close.

153
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,753
I promise you this.

154
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,507
You will end up suffering
the most excruciatingly painful death.

155
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,303
You should not be so cocky.

156
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,222
You are not even a threat
to the Warrior Deity now.

157
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,517
After all, he possesses
a luminous pearl, just like you.

158
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,768
You…

159
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,229
and that brat you care so much about

160
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,231
will soon be done for.

161
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,358
I should kill you!

162
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,903
That is enough.

163
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,779
Even His Majesty held back
from slaying him.

164
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,864
Gangcheori.

165
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,139
Stop right there!

166
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,444
My goodness. Look who it is.

167
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,574
Why, it is Her charming Grace,
the Queen Dowager.

168
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,286
You dared to trick me
into offering up my son as a sacrifice?

169
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,916
You committed that vile act
against the ever-gentle Queen

170
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,794
and used me

171
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,879
to defy the King?

172
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,965
Why did it have to be me?

173
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,300
Why did you target me?

174
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,390
That was because you, wench,

175
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,642
looked like the most terrified,
cornered rat.

176
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,520
What did you say?

177
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,106
Toying around with a terrified wench
in the palm of your hand

178
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,607
requires no effort at all.

179
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,820
Why, you scoundrel!

180
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,781
Your Grace. He is to be beheaded shortly.

181
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,242
Please try to remain calm.

182
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,624
Let us go.

183
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,350
Your Majesty.

184
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,397
These objects were delivered
by Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri.

185
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,774
A talisman that wards off ghosts

186
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,526
and eastern peach branches.

187
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,698
Your Majesty.

188
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,576
You cannot continue to refuse your meals

189
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,620
and reside in the royal library all day.

190
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:22,958
Your Majesty.

191
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,420
I am the one who deserves death.

192
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,173
So please,

193
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,801
look after your sacred body.

194
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,973
Please look after your sacred body.

195
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,728
Your Majesty…

196
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,675
I will get you some more.

197
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,611
But she never drinks tea.

198
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,872
Why?

199
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,458
Does it look strange?

200
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,922
A pearl necklace on a pig's neck…

201
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,259
is what I was afraid of…

202
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,887
but it suits you quite well.

203
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,688
Do not be too disheartened…

204
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,108
because I am keeping my distance.

205
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,654
It is just that…

206
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,535
if I embrace you as I would my own child…

207
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,749
I would feel so sorry for my poor Gap.

208
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,962
I am aware.

209
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,755
Do not burden your heart.

210
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,759
Mortals are lowly creatures

211
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,970
and they sometimes behave revoltingly,

212
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,891
but they can also be charming at times.

213
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,226
I am certain…

214
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,189
that was thanks to mothers like you

215
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,774
who so tenderly looked
after their children.

216
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,115
Is Yeo-ri making a fresh batch of rice?

217
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,508
This is indeed caragana.

218
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:22,221
Did the plant I gave you flower?

219
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,767
Well… the plant is currently
with someone else.

220
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,811
However, I did see the buds
before they bloomed for myself.

221
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,521
Is that true?

222
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,192
Did that caragana actually bloom?

223
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,404
May I ask why you respond so?

224
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,406
What is so special about that caragana?

225
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,911
Well, the thing is…

226
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,134
Examiner Yoon Gap.

227
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,832
They say if the caragana blossom
is consumed,

228
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,126
one will be able to hold out

229
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,463
until the luminous pearl
is completely drained

230
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,340
while confronting
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

231
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,385
Does Gangcheori know about this?

232
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,145
Gangcheori…

233
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,939
what exactly are you planning to do?

234
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:27,929
Your Majesty.

235
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,157
Hear me.

236
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,368
Is anyone there?

237
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,621
Hear me!

238
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,513
You…

239
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,890
You must be the scoundrel.

240
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,103
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

241
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,089
You should have just killed me instead.

242
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,676
Why would you kill her?

243
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,013
I attempted to ask for your forgiveness.

244
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,308
With my sincerest intention,

245
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,978
I sought to atone.

246
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,313
Then, why…

247
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,484
Why would you kill
someone completely innocent?

248
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,323
She was beautiful and ever so gentle.

249
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,081
I understand your grudge runs deep,

250
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,083
but where does it end?

251
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,295
Tell me where it ends!

252
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,090
Why must I suffer so

253
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,886
because of the sins
of my ancestor long past?

254
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,599
His sins are not mine.

255
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,894
Do you say they are not your sins?

256
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,487
You do not know anything.

257
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,449
You do not know how I died.

258
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,202
How my family,

259
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,412
my kin,

260
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,748
and my neighbors

261
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,792
all met their demise.

262
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,005
You know not

263
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,133
of the vow I made with my last breath.

264
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,261
What could you possibly know?

265
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,181
You spent your life in these gilded halls,

266
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,809
draped in silks
and veiled behind the palace walls.

267
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,437
You do not know anything!

268
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,780
Seon-u…

269
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,047
Run. Hurry.

270
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,973
Cheers to Commandant Cheon
of Yongdam Village!

271
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,308
Cheers!
Cheers!

272
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,688
With the military exam behind him,
we should call him the deity of warriors!

273
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,481
The Warrior Deity!

274
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,901
Yes, of course.
He is the Warrior Deity, indeed!

275
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,737
Cheers to the Warrior Deity
of Yongdam Village!

276
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:08,867
Cheers to the Warrior Deity
of Yongdam Village!

277
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,661
Cheers to the Warrior Deity
of Yongdam Village!

278
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:15,373
Cheers to the Warrior Deity
of Yongdam Village!

279
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,542
Cheers to Yongdam Village!

280
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,836
Cheers to Yongdam Village!

281
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,673
It is my fault.

282
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,633
It is all my fault.

283
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,386
Everyone died because of me.

284
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,100
I will never forgive you.

285
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,146
I shall make you pay, even in death.

286
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,275
King…

287
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,860
I shall…

288
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,530
slaughter every member of your bloodline.

289
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,950
I shall never forgive you.

290
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,869
For all eternity!

291
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,395
Did you say these are not your sin,

292
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,857
but those of your ancestor?

293
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,614
This royal dragon robe you wear

294
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,325
was woven with the bloody sacrifices

295
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,995
of the villagers of Yongdam,
my family, and me!

296
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,791
The very throne your ancestor secured
through sacrificing our lives…

297
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,128
is where you sit, is it not?

298
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:53,513
However, I am sure you remained oblivious,

299
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,850
satisfied about what a sage king you are.

300
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,562
You must have prided yourself
on being a benevolent king

301
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,064
who embraced all his people.

302
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,193
Your very existence is a sin.

303
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,947
That blood only flows through your body

304
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,325
because it was saved

305
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,577
with our wretched, fiery deaths.

306
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,081
And yet, you shamelessly proclaim

307
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,627
that you are utterly without blame?

308
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,901
My grudge shall not be extinguished

309
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,612
until every last drop
of blood from your lineage…

310
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:58,911
has been eradicated from this land.

311
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,329
No…

312
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,374
You cannot…

313
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,710
Please…

314
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,051
I will let a part of you remain conscious,

315
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,721
so prepare your eyes
to fully bear witness…

316
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,892
what happens to your son,

317
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,563
that insufferable Imugi scoundrel
who always got in my way,

318
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,858
and even that wench, Yeo-ri.

319
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,071
You shall witness
how they all meet their demise,

320
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,407
just as I had met mine.

321
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,792
You cannot. No!

322
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,129
I was wrong.

323
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,465
I was wrong!

324
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,467
Please.

325
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,596
Please!

326
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,694
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

327
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,779
My goodness.

328
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,399
After all, he possesses

329
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,317
a luminous pearl, just like you.

330
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,569
You…

331
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,238
and that brat you care so much about

332
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,698
will soon be done for.

333
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,183
Oh, you scared me.

334
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,518
Sulking in utter desolation

335
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,229
is only making that ugly face uglier.

336
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,314
What?

337
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,274
Follow me.

338
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,485
What? To where?

339
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,413
I was sure it was around here somewhere.

340
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,998
What are you looking for?

341
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,375
There it is.

342
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,754
Welcome.

343
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,426
We will take this.
Sure. That will be three jeon.

344
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,886
Three jeon…

345
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,351
Come here.

346
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,795
Finally, somewhat acceptable.

347
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,965
What is?
You finally look somewhat acceptable,

348
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,591
after covering up some of that ugly face.

349
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,261
What? I'm taking it off.
No.

350
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,013
Your sacred patron deity
just bestowed this upon you. How dare you?

351
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,266
Make sure to wear it every day.

352
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,560
Maybe you will tremble
a little less with that on.

353
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,313
You always speak like that.

354
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,065
Just say you wanted to buy it for me.

355
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,692
Was calling me ugly necessary?

356
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,194
Well… I guess it is warm.

357
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,657
Wait, but you cannot squander
your salary again like last time.

358
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,409
Bring every last bit to your mother.

359
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,870
After I graciously used
my pumpkin taffy money to buy it,

360
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,497
must you nag like that?

361
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,336
But maybe…
I might like that one a bit more.

362
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,546
Which one?

363
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,132
This one? Or this one?

364
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,135
No. On a second look,
I think this one is the prettiest.

365
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,345
And you did choose this one for me…

366
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,984
You are still the fairest mortal
I have ever known.

367
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,486
Hence,

368
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,822
it breaks my heart.

369
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:51,871
Where are you taking me?

370
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,255
It is almost the first full moon
of the lunar new year.

371
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,175
It looks like people added wish papers
to be burned with the moon hut.

372
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:07,053
You could not care less about it
in Yongdam. What has gotten into you?

373
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,555
It was not that I did not care.

374
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,724
I just stayed away
because they were nasty and petty.

375
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,227
They used to shoot dirty looks
if I ever approached them,

376
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,688
worried I would end up
jinxing their holy wishes.

377
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,399
Seeing how angry you are now,

378
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,487
you must have had a wish
you wanted to write down.

379
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,655
I did.

380
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,201
I was so sick and tired of being alone.

381
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:34,372
I wanted to wish for someone
to share meals and tender warmth with.

382
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,790
I wished for it with all my heart.

383
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,084
That was it.

384
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,888
Are you trying to keep it a secret?

385
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,056
You will jinx me. Go over there.

386
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,398
Traditionally, they burned
moon huts with wishes

387
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,900
as a way of wishing on the Big Dipper.

388
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,944
However,

389
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,280
despite having
your patron deity right here,

390
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,325
you wish to pray
to some stars far, far away?

391
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,494
Who knows if it will ever be granted?

392
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,913
It might be granted if I wish hard enough.

393
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,958
The Big Dipper up there might.

394
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,335
So, what did you write down?
You will only jinx it.

395
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,712
Unbelievable.

396
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,174
Wait, what is that over there?

397
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,509
What?

398
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,219
What are you talking about?

399
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,638
No. All the way over there.

400
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,223
That?
Yes.

401
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,398
I heard…

402
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,900
Pung-san was scheduled
to be beheaded today.

403
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,875
Proceed with the execution!

404
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,657
He smiles?

405
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,077
Stop!

406
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,082
His Majesty commands
you to stop this execution at once!

407
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,384
Your Majesty,

408
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,928
did you just give a command to…

409
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,763
Your Majesty.

410
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,099
Why are you stopping their execution?

411
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,435
Those two, An Seok-ju and Pung-san,

412
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,188
assassinated Her Highness, the Queen.

413
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,649
They did not kill the Queen.

414
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,444
The ones who led me to perform
that heinous, heretical ceremony,

415
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,154
Examiner Yoon Gap

416
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,949
and Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri,

417
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,992
killed the Queen.

418
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,410
That is not true, Your Majesty.

419
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,288
They were merely trying
to aid Your Majesty.

420
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:26,460
Were you also an accomplice
in the assassination of the Queen?

421
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,505
Most certainly not, Your Majesty.

422
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,340
How could I ever dare--

423
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,467
Carry out my royal command properly!

424
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:38,180
Stop the execution of Noble Elder Pung-san
and the others immediately.

425
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,849
Apprehend Examiner Yoon Gap

426
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,936
and Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri,

427
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,773
and behead them immediately!

428
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,359
This is a royal command.

429
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:53,487
Apprehend Examiner Yoon Gap
and Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri.

430
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,072
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

431
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,325
Who is Yeo-ri?

432
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,828
What's going on?
My goodness!

433
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,173
Yeo-ri.

434
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,811
They could not have gone far.

435
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:26,895
Find them.

436
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,363
I already searched over here.
Search that way.

437
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,616
Yes, sir. Let's go!

438
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,047
My lord, what is going on?

439
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,673
Why is His Majesty coming after us?

440
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,383
His Majesty has changed.

441
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,927
He was definitely lost
in melancholy just before,

442
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,764
but he suddenly experienced
a surge of energy and gave the order.

443
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,100
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
has possessed him.

444
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,354
With the Ghostbane Stones gone,

445
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,439
there is no reason
for him to bide his time.

446
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,318
Come to think of it,
I detected on His Majesty

447
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,029
the stench that once came
from the Prince's quarters.

448
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,616
His Highness is in danger.

449
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,576
If His Majesty is possessed,

450
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,495
the Prince will be his first target.

451
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,081
However,

452
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,001
I cannot just openly defy His Majesty's
royal command to save His Highness.

453
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,337
That is Your Majesty in appearance only.

454
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,297
What will happen
when he is no longer possessed

455
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,634
and he finds out he killed his son
with his own two hands?

456
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:42,304
Considering his lofty character,
he is bound to give in to insanity.

457
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,892
We will be at Choi Won-u's residence.

458
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,478
Bring the baby Prince there.

459
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:56,902
What did you just say?

460
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,613
He stopped Pung-san's execution?

461
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,949
And he also commanded
for Examiner Yoon Gap

462
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,535
and Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri
to be apprehended?

463
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,994
Yes, Your Grace.

464
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,998
I heard Pung-san was
summoned to the palace.

465
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,420
How could the King give out
such an absurd command

466
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,463
if he has not gone mad?

467
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,436
Your mourning robe…

468
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,402
Your Majesty.

469
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,363
Have you already forgotten
what kind of creature he is?

470
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,949
He used a wicked spirit

471
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:47,953
to kill the Queen
and my son, Prince Yeongin!

472
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:53,625
Yet, you stopped his execution
and even summoned him to the palace?

473
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,672
Answer me, Your Majesty!

474
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,678
It has not even been a few days
since the passing of the Queen.

475
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:07,181
How could you change out
of your mourning robe already?

476
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,226
Did you forget
what the Queen meant to you?

477
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,020
You are much too noisy.

478
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,148
Shall I behead you as well?

479
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,276
What did you say?

480
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,612
What did you just…

481
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,383
You…

482
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,145
What could you possibly do
as you shake like a leaf?

483
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,694
I have no intention
of killing you as well.

484
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,614
You are not of his bloodline anyway.

485
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,286
However, if you act foolishly…

486
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,541
you shall lose your life as well, wench.

487
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,003
Your Grace!

488
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,338
Your Grace.

489
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,257
Your Majesty.

490
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,137
Your Majesty,
how could you treat Her Grace--

491
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,430
I do not want to hear it.

492
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,600
You two shall also leave my sight at once.

493
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,187
Unless you have a death wish.

494
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:46,446
And end the state mourning
for the Queen this instant!

495
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,700
Your Majesty.

496
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,493
But…

497
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,580
Your Majesty.

498
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,250
Your Majesty…

499
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,378
Your Grace!

500
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,928
Are you all right, Your Grace?

501
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,157
Who goes there?

502
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,043
Are you not that eyeglass artisan?

503
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,838
Can you please invite us in?

504
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,388
What are you saying?

505
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:56,058
What do you mean His Majesty
is possessed by an evil spirit?

506
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,435
He stopped the execution
of the Queen's assassins,

507
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,729
Lord An Seok-ju and Noble Elder Pung-san,

508
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,357
before calling for our arrest.

509
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,691
Royal Guard Seo Jae-il

510
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,402
also mentioned His Majesty
suddenly started acting strangely.

511
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,488
Yes…

512
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:12,783
It does indeed seem strange,
based on what you told me.

513
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:22,542
However, I cannot just blindly believe
what you two tell me.

514
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:27,255
Something else could have happened before
to warrant His Majesty's actions.

515
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,633
I cannot welcome
an unnecessary misunderstanding

516
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,052
by taking you two in
when you are on the run.

517
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,389
I will not report you to the state troops…

518
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,767
but you must leave at once.

519
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,772
Have you already forgotten
your daughter was once possessed

520
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,066
by that book merchant's vengeful ghost?

521
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,070
The same thing is happening right now.

522
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,030
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost,

523
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,324
the vengeful ghost of Cheon Geum-hwi,

524
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,326
has now possessed him.

525
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,828
Yet, you still do not believe us?

526
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,580
You…

527
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,418
Your tone and conduct last time
at Yongdam Village was quite irritating,

528
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,504
but I held back
because His Majesty let you be.

529
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,716
How dare you refer
to His Majesty in such a manner!

530
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:11,800
It is "His Majesty"!

531
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,094
You dare refer to him as "that King"?

532
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,680
Damn it.

533
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,974
Let us go, Yeo-ri.
We are talking to a wall here.

534
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,186
I hope you do not kick out the baby Prince
once he flees and makes his way here.

535
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,480
What did you say?
Wait. Hold on…

536
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:29,609
Father, these two saved both you and me.

537
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,446
This is no way to repay them
for their kindness.

538
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,952
You may stay the night. However,

539
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,997
leave once day breaks.

540
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:51,047
Take them off.

541
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,257
Stop it.

542
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,342
Come now.

543
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,510
Shall I do it for you?

544
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:56,720
What is wrong with you?

545
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,561
Take them off already.

546
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,938
I told you I am fine.
They do not hurt anymore.

547
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,900
I saw you wincing as you walked.

548
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,694
That is enough already.
I will take care of my own ankles.

549
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:20,994
We are coming in.

550
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,707
Sure. Come in.

551
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:37,385
It is late and I could not ask them
to prepare a feast.

552
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,513
I had them prepare something light.

553
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:43,266
Thank you, my lady.
And for welcoming us earlier as well.

554
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,645
We would be lost right now
if we were turned away like that.

555
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,939
You are the one who saved me.

556
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,274
I, also…

557
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,276
am someone who knows
how to repay kindness.

558
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,446
Yes, I am sure you are.

559
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,037
But…

560
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,082
this room is quite small.
Will you be all right?

561
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:10,335
I had them prepare another room.
You should stay there, my lord.

562
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,088
Your meal is waiting
for you there as well.

563
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,925
It is not small at all.
This is even bigger than our house.

564
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,106
I should help you with a hot compress--

565
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,024
Stop. Enough.

566
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:46,246
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
has possessed His Majesty?

567
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,082
Are you sure
that is what Imugi Gangcheori said?

568
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:50,959
Yes, my lord.

569
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,840
But what are you two doing in here?

570
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,592
Why are you not in the Grand Hall?

571
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,635
We were kicked out.
Pardon?

572
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,220
Way to brag.

573
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,930
How ridiculous.

574
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,016
His Majesty… I mean,

575
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:09,060
His Eight-foot-tall Ghost Majesty
has already figured out

576
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,062
that we had our suspicions.

577
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,440
How is this just in any way?

578
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,817
We were kicked out
after a lifetime of service

579
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,194
to have Sang-deuk, that traitor,

580
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,698
and the steward who stabbed Her Highness
serve His Majesty.

581
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,033
I cannot believe this.

582
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,077
What should we do about this?

583
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:29,789
Yeo-ri and Imugi Gangcheori were worried
about His Highness, the Prince.

584
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,292
What? His Highness? Why?

585
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,628
They said
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost's first target

586
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,005
would be His Highness.

587
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,259
Are you asking about the caragana blooms?

588
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,803
Yes. Do you have any more?

589
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,973
I came here today specifically
to acquire some more.

590
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,393
Providing more will not be an issue,

591
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:54,940
but you must tell me
what those blooms exactly are.

592
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,485
I am observant in my own ways.

593
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,404
Just like how Yeo-ri is not
a mere eyeglass artisan,

594
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,449
I had figured out your lord

595
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,201
was not just a mere examiner.

596
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,288
I am sure the caragana
that bloomed in the middle of winter

597
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:13,083
is not just an ordinary flower.

598
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,584
So please, answer me.

599
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:18,004
Is that not the least amount
of etiquette you could show me

600
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,966
after I took care of it this whole time?

601
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,803
You are right.

602
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,682
To protect the one I wish to keep safe,

603
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,268
I need that flower.

604
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,230
By "the one you wish to keep safe,"

605
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,526
do you mean Yeo-ri?

606
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,124
What are you doing here?

607
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:57,752
It is nothing.

608
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:01,214
By chance, can I borrow
some yellow soil and salt?

609
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,591
To do what with them?

610
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:05,760
How much do you need?

611
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,095
As much as I can get.

612
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,098
I suspect they will come in handy soon.

613
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:24,904
Open them!

614
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,265
Where is that damn Prince?

615
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:01,024
Your Grace, where are you going?

616
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,609
First, to my quarters.

617
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:07,030
Once His Majesty realizes
His Highness is missing,

618
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,449
that is where he would go next.

619
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,537
How is there not

620
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,790
a single place to hide the Prince
in this vast palace?

621
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,145
Your Grace.

622
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,001
Did you look into it?

623
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,129
Yes, she was speaking the truth.

624
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:09,259
The Capital is crawling with state troops
looking for the two of them.

625
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,555
Your Excellency, it is Mak-geum.

626
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,848
What is it?

627
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:20,937
Your Highness!

628
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,605
My lord.

629
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:34,868
We have confirmed His Highness is residing
at Lord Choi Won-u's residence.

630
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:40,999
How did you know
His Highness would flee in advance?

631
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:45,253
When drive hunting, the prey
are bound to look for hiding spots.

632
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,298
I am sure that brat

633
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,925
and that rotten Imugi are there as well.

634
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:52,927
I shall hunt them all at once.

635
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:04,105
No! You cannot!

636
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,691
Please!

637
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:17,994
Why, this is…

638
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,997
Her Grace's dragon-head hairpin,
is it not?

639
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,125
She asked me to deliver this to you.

640
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,713
To ask you to keep me, the Prince, safe.

641
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:35,094
His Highness was able to make it out
safely, thanks to Her Grace's assistance.

642
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:39,432
Then, is His Majesty
truly possessed by an evil spirit?

643
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,441
You refused to listen to us.

644
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,567
Now, do you believe us?

645
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,821
Your Excellency!

646
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:57,242
Your Excellency,
there is great trouble afoot.

647
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:00,662
State troops are gathering outside!

648
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,833
Your Highness.

649
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,336
You will be all right.

650
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,507
Get the boy out of here with Yeo-ri.

651
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,552
I will buy you some time.

652
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:16,886
No.

653
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:22,767
I shall step outside.

654
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,160
Look after His Highness.

655
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,287
Open these gates.

656
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,831
His Majesty awaits outside!

657
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,542
Knock down the gates.

658
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,727
Your Majesty.

659
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:52,190
What brings you by to my residence,
this early in the morning?

660
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,286
Your Majesty.

661
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,455
Now, I finally know who you are.

662
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,999
Your cowardly ancestor

663
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,627
was there as well.

664
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,588
Your Majesty.

665
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,840
Just as your ancestor had done,

666
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,927
remain quiet and do nothing.

667
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:25,682
If you interfere once more,
I shall slay you first!

668
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,195
Let us go.

669
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:43,866
Halt!

670
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,622
Go on ahead.

671
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,697
Step back, all of you.

672
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,991
I will take care of this Imugi myself.

673
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:12,663
The whole nation is
in the palm of the Warrior Deity.

674
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,123
What happens to us now?

675
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:18,711
Must we continue running from Father
who remains possessed by an evil spirit?

676
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:19,879
You are the most important to me.

677
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,089
So, let us run away, Gangcheori.

678
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:23,174
Do you mean it?

679
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,551
I have sworn an oath to always be ready
to give my life for His Majesty.

680
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,679
I can no longer stand by
as that dirty, evil spirit continues

681
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:30,681
to occupy His Majesty's body.
Where is Yeo-ri?

682
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,058
You must be safe.

683
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,185
You…

684
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,895
I am here, under the command
of The Ten Kings of the Underworld,

685
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,480
to escort you to the afterlife.

686
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,065
Follow without protest.

687
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:42,735
