1
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,917
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,421
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,550
Don't…

4
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,634
Stay still, I say.

5
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,345
You could barely wipe it due to the pain.

6
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,348
Gosh.

7
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,184
Just stop it!

8
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,897
Do you know
what the most infuriating thing is?

9
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,777
My grandma must be suffering right now
within the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

10
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,489
Her futile death still breaks my heart.

11
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,741
Yet…

12
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,078
deep in my heart…

13
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,623
I am relieved.

14
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,669
So relieved that you were not the one

15
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,297
who did that to my grandma.

16
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,426
That was the first thought I had.

17
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,139
I was relieved to find out

18
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,352
that I no longer have to feel guilty
about being attracted to you.

19
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,395
That thought was all…

20
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,691
You--
How is this even possible?

21
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,361
How can someone be so wretched?

22
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,124
I think

23
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,043
your mother is awake.

24
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,380
Right.

25
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,716
You should check on her.

26
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,676
Call me if you need me.

27
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,222
Oh… Me?

28
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,058
I should go inside? Now?

29
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,728
Yes, you should. Go on.

30
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,356
Go inside…

31
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,401
I will go inside.

32
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,758
My child, are you all right?

33
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,010
I am fine.

34
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,054
Did you get hurt badly earlier?
Let me see.

35
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,389
I told you I'm fine.

36
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,809
Thank goodness.

37
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,520
Do you know how shocked I was?

38
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,189
Why in the world
did that lord do that to you?

39
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,774
What sort of bitterness toward you

40
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,777
drove him to even kidnap me
and put you through all that danger?

41
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,321
He wasn't seriously hurt, right?

42
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,074
Even one slipup with such a nobleman

43
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,993
leaves people like us in ruins.

44
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,537
There is nothing to worry about.

45
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,706
He will never come after you again.

46
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,711
Gap.

47
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,130
Just forget civil service.

48
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,882
Can you not just come up
with an excuse and quit?

49
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,052
I wish you would just quit,

50
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:07,056
so you, Yeo-ri, and I can just go back
to Yongdam Village together.

51
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,517
How many times
have you risked your life already?

52
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,980
Living is not that complicated.

53
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,690
The years pass by just like that.

54
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,650
So…

55
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,905
grab the hand of the one
you hold in your heart

56
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,782
and embrace the affection you share.

57
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,367
That is the best way to live.

58
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,244
All right?

59
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,085
Did you say this talisman

60
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,546
was crafted by the noble elder
of the blind association?

61
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,173
Yes, my lord.

62
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,760
They say everyone has been lining up
for this talisman.

63
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,651
I cannot believe
the esteemed Minister of War

64
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,071
has come all this way
to our squalid corner of the world.

65
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,781
Unlike the others,

66
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,034
I am not here to make a request.

67
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,702
I--

68
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,829
Are you not here
because of Examiner Yoon Gap?

69
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,958
You must be curious how the Haeilbu
talisman managed to stop him

70
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,835
and his otherworldly powers.

71
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,798
How… How did you know?

72
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,965
He is

73
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,884
an Imugi.

74
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,261
What did you say?

75
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,805
What do you mean he is an Imugi?

76
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,349
Imugis possess luminous pearls
inside their bodies.

77
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,267
Those pearls hold wondrous power.

78
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,521
Blasting someone off with the wind
is a cinch for a holder of the pearl.

79
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,900
Was that how that scoundrel
came back from the dead?

80
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,569
You must keep that talisman
with you at all times.

81
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,613
Also…

82
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,116
if you ever have to face him,

83
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,659
use that against him.

84
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,303
What is up with you?

85
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,014
Why are you glowing like a newlywed?

86
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,394
What is it?

87
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,772
Yeo-ri…

88
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,068
said she likes me.

89
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,821
What?

90
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,491
Are you some sort of dummy? A half-wit?

91
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:34,370
Do you not know that mortals
are easily dazzled by what they see?

92
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,957
Do you actually think she likes you?

93
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,876
She likes that body you are in.

94
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,794
That's why she is also confused.

95
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,297
What could you possibly expect
from a mortal?

96
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,259
Did it ever occur to you
that you would only end up hurt?

97
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,304
You may be right.

98
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,097
However,

99
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,851
she saw me for the first time.

100
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,437
That is what I will be
focusing on for now.

101
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,815
Also, I have a dependable brother-in-arms
like you by my side.

102
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,650
How could I get hurt?

103
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,529
Do not worry.

104
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:13,034
I shall catch you a rascal with
a belly full of spite for you to devour.

105
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,281
Goodness me,
you should take the day off today.

106
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,117
You went through hell yesterday.

107
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,411
You never know what might happen.

108
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,122
What if that man tries to harm Yeo-ri?

109
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,335
That's why you two always stick
by each other's side, starting today.

110
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,510
Take good care of Yeo-ri.

111
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,556
We should go.
All right.

112
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,851
Go on. Follow after her.

113
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,106
Always stick together!

114
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,525
What a cute couple.

115
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,903
Adorable.

116
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,297
Oh, right. Your mother…

117
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,509
She mentioned that
you knew her captor well. Do you?

118
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,970
That woman must have imagined it
amidst all the chaos.

119
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,722
I did not recognize him.

120
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,934
Then, why did a stranger
go after you and your mother…

121
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,563
It means the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
is no longer our only foe.

122
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,232
We have been found out
by the King's political adversaries.

123
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,070
Do not worry.

124
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,197
As long as you are by my side,

125
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,950
no one will even lay a finger on you.

126
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,246
Hence, you must never leave my side.

127
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,331
Understand?

128
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,920
Oh! Wild chrysanthemums.

129
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,465
Wild chrysanthemums?

130
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,142
I guess they still need
a few more days to bloom.

131
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,953
They have all bloomed already.

132
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,189
His Majesty commanded
you wait for him here.

133
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,566
Yes, my lord.

134
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,821
What now? What is it?

135
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,114
This must be

136
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,408
Lord Yoon Gap's brush.

137
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,037
YOON GAP

138
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,288
That is right.

139
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:13,209
Examiner Yoon Gap
used that very brush in this library.

140
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,800
Your Majesty,

141
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,720
have you been praying
for Lord Yoon Gap's soul?

142
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:28,015
No one in the world knows of his death.

143
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,685
I thought I should at least offer
my prayers for his soul.

144
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:38,025
I am sure Examiner Yoon Gap is
also grateful for Your Majesty's prayers.

145
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,198
Could I take you returning here today

146
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,159
to mean you will continue helping me

147
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,578
with my undertaking?

148
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,375
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost is
my grandmother's sworn enemy as well.

149
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,795
I am certain her soul
remains captive under it.

150
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,172
To ensure my grandmother's soul
rests in peace,

151
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,217
I will see to it that
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost crosses over.

152
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,177
All right.

153
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,597
I was informed by the clerk officer

154
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,475
that you also faced hardships yesterday.

155
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,521
Yes… sir.

156
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,108
"Yes, sir"?

157
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,944
Did you just say, "Yes, sir"?

158
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,237
Yes, sir.

159
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,615
I am certain I did, sir.

160
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,582
I heard it as well. "Yes, sir."

161
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,295
You are a deity

162
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,005
and I am a mere king.

163
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,506
Yet, you show me such respect?

164
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,717
You may be a mere king,

165
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,303
but you commendably saved Yeo-ri's life.

166
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,513
A king who cherishes his people

167
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,432
deserves a certain level of respect.

168
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,314
Forget it, you rascal.

169
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,524
If that is your idea of respect,
do not bother.

170
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,569
Well, that effort was wasted.
Forget it then.

171
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,408
So, were you able to get a look

172
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,201
at your attackers?

173
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,413
I did, but I did not recognize
any of them.

174
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,540
They kidnapped Yeo-ri

175
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,585
and Yoon Gap's mother simultaneously
to leave me incapacitated.

176
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,963
They plotted to tear Yeo-ri and me apart.

177
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,467
So, they got together to conspire.

178
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,594
The man who took me away
definitely claimed

179
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:32,181
Chief State Councillor Kim Bong-in
had summoned me.

180
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:36,268
But His Lord has stated
that he never sent anyone for you.

181
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,772
He just denies it and walks free?

182
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,565
Are you protecting your grandfather?

183
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,402
I also confirmed that His Lord
was in the palace at that time.

184
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,446
As you allege,

185
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,657
His Lord indeed
could have done such a thing,

186
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,284
but, conversely,
someone could be framing him

187
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,328
because he is one of my supporters.

188
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,895
My lord.

189
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,647
He has arrived.

190
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,107
All right. Let him in.

191
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,415
I am Yi Hwa-seong from Onsu-gol, Chungju.

192
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,750
My lord, you are second only to the King.

193
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,712
May I ask why you summoned me here?

194
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,673
You may lift your head.

195
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,512
Was your great-great-grandfather not
Prince Hopyeong,

196
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,222
King Yeonjong's younger brother?

197
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,642
Then, why do you present
yourself in such a manner

198
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,811
when you are of royal descent?

199
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,731
Royal descent?
I am unworthy of such a title.

200
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,400
I am not even of a collateral line.

201
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,904
I am well aware you rely on the needlework
of your widowed mother to keep afloat

202
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,990
and for the past several years,

203
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:16,577
you failed to even pass the first round
of the civil service examination.

204
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,328
How did you--

205
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,873
If you just do as I say,

206
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,834
you will be able to leave
that outcast existence behind.

207
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,796
What do you say?

208
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,965
Will you do as I say?

209
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,640
You say there are
no evil spirits in this nation?

210
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,725
Yes, Your Majesty.

211
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:43,187
My grandmother repeatedly said that
to me in her lifetime.

212
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,230
What does that mean?

213
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,441
Is the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
not an evil spirit?

214
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:51,070
That evil spirit is responsible
for all the tragedies of the royal family.

215
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,363
How could there be no evil spirits?

216
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:57,117
It means no evil spirit commits evil deeds
unprovoked and without reason.

217
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,244
That is to say,

218
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,914
there are only
vengeful spirits with grudges

219
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,957
that commit evil deeds to resolve them.

220
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,250
Vengeful spirits?

221
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,628
Then, does that mean

222
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,006
if the grudge of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
is resolved,

223
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,758
it will be able to cross over?

224
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,259
That is correct.

225
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,554
So far, we have utilized
various ad hoc measures to banish it,

226
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,389
but none of them
offered a lasting solution.

227
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,558
It is because we were not applying
the right method.

228
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,851
The right method?

229
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,895
There is only one proper method.

230
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,107
We must expose the true identity
of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

231
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,859
and resolve its grudge.

232
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,569
But,

233
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,656
how will you expose its true identity?

234
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,866
The only thing we know about it

235
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,203
is that it was burned to death
to become an ember ghost.

236
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,580
Perhaps,

237
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,460
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost was
a military officer in its lifetime?

238
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,004
A military officer?

239
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,006
Why do you think that?

240
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,386
The combat skills Your Majesty displayed
while being possessed by it

241
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,138
were extraordinary.

242
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,694
A military officer…

243
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,280
Finding out its true identity

244
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,116
will be the first step
in the correct method to banish it.

245
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:24,621
I will search for any small clue
that may help reveal its true identity.

246
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,666
Proceed as such.

247
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,878
I shall do all I can to help.

248
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,465
That damn quack monk claimed
the luminous pearl had to be drained

249
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,426
for the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
to be banished.

250
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,929
Even if its true identity is exposed,

251
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,183
it will all be useless
without the luminous pearl.

252
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,394
Then, we shall now take our leave.

253
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,240
Hello?

254
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,415
Goodness. Why are you grabbing his hand?
Let us go.

255
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,626
All right.

256
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,254
What is with the hand-holding?

257
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,549
How grotesquely indecent!

258
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,634
Why that…

259
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,195
YOON GAP

260
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,817
My lord, are you all right?

261
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,028
Has he committed
another impropriety toward you?

262
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,034
Yoon Gap, you scoundrel…

263
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,246
What are you scheming?

264
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:37,337
We ask the Ten Kings of the Underworld
To aid the spirit

265
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,299
Of the late Grand Prince Yeongin
Born in the Year of the Earth Pig

266
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,968
Please grant his soul

267
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:49,057
Passage to the Pure Land
And rebirth in eternal peace

268
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,813
Homage to the First Great King Jingwang

269
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,357
We humbly plead with you
To relieve his grudge

270
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,484
Homage to the Second Great King Chogang

271
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,195
We humbly plead with you
To relieve his grudge

272
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,489
Homage to the Third Great King Songje

273
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,034
We humbly plead with you
To relieve his grudge

274
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,202
Homage to the Fourth Great King Ogwan

275
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,204
We humbly plead with you
To relieve his grudge

276
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,790
Homage to the Fifth Great King Yeomna

277
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,001
We humbly plead with you
To relieve his grudge

278
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,211
Homage to the Sixth Great King Byeonseong

279
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,838
We humbly plead with you
To relieve his grudge

280
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,549
Homage to the Seventh Great King Taesan

281
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,593
We humbly plead with you
To relieve his grudge…

282
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,428
Your Grace.

283
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,848
Today concludes
the Ceremony of Passage for the Deceased.

284
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,725
I am sure Prince Yeongin

285
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,436
has now peacefully crossed
the River of the Afterlife.

286
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,277
Your efforts are appreciated.

287
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,199
However, who was that young man earlier?

288
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,703
He was earnestly praying
for Prince Yeongin.

289
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,247
I did not recognize him at all.

290
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,334
He is Yi Hwa-seong,
great-great-grandson of Prince Hopyeong.

291
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,670
He was so heartbroken
to hear about Prince Yeongin's passing,

292
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:05,092
he personally made an ardent plea
to be a part of the ceremony.

293
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,886
Is that so?
Yes, Your Grace.

294
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,473
He has a pure mind
and conducts himself with integrity.

295
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,683
He appears to be
an excellent candidate to oversee

296
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,436
Prince Yeongin's memorial rites
since there is no living heir.

297
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:23,318
Ask him to come by the palace
to read me a book.

298
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,654
I must observe him more closely.

299
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,031
Yes, Your Grace.

300
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,158
I shall carry out your command.

301
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,677
Myeongdu, the mirror that reveals spirits.

302
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,721
I am certain Yeo-ri used this

303
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,808
to neutralize the talisman back then.

304
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,613
What are you doing here?

305
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,116
Nothing at all.

306
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,230
For some odd reason,

307
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,733
it seems Yoon Gap has kept silent
about yesterday's incident.

308
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,360
He is unusually quiet.

309
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,448
It seems he kept it from the King as well.

310
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,574
If he had reported it,

311
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,619
the King would not be this quiet.

312
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,038
I reinforced security, just in case.

313
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,874
Well done.

314
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,918
Keep an eye on him.

315
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,337
If you notice anything strange,

316
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,297
report back to me immediately.

317
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,424
Yes, my lord.

318
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,769
Is anyone out there?

319
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,070
Who are you?

320
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,335
How dare you show up here?

321
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,281
You damn rat! Die!

322
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,133
You damn scoundrel…

323
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,884
Please spare me.

324
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,304
I will grant you whatever you wish.

325
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,639
Just please…

326
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,849
There is only one thing I desire from you.

327
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,019
What is it?

328
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,564
Your life.

329
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,275
What?

330
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,653
Oh, there is one more thing.

331
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,322
At the very least,

332
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,283
you should apologize to Yoon Gap
who died by your hand.

333
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,661
I knew it.

334
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,288
You are not Yoon Gap.

335
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,291
So, you are…

336
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,598
What did you say?

337
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,768
The Minister of War
suddenly passed last night?

338
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,437
Yes, Your Majesty.

339
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,730
That is not possible.

340
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,440
He was in robust health.

341
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,608
How could he end up like that,
all of a sudden?

342
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,695
They say he passed in his sleep.

343
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,619
My lord…
He had already stopped breathing

344
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,788
when the maidservant
discovered him in the morning.

345
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,665
The Minister of War…

346
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,543
How could he die such a meaningless death?

347
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,837
This has been happening
quite frequently as of late.

348
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,006
Old vassals have been meeting

349
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,217
cruel and unnatural ends
in the dead of night.

350
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,930
Your Majesty, actually…

351
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,934
You may speak up.

352
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,063
I heard a rumor recently.

353
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:38,735
They say that an Imugi
has been going around

354
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,653
and devouring elderly noblemen.

355
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:42,697
Could this mean

356
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,950
Gangcheori was responsible?

357
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,744
Yoon Gap…

358
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,789
Did he kill the Minister of War?

359
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,667
That is utterly preposterous.

360
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,711
Who would believe such a thing?

361
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,131
No, no. I certainly do not
believe it to be true,

362
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,343
but I hear a lot of the noblemen
in the capital are seeking out

363
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,178
the noble elder of the blind association

364
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:08,389
to avoid unforeseen calamity.

365
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,267
I hear they believe carrying around
a talisman from him

366
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,853
is enough to keep them safe
from such misfortune.

367
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,271
Here we are again with him.

368
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,732
The noble elder of the blind association…

369
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,281
I cannot help but feel discordant.

370
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,952
For the past 13 years,
I mulled over the coup he instigated

371
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,872
and I have vowed to myself,
time and again,

372
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,042
to see that he is properly punished.

373
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,461
However, he just met
the most futile death.

374
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,506
Your Majesty.

375
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,883
Provide them with what they need
for the funeral

376
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,677
and follow protocol to process it.

377
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,554
Yes, Your Majesty.

378
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,514
I shall carry out your command.

379
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,198
Who are you and why were you
in the Queen Dowager's Palace?

380
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:12,954
Your Majesty.

381
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,331
I am the great-great-grandson
of Prince Hopyeong.

382
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,708
Yi Hwa-seong is my name.

383
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,334
Prince Hopyeong?

384
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,005
As in King Yeonjong's brother?

385
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,298
Yes, Your Majesty.

386
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,135
I came to the palace
because Her Grace summoned me.

387
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,387
I see.

388
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,055
You may leave now.

389
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,400
It appears the Queen Dowager
has chosen that sad excuse of a man

390
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,819
to replace Prince Yeongin.

391
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,501
Your Majesty, what is the matter?

392
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,610
Did I leave it like this last time?

393
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,036
My goodness, where is my head?

394
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,166
We are completely out of rice. Sheesh.

395
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,335
I will go and pick up some barley.

396
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,962
No, that is all right, Yeo-ri.

397
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,465
You worked hard to make that money
with your glasses. Save it.

398
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:51,052
And Gap is receiving
his three-month salary today.

399
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,222
It may not be much, but it is enough
to keep the three of us fed. Do not worry.

400
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,182
All right.

401
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,061
But why is that rascal not home yet?

402
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,813
I'm not sure.

403
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,941
He told me to go on ahead
because he needed to stop by somewhere.

404
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,025
Did he?

405
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,903
Gosh. I should at least
make some porridge.

406
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:22,000
Come on and take a look.
I will be generous with the servings.

407
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,501
Here.
Can you give me another?

408
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,919
Sure. Coming right up.

409
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,470
How much is one piece of pumpkin taffy?

410
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,597
Hello, sir. It is one pun per piece.

411
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,224
One… pun?

412
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,308
Yes, sir.

413
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,603
I thought this salary was meager at best,

414
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,523
but 15 nyang come out to 1,500 pun.

415
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,318
So, 1,500 pieces of pumpkin taffy!

416
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,571
Up until now, I had to suck up

417
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,614
an exorbitant amount
just for a few pieces.

418
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,201
Now, I can lavishly eat
ten pieces a day without worrying.

419
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,205
This must be why mortals
go so crazy for money.

420
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,586
How many would you like?

421
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,256
I will be right back. Stay put.

422
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,009
You must not sell out.
Yes, sir.

423
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,977
Welcome. Feel free to look around
as much as you wish.

424
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,604
I will take that pair.

425
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,523
Are you referring to these?

426
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,649
No.

427
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,360
The ones embroidered
with the longevity emblems.

428
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,283
These are quite pricey.

429
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,371
I just received my salary today.

430
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,165
How much could those possibly cost?

431
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,667
Yes, sir. I will wrap them up for you.

432
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,979
This is quite well-made.

433
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,314
I will take this, too.

434
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,525
Are you sure?

435
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,070
There you go again.
I told you I just got paid today.

436
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,282
I can even buy 1,500 pieces
of pumpkin taffy if I wish. That I can.

437
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,118
Yes, sir.

438
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,830
It feels like I have been swindled.

439
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,915
How could I

440
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,459
only be left with enough
to buy five pieces of taffy?

441
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,506
Why are maidens' shoes
and hairpins so expensive?

442
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,428
Master, I told you.
We need to go that way.

443
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,514
We were just there.
What is this now?

444
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,099
Is that Gaseop?

445
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,434
What is that rascal doing here?

446
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,936
No, we need to…

447
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,191
Master, wait!
Damn it.

448
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,944
Wait, stop!

449
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:57,196
No. Stop. Goodness me!

450
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,663
What is going on?
Why is that wretched monk in the capital?

451
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,124
Sheesh! You scared me.

452
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,001
Why are you alone?

453
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,003
Where is the giant?

454
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,671
Give me some, too.

455
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,381
Give you what?

456
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,968
How did you even know?

457
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,442
Got… you!

458
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,360
What the… Where did you pop up from?

459
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,612
Let go of me.

460
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,280
Damn quack monk.

461
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,038
Gosh, am I happy to see you!

462
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,541
Do you know how many times I circled
the capital looking for your house?

463
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,792
Master.

464
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,338
We will not be sleeping
on the streets tonight!

465
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,258
It is so nice to see you. Just delightful.

466
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:03,012
Stop smiling! Stop laughing! Damn it.

467
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,560
We have finally arrived.

468
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,520
Venerable!

469
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,482
What brings you here?
When did you arrive in the capital?

470
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,360
I came because I had
something to give you.

471
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,279
You do not know how many hardships

472
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,491
we have been through in the last few days
looking for this house.

473
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,326
I see. Come inside.

474
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,454
My goodness! Look who it is!
Hello, Venerable!

475
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,706
Hello, Venerable! Have you been well?

476
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,710
My goodness. I am so happy to see you two.
It feels like a holiday.

477
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,213
I apologize for imposing.

478
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,923
Do not be silly.

479
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,424
Gap actually got paid today.

480
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,510
We'll be able to show you
some proper hospitality.

481
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,222
Excellent. Let us go inside, Master.

482
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,391
This way.
All right.

483
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,937
So…

484
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,107
you just spent every last bit

485
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,987
of your three-month salary to buy this?

486
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,115
Well…

487
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,326
I was sick and tired of looking at that.

488
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,328
Sick and tired?

489
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,831
Why, you scoundrel!

490
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,376
Look at you spewing nonsense
like a damn fool.

491
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,253
Just look at you go!

492
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,879
I cannot believe you!

493
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,464
Ma'am, please try to calm down.

494
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:24,593
Master, it seems we chose
the wrong day to come.

495
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,512
Yes. Calm down.

496
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,723
How dare you touch me?
"Calm down"?

497
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,976
And what happens if I do not?
What are you going to do about it?

498
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,352
Ah! Hot!

499
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,563
My goodness.

500
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,401
Oh, no. What is wrong?

501
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,695
That's right!

502
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:46,365
I forgot I came
all this way to deliver this.

503
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,327
I can be so scatterbrained.

504
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,246
Here we go.

505
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:53,748
That is--

506
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,999
The Ghostbane Stone.

507
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,960
That is my Ghostbane Stone.

508
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,966
No!

509
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,262
I thought I lost it for good.

510
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,847
How did you find it?

511
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,016
Well, you see…

512
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,394
All right.

513
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,105
Stop!

514
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,190
Yes, Master.

515
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,029
Master?

516
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,242
What sort of monk looks at fish like that?

517
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,622
Master, let us go now.

518
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,832
You can just take it.
Pardon?

519
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,210
I cannot sell it
with that busted belly anyway.

520
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,212
No, that will not be necessary.

521
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,755
What would we do with fish?

522
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,216
Master, let us…

523
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,743
Great Shaman Neop-deok
claimed that she first discovered

524
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,038
the set of male and female
Ghostbane Stones

525
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,208
under a boulder by the sea,
a long time ago.

526
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,295
With that story, she also told me

527
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,674
that the Ghostbane Stones
have mystical powers

528
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,760
and that they always find
their way back to their owners.

529
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,391
This all happened
because that laudable object

530
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,394
was intent on finding its way back to you.

531
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,689
My goodness. Is that stone that precious?

532
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,982
What exactly is it?

533
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,777
This is called a Ghostbane Stone.

534
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,947
It wards off ghosts.

535
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,407
Gosh, it even wards off ghosts?

536
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,077
My goodness, what a marvelous object.

537
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,872
Look at this.
This apparently wards off ghosts.

538
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,582
Get that away from me.

539
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:00,749
Please be careful.

540
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,877
Careful… My goodness.

541
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,421
Is it not amazing?
Get it away from me!

542
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,512
You knew about this…

543
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,640
from the start, did you not?

544
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,852
That the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
killed my grandma.

545
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,233
You see, Yeo-ri…

546
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,279
When I think back on it now,
there were so many clues.

547
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:34,074
I went to see you
to get rid of Gangcheori,

548
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,952
but you taught me
a recitation ceremony for evil spirits

549
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,663
and had me repeatedly review all the ways

550
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:43,375
my grandma used to ward off ghosts
throughout her life.

551
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,672
All the pieces were there.

552
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,549
What a fool I was.

553
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,720
Thirteen years ago,

554
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,265
the reigning Queen Dowager

555
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,644
summoned me to banish
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

556
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,853
However,

557
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,773
I was no match for it.

558
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,107
So,

559
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,360
I asked Great Shaman Neop-deok

560
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,905
to come with me to the capital.

561
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,658
I am largely to blame for what happened

562
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,536
to Great Shaman Neop-deok.

563
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,956
I kept this from you because--

564
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,500
You must have been afraid
that I would rashly confront

565
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,294
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

566
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,381
Yeo-ri--
Venerable.

567
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,676
I am not that little girl anymore.

568
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,220
My grandmother is being
held captive by that ghost.

569
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,726
I will catch the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

570
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,234
The blind association?

571
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,486
That Haeilbu talisman

572
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,948
was crafted for the noblemen by Pung-san,
the association's noble elder.

573
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,741
A mere blind fortune teller

574
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,661
managed to craft a talisman
with that much mystic force?

575
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,538
So? Have you met him yet?

576
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:05,040
I tried to get close
to that Pung-san scoundrel,

577
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,918
but I did not get very far
because of the strong fire energy.

578
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,254
Fire energy…

579
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,298
You know, that myeongdu…

580
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,341
came in quite handy.

581
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,094
I will have no issue
setting my feast table if I have that.

582
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,807
I will be very happy for you
on your ascension day.

583
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,810
Your ascension will give me hope.

584
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,521
I will continue to actively support you.

585
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,316
Gangcheori…

586
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,443
However,

587
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,361
do not tell Yeo-ri.

588
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,071
Why?

589
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,616
She will not understand.

590
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,410
She is a mortal.

591
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,037
Damn it.

592
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,894
Why are you not sleeping?

593
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,022
I could not, even if I wanted to.

594
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,233
The thunderous roars are deafening.

595
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,069
They must be tired.

596
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,071
It sounded like they had quite a journey.

597
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,239
And what about you?

598
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,533
Why are you up?

599
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,201
I just… am.

600
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,997
Yoon Gap's mother grinds her teeth,
does she not?

601
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,128
She rolls over once every hour,
then flings a leg on you.

602
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,634
Stop it. She will hear you.

603
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:25,389
I gave them to you to wear, not cuddle.

604
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,100
I was just briefly admiring them
for their beauty.

605
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,187
How could someone like me
ever put such expensive shoes on my feet?

606
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,232
They will need
to be returned for a refund.

607
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,609
You are going to get
a refund for the gift I gave you?

608
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,904
What choice do I have?
Think of all the mouths we have to feed.

609
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:47,202
I went out of my way to get them
because I saw you gawk at that embroidery.

610
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,665
What are you talking about?
When did I ever do that?

611
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:52,875
Last summer,

612
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,711
when you went to go sell glasses
to Scholar Park, one village over.

613
00:45:56,545 --> 00:46:00,090
Did you think I did not notice
you gawking at the embroidery

614
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,300
on his daughter's shoes?

615
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,012
I was just admiring how
the sun, moon, mountains, and trees

616
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:08,724
all managed to fit so harmoniously
on those small shoes.

617
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,647
You were truly…

618
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,984
always by my side.

619
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,451
I thought I was completely alone
for all those years.

620
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,037
I was quite a fool.

621
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,873
Yes. A big fool.

622
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,086
I will…

623
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,714
expose that ghost's identity
and have it cross over as soon as I can.

624
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,926
So I can save

625
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,221
my grandma's soul

626
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,473
and Lord Yoon Gap's as well.

627
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,772
And after you save Yoon Gap?

628
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,733
You might…

629
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,153
have to leave that body.

630
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,241
But,

631
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,201
even without a physical body,

632
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:11,662
you will still be Gangcheori

633
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,499
and I will wholeheartedly serve you
as my patron deity.

634
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,710
That will be my way

635
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,130
of thanking you for protecting me
all those years…

636
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,553
and honoring my heart

637
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,389
that yearned for you.

638
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:53,996
So hot!

639
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,163
What's wrong?

640
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,333
Do you… have the Ghostbane Stone?

641
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,045
Oh, right. This is like poison to you.

642
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,714
Should I set it aside for now?

643
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,928
Set it aside… to do what?

644
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,431
I mean, I was not trying to,

645
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,974
but you were…

646
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,356
Ghostbane Stone!

647
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,868
That is the blind fortune teller
I met last time.

648
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,039
This path leads
to the Queen Dowager's Palace.

649
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,498
That means…

650
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,293
He is the noble elder
of the blind association?

651
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:43,795
Hello again.

652
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,673
Huh? Who is it?

653
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,718
I am the Royal Couturier's
eyeglass artisan you met last time.

654
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,556
You are that young maiden

655
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,725
with the extraordinary aura.

656
00:48:56,808 --> 00:49:00,479
He just looks like
a normal blind fortune teller.

657
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:02,481
Take care. Please excuse me.

658
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,862
You can craft implements
that clear up one's sight,

659
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:13,283
but can you not make anything for a blind
man like me to make my eyes open wide?

660
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,329
Forgive me, my talents remain lacking.

661
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,629
I do not know his name.

662
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,756
It was a eunuch with scary eyes.

663
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,342
His fingertips were black.

664
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,930
It is him.

665
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,723
He is the Yapper.

666
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,267
I must let His Majesty know immediately.

667
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,645
Pardon me, I must go now.

668
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:46,775
Se-won.

669
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,652
Is there anyone watching us?

670
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,948
There is not even an ant in sight.

671
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,158
How fortunate.

672
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,374
Your Majesty!

673
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,584
You were correct!

674
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,170
Your Majesty was correct indeed!

675
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,507
As you commanded, I reviewed
the exhaustive roster of royal relatives,

676
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,844
covering both direct
and collateral descendants,

677
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:17,347
who have passed away in the last 13 years.

678
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,349
Please take a look at this.

679
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:33,739
Did you have me come here this early
to look at a measly piece of paper?

680
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,282
Why you…

681
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,035
It is not some measly piece of paper.

682
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,746
It is the royal family tree.

683
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:42,998
Royal family tree?

684
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:47,711
For over ten years, many royal relatives
met their sudden deaths.

685
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:51,256
Only after I started to believe in the
Eight-foot-tall Ghost by you and Yeo-ri,

686
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,049
was I able to confirm

687
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,302
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
was behind their deaths.

688
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,095
So?

689
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,556
Yesterday, I met a man
by the name of Yi Hwa-seong

690
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,142
who claimed to be
a distant, collateral royal relative.

691
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,896
Which means the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

692
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:09,441
did not target its victims
just because they had royal blood.

693
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,942
Yes.
Then…

694
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,696
looking at the victims of the Eight-
foot-tall Ghost for the past 13 years,

695
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:18,909
we will discover who was responsible
for its grudge.

696
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,792
Your Majesty, it is Sang-deuk.

697
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,835
Yes. Enter.

698
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,759
Why do you come alone?

699
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,427
I told you to fetch Yeo-ri.

700
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,429
Well…

701
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,349
Eyeglass Artisan Yeo-ri
was not at the Royal Couturier.

702
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,017
They said she just left.

703
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,978
However, I did not find her
after searching the vicinity.

704
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,898
What?
Did you see anyone suspicious?

705
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,942
No, Your Majesty.

706
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:55,320
And the Queen Dowager has been quiet?

707
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,863
The Queen Dowager has summoned

708
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,783
a blind fortune teller
for a recitation ceremony of sutras.

709
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:16,758
What are you doing?

710
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,915
I tried to get close
to that Pung-san scoundrel,

711
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,877
but I did not get very far
because of the strong fire energy.

712
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,212
Yeo-ri!

713
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,593
Celestial Venerable speaks
Of the nine spirits in the body

714
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,636
Shall we summon them?
On the first day, Heaven-born

715
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,513
On the second day, Lightless
On the third day, Dark Pearl

716
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,599
On the fourth day, True Center
On the fifth day, Crimson Child

717
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,517
On the sixth day, Returning Cycles
On the seventh day, Crimson Origin

718
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,019
On the eighth day…
Your Grace.

719
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,730
His Majesty is here for you.

720
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:12,898
What?

721
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,160
Your Majesty, welcome.

722
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,413
You may leave us, Noble Elder.

723
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,707
Yes, Your Grace.

724
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:31,791
No.

725
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,668
Take a seat.

726
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,921
Pardon?

727
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:41,426
I hear you led Prince Yeongin's
Ceremony of Passage for the Deceased.

728
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,304
I am grateful.

729
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,183
Thanks to you,
Yeongin's bitter sorrow was relieved

730
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:51,728
and I am now able to wipe away
Her Grace's tears.

731
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,146
Your Majesty.

732
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,565
I am truly honored.

733
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,400
Your Grace.

734
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,445
I wish to reward him handsomely.

735
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,322
What do you say?

736
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,491
He is a lowly creature.

737
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,619
His talents can be useful at times,

738
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,039
but he does not deserve your attention.

739
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,248
Not at all.

740
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,211
I feel sorry
for misunderstanding him in the past

741
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:19,089
and I should be thankful
for all the effort he has shown

742
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:21,174
in always providing Her Grace with solace.

743
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,300
Your Majesty.

744
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,720
For what reason do you--

745
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,806
Yes, that will be best.

746
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,934
I shall personally make my way
to the Association of the Blind

747
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,103
and publicly commend you
for your contribution

748
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,854
for all to see.

749
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,191
Your Majesty,
our quarters are much too squalid

750
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,986
to welcome the exalted sovereign
of this nation.

751
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,487
Not at all.

752
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:44,864
The Association of the Blind

753
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:48,159
is a meaningful institution that has long
been a safe haven for the forlorn blind.

754
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,496
But I am curious

755
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,833
as to how you made your way here alone

756
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,627
when you are not able to see
what is in front of you.

757
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,005
Where is your servant?

758
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,259
Could he have figured out
what we did with that brat?

759
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,302
Pung-san is extraordinary.

760
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:09,889
Making his way to the palace alone
is no trouble for him at all.

761
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,599
Hence,

762
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,561
that is why I so greatly value
his talents.

763
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,148
I see.

764
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:55,810
What is that?

765
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,520
It is fine abrasive sand.

766
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:00,190
Sand used to polish corrective lenses.

767
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:02,901
It belongs to Yeo-ri.

768
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,699
This leads to the drainage gate.

769
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,660
Once you pass the drainage gate,
the Association of the Blind is nearby.

770
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:14,746
Someone…

771
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,249
dragged Yeo-ri out of the palace.

772
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,544
Yeo-ri!

773
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,296
Yeo-ri!

774
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,132
You cannot just enter like that.

775
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,301
The noble elder is not here right now--

776
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,470
Where is she?

777
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,055
What did you do with her?

778
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,349
Why are you doing this to me?

779
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,558
My goodness…

780
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,644
I don't know what you are talking about.

781
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,148
What do you think you are doing?

782
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:44,692
My goodness.

783
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,486
What is the meaning of this?

784
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:51,241
I may just be a lowly blind man,
but this is unacceptable.

785
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,868
Where is Yeo-ri?

786
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,703
Who is Yeo-ri? Why are you doing this?

787
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,498
I am the only lowly creature
who resides in this chamber.

788
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,834
That is enough.

789
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,210
He is protected by the Queen Dowager.

790
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,428
I have already searched
every corner of this place.

791
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,890
There was nowhere to hide someone.
So, please…

792
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:21,372
Yeo-ri!

793
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,838
Yeo-ri! Where are you?

794
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:32,842
My goodness.

795
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,302
What did you do with her?

796
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:35,845
Where is she?

797
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,013
Please spare me.

798
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:40,016
I am just a lowly blind man
who knows nothing.

799
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,100
Please spare me.

800
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,562
A lowly blind man who knows nothing?

801
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,816
Then, explain why this shrine
is overflowing with potent fire energy.

802
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,319
You are the Yapper.

803
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,696
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost is behind you!

804
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,836
You…

805
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,026
Go and tell the King.

806
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,611
Go on!

807
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:39,450
Why…

808
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,205
do you attack me?

809
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,332
I saw it.

810
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:49,085
On the day I was born 100 years ago,

811
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,088
I saw you fall to the ground.

812
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,257
Then, why?

813
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,634
Why do you attack me and not them?

814
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,345
What sort of nonsense are you spewing?

815
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,140
I am not your foe.

816
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,518
The King's royal bloodline is.

817
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:07,895
Then, why?

818
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,815
Why do you attack me?

819
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:09,707
It is odd that the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
just disappeared like that.

820
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,376
Where is Pung-san's shrine?

821
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,002
Reveal yourself this instant!

822
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,798
He was really born the day
you fell to the ground?

823
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:19,217
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost's grudge
must be against him.

824
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,094
I shall go to Yongdam Village in ten days.

825
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:24,389
I will expose the true identity
of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

826
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,557
I no longer need the Ghostbane Stone.

827
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,559
You are my protector now.

828
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,937
You have strayed too far
from Gangcheori the Imugi.

829
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,271
All because of that brat, Yeo-ri.

830
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,857
Just hand over that brat named Yeo-ri.

831
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,526
I am sorry, but please die here and now.

832
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:41,614
