1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,920
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,420
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES

3
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,310
<i>He is not here.</i>

4
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,400
<i>He is nowhere near this house.</i>

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,030
<i>Where in the world did Gangcheori go?</i>

6
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,530
You had that terrible fever
through the night.

7
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,040
Take the day off.
Must you go to the palace today?

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,210
The nation will not fall
just because you are absent.

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,630
You should stay with me a bit longer.

10
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,500
I must see His Majesty.

11
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,960
Yeo-ri, let us go.

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,880
Yes, my lord.

13
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,880
I shall be off, Mother.

14
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,510
All right.

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,020
Gosh. That really is my Gap.

16
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,610
That is him, all right.

17
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,990
<i>I cannot believe this.</i>

18
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,950
<i>It really is Lord Yoon Gap.</i>

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,870
<i>The look in his eyes is different.</i>

20
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,380
<i>This is what I have been praying for.</i>

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,750
<i>Lord Yoon Gap has truly returned.</i>

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,930
Yeo-ri.

23
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,970
Thank you.

24
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,430
Pardon? For what?

25
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,640
You looked after my mother

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,890
and kept my body safe.

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,100
That was…

28
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,020
not my doing.

29
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,650
Yes. He was responsible.

30
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,570
The malevolent deity
named Gangcheori, was it?

31
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,700
My lord, how did this happen?

32
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,330
You were held captive
by the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

33
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,870
How…

34
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,450
I do not know, either.

35
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,420
The realm beyond life
was hazy and obscured.

36
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,920
I found it difficult to think clearly.

37
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,090
However…

38
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,010
there is something I am certain of.

39
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,510
And what might that be?

40
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,060
I have come back…

41
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,060
because there was
something I needed to tell you.

42
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,110
Back then,

43
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,070
I felt a great sense of urgency

44
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,450
after seeing the royal family
on the verge of peril

45
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,660
and His Majesty suffering so.

46
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,780
I was planning to tell you

47
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,040
everything after we arrived
at the Capital.

48
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,290
I… deceived you.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,080
I pushed you into danger
with the Eight-foot-tall Ghost.

50
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,710
I am sorry, Yeo-ri.

51
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,430
Perhaps…

52
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,640
I tried so hard to save you

53
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,310
because I wanted
to hear you say such words to me.

54
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,730
I am very happy…

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,810
to have you back, my lord.

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,920
This…

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,420
is not mine.

58
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,260
That…

59
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,720
was intended for another.

60
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,270
I see.

61
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,800
Your Majesty,

62
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,100
please forgive this unfaithful servant.

63
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,600
I offer you my delayed greetings

64
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,600
after I failed to obey your royal command.

65
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,490
He is indeed Examiner Yoon Gap.

66
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,990
What are you saying?

67
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,820
Are you saying he is
no longer Gangcheori the Imugi,

68
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,080
and has reverted back to Examiner Yoon Gap

69
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,040
just like that?

70
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,160
Yes.

71
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,420
Yoon Gap…

72
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,250
has returned?

73
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,420
Your Majesty.

74
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,630
I longed to offer up my futile existence

75
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,010
to become kindling in your honor
to lend Your Majesty my meager support,

76
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,640
but I failed to do so.

77
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,190
You really are…

78
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,520
Yoon Gap.

79
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,780
The Yoon Gap that I cherished so…

80
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,830
has returned to me.

81
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:41,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

82
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,460
It is I.

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,090
Your unfaithful servant…

84
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,670
has finally returned.

85
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,260
Gap.

86
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,560
Are you okay, Your Majesty?

87
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,020
My goodness, Your Majesty!

88
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,350
My reaction was delayed

89
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,020
because his acts of insolence
have been so frequent as of late.

90
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,440
Such insolence!

91
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,150
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

92
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,990
As soon as I felt your royal frame,

93
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,320
I experienced unbearable pain.

94
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,160
Thus…

95
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,490
What do you mean?

96
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,290
Your Majesty, it is because
of the Ghostbane Stone.

97
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,870
Ghostbane Stone…

98
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,010
This is it.

99
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,720
It is a stone that wards off ghosts.

100
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,810
I learned about it, thanks to Yeo-ri.

101
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,100
I hear this Ghostbane Stone
of the Dragon King

102
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,440
is what kept me safe

103
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,560
from the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
all these years.

104
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,480
Ghostbane Stone…

105
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,900
Stone of the Dragon King…

106
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,070
So it was because of that…

107
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,080
But did you not say
this Ghostbane Stone warded off ghosts?

108
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,340
Then, why is it having an effect
on Yoon Gap who is alive and well?

109
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,590
The soul of the deceased
has returned to the body,

110
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,680
but this body
has already experienced death once.

111
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,470
Thus,

112
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,010
that is why he cannot
approach the Ghostbane Stone.

113
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,730
Regardless, I remain delighted
by your return.

114
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,070
You lost your life while carrying out
my royal command.

115
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,320
You must have experienced such sorrow.

116
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,490
I have felt sorry…

117
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,710
time and time again.

118
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,370
Your Majesty.

119
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,270
What do you think
of the finalized state-owned slave reform?

120
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,560
Your Majesty.

121
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,150
I am truly in awe.

122
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,860
You supplemented with commoners to counter

123
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,360
the bureaus' slave labor deficit,
voiding the distinction of slaves.

124
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,370
Your Majesty has faithfully acted
in the best interest of the people.

125
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,450
Now that the opponents
of the reform have been subdued,

126
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,500
you <i>will</i> forge this into reality.

127
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,120
Do you truly believe that?

128
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,970
<i>You will achieve</i>
<i>that noble pursuit you seek.</i>

130
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,010
<i>After all,</i>

131
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,060
you are one of those mortals

132
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,650
I come across occasionally.

133
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,650
That damn Imugi rascal…

134
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,960
Without you around,

135
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,130
His Majesty experienced
all sorts of discomfort.

136
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,800
You will inevitably be weary
of public scrutiny for a while.

137
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,890
Rumors of your insanity
ran rampant in the palace.

138
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,680
By the way,
are you sure you will be all right?

139
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,350
Your body has found a new master overnight

140
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,940
and I heard you had
a fever through the night.

141
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,940
His Majesty also said
you should not overexert yourself.

142
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,690
I am all right.

143
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,740
Thank you, Head Eunuch.

144
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,880
Right, I am the Head Eunuch…

145
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,090
Maybe I should go to the courtesan house
for some grilled abalones tonight?

146
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,680
He could have said goodbye before leaving.

147
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,050
That rotten Imugi scoundrel…

148
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,100
You cannot hear me, right?

149
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,270
Can I get a "Grilled Abalone"?

150
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,960
<i>Eight-foot-tall Ghost…</i>

151
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,500
<i>This must be your doing.</i>

152
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,900
<i>Let harmonious energy arrive soundly</i>
<i>From east to west</i>

153
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,900
<i>If evil energy exists</i>
<i>Let it be released to the west</i>

154
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,080
All better?

155
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,170
I called you here to stop your pain.

156
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:27,970
You are…

157
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,890
that wicked spirit's lackey.

158
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,010
I have nothing to say to you.

159
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,640
How does it feel to reclaim
your once stolen body?

160
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,900
Do you not feel a surge of resentment
over the things you had lost?

161
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,780
That body will not remain yours.

162
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,360
It will not last long.

163
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,080
Pour this on the King's Ghostbane Stone.

164
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,830
If you do,

165
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,620
the Warrior Deity will ensure
you keep that body for good.

166
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,710
What happens…

167
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,130
if I pour that over the Ghostbane Stone?

168
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,920
What will happen to His Majesty?

169
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,720
Why would you ask
about such useless things?

170
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,510
Just do as you are told
and that body will be yours forever.

171
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,550
As if I would fall for your tricks.

172
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,010
I would rather choose

173
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,510
to be a pile of ashes
than put His Majesty in harm's way.

174
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,140
Have you not found him yet?

175
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,770
No.

176
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,690
I thought he would be
at the creek he frequented,

177
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,480
but he was not there, either.

178
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,830
The soul of a deceased man returning
to his body is strange enough as it is.

179
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,250
And now that once virile creature
has suddenly gone missing.

180
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,460
It seems something is definitely going on.

181
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,090
There is no way Gangcheori
would back down so easily.

182
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,380
His feelings for you ran deep.

183
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:33,840
I am afraid.

184
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,010
I am so afraid that Gangcheori will

185
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,560
also end up like Bibi.

186
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,700
- Mother.
- Yes?

187
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,620
You must be tired. You should go and rest.

188
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,740
I'm not tired at all.

189
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,200
I've been full of energy all day.
I cannot sleep.

190
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,750
Mother.

191
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,500
I will go to my room soon.

192
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,210
I will…

193
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,300
I am just worried you might leave me again

194
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,630
while I sleep.

195
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,840
You should go to sleep.

196
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,760
Let me look at you a bit longer. Lie down.

197
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,690
That body will not remain yours.

198
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,570
It will not last long.

199
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,480
<i>You call yourself a patron deity?</i>

200
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,520
<i>How could you just abandon</i>
<i>your disciple and disappear like this?</i>

201
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,520
<i>You wretched, malevolent deity.</i>

202
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,070
<i>Fine. It is my time to be reckless now.</i>

203
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,910
<i>So, hurry up and come here to scold me.</i>

204
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,740
<i>Come and yell at me</i>

205
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,290
<i>for daring to use such a tone</i>
<i>with my sacred patron deity.</i>

206
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,000
<i>Even if you successfully save his soul</i>
<i>and bring him back to life,</i>

207
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,880
<i>nothing will change</i>
<i>until I ascend as a dragon.</i>

208
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,590
Even if you ardently hold him
in your heart,

209
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,550
I will never…

210
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,430
let you go.

211
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,140
<i>What happened to never letting me go?</i>

212
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,980
<i>You vanished without a word.</i>

213
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
<i>What do I do now?</i>

214
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,510
<i>Yeo-ri.</i>

215
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,350
Yeo-ri.

216
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,560
I am right here.

217
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,990
Damn Yoon Gap.

218
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,360
Release me at once.

219
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,660
Let me go.

220
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
No. You cannot go.

221
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,590
I cannot let you go to Yeo-ri.

222
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,970
I will not let you take her from me.

223
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,930
Let go of me already.

224
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,430
Yeo-ri is calling out for me.

225
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,810
Gangcheori.

226
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,020
I will never let you go.

227
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,610
I need to go!

228
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,900
You cannot!

229
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,230
Why can I not?

230
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,240
- Yeo-ri!
- What?

231
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,950
Gangcheori?

232
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,330
No, Yeo-ri.

233
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,040
It is I.

234
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,540
My lord.

235
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,500
This rascal is really something else…

236
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,890
It is my body. It belongs to me.

237
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,180
You may not move it as you wish.

238
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,850
<i>Gangcheori has been</i>
<i>in that body with His Lord?</i>

239
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,060
<i>How did this happen?</i>

240
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,570
How can you just claim
someone else's body like this?

241
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,780
Leave… my body at once!

242
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,660
Damn it.
I would have left it ages ago if I could.

243
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,620
Do you think I want to be stuck
in this wimpy, little body?

244
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,540
Did you think I would not know
you used this hand

245
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,330
to grab Yeo-ri's hand?

246
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,130
Well… I could not grab it with a foot.

247
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,920
A scholar must maintain
a pure and chaste demeanor.

248
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,340
You rascal have made
rags of all my clothes.

249
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,260
You consumed so many sweets.

250
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,890
You ruined my teeth,
just after a few months.

251
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,470
"Your body, hair, and skin
are a gift from your parents."

252
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,600
You have abused my parents' gift.

253
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,520
How dare you act so brazen?

254
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,770
Did you hear him?

255
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,770
He should be thanking me
for stopping his body from rotting.

256
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,150
What a pompous prig he is.
Just prattling on and on.

257
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,700
Prattle, prattle.

258
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,160
Enough.

259
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,120
Yeo-ri.

260
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,250
That was not meant for you, my lord.

261
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,710
Anyhow, you should stop it
as well, my lord.

262
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,460
This is not the time for quarreling.

263
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,880
Yeo-ri is right.

264
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,630
There is no way that dogged, wicked spirit
let you free for no reason.

265
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,260
What is he scheming?

266
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,480
My lord?

267
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,690
You were just prattling on
without any issue before.

268
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,110
Why are you suddenly silent like a mouse?

269
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
You…

270
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,200
What are you scheming right now?

271
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,550
That damn Imugi.

272
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,720
I thought he would easily hold out
for a few days.

273
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,470
But that damn Imugi was awakened already.

274
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,950
Gangcheori.

275
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,070
Gangcheori!

276
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,170
<i>Gangcheori and Lord Yoon Gap</i>
<i>are trapped in one body together.</i>

277
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,220
<i>How is this even possible?</i>

278
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,050
<i>The Eight-foot-tall Ghost</i>
<i>must be behind this.</i>

279
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,310
<i>It feels like he is using my lord</i>
<i>to plot something.</i>

280
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,730
<i>What should I do?</i>

281
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,270
That damn Imugi rascal…

282
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,120
Stop…

283
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,330
Stop it.

284
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,000
This is not mine.

285
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,000
That…

286
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,300
was intended for another.

287
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,410
<i>Nothing could have happened overnight…</i>

288
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,130
My goodness.

289
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,260
It appears our Gap is really back indeed.

290
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,180
Look at how neatly he folded his bedding.

291
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,810
Gap was always like this before.

292
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,730
He was only messy after he lost his mind.

293
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,140
He has always been this orderly.

294
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,650
<i>The Ghostbane Stone…</i>

295
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,900
What is wrong, Yeo-ri?

296
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,660
You're as pale as a ghost.

297
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,870
<i>His Lord wants the Ghostbane Stone?</i>

298
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,830
<i>Is it the Eight-foot-tall Ghost?</i>

299
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,660
My goodness.

300
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,040
What's wrong, Yeo-ri?

301
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,050
SINBU: A PASS FOR THE PALACE

302
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,190
<i>My lord, you cannot.</i>

303
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,400
- My goodness!
- I am sorry.

304
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
You should watch where you are going!

305
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,440
<i>My lord…</i>

306
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,570
My goodness, what am I going to do now?

307
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,960
Your Majesty, what are you writing?

308
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,170
I was struck with an excellent idea

309
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,590
after hearing your thoughts
on the slave reform plans yesterday.

310
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,380
Step up here for a moment.

311
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,150
Here. Take a look.

312
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,030
I am honored to have you record
my humble opinion in such a manner.

313
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,330
I am most obliged.

314
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,420
I have been struck with another one.

315
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,670
Goodness me.

316
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,430
Yeo-ri insisted with such zeal

317
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,470
that I keep this with me at all times,
so I have.

318
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:29,270
But it is just impossible
to get any writing done with it.

319
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,900
<i>My lord.</i>

320
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,450
<i>Please.</i>

321
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,120
Yes, so if we proceed as such,

322
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,000
the people do not need to worry
about being implicated as slaves

323
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,840
and public sentiment toward the king
waning will not be a concern.

324
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,300
Both the state and private domains
will be content.

325
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,890
<i>No!</i>

326
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,720
Be careful, Your Majesty.

327
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,890
The bottle has completely shattered.

328
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,390
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

329
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,900
Are you all right?

330
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,110
Damn it.

331
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,200
My goodness.

332
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,110
Sure.

333
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,510
What in the world is this?

334
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,800
Is this alcohol?

335
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,970
Sang-deuk!

336
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,770
- Hurry. This bottle shattered.
- Yes, my lord.

337
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,900
Stop right there!

338
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Please let me take care of it!

339
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,330
My lord?

340
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,290
Gangcheori!

341
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,180
My lord.

342
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,180
Stay back, Yeo-ri.

343
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,680
Do not look at me.

344
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,100
Unbeknownst to me,

345
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,570
I grew resentful of my stolen life
and my heart grew wicked.

346
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,190
I fell for his ruse.

347
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,070
He said my body would be mine if I spilled
alcohol on the Ghostbane Stone.

348
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,120
I let my heart grow beastly.

349
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,660
You are wrong.

350
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,300
I was not the one who grabbed your hand
in that last moment.

351
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,550
It was you.

352
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,470
<i>No!</i>

353
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,220
You…

354
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,640
did not let your heart grow wicked.

355
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,810
It does not change the fact
I was initially willing

356
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,730
to do that to His Majesty.

357
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,650
I…

358
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,900
tried to harm His Majesty.

359
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,740
If I continue,

360
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,740
I will end up betraying His Majesty

361
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,790
and become a sinner condemned by history

362
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,790
The Eight-foot-tall Ghost
has me by the throat

363
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,210
and we do not know
how he will use me next time.

364
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,040
Before…

365
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,210
I become a detestable, evil spirit,

366
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,840
you must let me go.

367
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,010
Yeo-ri.

368
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,060
Please guide me to the afterlife.

369
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,100
My lord.

370
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,370
That moron.

371
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,920
I offer him a chance to reclaim his body
for good and he still refuses.

372
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,550
But it does not matter.

373
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,970
Things have gotten a bit messy,

374
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:16,510
but now we know the Ghostbane Stone
was what was in the Warrior Deity's way.

375
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,430
Getting rid of that will be a breeze.

376
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,320
My goodness. You are home early today.

377
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,070
The food is all done. Hurry and wash up.

378
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,570
Gap.

379
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,910
Why…

380
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,370
are you here?

381
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,040
What happened to my Gap?

382
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,000
Why are you back?

383
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,760
Yeo-ri.

384
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,300
This is not my Gap.

385
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,810
He is not my Gap!

386
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,310
Where is my Gap? Why are you back?

387
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,230
What did you do to my poor boy?
Why are you back here?

388
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,320
My poor Gap… My son…

389
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,910
Please return my Gap to me.

390
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,830
Please return him to me.

391
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,000
Please return my Gap to me.
Please, I beg you.

392
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,220
I am sorry, Mother.

393
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,840
Where did my Gap go?

394
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,010
I am truly sorry.

395
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,680
My Gap! Give me back my son!

396
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,730
Return him to me. Please…

397
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,780
<i>An ablution rite.</i>

398
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,030
<i>A ceremony that cleanses the soul.</i>

399
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,290
<i>Through this ceremony, Lord Yoon Gap…</i>

400
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,460
<i>will wash away</i>

401
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,130
<i>all the karma from his lifetime.</i>

402
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,510
The spirit of the deceased Yoon Gap
we wish to guide today.

403
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,590
Of all endeavors to cleanse
the three karmic deeds,

404
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,640
nothing exceeds
the purification of the heart

405
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,310
and when it comes
to the purification of all things,

406
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:13,100
nothing compares to pure water.

407
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,410
<i>In accordance with</i>
<i>The sacred law of the Buddha</i>

408
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,830
<i>The ritual altar of ablution</i>
<i>Has been prepared</i>

409
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,910
<i>May the soul of the deceased Yoon Gap</i>

410
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,000
<i>Be cleansed of defilement,</i>

411
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,790
<i>All at once</i>

412
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:40,010
<i>May he attain unchanging purity</i>

413
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,430
<i>And ascend to rebirth</i>

414
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:52,310
<i>In the Pure Land</i>

415
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,030
<i>Now,</i>

416
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,740
<i>His Lord has…</i>

417
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,890
My lord.

418
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,270
I am sorry.

419
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,570
Yeo-ri.

420
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,410
You are not to blame for my death.

421
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,830
If it becomes your fault,

422
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,790
my intentions in fighting
for His Majesty's noble cause

423
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,040
becomes meaningless.

424
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,790
Though I am saddened,

425
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,380
I have no regrets about my life.

426
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,140
Yeo-ri.

427
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,140
Is my Gap here?

428
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,440
He is, is he not?

429
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,190
Gap.

430
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,900
Gap!

431
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,910
Gap, please don't go.

432
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,950
Don't leave me here alone.

433
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,750
Gap…

434
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,630
Mother…

435
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,010
Gap, please don't go.

436
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,010
Mother.

437
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,100
Thank you for giving birth to me.

438
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,560
Living as your son

439
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,320
was my greatest joy.

440
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:03,290
YOON GAP

441
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,220
Yoon Gap…

442
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,730
has left us in the end.

443
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:34,740
YOON GAP

444
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,170
Why did you not tell Yeo-ri?

445
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,550
You also had feelings for her.

446
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,760
She has already given
her heart to another.

447
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,100
If I tell her,
just to satisfy my own greed,

448
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,720
I will only end up distressing her.

449
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,930
How annoyingly cool you are.

450
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,020
Have a safe journey.

451
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,780
For you led a beautifully steadfast life
like that of an evergreen pine,

452
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,150
you will move on to a peaceful place.

453
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,200
Please take good care…

454
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,490
of Mother and Yeo-ri.

455
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,380
Have you lost your mind?

456
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,210
How could you ask me to do such a thing?

457
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,510
I am going to end up losing my head
as a heinous traitor

458
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,220
before that Imugi ever has
a chance at my throat.

459
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,600
Then, are you saying you cannot do it?

460
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:30,440
How could anyone sane
do such things to the King and the Prince?

461
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,440
Se-won.

462
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,820
Grab the bottles. We are done here.

463
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,620
What do you think you are doing right now?

464
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,160
I know I am blind, but I always believed
I had a good eye for judging character.

465
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,210
Maybe not.

466
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,630
I should continue my search for someone

467
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,090
with greater mental fortitude.

468
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,760
This nation might be small, but surely,

469
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,760
there must be at least one other
for the Chief State Councillor's seat.

470
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,560
Hold on… Stop.

471
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,120
Those are some mighty callused hands.

472
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,080
Do you know how to wield a sword?

473
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,080
Pardon?

474
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:34,000
The Warrior Deity is
quite pleased with you.

475
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,050
Your Majesty!

476
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,600
Your Highness.

477
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,680
- Oh, my!
- You got it, Your Highness.

478
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:22,930
Gwang's legs have become
much stronger since last we played.

479
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,520
I almost found it difficult
to keep up with his running.

480
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,640
In a matter of a few months,

481
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,400
he had another growth spurt.

482
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,980
It has been a year already, not months.

483
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,150
Pardon?

484
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,150
It has been over a year
since His Majesty played

485
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,280
a game like that with the Prince.

486
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,210
Has it been a year already?

487
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,750
Yes.

488
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,710
It appears I have been
quite a heartless father.

489
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,510
Ma'am.

490
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,760
We are heading out now.

491
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:54,730
Do not skip any meals.
Be sure to eat well.

492
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,360
Let's go.

493
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,660
Come on.

494
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:21,380
She knows you are not Lord Yoon Gap now.

495
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,050
It would be too cruel to her

496
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,050
if we stay here.

497
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,320
Pardon? You only have one room left?

498
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:52,080
The merchants here for the market tomorrow
have filled up the rest.

499
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,830
It is also the smallest room
in the corner.

500
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,750
Do you still want it?

501
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,130
Well?

502
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,640
What are we going to do tomorrow?
We cannot continue sleeping at taverns.

503
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:19,140
Ask that King to buy you a house.

504
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,270
You have saved his family
countless times already.

505
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,270
It is one order after the other
without reward.

506
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,110
You deserve a few houses, at least.

507
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,610
Then, you should talk to His Majesty.

508
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,610
Even if it is not a mansion,

509
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,830
a small two-room house
would be more than enough.

510
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:54,930
Yoon Gap must have…

511
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,100
crossed the River of the Afterlife by now.

512
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:01,310
Yes.

513
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,570
Your initial reason to face
the Eight-foot-tall Ghost is now gone.

514
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,280
Right.

515
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,900
And yet…

516
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,360
you will continue to pursue him?

517
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,120
You are right.

518
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,460
It started with Lord Yoon Gap.

519
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:25,500
But my grandma still remains his captive.

520
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,250
Regardless of everything else,

521
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,590
I know now.

522
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,430
I know this is what I must do.

523
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:37,350
And I also pity the Eight-foot-tall Ghost
for suffering so,

524
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,520
while letting his grudge fester

525
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,230
for all those years.

526
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,940
I want to purify and free Cheon Geum-hwi

527
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,190
from his pain and suffering,

528
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,400
along with the countless grudges

529
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,780
of the villagers of Yongdam

530
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:57,990
that remain tied to him.

531
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,670
Why do you remain by the door?

532
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,210
Come in. You will catch a cold.

533
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,340
No. I like it here just fine.

534
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,390
You do not need to know. Just trust me.

535
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:23,140
Why? Are you scared I will devour you?

536
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,610
You can sleep on that side.

537
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,360
You are surprisingly naive sometimes.
Did you know that?

538
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,460
You dare refer
to your sacred patron deity as naive?

539
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,790
Do you want to see how naive

540
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,210
I could really be?

541
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,550
No, thanks.

542
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,720
If I ask you…

543
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,930
to let it all go and run away with me…

544
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,150
would you?

545
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,610
Now, I cannot return this body to Yoon Gap

546
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,240
and I still have no way to escape it,

547
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:21,290
so maybe…

548
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,910
I just embrace it

549
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,920
and postpone all that ascension business.

550
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,380
Maybe…

551
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,000
I just become an ordinary mortal.

552
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,380
How would you like
to live 100 years with me?

553
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:57,070
How could we even run
without dealing with that damn ghost?

554
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,240
Wherever we go,

555
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,120
he would follow us with vindictive intent.

556
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,750
I was not being serious.

557
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:06,750
Gangcheori.

558
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:08,920
I…

559
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:16,840
You two aren't wed yet.

560
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,010
You should not be sharing a room already.

561
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,010
Come on.

562
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:37,440
Day will break at this rate.

563
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:39,400
Let us get a move on.

564
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,530
Yes, ma'am.

565
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,000
Why did she wait
if she was going to drag us

566
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,460
back in the dead of night anyway--

567
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:56,630
Exactly. Why did you have to choose
a tavern in the middle of nowhere

568
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:00,050
and make me search the whole Capital
in the dead of night?

569
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:02,260
- What is she saying?
- Shush.

570
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,260
Unbelievable.

571
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:21,610
- Did you find out?
- Yes.

572
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,080
His Majesty plans
to go outside the Capital.

573
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,660
Outside the Capital?

574
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:30,710
Where exactly?

575
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:32,040
I am unsure of the details.

576
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,580
He has always been quite secretive.

577
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:38,050
However, I hear
the Queen Dowager, the Queen,

578
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:40,510
and even the Prince is to accompany him.

579
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:42,800
I, too, am to accompany the royal guards.

580
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,390
I shall report back in detail afterward.

581
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,070
SPIRIT TABLET OF THE LATE CHEON GEUM-HWI

582
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,210
Have Yeo-ri and Imugi Gangcheori arrived?

583
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:21,300
They said they would go directly
to Jinseung Temple with Venerable Gaseop.

584
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,890
We should head out as well.

585
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,480
Your Highness,
His Majesty is here for you.

586
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,280
Your Majesty.

587
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,940
What brings you to the Queen's Palace?

588
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:46,410
No matter how hard I think it over,

589
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:48,700
I believe this is right.

590
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,750
Your Majesty,
is that not the Ghostbane Stone?

591
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,750
Why are you giving it to me?

592
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,960
You also carry a member

593
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,050
of the royal bloodline in your womb.

594
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:07,800
Furthermore, the ghost
has targeted you once before.

595
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,890
Hence, you should hold onto it.

596
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,600
No, Your Majesty.

597
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:15,810
Your Majesty's safety comes before mine
or that of the unborn child.

598
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,900
At today's passage rite,

599
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,530
I will be making a plea for forgiveness
to the Eight-foot-tall Ghost

600
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,900
on behalf of my ancestors
who greatly wronged him.

601
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:30,200
However, if I approach him
with the very thing that repels him,

602
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,660
that would be duplicitous.

603
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,720
CHEON GEUM-HWI

604
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,110
Grandma.

605
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,320
Are you performing an afterlife ritual?

606
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:07,820
Yes.

607
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:10,820
It appears the top house
across the bridge,

608
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:13,990
is dealing with a troublesome evil spirit.

609
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,160
Why did you stick an identification tablet
and a talisman inside your overcoat?

610
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,340
When you do,

611
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,920
a shaman can summon the Grim Reaper

612
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:31,340
to take the evil spirit directly
to the underworld.

613
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:36,310
The Grim Reaper needs a clear record
that contains the name

614
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:38,140
and the date of death for the deceased.

615
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,020
However,

616
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,060
this method

617
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:46,530
does not relieve the grudge of the ghost

618
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,110
and…

619
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,410
the shaman could instantly die

620
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:54,870
if things go awry.

621
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,620
It must…

622
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:59,540
It must be used as a last resort.

623
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:02,670
What if you end up dying instantly?

624
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:06,630
For I know
that evil spirit's true identity,

625
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,800
I will be fine.

626
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,390
Look!

627
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,980
The caragana has blossomed.

628
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:27,610
The buds were definitely tightly shut
just last night,

629
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,110
but this morning,

630
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:31,570
I saw that they all fully bloomed.

631
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:35,870
Since you made a special request of me,

632
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:38,160
I ran over as soon as I saw them.

633
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,410
My lady!

634
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,540
You should not scurry off like that.

635
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,880
It will only get me in trouble later.

636
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,550
When did I scurry off?

637
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,420
You are just a slow walker.

638
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:50,590
Damn it.

639
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,180
Thanks.

640
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,640
My lord.

641
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,520
This is exactly why I said we should just
forget about that rotten jerk…

642
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,480
now.

643
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,610
<i>As if they were scheduled,</i>

644
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,450
<i>the flowers just happened to bloom</i>
<i>on the 100th anniversary</i>

645
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:16,870
<i>of the Eight-foot-tall Ghost's birth.</i>

646
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:20,000
You did not even like coming
to the palace from the start.

647
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,790
You came because of me.

648
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:27,290
I am already plenty thankful
for all that you have done.

649
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,670
<i>Yeo-ri already knows that</i>

650
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:32,260
<i>in order to</i>
<i>banish the Eight-foot-tall Ghost</i>

651
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,140
<i>the luminous pearl</i>
<i>must be completely drained.</i>

652
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:53,530
<i>With her temperament,</i>

653
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,240
<i>she will do something reckless</i>
<i>to keep me out of harm's way.</i>

654
00:54:58,070 --> 00:54:59,200
<i>Hence, this will just be</i>

655
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,950
<i>a precaution,</i>
<i>in case Yeo-ri ends up in peril.</i>

Something feels off.
Something has gone amiss.

672
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:50,960
Stay back.

673
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,130
- Stop him!
- Keep His Majesty safe!

674
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:26,780
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty…

675
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:46,570
