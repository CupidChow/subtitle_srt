about Ming Qian's death?

There's no need to blame yourself.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,270
It was His Majesty's insistence on

to counter noble families

the progress of the investigation?

10

don't let yourself become someone's pawn.

just in case.

137
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,720
The lights we saw just now

138
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,030

If we were circling the same paths,

142
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,240
we should at least see the markers
we left behind.

143

All along the way,

00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,080
it feels like someone's been following us.

related to fox demons,

154
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,800
I've been concerned about the matter.

155
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,010
I heard that fox demons appear here
at night,

156
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,450
so I came to investigate.

157
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,990
But unexpectedly,

158
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,820
I got lost in the bamboo forest.

159
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,360
Then,

160
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,550
did you discover anything tonight?

161
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,250
I arrived here not long ago

162
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,150
and got lost immediately.

163
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,330
I found nothing

164
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,670
and even fell once,

165
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,840
injuring my hand.

166
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,320
This forest is dense with thick fog,

167
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,450
and you're injured.

168
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,330
You should head back quickly.

169
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,750
Yes, yes.

170
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,360
A scholar is of little use
in such matters anyway.

171
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,620
I'll take my leave now.

172

Your Majesty, don't you find Meng Zhixing

173
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,520
a bit odd?

174
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,360
Indeed, something's off about him.

175

To cross paths with us
in such a dense forest at night—

178

We're lost.

179
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,100
The markers we made
must have been destroyed.

180
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,970
The night is dark
and the bamboo forest dense—

181

182
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,400
We can't keep going like this.

183

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,100
the star-guided navigation that
the late empress taught us in our youth?

185
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,090
So many stars.

186

It is August.

193

Midnight has passed.

194
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,670
So the brightest star in the sky...

195
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,850
is the Morning Star.

Once we have our direction,

199
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,870
we can find our way out.

200
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,960
Toward the Morning Star.

201
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,300
The star heralds the end of darkness,

202

Likewise, if we pierce through the fog,

204
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,610
the truth will be revealed.

205

Even if we are temporarily deceived
by false appearances,

A clear conscience is all that matters.

214
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,210
I don't care about what others think.

215
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,250

to see whether their promotion of scholars
from humble families

220
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,880
is truly for the public good
or for personal gain.

There must be something fishy here.

Prime Minister Lu was once convicted
for his seditious poetry,

which was truly a pity.

241
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,460
The late empress encouraged
open criticism,

242
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,860

connected to the imperial examination.

Let's take these with us first.

269

I was of humble origin,

farming in Nanyang,

00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,830
merely surviving in chaotic times,

272
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,490
with no desire for recognition
among the lords.

273
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,160
The late Emperor did not despise
my humble status

274
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,760
but condescended

275
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,700
to visit me three times
in my thatched cottage,

in dangerous and difficult situations.

00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,350
He worried that,
after achieving a high rank,

372
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,080
she would try to clear his name.

373
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,720
Then perhaps Lu Yueying

374
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,680
participated in the exam behind his back.

375
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,260
She left me a note

376
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,990
saying it was about examination fraud.

377
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,520
I think...

378
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,510
she might be referring to
what happened back then.

379
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:00,830
We still need to find answers

380
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,630
from Prime Minister Lu himself.

381
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,880
When I was young and studying,

382
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,610
I only knew that books were vast,

383
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,500
without distinction of rank or status.

384
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,030
Anyone with the will to study

385
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,210
might freely do so.

386
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,310
But I never thought

387
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,310
some people would go to
such great lengths just to study

388
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,710
or endure such hardships

389
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,650
for the imperial examinations.

390
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,180
Indeed.

391
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,650
Prime Minister Lu once fearlessly
stood against the noble families

392
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,380
but was punished for his words.

393
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,700
Now in his later years,

394
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,160
he would rather teach quietly
in the secluded mountains

395
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,690
than serve the court again.

396
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,150
Perhaps his ambitions have died,

397
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,560
and he desires nothing more.

398
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,730
If his ambitions had truly died,

399
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,970
this academy wouldn't exist.

400
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,880
Deep down,

401
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,490
he still hopes that someday

402
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,030
the truth will come to light.

403
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,280
Let's hope so.

404
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,020
I'll find a place to stay
at the foot of the mountain

405
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,720
and visit more often in the coming days.

406
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,640
Perhaps

407
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,350
he will come around.

408
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,640
Someone's following us.

409
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,770
-Yin Cong?
-Yin Cong?

410
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,180
Yin Cong, why are you here?

411
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,440
By Your Majesty's order, I'm investigating
the Number Three Scholar case,

412
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,830
and my inquiries have led me here.

413
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,590
Had I known that Your Majesty
and Consort Xian would be here,

414
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,390
I certainly wouldn't have come.

415
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,990
I don't need to report my actions to you.

416
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:52,650
Of course.

417
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,000
Your Majesty has always acted
without restraint,

418
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,440
answering to no one.

419
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,710
Yin Cong,

420
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,760
it's not that His Majesty and I
don't trust you.

421
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,880
It was only that the matter was urgent...

422
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,540
Whether His Majesty trusts me or not
is his grace

423
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,820
and likewise requires no explanation.

424
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,310
My loyalty to Dacang

425
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,920
and to the late empress is
beyond question.

426
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,510
So,

427
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,260
you're loyal to everyone except me.

428
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,030
Yin Cong, say no more.

429
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,390
Your Majesty.

430
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,920
You mustn't be late for the court session.

431
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,750
Leyu,

432
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,130
you suspect me too?

433
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,110
Yin Cong.

434
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,750
Regardless of
whether His Majesty and I suspect you,

435
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,630
you should never have spoken to him
like that.

436
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,680
What's the worst that could happen? Death?

437
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,550
Where is the reluctance

438
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,770
and resistance you showed
when you married him?

439
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,060
But now, you treat him

440
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,050
with profound affection
and unwavering loyalty.

441
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,060
You've always resented

442
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,570
that I became his consort.

443
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,260
Then what would you have me do?

444
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,340
Rebel?

445
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,830
Do you truly believe

446
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,240
he would risk offending the noble families

447
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,500
to stand up for scholars across the land?

448
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,040
His Majesty now is not

449
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,170
the same person we saw at Xuanji Pavilion.

450
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,920
Think carefully—

451
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,110
the Changding Bridge case,

452
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,300
the elimination of the Xi family,

453
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,710
and now his secret assistance with
the Number Three Scholar case.

454
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,370
Everything he's doing now...

455
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,960
reminds me of

456
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,740
the spirited and ambitious man
he once was.

457
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,580
Yin Cong,

458
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,960
have you ever considered

459
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,290
that perhaps what happened back then

460
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,440
might not have been as it seemed?

461
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,640
You saw it with your own eyes—

462
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,960
the late empress died
right in front of you,

463
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,950
didn't she?

464
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,590
If he could

465
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,920
strike his own mother down,

466
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,430
what else would he not do?

467
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,200
I don't understand

468
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,780
why he would do such a thing either.

469
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,910
But these past days,

470
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,000
he has shown me

471
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,680
his determination to change

472
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,310
this corrupt court.

473
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,420
He's also shown me that...

474
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,960
he's trying to fulfill
the late empress's wishes.

475
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,650
This leaves me conflicted.

476
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,670
Yin Cong.

477
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,610
I will get to the bottom of all of this.

478
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,600
There's an urgent matter
at the Justice Bureau.

479
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,970
Is that a signal flare
from the Justice Bureau?

480
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:16,530
Yes,

481
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,570
I need to go back.

482
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:22,770
Could it be...

483
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,040
That night at Xuanji Pavilion,

484
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,450
there were people
from the Justice Bureau too?

485
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,320
And back then, the head of
the Justice Bureau

486
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,510
was from the Qin family.

487
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,110
Could it be...

488
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,610
It seems...

489
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,000
I need to find a way

490
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,550
to go to the Justice Bureau
to investigate.
