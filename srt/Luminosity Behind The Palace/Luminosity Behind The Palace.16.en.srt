The Imperial Hospital has tried everything

but could not find
the source of the poison.

5
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,360
We could only detect
a scent of ancient wood

that night at Xuanji Pavilion,

it was also the Justice Bureau

And when you led your troops
into Xuanji Pavilion,

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,889
it appeared to be a coup,

25

That night, I received a secret order
from the late empress,

to Xuanji Pavilion for a meeting.

I discovered

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,000
it merely meant
replacing one puppet with another.

controlled by the noble families,

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,170
Hand over the prince,

190
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,300
and I'll spare your life.

191
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,930
Qin Qiu is already inciting
military rebellions in all provinces.

192
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,030
Even with the troops of your Su family,

193
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,960
it'll still be like a mantis
trying to stop a chariot.

194
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,390
Take a good look at this.

195
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,840
Prince Ji, Yin Changyan,

196
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,540
willingly endured infamy

197
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,710
and staged a palace coup with me

198
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,880
to protect the throne.

199
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,880
Therefore, I hereby write this decree

200
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,170
to clear his name.

201
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,770
This is...

202
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,090
Hoping future generations will understand
his true intentions.

203
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:49,990
Impossible.

204
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,480
This is impossible.

205
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,140
You should be very familiar with
the late empress's handwriting.

206
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,330
All these years, His Majesty

207
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,770
had been fulfilling
the late empress's wishes.

208
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,240
It was you and Qin Qiu
who stirred up trouble,

209
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,440
conspiring together

210
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,730
and plunging Dacang into chaos!

211
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
It was you,

212
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,990
who betrayed the late empress,

213
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,920
betrayed Dacang,

214
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,270
and betrayed His Majesty!

215
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,400
This is impossible!

216
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You even betrayed yourself as well.

217
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,460
This absolutely can't be.

218
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,349
You're...

219
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,220
You're trying to deceive me
with this delaying tactic.

220
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
So it was really me

221
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,520
who killed him with my own hands.

222
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,480
Yin Cong, tell me.

223
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,670
Was His Majesty's poisoning

224
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,990
related to your brush holder?

225
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,910
Yes.

226
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,550
But why am I unharmed?

227
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,350
Why him specifically?

228
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,680
Why?

229
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,810
It would only take effect when taken with
the black tea His Majesty drank.

230
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,260
How cruel you are.

231
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,480
I've been tolerating your hostility

232
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,010
and prejudice against His Majesty
all along.

233
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,920
Is this what my tolerance has earned me?

234
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,550
Yin Cong.

235
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,790
Today, our friendship

236
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,030
ends here.

237
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,110
Yin Changyan is truly dead.

238
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,030
Arrest that sinful woman Su

239
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,190
and find the prince!

240
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,790
Yes!

241
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,510
Grand Preceptor, we've searched
the entire palace

242
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,310
but found no trace of the prince.

243
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,110
It seems that kid has been sent away.

244
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,790
However, with Prince Qi in my hands,

245
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,960
that kid is no longer a threat.

246
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,960
Relay my orders.

247
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,590
Empress Su poisoned His Majesty

248
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,680
and plotted to usurp the throne.

249
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,940
She has been arrested.

250
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,110
Throw her into the imperial prison
immediately

251
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,500
to await further orders!

252
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,020
Yes!

253
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,000
Move.

254
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,550
The great cause is complete.

255
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,360
This realm will soon be entirely
in my hands.

256
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,820
[Justice Bureau]

257
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,570
I heard Your Majesty is skilled at Go.

258
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,160
May I have the honor of
learning a thing or two from you?

259
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,750
The art of Go

260
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,840
requires careful planning
and control of the entire board.

261
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,960
When it comes to ruthlessness
and scheming,

262
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,590
I, Leyu, pale in comparison.

263
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,860
Your strategy has left you

264
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,600
with your brother dead,

265
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,070
His Majesty gone,

266
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,590
and yourself imprisoned.

267
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,820
In this game of Go,

268
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,170
Your Majesty has lost miserably.

269
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,750
Grand Preceptor,

270
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,350
the game isn't over yet.

271
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,240
How can you be so certain?

272
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,280
Yin Cong cannot save you,

273
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,200
and neither can Yin Zhiyi.

274
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,350
What's before you now

275
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,830
is a lost game.

276
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,730
I am different from you, Grand Preceptor.

277
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,340
You're in the game,
yet merely a pawn yourself.

278
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,720
However, you foolishly attempt

279
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,250
to use others as your pawns.

280
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,540
But people and pawns
are fundamentally different.

281
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,210
The one who plays

282
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,570
must know how to employ each wisely.

283
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,830
Yet people are not pawns.

284
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,110
How could they be compared to
a mere game of Go?

285
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,370
If you always treat others as pawns,

286
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,880
one day,

287
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,380
you'll find yourself trapped
in your own deadly game.

288
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,400
In the end,

289
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,990
the pawns will turn against you,

290
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,350
and you will lose everything.

291
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,320
Well said.

292
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,750
Very well.

293
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,490
Then I shall see

294
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,600
what kind of strategy Your Majesty has.

295
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,790
Lu.

296
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,960
I appreciate talent.

297
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,240
A wise man should know
when to bend with the wind.

298
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,920
I, Lu Jiuzhang, am old,

299
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,200
and my legs are weak.

300
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,910
Facing traitors and rebels,

301
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,680
I cannot kneel.

302
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,470
Kill me if you wish.

303
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,720
I'm at your mercy.

304
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,860
No need for further words!

305
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,390
Qin Qiu, you traitor!

306
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,480
Qin Qiu, you traitor!

307
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,820
May you rot in hell!

308
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,960
Rot in hell!

309
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,150
Once I finish dealing with
that treacherous woman today,

310
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,350
I'll have you traitors
dragged to the execution grounds.

311
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Bring that treacherous woman here!

312
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,160
Your Majesty.

313
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,480
Your Majesty.

314
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,550
Su Leyu.

315
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,640
You're audacious beyond measure,

316
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,570
plotting for power,
trying to usurp the throne,

317
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,240
and poisoning His Majesty to death!

318
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,570
Do you admit your guilt?

319
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,930
He who has a mind to beat his dog

320
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,590
will easily find his stick.

321
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,110
So you don't admit it?

322
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,570
You were alone with His Majesty
in Ningzheng Hall,

323
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,880
and by the time we arrived for his rescue,

324
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,280
His Majesty was already poisoned to death.

325
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,300
If not you, then who else could it be?

326
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,270
For his rescue?

327
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,760
You were clearly staging a coup.

328
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,340
The truth is like
a flickering candlelight.

329
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,020
Who can truly see it clearly?

330
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,150
The verdict is final.

331
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,810
I, Qin Qiu,

332
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,060
respectfully request Your Highness,
Prince Qi,

333
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,760
to follow heaven's will

334
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,820
and ascend the throne.

335
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,090
Follow heaven's will

336
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,040
and ascend the throne!

337
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,820
Your Highness.

338
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,310
His Majesty has passed away.

339
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,350
Since ancient times,
the younger brother succeeds

340
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,830
when the elder passes.
This is the ancient law and ritual.

341
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,160
I hope Your Highness
will follow heaven's will

342
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,000
and take the throne, Prince Qi.

343
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,700
Her Majesty always says
your heart is pure,

344
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,610
untainted by worldly matters.

345
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,330
If Your Highness can
stay true to yourself,

346
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,660
there may still be hope.

347
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,020
I believe Your Highness
can discern right from wrong

348
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,220
and see through the clouds to the truth.

349
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,200
Qin Qiu.

350
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,690
As a minister of Dacang,

351
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,750
instead of working for the welfare of
our state and the people,

352
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,400
you committed treason.

353
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,360
Three years ago at Xuanji Pavilion,

354
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,400
you attempted to
force the late empress to abdicate.

355
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,660
And now, you're plotting treason again.

356
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,670
You've really lost all conscience!

357
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,950
-So that's the truth.
-So it was him.

358
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,810
I never would have suspected him.

359
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,680
Qin Qiu!

360
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,610
You traitor!

361
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,590
Confess your crimes
and submit to justice now!

362
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,440
You've completely abandoned
all human decency!

363
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,300
Your Highness.

364
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,290
These wild accusations of yours,

365
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,780
I simply don't understand any of them.

366
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,670
As a noble prince,

367
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,500
how could I be held hostage by a traitor?

368
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,920
I, Yin Zhiyi,

369
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,700
will never submit, even unto death!

370
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,580
"Never submit, even unto death?"

371
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,010
Can't you see the situation we're in?

372
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,410
Go die!

373
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,200
Look out!

374
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,030
Qin Qiu!

375
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,240
Leyu!

376
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,040
Leyu!

377
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,840
Nobody move!

378
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,260
Su Leyu.

379
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,410
Today, I will make you bleed
right where you stand!

380
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,400
Report!

381
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,110
Marquis Jingyuan, Su Wencheng,
has brought troops

382
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,070
and surrounded the palace!

383
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,600
Su Wencheng is still alive?

384
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,610
His Majesty and I
had long seen through your plot

385
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,440
and secretly sent people
to escort my brother into the city.

386
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,970
When Prince Qi suddenly
returned to Zhongdu,

387
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,000
I suspected

388
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:09,110
that you, Grand Preceptor,
must be plotting something,

389
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,000
so I secretly gathered the imperial guards

390
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,660
and sent you the false news
of my brother's death

391
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,310
as preparation for today.

392
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,070
What a clever strategy,

393
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,240
creating a diversion
while executing the real plan.

394
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,110
Grand Preceptor,

395
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,200
in this game of Go now,

396
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,920
who holds

397
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,880
the winning hand?

398
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,880
Now that I have you, Su Leyu, in my grasp,

399
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,830
even with thousands of troops
at his command,

400
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,400
Su Wencheng wouldn't dare
make a rash move.

401
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,040
There's a rule of our Su family:

402
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,000
never rescue hostages.

403
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,960
I don't believe
Su Wencheng will just watch you die.

404
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,890
Everyone, listen to my orders!

405
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,960
Take Su Leyu

406
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,960
and defend the palace gates at all costs!

407
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,590
Yes!

408
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,850
As expected, womanly compassion

409
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,100
is unfit for important tasks!

410
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,000
Qin Qiu.

411
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,040
I've served you my entire life.

412
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,150
But today,
I refuse to be your accomplice anymore!

413
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,490
Leyu.

414
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,900
As for what I owe you,

415
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,420
what I owe the late empress,

416
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,880
and what I owe His Majesty,

417
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,450
I shall repay it all today.

418
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,590
Yin Cong!

419
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,050
Kill them!

420
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,650
Throw this traitor

421
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,830
into the death prison,

422
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,300
and execute him by slow slicing!

423
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,320
Heaven wants me dead.

424
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,360
Heaven wants me dead!

425
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,440

426
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,070
Yin Cong!

428
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,250
I'm sorry.

429
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,390
Next spring,

430
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,390
let's take our best bows and arrows.

431

Gallop...

434
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,660
Gallop freely.

All things in this world are predestined.

Trials of love and hate are merely
illusions in this fleeting life,

441
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:46,720
so open your heart
and follow the natural way.

442
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
Only then will you find inner peace.

443
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,540
The universe is vast.

444
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,350
The faithful will surely
find their own place in it.

The turmoil has passed,

449

and the court is stable now.

450
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,330
As for this ordeal,

451
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,320

may pursue education

once the new emperor comes of age,

Most officials in this world

491
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,530
only look down as they walk,
