00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,590
There's something fishy about
what happened these two days.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,120
We had just left the academy

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,700
when we ran into Yin Cong.

5
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,510
And then the academy,
which had been hidden for so long,

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,300
was suddenly shut down by authorities.

7
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,760
Who do you think
is the mastermind behind it?

8
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,379
And then at the Juma River Camp,

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,400
when we were surrounded by assassins,

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,640
Yin Cong happened to arrive there
from night hunting.

11
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,100
But later, I found out that

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,280
it was impossible
to hunt at night in that area.

13
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,900
So you're suspecting that

14
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,890
Yin Cong
followed us, closed down the academy

15
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,620
and then deliberately saved us
at the Juma River?

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,280
I don't know

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,120
about the specific details.

18
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,780
But all of this
seems to have been arranged.

19
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,150
There are indeed many questionable points

20
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,350
about all the things you've mentioned.

21
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,630
But I believe

22
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,740
when it comes to
the matters of right and wrong,

23
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,140
Yin Cong knows what to do.

24
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,270
I hope what you said is right.

Even if the person is a criminal,

00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,600
and showed mercy when you were flogged.

186
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,040
I survived it.

187
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,590
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

188
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,250
If I were truly meant to die,

189
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,830
I would've been killed
at the Xuanji Pavilion that night.

190
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,900
However, not only did I survive,

191
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
but I also became your Consort Xian.

192
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,280
The reasons behind this

193
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,170
cannot be stated explicitly, huh?

194
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,320
We are both in the imperial court.

195
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,480
Fortunately, I have your companionship,

196
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,750
and we're together days and nights,

197
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,210
so I no longer feel lonely.

198
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,690
Though you're involved in court affairs,

199
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,370
you're still the same Su Leyu as before,

200
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,500
having a heart full of justice

201
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,840
and being fearless.

202
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,630
But since I ascended the throne,

203
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,030
it has felt as if I had walked into

204
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,440
a suffocating cage.

205
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,960
Sometimes,

206
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,480
I can barely remember who I once was.

207
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
Your Majesty,

208
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,370
if your mind
isn't confined to small spaces,

209
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,120
then wherever you look,

210
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,880
you can always see vast skies
and boundless seas.

211
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,150
Leyu.

212
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,630
Do you trust me?

213
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,150
Yes, I do.

214
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,690
I believe you can not only

215
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,080
clear my name

216
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,440
but also

217
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,580
eliminate the corrupt officials
in the imperial court

218
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,040
and eradicate
the injustices of this world.

219
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,100
They think they can control everything
with their power,

220
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,870
hide the truth

221
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,670
and disrupt the imperial court.

222
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,790
I will uproot them completely

223
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,210
and make them pay the price
for their evil deeds.

224
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,120
What happened to
the Thousand-Character Classic in the box?

225
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,550
Yang Yun discovered Lady Song's attempt
to frame me,

226
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,550
so she secretly put it inside there.

227
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,530
Your Highness.

228
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,160
His Majesty has already told me

229
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,200
you want to investigate the case
at the Imperial Academy again.

230
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,750
I have made all the arrangements.

231
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,120
But in terms of your health condition...

232
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,180
It doesn't matter.

233
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,710
Your Highness.

234
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,830
This room has been kept exactly as it was.

235
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,330
There have been no changes at all.

236
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,370
Thank you for your efforts, Lord Feng.

237
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,350
I want to see Consort Xian.

238
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,550
I have urgent matters to report.

239
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,690
Who's making that noise?

240
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,380
Report!

241
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,600
Lord Feng,

242
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,850
there's a scholar outside

243
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,960
who insists on seeing Consort Xian

244
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,910
and refuses to leave.

245
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,670
Who is he?

246
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,410
Liu Wenchong, the new Number One Scholar.

247
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,030
I am ashamed.

248
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,810
What are you doing?

249
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,870
Please stand up.

250
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,870
Regarding the imperial-exam cheating case,

251
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,600
thank you for standing up for all scholars
in our country

252
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,670
by beating the petition drum.

253
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,600
Though I'm the Number One Scholar,

254
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
to protect my reputation and title,

255
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,240
I didn't dare to speak up for them.

256
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,720
I don't deserve the title
of Number One Scholar.

257
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,790
You're so righteous.

258
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,480
I feel deeply ashamed.

259
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,130
Please stand up.

260
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,850
I previously thought that

261
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,770
you were against the idea
of women taking the imperial exams,

262
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,960
so you often satirized Lu Yueying.

263
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,490
And I was quite prejudiced against you.

264
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,490
I'm really sorry.

265
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,270
On the night when Lu Yueying was killed,

266
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,390
I had intended to meet her
and make peace with her.

267
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,920
But unexpectedly,
I encountered a fox demon.

268
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,960
Do you also believe
it was a fox demon that killed her?

269
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
How could that be possible?

270
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,690
No fox demons would bleed
after getting injured.

271
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,600
I think

272
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,990
the killer must have
disguised himself as a fox demon.

273
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,120
Then do you remember

274
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,950
which part of the killer's body
was injured?

275
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,630
It seemed to be the right hand.

276
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,700
The right hand?

277
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,170
Lord Feng.

278
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,300
Your Highness.

279
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,770
The fox demon's tail has been exposed.

280
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:37,870
Let's go.

281
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,550
Be careful, Your Highness.

282
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,600
Who are you?

283
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,750
Who are you?

284
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,640
This is impossible.

285
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,120
Who are you?

286
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,450
Are you a human or a ghost?

287
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,330
Do you think

288
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,600
I'm a human

289
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,570
or a ghost?

290
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,120
There's a ghost here!

291
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,320
There's a ghost here!

292
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,610
Are you a human or a ghost?

293
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,810
Am I a human or a ghost?

294
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,110
Lord Wang.

295
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,870
Lord Wang!

296
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,140
Lord Wang, save me!

297
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,230
Lord Wang!

298
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,420
Lord Wang!

299
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,600
Save me!

300
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,730
Mr. Meng.

301
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,270
This Lord Wang you mentioned
is the mastermind

302
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,210
who asked you to disguise yourself
as a demon to kill someone

303
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,360
and then frame the innocent, isn't he?

304
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,610
Miss Su.

305
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,370
You guys could never

306
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,840
understand my suffering.

307
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You and Lu Yueying
had been classmates for many years.

308
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,570
How could you kill her so cruelly?

309
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,870
Among the scholars of our generation,

310
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,720
Lady Lu's talent was the most outstanding.

311
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,610
She was the most notable figure
among all the scholars.

312
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,270
And no matter how hard I tried,

313
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,680
I just couldn't catch up with her.

314
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,170
This year's imperial examination is over.

315
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,770
Now we can finally
enjoy a good drink together.

316
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,390
Without the recommendation
from a noble family,

317
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,720
even if we pass the exam,

318
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,120
we still can't become officials.

319
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,360
Let me give you some advice.

320
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,890
Here you go again with this.

321
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,640
I've told you

322
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,710
I, Lu Yueying,
only rely on my true capabilities,

323
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,960
and I'll never curry favor
with noble families.

324
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,910
Due to her own talents,
Lady Lu was quite arrogant.

325
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,790
She looked down on those noble families.

326
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,920
But only until later did I find out that

327
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,220
she was the daughter
of the former Prime Minister, Lu Jiuzhang.

328
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,790
Yet she was so pretentious.

329
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,390
How would she understand the struggles
of people from humble families like us?

330
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,660
So you chose to
curry favor with the Wang family?

331
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,810
The premise was that

332
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,210
you had to frame Lu Yueying
for cheating in the imperial exam.

333
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,430
This was my only chance

334
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,090
to receive a recommendation.

335
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,080
After it's done,

336
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,120
you'll get a position
in one of the six ministries.

337
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,950
I didn't want to frame Lady Lu, either.

338
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,480
I... I tried to persuade her

339
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,200
to join me
in currying favor with the Wang family.

340
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,770
Mr. Meng, if it's still about this matter,

341
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,830
please say no more.

342
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
I have something else to do.

343
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,800
Please see yourself out.

344
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,060
[In that case,]

345
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,400
[I had nothing more to say.]

346
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,440
[According to Wang Zhan's instructions,]

347
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,550
[I started to look for
a birthday-banquet guest list.]

348
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,720
[But I searched the entire house]

349
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,920
[and found nothing.]

350
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,860
[Instead, I discovered a secret passage
in the room.]

351
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,520
[I suspected this secret passage]

352
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,450
[must be connected to Lu Yueying.]

353
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,630
[I went out of the secret passage
and walked through a bamboo grove.]

354
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,490
[Then I found Lu Yueying's house
outside the city.]

355
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,530
[I thought the list must be there.]

356
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,200
[But after searching for a long time,
I found nothing.]

357
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,330
[Then I discovered]

358
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,080
[many people had disguised themselves
as fox demons outside the house.]

359
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,740
[To avoid being discovered,]

360
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,520
[I put on Lu Yueying's outfit.]

361
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,080
[When I returned to the Imperial Academy,]

362
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,790
[I suddenly thought of the note
Wang Zhan wanted me to put in her room.]

363
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,440
[Then I looked for the right place]

364
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,040
[to put it on the bookshelf.]

365
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,310
Why are you still here?

366
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,760
So you've been to the academy?

367
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,730
What is this?

368
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,760
Meng Zhixing.

369
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,720
I thought
despite our different ambitions,

370
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,920
you would at least have some integrity.

371
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,550
To curry favor with a noble family,

372
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,200
how could you try to frame me?

373
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,580
I'm just doing this to have a good future.

374
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,080
Since you're the daughter of an official,

375
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,510
how would you understand my difficulties?

376
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,360
So you could just
use such unscrupulous methods?

377
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,120
So what?

378
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,750
This world
is about survival of the fittest.

379
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,270
Only the strong ones can survive.

380
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,200
The strong ones?

381
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,750
By currying favor with a noble family

382
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,360
and framing others to gain a position,

383
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,090
you'll become a strong person?

384
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,240
I'm so disgusted at you.

385
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,000
Shut up!

386
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,260
What rights do you have to condemn me?

387
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,960
You're nothing but a scoundrel.

388
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,970
Come with me to the government office.

389
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,600
Let's go.

390
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,630
Let's go!

391
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,550
That day,

392
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,970
you happened to
be wearing a fox-demon outfit.

393
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,130
So you pretended to be a fox demon

394
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,790
and started to spread rumors.

395
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,720
That was why you put animal hair

396
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,960
all over the room

397
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,960
and fabricated animal claw marks.

398
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,040
Then you shifted the suspicion of murder

399
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,960
onto that fictitious fox demon.

400
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,460
A fox demon!

401
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,430
That's really a fox demon.

402
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,510
Am I right?

403
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:26,829
Yes.

404
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,070
It's all correct.

405
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,620
It was all Lu Yueying's fault.

406
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,470
She looked down on me.

407
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,960
What could I do?

408
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,750
She had the ability to become an official.

409
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,810
Who cared about me?

410
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,590
In times like these,

411
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,330
without the support of noble families,

412
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,730
which of the scholars from humble families

413
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,030
could gain a foothold
in the imperial court?

414
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,980
Am I, Meng Zhixing,

415
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,590
the only murderer here?

416
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,000
Those high-ranking officials

417
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,960
in the imperial court

418
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,210
and those noble families
controlling nominations

419
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,160
are murderers too, aren't they?

420
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,350
Scholars from humble families
have no path to serve the country.

421
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,000
It's due to the negligence
of the imperial court.

422
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,130
But this is not your excuse for murder.

423
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,920
Meng Zhixing.

424
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,680
The scholars of our generation

425
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,210
should strive for excellence,

426
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,690
regardless of our origins.

427
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,140
Haven't you noticed this?

428
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,000
In front of others,

429
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,540
you always claim to be the humble one,

430
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,030
bowing and groveling.

431
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,240
I, the humble one, am Meng Zhixing.

432
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,180
I'm Lady Lu's classmate.

433
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,500
I have to go now.

434
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,360
But at that time,
you didn't even know our identities.

435
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,300
And this is your biggest problem.

436
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,230
You've never respected yourself

437
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,440
and never believed in yourself.

438
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,750
It's been ten years.

439
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,670
All of this is just a dream!

440
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,530
Guards!

441
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,790
Take him away.

442
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,350
Yes!

443
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:57,780
[Taiji Palace]

444
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,310
The scholar, Meng Zhixing,

445
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,970
committed murder and framed others.

446
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,020
He has confessed to his crimes
without reservation.

447
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,780
After a trial
by the Three Judicial Offices,

448
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,180
he is sentenced to execution after autumn.

449
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,820
Wang Zhan, Minister of Justice,

450
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,040
asked someone to frame others

451
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,320
and set up factions for personal benefits.

452
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,680
The evidence is irrefutable.

453
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,810
Your Majesty, please make a decision.

454
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
Grand Preceptor.

455
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,590
Your Majesty!

456
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,350
Your Majesty! I am innocent! Your Majesty!

457
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,790
I am innocent, Your Majesty!

458
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,510
Your Majesty!

459
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,310
Wang Zhan.

460
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,600
You have openly defied our country's law.

461
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,960
Strip him of his position
as Minister of Justice.

462
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,680
Send him to the Court of Judicial Review

463
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,830
for a thorough interrogation.

464
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,890

I am innocent!

Your Majesty!

Your Majesty!

470
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,270
I've never asked him to do that!

471
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,120
Your Majesty!

472

Grand Preceptor, save me!

Your Majesty!

475
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,060
Please listen to me!

476
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,330
I've never...

477
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,220
never asked him to do that!

478
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,770
Your Majesty!

479
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,890
Your Highness.

480
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,530
His Majesty
is waiting for you in the bedchamber.

481
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,930
He has specially ordered me
to welcome you back to the palace.

482
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,640
Thank you, Eunuch Xu.

483
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,200
Eunuch Xu.

484
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,510
You're the general director
of the inner court.

485
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,540
You've served
both the late empress and His Majesty.

486
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,530
Now that you're here
to welcome me back to the palace,

487
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,810
I am truly honored.

488
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,400
It is only because the late empress
and His Majesty

489
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,660
have shown favor to me.

490
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,270
Eunuch Xu.

491
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
You were also at the Xuanji Pavilion

492
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,800
that night, weren't you?

493
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,710
From the incident at the Changding Bridge

494
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,720
to this case
involving the Number Three Scholar,

495
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,050
His Majesty has been secretly helping me.

496
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,000
He seems to

497
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,270
be on the side of the noble families.

498
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,610
But actually,
the truth is quite the opposite.

499
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,750
He is carrying out
the late empress's wishes

500
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,950
and gradually weakening the power
of the noble families.

501
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,750
Your Highness, I don't understand

502
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,280
what you're talking about.

503
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,200
Then let me explain it more explicitly.

504
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,240
That night at the Xuanji Pavilion,

505
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,590
the soldiers from Prince Ji's Mansion

506
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,370
didn't kill the imperial guards.

507
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,110
They eliminated
the Justice Bureau's rebel army

508
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,110
which belonged to the Qin family
and pretended to be the imperial guards.

509
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,710
Am I right?

510
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,820
What difference does it make?

511
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,680
If at the Xuanji Pavilion,

512
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,720
those were truly imperial guards
who protected the late empress,

513
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,780
then Prince Ji would be guilty of treason.

514
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,390
But if

515
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,750
they were the Justice Bureau's troops
which belonged to the Qin family

516
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,460
and surrounded the Xuanji Pavilion first,

517
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,540
then Prince Ji,
who led troops into the palace,

518
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,130
seemed to rise in rebellion
and kill people at the Xuanji Pavilion,

519
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,120
and actually,
the truth was quite the opposite.

520
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,520
Prince Ji rushed there
to save the empress.

521
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:54,850
Eunuch Xu.

522
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,920
Am I right?

523
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,590
His Majesty often talks about

524
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,200
proving the general truth
through one's own actions.

525
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,950
In childhood, you and His Majesty

526
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,010
were both taught by the late empress.

527
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,070
I think you understand this principle
better than I do.

528

530
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,480
Get rid of bad luck

531
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,610
and be reborn from the flames.

532

Where are Wan and the others?

533

You've just been released from prison.

534
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,920
Don't look back.

535
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,560
It's a taboo.

536
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,680
Since when have you

537
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,550
become more superstitious than I am?

538
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,540
Here we are.

Wash your hands with pomelo leaves

540
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,990
to ward off evil spirits.

541
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,400
Then good luck will come.

542

Your Majesty.

543
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,810
Are there any other rituals
I should comply with?

544
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,330
There is one more thing,
which is the most important.

545
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,660
Wearing this red outfit

546
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,320
will bring you good luck.
