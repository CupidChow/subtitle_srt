1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,440
The late empress was wary of
the Su family,

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,160
so she arranged for me
to be raised in the palace.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,960
Yet now, Your Majesty

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,160
actually see the Su family
as the late empress's faction!

5
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,450
[Luminosity Behind The Palace]

6
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,490
Yin Cong.

7
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,760
What brings you here today?

8
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,910
The imperial tomb guard
is changing shifts today.

9
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,840
I've come back to report on my work.

10
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,640
Autumn has just begun,

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,070
and it's getting chilly
over by the imperial tomb.

12
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,470
I'll go get you a fur coat.

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,920
Leyu.

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,600
Are you really going to
marry Yin Changyan?

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,310
Yin Cong.

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,850
Have you noticed

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,200
that he seems to be hiding something?

18
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,350
But Leyu, you...

19
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:48,950
Yin Cong.

20
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,430
We haven't seen each other for ages.

21
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,170
Did you come to see me

22
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,200
just to talk about this?

23
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,890
I actually came to tell you something.

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,680
What is it?

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,400
That night
when I ran into you and Yin Changyan,

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,900
I didn't say much because
I didn't want him to get suspicious.

27
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,870
But thinking about it today,

28
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,199
I still have to tell you.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,890
That necklace of yours,

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,050
I know something about its origin.

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,770
Are you talking about this?

32
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:16,750
Yes.

33
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,970
Go ahead, tell me.

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,710
I once heard people
from the Northern Border say

35
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,750
that this can only be worn by

36
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,000
chief generals or higher-ranked officials

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,260
in the foreign armies.

38
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,650
And to them, this is

39
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,520
even more important than life itself.

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,540
Unless they're killed,

41
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,140
they would never take it off.

42
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,380
So, Leyu,

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,380
this necklace is very likely
a key piece of evidence

44
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,840
that can prove
who killed the enemy general.

45
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,110
This necklace was given to me by Yang Yun.

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,500
Could it be that

47
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,470
Xi Zimo and Wang Zhan

48
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,079
were not only looking for the token
that day,

49
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,410
but also this necklace?

50
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,130
Yin Cong.

51
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,100
Can you take me out of the palace?

52
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,430
I don't think it'll be difficult.

53
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:56,960
Where to?

54
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,329
His Majesty imprisoned Yang Yun

55
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,170
to appease the noble families.

56
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,430
I have to go rescue her.

57
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,310
Seeing you like this puts my mind at ease.

58
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,680
You truly are still

59
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,130
the clear-minded and upright Su Leyu
who separates public and private matters.

60
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,590
His Majesty must have
his own difficulties,

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,070
which is why he resorted to such measures.

62
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,670
I must find the real culprit.

63
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,430
I've told you before that

64
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,990
he's no longer the Yin Changyan
you used to know.

65
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,560
Today's Yin Changyan will stop at nothing

66
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,760
to secure the throne.

67
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,910
If you stay here, you'll eventually become

68
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,310
just another pawn in his imperial schemes.

69
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,110
Let's rescue Yang Yun first

70
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,790
and discuss the rest later.

71
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:40,850
Your Majesty.

72
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,620
As expected, Princess Zhaoyang
went to Lezhu Villa

73
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,530
to see Miss Su.

74
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,310
They have both left the palace now.

75
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,570
Did Your Majesty anticipate that Miss Su

76
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,079
would certainly leave the palace
to continue her investigation?

77
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,060
If she didn't investigate,
she wouldn't be the Su Leyu I know.

78
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,920
Now that Yin Cong has come back
to report on her work,

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,150
I feel a bit more at ease

80
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,670
knowing they can go together.

81
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,230
Your Majesty deliberately
quarreled with her

82
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,040
so as to make Qin Qiu's faction

83
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,130
lower their guard.

84
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,370
So regarding Yang Yun's matter,

85
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,100
how should we proceed now?

86
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,350
I still need to maintain the appearance
of a good relationship with Qin Qiu.

87
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,089
As for Yang Yun's matter,

88
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,760
it's inappropriate for me
to investigate it myself,

89
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,870
so I'll leave the things that follow

90
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,920
to you.

91
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,430
I understand.

92
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,720
But I fear

93
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,340
this will only deepen the misunderstanding

94
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,220
between Miss Su and Your Majesty.

95
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,570
I just hope that one day,

96
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,610
Your Majesty and Miss Su can

97
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,250
let go of past grievances and reconcile.

98
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,800
Leyu.

99
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,600
Yin Cong.

100
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,159
I, Yang Yun, thank you ladies
for saving my life.

101
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,830
But Miss,
you might get into serious trouble

102
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,490
for breaking me out of prison.

103
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,520
Don't worry.

104
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,610
We'll handle any trouble
that comes our way.

105
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,940
Let's sit down and talk.

106
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,060
Yang Yun.

107
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,000
Do you know anything

108
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,630
about this neckless?

109
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,460
Mrs. Yue said

110
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,040
she obtained this necklace

111
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,370
after killing the enemy's chief general.

112
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,530
This necklace

113
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,490
is proof of her military achievement,

114
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,310
which can prove

115
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,020
that the Pingyang Army did reach
the Northern Border back then,

116
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,730
and that it wasn't a failed reinforcement.

117
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,630
So,

118
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,740
the elders in the village were members
of the Pingyang Army from back then?

119
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,540
That's right.

120
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,720
According to the elders in the village,

121
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,420
Mrs. Yue was the commander
of the Pingyang Army.

122
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,600
It was a mysterious troop

123
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,200
composed entirely of women.

124
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,030
That's why few outsiders knew about it.

125
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,940
Right after

126
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,240
the battle at the Northern Border,

127
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,150
the entire army
was mysteriously convicted.

128
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,950
They were forced to hide in Luofeng Valley

129
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,080
to escape disaster.

130
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,630
Is it related to Xi Zimo?

131
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,190
After learning that the Pingyang Army

132
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,500
was wrongfully accused,

133
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,230
we wanted to clear their names.

134
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,310
As it happens,

135
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,560
we witnessed Xi Zimo

136
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,630
collapse the Changding Bridge，

137
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,410
so we thought we could make use of
this incident.

138
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,240
Therefore, we fabricated the matter of
Hidden Message in a Fish

139
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,600
and placed the dead fish
near Changding Bridge.

140
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,830
Then we spread rumors

141
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,680
and decided to go with the plan of
Ghost Soldiers Passing.

142
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,440
First, we bribed the innkeeper

143
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,670
to have him

144
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,310
spread the gossip about
Hidden Message in a Fish

145
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,840
and Ghost Soldiers Passing

146
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,730
to visitors from all sides.

147
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,520
Innkeeper, have you heard about

148
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,250
Ghost Soldiers Passing,
which happened on Changding Bridge?

149
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,260
You guys saw it?

150
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,160
We modified the old armor
of the Pingyang Army

151
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,560
and changed its appearance.

152
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,490
Taking advantage of the night fog,

153
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,250
we disguised ourselves
as ghost soldiers from the underworld.

154
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,520
That night at the Mountain God Temple,

155
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,720
it was you who fought with me, wasn't it?

156
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,840
Yes, it was me.

157
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,430
I could tell you weren't ordinary people,

158
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,970
so I wanted to use your help

159
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,630
to seek justice for
Mrs. Yue and the others.

160
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,310
But how did those blue ghost flames

161
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,360
come about?

162
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,270
Those blue flames

163
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,310
were actually

164
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,690
produced using a special kind of powder.

165
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,580
Although the flame looks fierce,

166
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,410
its temperature is actually low.

167
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,670
When ignited on armor,

168
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,010
it won't burn, and it resembles
a ghost soldier in appearance.

169
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,750
That night at the Mountain God Temple,

170
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,680
we first used sounds

171
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,010
to draw your attention.

172
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,190
Then

173
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,950
we shot powder with arrows

174
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,000
into the bonfire.

175
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,360
When the flame comes into contact with
the powder,

176
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,560
it turns blue.

177
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,960
What is this special powder

178
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,220
you're referring to?

179
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,330
Phosphorus powder.

180
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,460
Phosphorus powder?

181
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,510
I recall that phosphorus powder

182
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,090
is strictly controlled
by the imperial court,

183
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,390
and both its sale and use

184
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,590
are regulated by the Ministry of Works.

185
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,280
How did you obtain it?

186
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,790
I don't know either.

187
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,880
I got it from Mrs. Yue.

188

But she's already...

189
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,570

190
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,150

191
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:50,840
Alright.

194
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:03,730

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,560
It's okay.

Greetings, Princess Zhaoyang.

198
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,590
The Ministry of War needs some files.

199
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,800
Where are the requisition records
for phosphorus powder?

200
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,110
The phosphorus powder is jointly used by
Ministry of War and Ministry of Works.

201
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,490
It's under the Department of Metallurgy,

202
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,620
located at Ding-Si position, rack 13.

203
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,690

204
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
This way, please.

205
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,850
No need.

206
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,179
I'll go find it myself.

207
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,640
I'm investigating this matter in secret.

208

210
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,710

This person is indeed something.

214
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,620
He definitely recognized me.

215
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,880
He recognized you but didn't reveal it,

216
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,810
so it seems he's a friend, not a foe.

217
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,680
Found it. Phosphorus powder.

the Ministry of Works, amount: 8 jin]

220
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,630
Xi Zimo?

221
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,120
During the time the Pingyang Army was held

222
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,390
at Juma River,

223
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,110
Xi Zimo was the only one
who requested phosphorus powder.

224
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,100
[Requested by Xi Zimo, Vice Director of
the Ministry of Works, amount: 8 jin]

225
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,380
So the ghost soldiers
and ghost flames back then

226
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,140
could have been Xi Zimo's work.

227
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,280
But why would he do that?

228
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,330
Look at this.

229
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:25,950
[Xi Zimo's Bureaucratic Record]

230
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,390
Xi Zimo participated in the renovation
of Changding Bridge

231
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,050
and was promoted to
Deputy Minister of Revenue.

232
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,720
This official road stone bridge

233
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,270
was supposed to be built with
large, solid stones,

234
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,870
but the stones of the Changding Bridge

235
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,530
were instead piled up
using this kind of rubble.

236
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,120
So Xi Zimo

237
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,240
embezzled the repair funds

238
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,960
during the renovation of
the Changding Bridge,

239
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,360
substituting the large stones
originally meant for the bridge piers

240
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,970
with rubble.

241
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,390
That's why

242
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,840
the once-sturdy Changding Bridge

243
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,500
could be so easily collapsed.

244
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,750
The collapse of the Changding Bridge
caused a delay in military operations,

245
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,720
and countless soldiers lost their lives
because of it.

246
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,870
Yet they shamelessly took advantage of
the national crisis to make huge profits.

247
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,900
With all this evidence

248
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,430
plus Yang Yun's testimony,

249
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,360
we can charge Xi Zimo
with framing loyal officials

250
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,750
and delaying military operations.

251
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,030
The Xi family was originally in control of
the lifeline of the imperial trade

252
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,200
and was supposed to act with integrity,

253
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,510
advising the court.

254
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,690
Yet they turned out to be
so corrupt and lawless—

255
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,290
it's utterly heinous.

to the end.

continue their misdeeds

259

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,850
His crime is unforgivable.

372
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,520
Yang Yun and other descendants
of the Pingyang Army,

373
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,920
in order to clear
the Pingyang Army's name,

374
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,240
staged the Ghost Soldiers Passing illusion

375
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,770
near the Changding Bridge.

376
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,390
It has now been confirmed

377
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,160
that the matter of
the Pingyang Army's jailbreak

378
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,170
was a deliberate frame-up by Xi Zimo.

379
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,700
During the Pingyang Army's resistance
against the enemy,

380
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,420
Xi Zimo deceived the imperial court

381
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,080
and stole their military achievements.

382
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,080
The court issued an erroneous decree
because of this,

383
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,660
causing the soldiers
to be wrongfully accused.

384
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,000
All these matters have been
thoroughly investigated and verified.

385
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,130
Your Majesty, please make a decision.

386
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,160
Since Xi Zimo has already
taken his own life,

387
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,560
let the matter be closed.

388
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,120
Now that this case has been clarified,

389
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
convey my decree:

390
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,420
restore the Pingyang Army's original title

391
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,000
and posthumously honor them as
the Zhaowu Pingyang Army.

392
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,480
All soldiers shall be honored
as loyal martyrs.

393
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,830
They shall receive military honors

394
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,200
and be enshrined in the Military Temple.

395
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,260
In Luofeng Valley,

396
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,990
a monument and temple shall be built.

397
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,640
Your Majesty is wise.

398
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,040
Yue Menglin,
former Director of the Archives,

399
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,260
known for his integrity

400
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,390
and competence,

401
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,600
shall be promoted to Minister of Revenue.

402
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,150
Su Wencheng shall be released
without charge

403
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,940
and immediately restored
to his original position.

404
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,600
As you command, Your Majesty.

405
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,890
[Ever-growing Radiance]

406
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,500
[Taiji Palace]

407
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,960
I've told you before that

408
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,420
he's no longer the Yin Changyan
he used to be.

409
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,780
Today's Yin Changyan will stop at nothing

410
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,980
to secure the throne.

411
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,170
Or perhaps,

412
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,260
deep in Your Majesty's heart,

413
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,220
there are also

414
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,830
unspoken

415
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,150
difficulties?

416
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,200
My original intention remains steadfast,

417
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,780
and I pursue my path diligently
to achieve my goals.

418
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,170
I have never changed.

419
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,170
By imperial decree of His Majesty:

420
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,790
Heaven has bestowed virtue

421
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,190
for this blessed union.

422
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,720
Now, the eldest daughter
of Marquis Jingyuan, Miss Su Leyu,

423
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,490
of virtuous character

424
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,200
[Imperial Edict]

425
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,550
and gentle demeanor,

426
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,240
is deemed a worthy match for me.

427
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,750
She's hereby granted the title of
Consort Xian,

428
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,210
and the investiture ceremony
will be held three days from now.

429
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,080
[Grand Preceptor's Mansion]

430
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,800
Su Leyu is truly something,

431
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,440
digging up such an old case

432
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,570
after all this time.

433
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,360
Poor Xi Zimo

434
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,040
had to be sacrificed.

435
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,260
We've also

436
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,070
lost a major noble family.

437
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,460
By the way, Grand Preceptor,

438
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,300
that Yue Menglin
His Majesty just appointed

439
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,870
comes from humble origins

440
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,870
and doesn't play by anyone's rules.

441
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,720
Things will be difficult for us
going forward.

442
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,520
If His Majesty can help him rise,

443
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
we can bring him down.

444
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,190
Grand Preceptor, you speak wisely.

445
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,190
However,

446
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,240
I can no longer
read His Majesty's intentions.

447
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,230
They say he rules by maintaining balance

448
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,369
and would never violate
ancestral precepts.

449
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:23,770
Yet imprisoning Yang Yun
was just for show,

450
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,290
as was his supposed discord with Su Leyu.

451
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,920
He's barely ascended the throne

452
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,120
and already brought down the Xi family.

453
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,890
His talk of balance

454
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,110
is merely because he knows

455
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,110
we'd fear the military power
in the Su family's hands.

456
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,330
Does he think that by protecting
the Su family this time,

457
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,710
Su Wencheng will become loyal to him?

458
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,550
Without Su Leyu,

459
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,240
his relationship with the Su family

460
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,830
would be like a candle in the wind,

461
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,070
ready to be extinguished at any moment.

462
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,400
That's why Su Leyu

463
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,480
is the crucial pawn.

464
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,790
The imperial examination results

465
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,240
will be announced soon.

466
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,110
Please rest assured, Grand Preceptor.

467
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,510
I've made all the necessary arrangements.

468
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,140
Your Highness.

469
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,650
You're scheduled to go back
and visit your family tomorrow.

470
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,020
Why are you leaving the palace today?

471
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,220
Just looking around.

472
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,720
Come on and check this out!

473
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,590
Fragrant and delicious,

474
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,850
perfect for everyone!

475
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,880
Come try our osmanthus wine!

476
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,240
Get our osmanthus wine here!

477
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,150
Come check out our osmanthus wine!

478
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,480
Miss, come have a taste.

479
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,520
Here.

480
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,620
It's newly opened.

481
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,140
Try it.

482
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,150
Is it good?

483
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,260
Wanna buy a pot?

484
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,130
Wencheng.

485
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,600
You and I were childhood sweethearts,

486
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,130
but fate is unpredictable.

487
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,240
There's no longer any possibility
between us.

488
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,370
I came here today to wait for your release
from prison...

489
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,050
Your Highness.

490
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,110
Just to see that you are safe and well.

491
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,860
Your Highness.

492
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,850
We should go now.

493
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,910
In this life,
we are not meant to be together.

494
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,000
May we each

495
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,640
take care of ourselves.

496
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,700
Now that the Pingyang Army's name
has been cleared,

497
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,050
if Mrs. Yue and the others knew of this
in the afterlife,

498
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,850
they would surely be delighted.

499
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,510
Thank you, benefactor.

500
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,200
If it weren't for

501
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,210
your idea to use
the Ghost Soldiers Passing strategy again

502
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,940
to reveal what happened at Juma River
back then,

503
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,040
the Pingyang Army's grievances

504
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,000
might never have been redressed
in this lifetime.

505
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,010
Don't mention it.

506
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,040
Fortunately, you were clever enough

507
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,700
to guess that I was the archer.

508
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,160
You once said

509
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,560
that to clear our name,

510
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,400
we needed to leave crucial evidence.

511
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,190
That day when I confronted Miss Su,

512
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,210
I deliberately revealed
the "Luofeng" inscription on my spear,

513
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,620
but dared not harm her in the slightest.

514
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,220
Well done.

515
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,130
I heard that Leyu admires you greatly

516
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,330
and has asked you to serve by her side.

517
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,180
Yes.

518
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,290
I will work at her palace

519
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,540
and keep a close eye on that Lady Song.

520
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,380
From now on,

521
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,470
make sure to protect Leyu well.

522
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,690
I will.

523
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,410
By the mandate of Heaven,

524
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,360
His Majesty decrees:

525
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,310
[Happiness]

526
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,770
from today onward, Su Leyu

527
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
is hereby granted

528
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,110
the title of Consort Xian,

529
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,810
bestowed residence in the Xianming Hall,

530
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,920
with the hope that
she'll observe propriety,

531
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,680
embody gentleness and humility,

532
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,010
and remain unsullied by worldly desires.

533
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,310
Leyu.

534
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,430
If one day

535
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,020
Changyan faces peril

536
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,390
and Dacang hangs in the balance,

537
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,790
would you be willing

538
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,920
to shoulder this immense burden for me

539
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,330
and protect our realm and people?

540
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,060
Last night, my mother reminded me

541
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,240
that an emperor
who ushers in a prosperous era

542
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,670
must have a virtuous and capable wife.

543
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,490
In my eyes, among our generation,

544
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,350
only you deserve to be called
virtuous and capable.

545
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,920
Leyu.

546
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:14,960
One day,

547
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,510
we'll take the pieces in our own hands

548
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,350
and together

549
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,290
shape the future of Dacang.

550
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,920
Yin Changyan.

551
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,440
I, Su Leyu,

552
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,040
vow never to marry a usurper.

553
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,270
But your actions

554
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,480
have made me sense

555
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,990
that you have untold secrets.

556
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,390
Thank you for Your Majesty's grace.

557
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,180
I originally intended to die
to show my resolve,

558
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,390
but I marry you today

559
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,380
to uncover the truth about
the Xuanji Pavilion.

560
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,860
If you truly forced the throne
and killed the former empress,

561
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,790
I'll make sure we perish together.

562
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,190
If you didn't,

563
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,000
I'll join you in shaping

564
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,870
the future of Dacang.
