00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,660
and what did you get in return?

192
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,320
Even a dog that barks loudly

193
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,790
can get a piece of meat!

194
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,840
Su Leyu is now a royal consort,

195
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,320
soon to be the crowned empress.

196
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,380
But what about you?

197
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,620
What status do you hold?

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,050
One is a tyrant who seized the throne

199
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,700
and killed your mentor.

200
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,240
The other is his accomplice,

201
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,960
a cruel and heartless woman!

202
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,110
Sooner or later, they'll get rid of you.

203
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,650
Just as they did before,

204
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,790
they'll cast you aside,

205
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,000
like you're a used tool,

206
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,060
leaving you rot in the imperial tomb!

207
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,840
Qin Cong.

208
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,510
Take a look around.

209
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,430
In all of Dacang,

210
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,640
there is no place for you!

211
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,570
You carry Qin blood in your veins.

212
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,850
We are your true family.

213
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,790
All I do is for you.

214
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,990
One day, Dacang
will belong to the Qin family.

215
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,590
You can kill me now,

216
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,180
and stay loyal to Yin Changyan.

217
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,150
Or,

218
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,950
you can join me to reshape the world.

219
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,180
The choice is yours.

220
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,150
Think carefully.

221
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,600
[Xianming Hall]

222
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,880
Your Majesty.

223
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,960
Just lie down.

224
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,400
Your Majesty.

225
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,820
I have a confession to make.

226
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,750
It was I

227
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,980
who deliberately told the physician to say

228
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,830
that the child was gone.

229
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,040
It's alright.

230
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,460
I already knew.

231
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,840
The imperial physician said

232
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,850
though the cause's still unclear,

233
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,030
luckily the poisoning wasn't severe,

234
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,600
so the child was saved.

235
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,530
Anyone who dares harm my child

236
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,550
will face consequences!

237
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,240
Careful.

238
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,550
Your Majesty.

239
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,190
You should use this opportunity

240
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,860
to condemn me,

241
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,000
make them believe

242
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,300
that I truly lost the child,

243
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,790
so they won't keep trying
to harm our child.

244
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,630
If I do so,

245
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,080
you may have to suffer more hardship.

246
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,380
I'm a daughter of the Su family.
I'm not afraid of hardship.

247
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,360
Your Majesty,
only by cutting ties with me,

248
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
will they reveal their true colors.

249
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,810
If you are unafraid,

250
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,550
then neither am I.

251
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,990
And I believe...

252
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,920
our child

253
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,570
won't be afraid either.

254
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,680
[Ningzheng Hall]

255
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,480
Your Majesty.

256
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,560
I've arranged experienced coroners

257
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,720
and imperial physicians to investigate.

258
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,150
They found peach kernels

259
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,840
were added to Consort Xian's tea,

260
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,320
causing the miscarriage.

261
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,160
Bring the maid who served the tea.

262
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,090
You served the tea.

263
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,950
Didn't you know
the food taboos during pregnancy?

264
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,020
Your Majesty, forgive me!

265
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,870
Her Highness craved snacks

266
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,100
during pregnancy.

267
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,140
She wanted to eat some nuts.

268
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,080
I didn't dare
let Consort Xian eat too many,

269
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,080
so I brewed them in tea.

270
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,460
I didn't know it would cause miscarriage!

271
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,910
Please have mercy, Your Majesty!

272
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,010
So careless, yet you beg for mercy?

273
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,550
Banish her from the palace

274
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,580
and exile her to the border!

275
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,980
Thank you, Your Majesty.

276
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,100
Come with us!

277
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,540
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

278
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,740
I have words to say, if I may speak.

279
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:05,830
Speak.

280
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,570
Consort Xian carried the heir.

281
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,210
She should have been extra cautious.

282
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,450
Even if the servant is at fault,

283
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,660
is Consort Xian entirely blameless?

284
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,750
If she's so careless,

285
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,580
how can she rule the imperial harem?

286
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,060
Indeed.

287
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,800
I've spoiled her too much.

288
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,390
Convey my decree.

289
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,480
Su Leyu craved snacks,

290
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,790
causing the miscarriage of the royal heir.

291
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,250
She's to be demoted
and sent to Yuzhen Temple

292
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,910
to reflect on her mistakes.

293
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

294
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:13,589
[Safe]

295
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:16,250

[Soft rosy hands, yellow sealed wine]

297

[The city brimmed with spring
as willows lined the palace walls]

[East wind devastates,
happiness wears thin]

299
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,270
[A cupful of melancholy,
several years of separation]

[Wrong, wrong, wrong! Spring remains
the same, but her frame grew thin]

[Tears washed away the rouge
and dampened her silk handkerchief]

302
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:18,160
[The peach blossoms are falling,
by the empty waterside pavilion]

303
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,520
Prince Qi's handwriting?

304
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:18,880
[Our oath to each other still remains,
yet I can no longer profess my love]

305
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,250
[Don't, don't, don't]

306
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,270
It's still cold in early spring.

307
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,540
Don't catch a cold.

308
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,860
Greetings, Your Majesty.

309
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,380
Rise.

310
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,410
I'm sorry for what you've suffered.

311
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,940
As long as our child is safe,

312
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,000
it's all worth it.

313
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,130
My demotion to this place

314
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,960
will make them lower their guard.

315
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,760
I can also take this opportunity

316
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,850
to enjoy the beautiful view here.

317
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,210
I even drew a fortune stick today.

[Safe]

319
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:57,660
Safe.

320
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,660
If the people are safe,

321
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,060
their families are safe,

322
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,340
and the nation is safe.

323
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,790
Safety...

324
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,720
is the simplest form of happiness.

325
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,140
A year's plan begins in spring.

326
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,920
We sow our hopes in spring,

327
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,840
and reap our harvest in autumn.

328
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,110
Indeed.

329
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,090
We plant in spring,

330
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,510
and in fall,

331
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,270
we will surely harvest.

332
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,350
Your Majesty.

333
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,220
Have you seen an imperial physician?

334
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,870
I'm fine.

335
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,570
The snow melts as spring arrives,

336
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,880
yet the air is still cold.

337
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,010
I just caught a cold.

338
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,050
The mountain winds
at Yuzhen Temple are even colder.

339
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,980
Your Majesty should return early.

340
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,280
Don't worry.

341
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,070
Leyu,

342
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,740
it's been a while since we've met.

343
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,670
Today, let's not talk about anything else,

344
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,120
just the spring scenery,

345
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,710
and our child.

346
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,680
Today is an auspicious day.

347
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,230
Perhaps Your Majesty

348
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,080
can give our child a name?

349
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,160
Jingzhou.

350
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,590
Jing

351
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,280
means the majesty of an emperor,

352
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,770
and a scene of brightness.

353
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,060
Zhou represents
long journeys and adventures.

354
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,700
I hope our child, boy or girl,

355
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,430
will live up

356
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,410
to the hopes of Dacang,

357
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,720
and make Dacang

358
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,800
prosperous and flourishing.

359
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,200
Jingzhou.

360
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,620
Bright and radiant.

361
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,250
Sailing and exploring.

362
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,720
May our child have great ambitions

363
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,200
and strong beliefs.

364
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,230
There's another layer of meaning to it.

365
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,260
I firmly believe

366
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,380
what we leave for Jingzhou

367
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,240
will also be a bright
and prosperous Dacang.

368
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,660
My Lady, what happened?

[The city brimmed with spring
as willows lined the palace walls]

00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,280
[East wind devastates,

372
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,640
[A cupful of melancholy,
several years of separation]

373
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,790
[Wrong, wrong, wrong! Spring remains
the same, but her frame grew thin]

374
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,260
[Tears washed away the rouge
and dampened her silk handkerchief]

375
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:55,590
Soft rosy hands, yellow sealed wine...

376
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,380
[The peach blossoms are falling,
by the empty waterside pavilion]

377
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,220
[Our oath to each other still remains,
yet I can no longer profess my love]

378
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,040
[Don't, don't, don't]

379
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,820
This is the Phoenix Hairpin.

380
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,970
But this Phoenix Hairpin

381
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,400
is in Prince Qi's handwriting.

382
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,160
How can this be?

383
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,750
How dare Prince Qi come here secretly?

384
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,170
There must be a scheme behind this.

385
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,030
I've already hinted to Prince Qi

386
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,430
about what has happened.

387
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,480
I just hope Prince Qi

388
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,150
won't be manipulated by others.

389
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,270
Could it be...

390
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,790
that Prince Qi knew
something happened to you,

391
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,190
so he came back secretly?

392
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,590
After all, Prince Qi also
has feelings for you, My Lady.

393
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,440
Prince Qi's words

394
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,510
must be a warning.

395
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,350
It seems...

396
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,350
their goal is to harm His Majesty.

397
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,550
Wan, burn it.

398
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,520
Yes, My Lady.

399
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,240
My Lady.

400
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,100
My Lady, what's wrong?

401
00:21:59,250 --> 00:21:59,780
[Under the west window,
the wind shakes the bamboo]

402
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,320
[Like an old friend has arrived]

403
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,040
Yang Yun, go as fast as you can.

404
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,440
You must deliver this note to His Majesty!

405
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,110
Yes, My Lady.

406
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,930
You must hurry.

407
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,660
Yes, My Lady.

408
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,340
Prince Qi suddenly returned.

409
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,590
It seems they can't wait any longer.

410
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,480
Kill him!

411
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,080
Protect His Majesty!

412
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,310
Your Majesty!

413
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,550
Have the reinforcements arrived?

414
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,360
General, they will be here soon.

415
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,230
Pack up your gear.

416
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,440
We'll enter the city before dark.

417
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,030
Yes, sir.

418
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,720
[Justice Bureau]

419
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
Grand Preceptor.

420
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,440
The Justice Bureau spotted
a merchant caravan entering the city,

421
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,310
heading straight for the palace gates.

422
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,160
It's very suspicious.

423
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,020
The scout said,

424
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,690
the leader appears to be Su Wencheng.

425
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,470
So Su Wencheng did not march south
to quell the rebellion.

426
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,480
There's something else going on.

427
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,860
Prince Qi.

428
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,900
It was you who sent poetry to Su Leyu,

429
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,080
trying to pass her a message.

430
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,680
You must know more about her, don't you?

431
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,450
Grand Preceptor.

432
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,540
I don't know anything more about Leyu.

433
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,170
Are you suspecting me?

434
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,250
When a pawn refuses to obey,

435
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,370
I don't mind scrapping the whole game.

436
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,690
Are you threatening me, Grand Preceptor?

437
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,500
You've been having an affair
with a palace concubine

438
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,450
and even exchanged love letters.

439
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,090
Prince Qi, imagine

440
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,210
the court's reaction
if this poem were made public.

441
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,480
What do you think would happen to Su Leyu?

442
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,770
Prince Qi,

443
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,360
you and Leyu were childhood friends,

444
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,960
and you've always loved her.

445
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,390
Help us succeed, Your Highness,

446
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,380
and I, Qin Cong, swear on my life,

447
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,910
that after we succeed,

448
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,270
you and Leyu can find
a beautiful, secluded place

449
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,700
to read, write poetry, and live happily.

450
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,010
Wouldn't that be nice?

451
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,880
Before that,

452
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,440
I want to see Leyu.

453
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,110
Fine. I'll arrange it tonight
as soon as possible.

454
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,170
Yang Yun, you're back.

455
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,480
What happened?

456
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,480
I... I was on my way back,

457
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,120
and I heard people saying...

458
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,990
that the Marquis...

459
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,250
What happened to him?

460
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,510
He suffered
a devastating defeat in the battle.
