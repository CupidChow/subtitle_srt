1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,320
I have to say...

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,750
this scheme of yours
to pit enemies against each other

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,640
is brilliant.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,000
This Ghost Soldiers Passing tactic

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,130
used the enemy's force to strike back.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,760
If Su Leyu finds out about the truth,

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,880
she'll just help His Majesty
bring down the Xi family.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,480
If she fails to uncover the truth,

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,810
it can still
weaken the Su family's power.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,760
Either way,
you can remain in an unbeatable position.

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,640
This tactic

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,730
is brilliant.

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,690
Grand Preceptor, you're quite smart, too.

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,470
You're trying to
use the Xi family as a blade.

15
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,200
If the plan succeeds,
you can weaken His Majesty's power.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,860
If it fails,

17
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,960
you can force Xi Zimo to commit suicide

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,560
and write a confession statement.

19
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,850
You can cut losses in time
and hide behind the scenes

20
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,580
with no harm to yourself at all.

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,210
Princess Zhaoyang,

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,560
we're quite alike.

23
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,430
Princess Zhaoyang doesn't

24
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,830
exist in Dacang anymore.

25
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,920
We're just black and white pieces

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,040
in this chess game.

27
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,520
I still prefer

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,640
calling you Princess.

29
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,800
After all, your surname is Yin.

30
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,260
[Luminosity Behind The Palace]

31
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,090
[Xianming Hall]

32
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,180
Princess Zhaoyang.

33
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,750
Tonight is Consort Xian's wedding night.

34
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,710
She can't receive guests now.

35
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,310
Wan.

36
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,730
Let her come in.

37
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,280
Yes.

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,500
This is a wedding gift for you.

39
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,650
I'm here to congratulate you
on your wedding.

40
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,840
May you and His Majesty
be like paired lovebirds

41
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,440
and love each other forever.

42
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,360
You're blaming me,

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,460
aren't you?

44
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,400
I have other plans.

45
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,690
That's why I've made this choice.

46
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,910
You're saying that you have other plans.

47
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,640
But in fact,
you've already chosen Yin Changyan.

48
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,780
Have you heard?

49
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,280
Yin Changyan has promoted Yue Menglin

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,150
to Minister of Revenue

51
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,210
to replace Xi Zimo.

52
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,590
He let Yue Menglin be the role model

53
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,240
and showed it to the whole country.

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,420
He used such cunning
and monarchical tactics.

55
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,880
But you didn't realize it?

56
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,310
You even helped him
eliminate his opponents?

57
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,970
Have you ever considered that

58
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,030
although Yang Yun was imprisoned,

59
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,610
we rescued her so easily

60
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,220
and we weren't hunted down afterwards?

61
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,840
The prison of the Court of Judicial Review

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,670
is not a place
where people can be rescued so easily.

63
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,710
I believe he was trying to buy time

64
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,400
for us

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,360
so that we could solve the case quickly.

66
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,280
So what?

67
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,750
He merely used you

68
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,810
to solve the case quickly
and establish his authority.

69
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,630
No matter what,

70
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,590
he saved my brother.

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,120
Yes.

72
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,560
General Su was exonerated,

73
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,470
and now you're going to be his consort.

74
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,680
The Su family's military power

75
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,410
is what he cares about the most.

76
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,020
Yin Cong, watch your tongue.

77
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,710
This country belongs to His Majesty,

78
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,770
and he can retrieve

79
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,980
this military power whenever he wants to.

80
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,290
You're still defending him now?

81
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,300
Back then, I asked you to leave with me.

82
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,550
But you said you would stay
for the sake of the country.

83
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,400
I think these were all just your excuses.

84
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,710
You just can't forget him.

85
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,770
It's not like that.

86
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,800
You witnessed

87
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,519
how he forced the empress
to abdicate and killed her.

88
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,750
But you still decided to
marry Yin Changyan

89
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,950
and be his consort.

90
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,920
How can you live up to
the late empress's expectations?

91
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
Are you worthy of

92
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,980
the golden age of Dacang you spoke of?

93
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,680
Yin Cong.

94
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,830
No matter how others misunderstand me,
it's fine.

95
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,630
But you can't misunderstand me.

96
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,750
I've never forgotten that night

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,960
at the Xuanji Pavilion.

98
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,600
I don't even dare to
forget the late empress's teachings.

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,730
Then why do you still want to marry him?

100
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,950
I once promised the late empress

101
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,120
that I would protect Dacang,

102
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,570
so I won't break my promise.

103
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,430
No matter what my status is,

104
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,310
I will do what I can for Dacang,

105
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,910
regardless of life or death.

106
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,610
His Majesty is here!

107
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,909
Greetings, Your Majesty.

108
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,730
You had an argument with Yin Cong?

109
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,800
Because you entered the palace

110
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,000
to be my consort?

111
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,670
Yin Cong only came here
to congratulate me.

112
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,140
She even brought a gift.

113
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,370
You ungrateful child!

114
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,120
Your Majesty, please forgive her.

115
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,900
I think you know
what Yin Cong's temperament is like.

116
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,870
She was just drunk

117
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,630
and muddle-headed,

118
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,240
acting impulsively
without thinking clearly.

119
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,409
I know she's angry,

120
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,630
and I can forgive her.

121
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,870
But with her temperament like this,

122
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,630
if she acts impulsively and causes trouble

123
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,560
again and again,

124
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,300
I will show no leniency.

125
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,440
I will

126
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,230
definitely remind her often.

127
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,210
Stand up.

128
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,210
In the past few days,

129
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,850
you've been busy with Wencheng's affairs

130
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,430
and have been mentally exhausted.

131
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,710
Today, it happens to
be the Mid-Autumn Festival.

132
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,040
Wencheng should be back at home now
after being exonerated.

133
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,810
You can go home to take a look, too.

134
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,270
Your Majesty.

135
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,030
What's wrong?

136
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,270
I...

137
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,680
just feel that

138
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,600
my brother's problem has just been solved,

139
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,430
and there are countless eyes in the court

140
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,090
watching Your Majesty and me.

141
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,610
If I leave the palace and go home now,

142
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,530
I'm afraid it'll cause gossip

143
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,730
and bring criticism upon Your Majesty.

144
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,180
It doesn't matter.

145
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,830
Consort Shu
has also asked for my permission

146
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,280
to go home and visit her family,

147
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,810
so you're not an exception.

148
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,780
I'd like to

149
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,520
thank Your Majesty for your kindness.

150
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,590
Leyu, one day if you marry me,

151
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,730
I'll personally make a crown
for your coronation.

152
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,500
How about making it with these camellias?

153
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,280
This Consort Xian is not that special.

154
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,620
On her wedding night,

155
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,510
she was left alone here like this.

156
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,430
Come and take a look!

157
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,100
Make way, please!

158
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,890
Sister!

159
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,440
Brother!

160
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,210
Brother.

161
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,110
You've suffered so much.

162
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,550
Thank you for running around outside

163
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,470
to help me.

164
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,250
I'm just glad you're back.

165
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,080
Come here.

166
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,460
Come on. Let's eat.

167
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,090
There are mooncakes,

168
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,280
chicken soup,

169
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,300
tofu and fish.

170
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,960
Hurry up. Eat while the food is hot.

171
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,390
Okay.

172
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,630
Leyu! Mr. Su!

173
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,150
Am I too late?

174
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,090
Yin Cong.

175
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,040
Sit down and eat with us.

176
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,850
Leyu.

177
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,910
I was drunk that day

178
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,360
and spoke without thinking.

179
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,900
I never meant to blame you.

180
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,840
Yin Cong.

181
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,570
How could there be any grudges between us?

182
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,600
But the wedding gift you gave me that day

183
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,060
showed your provocation.

184
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,330
Don't do such things again.

185
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,990
Have I caused trouble for you?

186
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,220
Sister.

187
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,210
What are you two

188
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,400
whispering about?

189
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,290
Nothing.

190
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,460
Sit down and eat with us.

191
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:14,840
Okay.

192
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,860
Come on. Sit down.

193
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,000
Come on. Drink my wine.

194
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,600
Okay.

195
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,210
Mr. Su.

196
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,780
This toast is to your exoneration

197
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,440
and your bright future ahead.

198
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,390
Leyu.

199
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,190
This toast is to you too

200
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,330
as my apology.

201
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,920
Cheers.

202
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:33,930
Cheers.

203
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,860
It still tastes the same as before.

204
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,950
Leyu.

205
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,440
As for the matter
of you entering the palace,

206
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
I'm not only confused

207
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,770
but also quite worried.

208
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,290
The Su family
is in a delicate position now.

209
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,000
His Majesty regards you
as the late empress's old officials

210
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,060
while the noble families regard you
as imperial members

211
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,790
and His Majesty's supporters.

212
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,400
Now the Su family

213
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,770
is truly in a dilemma.

214
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,070
Leyu.

215
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,180
With the Su family's current situation,

216
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,340
which side will you take?

217
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,760
The Su family is just the Su family.

218
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,650
We'll side with Dacang

219
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,370
and the people.

220
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,780
We will never align ourselves
with any particular side.

221
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,180
This is truly what Su Leyu is like.

222
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,540
Let's not talk about these things now.

223
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,200
Today, it's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

224
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,130
Let's only talk about the full moon

225
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,970
and reunion.

226
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,680
Come on.

227
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,140
Come on.

228
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,680
Cheers.

229
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,850
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

230
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,880
The full moon.

231
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,800
Reunion.

232
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,630
I remember how His Majesty always

233
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,280
used the excuse of loving our mooncakes

234
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,440
to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival with us.

235
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,020
But now...

236
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,360
[Ningzheng Hall]

237
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,880
Your Majesty.

238
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,380
Be careful, Your Majesty.

239
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,080
I remember
during the festivals in the past,

240
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,620
my mother would hang

241
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,200
wish-bearing wind chimes
all over the courtyard.

242
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,870
Their constant tinkling

243
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,300
reminded us to stay vigilant
even in times of peace.

244
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,630
Even with the music disturbing the ears,

245
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,170
we must cultivate inner peace.

246
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,290
Your Majesty,

247
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,650
hanging wish-bearing wind chimes
during the Mid-Autumn Festival

248
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,650
is also meant to pray for blessings.

249
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,230
Shall I ask someone to take them down?

250
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,260
No need.

251
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,740
I want to be alone for a while.

252
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,000
Yes.

253
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,260
Mother.

254
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,090
Today, it's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

255
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,530
The whole country is celebrating.

256
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,530
Why don't we...

257
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,490
Remember.

258
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,640
To walk the path we've chosen,

259
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,230
we're destined to endure loneliness.

260
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,900
Just like the sun,

261
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,320
the more brightly it shines,

262
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,580
the lonelier it seems.

263
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,840
A monarch

264
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,690
is just like a solitary peak
above an abyss.

265
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,940
Though he can watch
all the small mountains from the top,

266
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,670
there will be no one
standing beside him anymore.

267
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,070
If you feel lonely in the future,

268
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,210
come listen to
the sounds of these wind chimes.

269
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,160
[When the wind stops
and the chimes become silent,]

270
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,490
[you'll realize that all glory has faded]

271
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,980
[and you must walk alone till the end.]

272
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,250
Two yards are full of moonlight
while one yard is full of frost.

273
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,400
The wind chimes in the Buddha Hall
keep ringing all night.

274
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,100
Even when the moon is full,

275
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,300
it's still hard
to be reunited with my family.

276
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,930
Didn't I say
I wanted to be alone for a while?

277
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,210
Eunuch Xu has told me

278
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,840
you haven't
eaten any mooncakes tonight.

279
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,800
Didn't you go home for the family reunion?

280
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,880
Why are you back?

281
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,590
My brother said

282
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,670
you loved pastries
and sweet food the most.

283
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,990
He specially asked me

284
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,609
to bring some back here

285
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,060
so that you could taste them.

286
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,120
Wencheng always thinks

287
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,290
the sweeter it is, the more I like it.

288
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,840
He always brings me pastries
with preserved fruits filling.

289
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,150
But only you know

290
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,610
I actually prefer mashed potatoes filling.

291
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,680
Leyu.

292
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,000
[Leyu.]

293
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,960
[Do you know
after that night at the Xuanji Pavilion,]

294
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,820
[the bitterness in my heart]

295
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,510
[has been like a stone]

296
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,570
[pressing down on me so hard
that I can hardly breathe?]

297
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,330
It's better to shatter as jade

298
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,740
than survive as a tile.

299
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,660
In Your Majesty's heart,

300
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,190
there are also

301
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,540
some unspoken

302
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,020
difficulties?

303
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,270
Leyu.

304
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,300
Do you know

305
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,690
my difficulties?
