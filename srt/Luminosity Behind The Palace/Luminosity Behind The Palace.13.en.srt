that I have no ambition
for official positions.

at night while reading reports?

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,310
a ruler is like the moon—

They fear looking at their sovereign
might bring them punishment

be what the late empress
would have wanted.

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,030
since I've returned to court,

173
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,630
I cannot come empty-handed.

I am all ears.

176
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,600
First,

177
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,110
make official evaluations public,

178
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,850
and promote those
with outstanding achievements.

Second,

180
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,540
abolish the system of
noble family recommendations

181
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,270
to prevent examination fraud.

182
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,290
Third, redistribute public lands

to curb land grabbing by noble families.

184
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,240
Fourth,

185

carefully select officials at all levels

from noble families.

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,910
Of course I do.

190
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,470
What I seek is a clear and bright world,

191
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,720
an enduring state,

192
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,000
and peace for all people.

193
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,700
We officials should
devote ourselves to the state,

194
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,060
working tirelessly day and night.

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Grand Preceptor,

196
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,680
wouldn't you agree?

197
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,240
Your Majesty,

198
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm willing to lead
the Ministry of Revenue

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,060
in supporting the four new policies.

200
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,540
I also support the new policies.

201
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,790
Grand Preceptor,

202
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,790
what do you think?

203
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,960
I too support it.

204
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,170
But implementing any new policy
will face difficulties.

205
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,240
Director Yin helped solve
the Number Three Scholar case,

206
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,750
which demonstrates her
exceptional abilities.

207
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,120
With these new policies
about to be implemented,

208
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,080
I believe

209
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,390
Director Yin should be the most

210
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,480
suitable one to be in charge.

211
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,750
Director Yin

212
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,200
lacks experience.

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,330
Since Mr. Lu proposed these new policies,

214
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,030
he shall take charge himself.

215
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

216
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,240
From this day,

217
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,200
Lu Jiuzhang is promoted
to Chief Secretary,

218
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,720
concurrently Scholar
of the Hanlin Academy,

219
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,320
attending to me at all times.

220
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,630
Thank you for Your Majesty's grace.

221
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,150
[Xianming Hall]

222
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,610
Leyu!

223
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,400
Your Majesty.

224
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

225
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,000
Rise now.

226
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,670
I just heard from the imperial physician

227
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,910
that you're pregnant,

228
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,040
so I came right away.

229
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,600
Set the rewards down

230
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,790
and you may all leave.

231
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,850
Yes, Your Majesty.

232
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,410
Your Majesty need not
make such a grand fuss.

233
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,000
No,

234
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,200
I must make a fuss over this.

235
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,970
When winter comes,

236
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,790
your hands are always cold

237
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,320
no matter inside or out.

238
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,270
I've had them put scented coal and spices

239
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,600
in this hand-warmer.

240
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,220
Keep it with you.

241
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,320
With this hand warmer,

242
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,270
even in the depths of winter,

243
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,550
it feels like spring.

244
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,680
Your Majesty,

245
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,440
the sugar on the persimmon has melted,

246
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,390
making it soft and sweet,

247
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,720
especially delicious.

248
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,690
Our Changyan

249
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,790
loves sweets so much.

250
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,270
Here.

251
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,850
How is it?

252
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,560
This snowy view is beautiful.

253
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,520
"As dusk falls and snow begins,

254
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,250
shall we share a cup?"

255
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,200
Such is winter's finest delight.

256
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,760
The new year is approaching.

257
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,240
Auspicious snow
foretells a prosperous year.

258
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,170
It's going to be another good year.

259
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,680
Before the new year,

260
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,480
the examination of new officials
must be completed.

261
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,210
Days like this when I can
leisurely enjoy the snow

262
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,810
are becoming rare.

263
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,550
Although Prime Minister Lu's
four new policies

264
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,410
have Your Majesty's protection,

265
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,910
it still need to
be implemented from scratch

266
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,040
and will inevitably face challenges.

267
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,960
And Your Majesty and Prime Minister Lu
are both at the eye of the storm.

268
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,320
I have some ideas

269
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,070
that I'd like Your Majesty to consider.

270
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,880
Sit down and tell me.

271
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,960
I believe

272
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,550
Your Majesty could establish
a new government office

273
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,860
to restrict officials

274
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,390
and prevent abuse of power.

275
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,000
This office would have no real authority,

276
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,970
only executing Your Majesty's orders,

277
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,970
providing counsel and giving those

278
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,140
from humble families
a chance to serve the state.

279
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,330
This way,

280
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,700
Prime Minister Lu's first policy

281
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,580
can be better implemented.

282
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,400
This would indeed help
restrict the noble families,

283
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,100
but it requires
virtuous officials in charge.

284
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,670
If this office falls into
the hands of noble families,

285
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,070
even without real power,

286
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,080
they would still turn it into a mess.

287
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,940
If Your Majesty trusts me,

288
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,180
I suggest

289
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,460
establishing the Hongwen Academy

290
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,270
in the name of imperial benevolence,

291
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,300
recruiting scholars
from humble families

292
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,480
under the pretext of literary exchange.

293
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,630
Regardless of background

294
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,720
or gender,

295
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,500
talents may be gathered to serve Dacang.

296
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,420
One day,

297
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,320
the state shall be peaceful,

298
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,150
the fields lush,

299
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,870
and the court filled with fragrance.

300
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,450
Leyu,

301
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,950
the Su family is already
in a precarious position.

302
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,320
I fear this might bring
even greater troubles to you.

303
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,130
When the Great Way prevails,

304
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,470
the world belongs to all.

305
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,880
If everyone could enter officialdom
through examinations,

306
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,390
it would truly be the foundation
of Dacang's prosperity.

307
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,520
We cannot back down.

308
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,390
For the public good, not private gain.

309
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,050
Graciously establishing
the Hongwen Academy,

310
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,060
and you're with child now.

311
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,010
I shall choose an auspicious date

312
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,710
to make you Empress.

313
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,030
Your Majesty...

314
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,210
Leyu, do not refuse.

315
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,410
With your talent, reputation,
and contributions,

316
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,760
you are worthy of the position.

317

who ushers in a prosperous era]

[must have
a virtuous and capable wife.]

[In my eyes,
among our generation,]

321
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,550
[only you deserve
to be called virtuous and capable.]

322
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,750
Mother laughed at my wishful thinking.

323
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,500
I've been thinking about it

324
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,089
and couldn't sleep all night.

325
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,720
Changyan,

326
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,730
it's not just wishful thinking.

327
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,510
[Justice Bureau]

328
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,590
Director Yin, I've followed
your instructions

329
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,790
and made that wood into a pen holder box.

330
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,510
This winter brew
is perfect for snowy days.

331
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,480
In the old days,

332
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
your mother would start brewing this wine

333
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,270
before the Mid-Autumn Festival.

334
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,960
By the time of the first snow,

335
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,590
she would brew Tusu wine,

336
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,480
to be enjoyed during New Year.

337
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,790
Grand Preceptor,
are you here about the Hongwen Academy?

338
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,470
His Majesty
established the Hongwen Academy,

339
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,930
yet it's the Su family
who's stealing the spotlight.

340
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,260
After the Number Three Scholar case,

341
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,190
Su Leyu's reputation has soared.

342
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,220
It's only natural
that His Majesty would let

343
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,020
the Su family have their moment.

344
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,790
This Su Leyu

345
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,200
truly lives up
to the late empress's teachings.

346
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,090
Using you as her instrument,

347
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,880
she not only cleared her name,

348
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,790
but also won
the reverence of the scholars

349
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,370
led by Liu Wenchong.

350
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,910
Now she even carries the imperial heir,

351
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,250
and the two are bound with deep affection.

352
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,570
I hear His Majesty
will soon make her Empress.

353
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,400
And you?

354
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,770
You work tirelessly
solving cases for them,

355
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,810
with only me
to request rewards on your behalf.

356
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,520
In the end,

357
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,550
you get nothing.

358
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,160
Lu Jiuzhang has offended many people,

359
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,510
and the noble families
are quite displeased with Su Leyu.

360
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,400
I'd like everyone in the state to know

361
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,350
about this Consort Xian's means.

Yin Cong,

368
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,090
you can speak frankly with me.

369
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,780
Why are you hesitating?

370
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,770
Have you heard the rumors?

371

spread wildly among the people.

374
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,470
Naturally, I have heard.

375
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,720
If one acts with integrity,

376
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,880
why fear rumors?

377
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,130
Abolishing recommendations,

378
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,030
testing officials,

379
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,940
enforcing strict promotions and demotions—

380
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,290
these are all things
the late empress wanted to do

381
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,750
but couldn't accomplish.

382
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,090
Now His Majesty has achieved them.

383
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,790
But all the blame

384
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,880
falls upon you.

385
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,340
He's using you as a shield.

386
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
In times of peace,

387
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,400
guard yourself with righteousness.

388
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
In times of chaos,

389
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,290
sacrifice yourself for righteousness.

390
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,750
Even if I must die for my principles,

391
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,550
I am willing to brave any danger.

392
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,510
The words Your Majesty spoke during that chess game

393
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,200
you remember quite clearly.

394
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,900
But it would be you

395
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,810
dying for principles,

396
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,130
not him.

397
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,300
His Majesty is so calculating

398
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,110
that he can manipulate circumstances

399
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,240
to make everything serve his purpose.

400
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,200
He even manipulated
the late empress with ease,

401
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,410
let alone you.

402
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,880
Implementing the new policies

403
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,720
is also the late empress's wish.

404
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,000
I believe,

405
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,370
if you're willing,

406
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,600
with both of us helping Changyan,

407
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,750
the new policies will surely succeed.

408
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,740
If you're unwilling,

409
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,850
there's no need to force yourself.

410
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,750
But do not speak such divisive words

411
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,300
to me again.

412
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,210
I've spoken out of turn.

413
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,840
I won't mention it again.

414
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,270
But that night at Xuanji Pavilion,

415
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,750
I simply cannot forget it.

416
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,280
Have you forgotten...

417
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,510
One must observe both words and actions
to know someone's heart.

418
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,790
What happened that night is already past.

419
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,220
Your obsession with it

420
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,750
is only causing yourself
unnecessary distress.

421
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,610
This is not what
the late empress would have wanted.

422
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
You may leave now.

423
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,000
Leyu.

424
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:19,980
Leyu,

425
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,720
I mean nothing else.

426
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,210
I just hope you may
live a life of peace and safety,

427
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,140
and not be dragged by affection into

428
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,140
the bloody storm of court politics.

429
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,080
By the way,

430
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,450
besides the longevity gold lock,

431
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,500
this wooden box

432
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,750
was also carefully crafted
by a master I commissioned.

433
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,510
I know you mind
the rift between His Majesty and me.

434
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,400
Consider this

435
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,510
my apology for what I said earlier.

436
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,540
Give it to him as a pen holder.

437
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,830
May you wield the pen as a blade,

438
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,270
to complete what
the late emperor left unfinished

439
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,600
and to select talents for the state.

440
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,680
Not letting the capable
sink into obscurity;

to rise to high positions.

Great.

Your Majesty,

459
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,740
when selecting an auspicious date
for the empress's coronation yesterday,

460
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,800
I saw Mars shining unusually bright,

461
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,540
and the Ziwei Star darkened.

463
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,960
This is an omen of great chaos.

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,880
Your Majesty,

465
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:46,310
yesterday's urgent report stated

[Star Map]

467
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,400
that bandits
are causing unrest in the south.

468
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,510
Now rumors run rampant:

469
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,070
"When the hen crows at dawn,

470
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,680
the Ziwei star falls into chaos."

471
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,660
Now with bandits rebelling in the south

472
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,190
and the Ziwei Star dimming,

473
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,130
these prophecies are coming true.

474
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,330
I implore Your Majesty
to heed heaven's will.

475
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
Grand Preceptor,

476
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,640
what do you mean by heeding heaven's will?

477
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,850

[Star Map]

479
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,530
I humbly suggest

480
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,590
that in the matter of
establishing Empress,

481
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,160
may Your Majesty reconsider.

482
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,800

[Star Map]

484
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,720
Heaven has sent its warning,

00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,980
and we must not defy it!

486
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,240
May Your Majesty reconsider!

487
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,920
May Your Majesty reconsider!

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,180
What should I reconsider?

489
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,450
Since I ascended the throne,

490
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,550
the position of empress
has remained vacant.

491
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,480
Now that Consort Xian is with child,

492
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,060
she should naturally be made Empress!

[Star Map]

494
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,400
Since ancient times,
the harem has stayed out of politics,

495
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,750
yet Consort Xian has repeatedly

496
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,800
disrupted court affairs.

And the Su family has controlled
significant military power for years.

498
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,280
If Consort Xian is made Empress,

499
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,510
it may invite criticism
from people

500
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,530
saying Your Majesty favors
and relies on in-laws.

501
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,790
And it may bring great

calamity to Dacang.

been loyal for generations,
