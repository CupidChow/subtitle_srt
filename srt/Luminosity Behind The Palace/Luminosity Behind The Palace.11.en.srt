00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,079
related to this matter?

56
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,030
I discovered that in the guest lists of

birthday celebrations,

58
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,840
there were many students who had just
taken the imperial examination.

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,630

those students attending the banquets

99

102
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,470
At that time,
we happened to be facing foreign invasion,

103
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,590

to resist the enemy.

She had no choice but to
consider the bigger picture,

so she dismissed me from office

From that moment on,

108
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,710

about Dacang's political situation.

110
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,740
After that,

111
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,090
I took my family and retreated
to live in seclusion in the mountains.

112
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,100
I taught Yueying from a young age
about etiquette, integrity,

113
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,900
and the principles of
being a righteous person.

114
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,410
Yueying also befriended many scholars
from humble families

115

and people with great ambition.

116
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,490
In them,

117
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,890
I saw hope for Dacang once again.

118
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,410
But the noble families were
really powerful,

119
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,269
and I worried that if discovered,

120
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,690
it would affect
the future of those scholars.

121
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,450
So,

122
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,700
I used the legend of
the fox demon as a pretext

123
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,430
to only teach at night.

124
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,030
Mr. Lu.

125
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,720
Later, Yueying discovered

126
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,950
the evidence I had hidden
in my poetry collection.

127
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,550
She learned I had been framed
by noble families

128
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,159
and decided to clear my name.

129
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,580
I knew this was like
throwing eggs against a rock,

130
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,800
so I removed the evidence

131
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,310

that's your choice.

But if it's for anything else,

"When the Great Way is followed,
the world belongs to all."

145
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,280
The sages traveled through various states

146
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,940
only to advise rulers
to practice benevolent governance.

153
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,270
I failed to stop her.

00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,420
It's my fault that she died.

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,480

156
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,790
please forgive my incompetence.

157
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,740
I couldn't even protect my own daughter.

158
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,090
How could I possibly protect
scholars across the land?

159
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,690
Regarding Yueying's death,

160
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,060
it's better not to investigate further.

161
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,440
Don't you want to seek justice
for your daughter?

162
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,700
Lu Yueying, full of talent and ambition,

163
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,580
only to be falsely accused

164
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,350
of cheating after her death.

165
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,040
Of course I want to!

166
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,660
But if I tried to clear her name,

167
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,510
those passionate scholars

168
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,990
would surely follow suit.

169
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,910
If they were to face retaliation
from noble families because of this,

170
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,620
I would be harming them.

171
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,570
I am well aware that
the court has been corrupt for years,

172
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,060
with noble families controlling
the imperial examinations

173
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,750
and blocking talented people's paths.

174
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,950
I have always desired

175
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,790
to break this corrupt system

176
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,650
and to establish
a fairer selection process,

177
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,640
allowing talented individuals

178
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,840
to serve the court

179
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,420
regardless of gender.

180
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,000
Mr. Lu.

181
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,850
This was also the late empress's wish.

182
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,960
The imperial examination
was never easy for women.

183
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,320
Lu Yueying had great aspirations,

184
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,520
exceptional talent,

185
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,020
and could have had a brilliant future.

186
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,170
Yet she risked offending noble families

187
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,570
to fight for a fair chance
for all scholars.

188
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,300
Are you willing to hide like this
for the rest of your life?

189
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,980
You are the father
Lu Yueying admired most,

190
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,070
yet you've been trying to protect yourself
and avoid trouble,

191
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,270
neither fighting for
a fairer examination system

192
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,190
nor defending your daughter
against false accusations.

193
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:30,870
Mr. Lu.

194
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,409
When you meet your daughter
in the afterlife,

195
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,870
how will you face her?

196
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,380
I've spent half my life drifting,

197
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,830
like a dull knife being worn down,

198
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,430
not realizing I had become
so numb and decayed.

199
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,510
Your words today, Your Highness,

200
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,920
have awakened me.

201
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,630
Very well.

202
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,750
Today, I'll

203
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,120
join Your Majesty

204
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,940
and Your Highness,

205
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,000
join all scholars,

206
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,980
and join Yueying

207
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,110
to clear the skies

208
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,120
and cleanse the world!

209
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,000
I hid the list

210
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,900
sewn inside this garment.

211
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,320
Just compare it with those
who passed the examination that year,

212
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,049
and you'll discover the truth.

213
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,270
Thank you, Sir.

214
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,940
You stay here with Mr. Lu.

215
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,010
I'll be right back.

216
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,370
Leyu,

217
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,230
you must be extra careful.

218
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,140
You too.

219
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,070
[Ningzheng Hall]

220
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,710
Your Majesty.

221
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,220
I have verified that

222
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,970
those on the birthday banquet list

223
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,550
are indeed all those who passed
the imperial examination that year.

224
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,000
Now,

225
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,320
they've all been appointed as officials

226
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,040
in various regional prefectures

227
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,770
or as key personnel in Zhongdu.

228
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,320
I just compared the lists,

229
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,450
and this Wang Lin seems very suspicious.

230
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,350
Go investigate the Hanlin Academy scholar,
Wang Lin,

231
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,750
to see if he ever held

232
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,360
similar banquets
before or after the imperial examination.

233
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,870
If so,

234
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,440
be sure to verify it thoroughly.

235
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,100
As you command, Your Majesty.

236
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,310
Your Majesty,

237
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,590
as you ordered,

238
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,790
we've arranged secret protection
for the academy

239
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,030
and Mr. Lu.

240
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,790
Recently, Wang Lin

241
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,360
held a grand birthday celebration
for his mother.

242
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,820
The people on the gift list

243
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,920
were all
on the second-rank candidate list.

244
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,730
Wang Lin?

245
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,360
So the person Liu Wenchong saw that night

246
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,840
who was arguing with Lu Yueying

247
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,920
could be Wang Lin.

248
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,080
Because Wang Lin
can be addressed as a scholar.

249
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,840
And

250
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,400
in the darkness of night,

251
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,160
Liu Wenchong might have been mistaken.

252
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,730
They are now using the same method

253
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,760
to bribe the examiners.

254
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,510
As long as they don't tamper with
the top three candidates,

255
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,470
it won't attract too much attention.

256
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,440
Wang Lin must have wanted
to win Lu Yueying over,

257
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,840
which is why they argued.

258
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,840
Having secured the top three,

259
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,010
they'd then assign those
who passed the imperial examination

260
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,550
to various important positions

261
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,600
through noble family recommendations.

262
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,260
In this way,

263
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,200
Dacang would be
completely under their control.

264
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,350
Your Majesty,

265
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,730
we must act decisively,

266
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,930
or it may drag on and cause more trouble.

267
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,930
Speaking of how to investigate Wang Lin,

268
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:45,560
it seems

269
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,120
the Justice Bureau must step in.

270
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,080
How about I disguise myself
as an officer from the Justice Bureau

271
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,190
and join the operation?

272
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,190
What do you think?

273
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,740
Then be sure to be very careful.

274
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,550
You must be hungry.

275
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,740
I've brought some food
specially for Your Majesty.

276
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,470
Your Majesty has a sweet tooth.

277
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,440

You must be quick.

00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:58,910
Got it!

331
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,430
His Majesty sent you to spy on me?

332
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,380
For that usurper,

333
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,270
you're certainly giving your all.

334
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,150
You aren't really a traitor,

335
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,050
so why would there be any talk of spying?

336
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,440
Yin Cong.

337
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,440
The hidden tumor will soon be exposed.

338
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,510
We'd better focus on the matter at hand.

339
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,480
My Lord.

340
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,960
There's nothing suspicious
inside the mansion.

341
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,760
Nothing found over here either.

342
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,360
Lord Yin!

343
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,910
What's this supposed to mean?

344
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,670
Lord Wang.

345
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,170
Don't be nervous.

346
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,480
Let me go!

347
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,800
Let me go!

348
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:25,970
Lord Yin!

349
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,760
Please show mercy, Lord Yin!

350
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,570
Lord Yin!

351
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,670
Lord Wang.

352
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,280
You truly have remarkable achievements
in governance.

353
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,820
You'll have to come with me.

354
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,590
Your Majesty.

355
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,110
The Justice Bureau has investigated
Wang Lin's household

356
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,040
and found a great deal of illegal wealth
as expected.

357
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,210
The members of the Wang family

358
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,100
must be eradicated completely.

359
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,310
[Justice Bureau]

360
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,500
The 29th year of Jianing...

361
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,860
September 6, 29th year of Jianing.

362
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,910
My guess was right.

363
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,860
That night, a group of officers
from the Justice Bureau

364
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,320
did go to Xuanji Pavilion.

365
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,750
There's no record here

366
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,200
of them reporting back,

367
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,410
which means...

368
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,650
Which means they never returned.

369
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,930
The Justice Bureau Duty Log.

370
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,910
Leyu, you've been investigating me.

371
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,080
So you're indeed spying on me
for Yin Changyan.

372
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,380
Director Yin.

373
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,690
How does it feel

374
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,920
to be betrayed?

375
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,000
What brings you here so late at night,
Grand Preceptor?

376
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,330
I've come to ask for a favor, of course.

377
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,220
The mighty Grand Preceptor,
with all your power,

378
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,330
coming to ask a mere Director
like me for help?

379
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,990
Su Leyu and Yin Changyan

380
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,550
have so little faith in you.

381
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,950
Don't you want to do something about it?

382
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,920
What do you want me to do,
Grand Preceptor?

383
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,140
Show your loyalty to
His Majesty and Consort Xian,

384
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,970
then we can plan our next move.

385
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,780
What makes you think

386
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,210
I would take your side?

387
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,600
The Xi family is gone,

388
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,860
and the Wang family will soon follow.

389
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,680
The Qin family will be next.

390
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,180
You will agree,

391
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,170
Qin Cong.

392
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,710
Go find something for me.

393
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,670
What is it?

394
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,990
It grows in extremely damp,
shaded places in the mountains.

395
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,050
Search carefully.

396
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,640
Yes.

397
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,010
[Imperial Academy]

398
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,970
News just came from the palace that

399
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,320
the investigation into
the examination fraud case is complete.

400
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,580
Hanlin Academy scholar Wang Lin
has been dismissed,

401
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,890
and his family's property
has been confiscated.

402
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:31,620
In one month,

403
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,830
the imperial examination
will be held again.

404
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,550
What?

405
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,970
The imperial examination
will be held again?

406
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,960
Although Wang Lin has been dismissed,

407
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,900
the noble families

408
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,230
still hold great power.

409
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,890
If this matter isn't
thoroughly investigated,

410
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,350
how can we put an end to the cheating?

411
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,070
That's right!

412
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,600
Exactly!

413
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,990
Not only that,

414
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,800
if the current imperial examination system
isn't reformed,

415
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,310
the poison of corruption
will surely return.

416
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,910
Everyone,

417
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,940
I am willing to represent us all

418
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,060
to beat the drum of grievance

419
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,260
and petition His Majesty!

420
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:55,700
Right!

421
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,880
Let's petition His Majesty!

422
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,190
Petition His Majesty!
Petition His Majesty!

423
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,160
[Justice Bureau]

424
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,960
Leyu, where are you going
dressed like this?

425
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,240
There are patrol officers on the streets.

426
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,640
What if you get spotted?

427
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,770
Why do you care about me?

428
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,000
Aren't you afraid I'd spy on you

429
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,460
for that usurper anymore?

430
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:22,920
Leyu.

431
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,160
I admit that whenever I think of
what happened at Xuanji Pavilion,

432
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,760
I'm always blinded by anger.

433
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,780
But from Wang Lin's case,

434
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,580
I can see His Majesty's determination
to restore the court.

435
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,030
Given the current situation of Dacang,

436
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,290
all that matters is peace and stability.

437
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,960
Leyu,

438
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,400
what we need to protect is Dacang,

439
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,760
isn't it?

440
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,170
Yin Cong, that's exactly
the right way to think.

441
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,060
Where are you going?

442
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,160
I can't keep hiding anymore.

443
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
Hiding forever isn't the solution.

444
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,050
Although the corruption case
has been thoroughly investigated,

445
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,370
if I continue to hide,

446
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,110
the wrongful conviction against Lu Yueying

447
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,370
will never be cleared,

448
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,110
and all the despicable schemes behind that

449
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,520
will be buried forever.

450
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,070
So you're going to...

451
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,960
That's right.

452
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,240
I believe in today's Dacang.

453
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:17,900
Let's go.

454
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,230
Petition His Majesty!
Petition His Majesty!

455
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,160
[Petition Drum Hall]

456
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,000
Everyone, please calm down.

457
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,830
Who are you?

458
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,620
Why are you stopping me?

459
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,710
You still need to take the imperial exams
in the future to enter officialdom.

460
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,340
If you beat the drum now,
you'd be opposing the authorities.

461
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,870
Don't ruin your own future.

462
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,830
Ruin my own future?

463
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,060
Our future

464
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,680
is about to be destroyed
by corrupt officials.

465
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,840
So why should we worry about
ruining it ourselves?

466
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,040
-Exactly!
-Exactly!

467
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,890
Right, why worry about
ruining it ourselves?

468
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,850
You are... Consort Xian?

469
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,430
She's from the Su family.

470
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,370
So you're the eldest daughter
of the Su family.

471
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,800
You noble families

472
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,440
are all cut from the same cloth.

473
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,170
-That's right!
-That's right!

474
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,300
Whether from noble families

475
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,430
or humble families,

476
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,080
everyone is equal.

477
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,150
You want to petition His Majesty, right?

478
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,310
I'll do it.

479
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,660
Great! Great!

480
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,690
Great! Great!

481
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,960
Great! Well struck!

482
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,140
Great! Well struck!

483
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
I, Su Leyu, am beating the drum today

484
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,300
not for myself, nor for the Su family.

485
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,950
I wish to seek justice for all scholars,

486
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,700
for Ming Qian,

487
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,430
and for Lu Yueying!

488
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:14,300
We want justice! We want justice!

489
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,110
Step back! Don't cause trouble!

490
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,260
Hurry, move!

491
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,120
What do you want?

492
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,160
The imperial examination fraud

493
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,690
disheartens the scholars.

494
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,160
I, Su Leyu, daughter of the Su family,

495
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,850
am beating the petition drum

496
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,420
for all scholars today,

497
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,350
requesting a re-investigation
of the imperial examination fraud case!
