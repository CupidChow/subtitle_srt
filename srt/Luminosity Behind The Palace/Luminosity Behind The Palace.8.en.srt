190

pleased to meet you.

191
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,690
You're from the Wang family?

192
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,030
What is it?

193
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,300

194
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,170

198
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,420
in joining my Wang family's team?

199
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,480
Lord Wang,

200
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,150
I know absolutely nothing about polo,

201
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:38,799

and also a Hanlin Academy scholar.

207
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,400
As they say, a wise bird chooses
the right tree to perch on.

208

At least let's be friends,

209
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:51,920
shall we?

210
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,190
I've also passed the imperial exam,

211

In the future at court,

213

we will be colleagues.

214
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,870
Lord Wang,

215
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,360
mind your words.

216
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,470
Such rudeness

217
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,860
from a mere woman.

218
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,310
If it weren't for

219
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,360
Lord Mingqian's strong recommendation,

220
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,710
you wouldn't even have sat for the exam.

221
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,470
And you think you'll be my colleague?

222

223
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,580
Then that

224
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,090
spares us further talk.

Wait.

00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,030
With such beauty and talent,

227
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,880
it's a shame if you don't

228

It really is a fox spirit.

Judging from the wound,

285
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,700
it was

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,340
Lord Feng,

379
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,680
you're clearly favoring the Su family.

380
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,790
Could it be

381
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,240
you're forming factions for personal gain?

382
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,210
Nonsense!

383
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,960
Your Majesty,

384
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,720
this case involves my sister,

385
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,250
and I should recuse myself.

386
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,170
But Lord Wang speaks with such certainty—

387
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,570
I cannot agree.

388
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,790
The Su family

389
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,390
has always been loyal

390
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,790
and dutiful,

391
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,140
and would never commit illegal acts.

392
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,510
I believe

393
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,320
the innocent will be proven so.

394
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,450
Your Majesty is wise

395
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,770
and will surely uncover the truth

396
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,520
to clear my family's name.

397
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,340
Your Majesty,

398
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,600
regardless of whether Lord Feng

399
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,790
has close ties with the Su family,

400
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,600
his judgment

401
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,060
is likely already biased.

402
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,100
I'm afraid he'll lose his impartiality

403
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,870
when investigating this case. I—

404
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,550
Enough.

405
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,200
Whether it's the Court of Judicial Review

406
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,690
or the Ministry of Justice,

407
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,390
I can no longer trust

408
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,960
either of you for future investigations.

409
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,750
Grand Preceptor,

410
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,440
Yin Cong has been
guarding the imperial tomb for a year

411
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,260
and will soon return to report her duties.

412
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,619
She's upright in character,

413
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,470
both a royal relative
and from a noble family,

414
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,470
and helped solve the Xi Zimo case.

415
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,619
I want to summon her back

416
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,420
to lead the Justice Bureau

417
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,109
and investigate this case.

418
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,020
Your Majesty is wise.

419
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,590
Your Majesty is wise.

420
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,940
[Grand Preceptor's Mansion]

421
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,710
Grand Preceptor,

422
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,120
it seems His Majesty

423
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,410
is determined to protect Su Leyu.

424
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,480
Even fish in a tank

425
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,190
sometimes need

426
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,680
different feed.

427
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,740
[Court of Judicial Review]

428
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,830
So this matter isn't simple.

429
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,160
They're targeting our Su family.

430
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,210
You must be very careful.

431
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,200
Brother,

432
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,350
don't worry.

433
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,510
The Court of Judicial Review
has always been fair

434
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,240
and won't mistreat prisoners.

435
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,220
I'll be going then.

436
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,440
[Ever-growing Radiance]

437
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

438
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,120
Have you assumed your position?

439
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,110
Yes.

440
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,660
I came to thank Your Majesty
for this honor.

441
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,150
I thought I'd guard
the imperial tombs all my life.

442
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,090
Never expecting

443
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,210
I could serve at court again.

444
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,900
I know you and Leyu
share a deep friendship.

445
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,870
You once earnestly advised her,

446
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,930
which shows your upright character.

447
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,710
Moreover,

448
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,720
when I married Consort Su,

449
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,710
you presented me with a significant gift.

450
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,920
I dare not presume Your Majesty's

451
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,720
deep meaning,

452
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,930
but since you've granted me this position,

453
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,070
I'll certainly serve with all my strength.

454
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,020
This case concerns Leyu's safety.

455
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,720
I trust you will do your utmost.

456
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,360
Your Majesty, Consort Su has

457
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,650
escaped from prison.

458
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,390
Lord Yin,

459
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,340
from the scene,

460
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,010
it seems Consort Su
struck the guard with a bowl shard

461
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,600
while food was served, then escaped.

462
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,650
[Taiji Palace]

463
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,130
Your Majesty, Consort Su's escape

464
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,600
surely proves her guilty conscience.

465
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,650
We must issue a warrant
across the provinces.

466
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,510
Once apprehended, all charges combined,

467
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,870
she must be severely punished.

468
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,440
The Court of Judicial Review
failed in its duty—

469
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,370
the guards too should be punished.

470
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,370
Your Majesty,

471
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,340
I've failed in my duty.

472
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,920
Lord Feng,

473
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,930
you think the admission of guilt

474
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,350
will let you off the hook?

475
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,860
Who knows if you
conspired with Consort Su?

476
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,650
Otherwise,

477
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,410
how could anyone
escape from the Court so easily?

478
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:17,850
You—

479
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,790
How dare you slander me!

480
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,640
Slandering you?

481
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,290
Enough.

482
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,070
This case has been
handed over to the Justice Bureau.

483
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,000
Lord Yin,

484
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,170
what's your opinion?

485
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,110
Your Majesty,

486
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,540
this case is riddled with doubts.

487
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,120
and we we must not jump to conclusions.

488
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,840
For now,

489
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,810
finding Consort Su is most urgent.

490
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,650
Your Majesty, if that's the case,

491
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,440
we should issue an arrest warrant

492
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,930
and apprehend the suspect
as soon as possible.

493
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,770
There are already rumors
spreading among the people.

494
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,060
If we don't resolve this quickly,

495
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,660
they might accuse
Your Majesty of favoritism,

496
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,130
and it would be hard
to silence such gossip.

497
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:02,950
Granted.

498
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,500
Let's go.

499
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,040
Let's go.
