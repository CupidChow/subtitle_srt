that those

If we want to uncover the truth
about what happened then,

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,630
Yin Cong?

189
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,460
I didn't expect to see you here.

190
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,550
This place borders the imperial tomb,

191
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,680
so I often come here for night hunting.

192
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,630
Thank goodness you showed up in time.

193
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,390
Otherwise,

194
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,840
we would have been in danger.

195
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,490
These assassins attacked fiercely,

196
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,000
yet they didn't strike to kill.

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,270
It seems they only wanted to stop us,

198
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,070
not to kill us.

199
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,670
Greetings, Your Majesty.

200
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,600
Now that Changding Bridge has collapsed

201
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,750
and Wen Cheng is imprisoned,

202
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,150
in such turbulent times,

203
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,850
you actually have the leisure

204
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,350
to hunt here at night.

205
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,370
By Your Majesty's order,
I keep vigil for the late empress.

206
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,080
I owe this leisure
to Your Majesty's generosity

207
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,480
in granting me such a comfortable posting.

208
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,820
I am not like Your Majesty,

209
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,720
who wields imperial power
and treats the world as a chessboard.

210
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,440
Even the late empress herself

211
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,100
is but a piece upon it,

212
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,080
let alone someone like me.

213
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,840
Now that Prince Qi has been exiled
to his fief,

214
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,670
Your Majesty is busy with state affairs,

215
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,200
Leyu remains in the palace,

216
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,630
and only I have

217
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,960
the leisure of hunting.

218
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,050
How things have changed.

219
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,000
Yin Cong,

220
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,100
this is your first time
hunting with Leyu and me.

221
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,440
These mountain forests are treacherous

222
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,320
with many fierce beasts.

223
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,450
Safety must come first in everything.

224
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,960
You two must also bear in mind

225
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,510
the hunting rules of our Dacang:

226
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,440
never kill cubs,

227
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,010
and never hunt pregnant or female beasts.

228
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,670
I certainly know these rules,

229
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,750
but I always feel

230
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,440
that protecting female and pregnant beasts
as if they're the weak ones

231
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,030
is the greatest injustice in hunting.

232
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,480
Females, even pregnant ones,

233
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,210
should be treated the same as males.

234
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,070
Natural selection
and the survival of the fittest.

235
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,750
Spring is when we spare female beasts,
honoring life.

236
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,000
When catching sacrificial fish,
leave three sides of the net open.

237
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,030
The ancients said
that Heaven cherishes all life.

238
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,830
So we must not go against nature.

239
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,440
The ancients also said

240
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,200
that all beings in this world are equal.

241
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,270
If all are equal, why distinguish between
male and female?

242
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,720
The strong should not prey on the weak,
nor should the many bully the few.

243
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,980
We should never bully women or children.

244
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,750
Using strength to bully the weak

245
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,680
must not be done.

246
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,870
Oh, you...

247
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,120
you always side with His Highness.

248
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,730
I simply oppose
the strong bullying the weak.

249
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,620
I won't bother with you two anymore.

250
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,550
I'll go on ahead.

251
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,860
Wait for me.

252
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,760
Yin Cong.

253
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,610
Are you leaving now?

254
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:21,910
Yes.

255
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,630
Take care of yourself while in the palace.

256
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,550
And you too—be careful in all things.

257
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,810
When you have time off,

258
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,300
we can ride horses and hunt

259
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
just like before.

260
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,080
I should not
disturb Your Majesty any further.

261
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,340
I'll take my leave now.

262
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,740
Back then, Yin Cong was

263
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,420
extremely competitive

264
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,770
and refused to back down.

265
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,250
Now I always feel that she's...

266
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,490
lost her edge.

267
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,540
People always change.

268
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,200
Yeah.

269
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,530
People change.

270
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,770
Then, Your Majesty...

271
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
have you changed?

272
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,560
These past few days...

273
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,720
I've been asking myself.

274
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,880
Is the emperor from that night
at Xuanji Pavilion

275
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,810
the same one

276
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,100
who is now determined

277
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,920
to uncover the truth

278
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,970
and even willing to risk his life
to save me?

279
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,380
Or perhaps

280
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,710
Your Majesty

281
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,980
bears...

282
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,570
unspoken...

283
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,060
burdens?

284
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,400
My original intention remains unwavering.

285
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,220
I stay true to the righteous path.

286
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,000
I've never changed.

287
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,150
It's getting late.

288
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,770
We need to get to Juma River Camp soon.

289
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,040
This humble commoner greets Your Majesty.

290
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,040
In the 11th year of Jianing,

291
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,360
when you were the prison warden
at Juma River Camp,

292
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,720
do you recall
a female army unit imprisoned here

293
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,960
for violating military law?

294
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,890
Yes, I remember.

295
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,030
They were our country's
only female army unit,

296
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,910
called the Pingyang Army.

297
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,260
They appeared to have suffered
a grave injustice

298
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,720
and were locked in prison.

299
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,090
However,

300
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,830
after General Xi visited,

301
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,230
everything changed.

302
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,050
That very day,

303
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,720
something strange happened.

304
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,720
What...

305
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,990
What the hell are those?

306
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,600
Ghost soldiers!

307
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,790
Guards!

308
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,090
There are ghosts!

309
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,120
-Ghosts!
-Help!

310
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,820
Ghosts!

311
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,990
Fire!

312
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,810
So, you're saying

313
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,740
you saw ghost soldiers in the fire,

314
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,960
and then the entire army

315
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,240
just vanished from the camp?

316
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,840
Yes,

317
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,240
I saw it with my own eyes.

318
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,670
You may leave.

319
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,570
I take my leave, Your Majesty.

320
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,720
What happened back then is

321
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,290
becoming more and more similar to
my brother's case.

322
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,960
So the villagers of Luofeng Village

323
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,870
may well be the Pingyang Army
that vanished years ago.

324
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,360
Unfortunately, Luofeng Village has been
completely destroyed,

325
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,240
and Yang Yun has likely also been...

326
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,120
Indeed so.

327
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,750
Your Majesty has revealed
your presence here tonight.

328
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,210
Tomorrow's court session

329
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,080
will surely be tumultuous.

330
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
I can handle it.

331
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,869
[Ningzheng Hall]

332
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,670
Your Majesty,

333
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:15,150
I heard that you went to the Juma River.

334
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,750
What?

335
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,130
Am I not allowed to go to the Juma River?

336
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,970
Of course, Your Majesty may go.

337
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,480
It's just
that regarding the Marquis Jingyuan case,

338
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,440
we have all the evidence and witnesses.

339
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,589
The death anniversary of the late empress

340
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,240
has long passed.

341
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,540
If Your Majesty insists on
delaying further,

342
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,750
could it be out of personal feelings,

343
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,980
wanting to use this case

344
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,680
to overturn the Su family's case

345
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,080
and seize control of their military power?

346
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,260
Mr. Xi, you're going a bit too far.

347
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,370
The Qin, Wang, and Xi families

348
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,270
are one family with His Majesty.

349
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,830
We rise and fall together.

350
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,910
We are all branches of the same tree.

351
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,350
How could His Majesty ever let
private ties with the Su family

352
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,620
cloud his judgment?

353
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,000
Your Majesty,

354
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,910
I spoke carelessly.

355
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,790
Please forgive me.

356
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,400
Regarding the Marquis Jingyuan case,

357
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,050
I have reached my judgment.

358
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,330
The Marquis was framed.

359
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,510
A group of descendants of military bandits
disguised themselves as ghost soldiers

360
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,050
and attempted to
frame Marquis Jingyuan, Su Wencheng.

361
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,720
To that end,

362
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,070
they even destroyed the Changding Bridge.

363
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,790
The mastermind, Yang Yun,

364
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,520
has already been arrested by me.

365
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,570
As the Grand Preceptor said,

366
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,170
I share both honor and disgrace
with all of you.

367
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,170
We can't let outsiders sow discord.

368
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,570
The woman is now in prison

369
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,920
and can be sentenced at any time.

370
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,810
In this way, it's a win-win.

371
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
Grand Preceptor.

372
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,140
The Su family is innocent.

373
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,720
Like branches of the same tree,
I'm bound to your four prestigious clans.

374
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,760
Our country is

375
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,330
still the same country as before.

376
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,000
Then we

377
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,600
shall take our leave now.

378
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,530
Those three families are
truly presumptuous,

379
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,930
daring to threaten Your Majesty like that.

380
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,230
They have more power,

381
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,930
so it's not yet time
to openly confront them.

382
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,160
Yang Yun is merely a stopgap—

383
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,870
using her to silence them for now.

384
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,120
However, we did not inform Miss Su

385
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,340
about Yang Yun in time.

386
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,410
I'm afraid she'll find it impossible
to understand.

387
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,170
It's better that she doesn't understand.

388
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,480
Go to Lezhu Villa.

389
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,660
My Lady!

390
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,340
My Lady.

391
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,090
Yang Yun has been thrown into prison.

392
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,680
His Majesty has arrived!

393
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

394
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,630
You may rise.

395
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,690
Last night, Your Majesty said

396
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,200
that you could handle it yourself.

397
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,110
So, your way is to sacrifice Yang Yun,

398
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,400
an innocent woman,

399
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
to appease those officials' anger?

400
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,170
Su Leyu,

401
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,250
you're becoming increasingly insolent.

402
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,710
You found Yang Yun long ago

403
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,000
yet never told me,

404
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,200
leading me to believe that there were
no survivors in Luofeng Valley.

405
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,130
Yin Changyan.

406
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,810
We seem to be working together
on this case,

407
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,200
but you've never trusted me,

408
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,110
have you?

409
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,680
We've already confirmed that
the Ghost Soldiers Passing was a hoax.

410
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,480
As long as Yang Yun confesses,

411
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,240
your brother can be released
without any charges.

412
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,720
Everything will be resolved.

413
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,920
What more do you want?

414
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,030
At this point,

415
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,680
this is no longer just about my family.

416
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,790
I want to reopen the investigation
of the Pingyang Army

417
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,830
to clear Yang Yun's name

418
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,790
and restore the honor
of the Pingyang Army,

419
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,050
-who fought for the country...
-Su Leyu!

420
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,070
Who do you think you are now?

421
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,120
And you think you can investigate
whatever you please?

422
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,450
Even regarding your brother's case,

423
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,240
if I hadn't turned a blind eye,

424
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,070
do you think
you could have investigated this far?

425
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,690
The Juma River incident
and my brother's case

426
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,880
very likely were orchestrated

427
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,440
by the same mastermind behind the scenes.

428
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,790
If we don't eliminate them,

429
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,590
how can the court remain stable?

430
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,000
Who do you think you are,

431
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,070
meddling in court affairs?

432
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,650
The late empress once decreed:

433
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,830
in matters concerning the nation
and its people,

434
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,090
regardless of status,

435
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,790
all may speak freely.

436
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,750
So does your Su family serve
the late empress

437
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,070
or me?

438
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,690
The late empress, wary of our family,

439
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,250
had me brought to the palace to be raised.

440
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,530
And now, Your Majesty

441
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,790
actually regards our family as
the late empress's faction.

442
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,350
This matter ends here.

443
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,710
Say no more.

444
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,040
Eunuch Xu.

445
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

446
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,480
Begin preparations
for tomorrow's investiture ceremony.
