00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,420
I don't know if anyone would believe me.

190
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,550
That night,

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,120
I was so angry

192
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,510
that I went to the Imperial Academy
to find Lu Yueying.

193
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,390
Say no more.

194
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,360
You can ask around—

195
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,120
I, Lu Yueying, have always relied
on my genuine knowledge.

196
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,630
Let go!

197
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,180
A fox demon?

198
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,110
Are you saying

199
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,180
you first saw Lu Yueying
arguing with someone,

200
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,270
and then saw a fox demon

201
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,240
in her room?

202
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,170
That fox demon
seemed injured and bleeding.

203
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,160
When it noticed I had discovered it,

204
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,490
it ran back into the room

205
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,930
and then disappeared.

206
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,310
Did you see

207
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,630
who she was arguing with?

208
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,690
It was too dark. I didn't see clearly.

209
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,810
But I heard Lu Yueying

210
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,440
call the person "Scholar."

211
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,570
That night,

212
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,990
all the officials of the Imperial Academy

213
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,270
were at the Qionglin Banquet.

214
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,120
Only the Dean, Lord Ming Qian,

215
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,250
had returned early.

We need to go out and file a complaint!

223

228
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,090
students,

229
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,340
please calm down.

230
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,750
This matter hasn't been settled yet.

231
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,320
You should all return to your studies.

232
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,000
That's what's most important now.

233
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,750
How can we focus on our studies like this?

234
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,350
Lord Ming,

235
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,150
because of Lu Yueying,
the court will hold a re-examination.

236
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,320
After all our hard study,

237
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,600
we finally earned our official ranks.

238
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,320
Won't all our efforts be in vain?

239
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,120
That's right!

240
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,600
-It'll be all in vain.
-Why should our results be canceled?

241
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,270
What if

242
00:11:59,390 --> 00:11:59,960
we fail this time?

243
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,870
We need to file a complaint!

244
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,360
Yes, we must file a complaint!

245
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,270
Calm down!

246
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,290
Everyone, please calm down!

What are you doing?

248
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,400
Complaining here is one thing.

249
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,630
If you rush out of the Imperial Academy,

250
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,360
that would be causing trouble!

251

Whatever the reason,

252
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,710
you will be arrested and held accountable.

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,080
once this matter is settled,

255
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,110
I will inform you immediately.

256

00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,240
Thank you, Director Yin.

Lord Ming,

260
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,790
may I talk to you privately?

261
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,510
Please.

262
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,770
Thank you again

263

for what happened today.

264
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,860
No need for thanks, Lord Ming.

265
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,230
And you are...

266
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,080
Lord Ming,
you must have recognized me, right?

268
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,080
Previously, you assisted His Majesty

269
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,440
in investigating the Changding Bridge case

270
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,870
and obtained evidence
of Xi Zimo's corruption.

271
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,730
You are truly a remarkable woman.

272
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,270
I deeply admire you.

273
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,510
This time,

274
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,430
we'd like to ask for your help

275
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,870
in solving the Number Three Scholar case.

276
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,860
What can I do

277
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,510
to help you?

278
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,510
Lord Ming,

279
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,240
on the night of the Qionglin Banquet,

280
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,620
before Lu Yueying died,

281
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,320
did you see her

282
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
in the Imperial Academy classroom?

283
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,550
I did not.

284
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,980
That night, after returning
from the Qionglin Banquet,

285
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,120
I stayed here working

286
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,980
and did not go to the classroom.

287
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,630
Lord Ming,

288
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,630
may we take a look around?

289
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,490
By all means.

290
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,400
[Having swept the fairy courtyard's jade-like mossy ground,
I see the languid breeze and brilliant moon through windows come around.]

291
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,630
Lord Ming,

292
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,250
these poems...

293
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,340
These poems are all my own work.

294
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,790
May I take one with me?

295
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,590
Of course.

296
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,710
Your Majesty,

297
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,280
are you worried about the imperial exams?

298
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,390
They're trying to use this incident

299
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,870
to force me to hold a re-examination,

300
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,440
undermine my authority
in the students' eyes,

301
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,570
and make more of them

302
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,750
turn to the noble families.

303
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,460
Any news from Leyu?

304
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,230

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,200
is currently with Director Yin.

307
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,910
Would you like to summon her?

308
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,370
No need.

309
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,280
Have the secret guards keep watch.

310
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,060
Leyu shouldn't appear just yet.

311
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,440
Report to me immediately
if there's any news.

312
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:54,790
Yes.

314
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,200
Here are the exam papers

315
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,460
of all the students who passed this time.

316
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:07,860
This is Lu Yueying's paper.

317
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,710
[Lu Yueying, a candidate of the palace examination,
from Jinzhou, Jiangbei Province.]

318
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,980
One of the lines in her paper

319
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,510
is identical to a poem by Ming Qian,

320
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,310
word for word.

321
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,440
So,

322
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,130
you suspect Lord Ming Qian
was involved in cheating?

323
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,770
Lu Yueying's essay topic

324
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:21,960
[Third Place in the First Class]

325
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,370
matches Ming Qian's poem exactly.

326
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,880
Having swept the fairy courtyard's
jade-like mossy ground,

327
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,730
I see the languid breeze and brilliant moon
through windows come around.

328
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,930
It's very likely that

329
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,490
as Dean of the Imperial Academy,

330
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,890
Ming Qian revealed the exam lines
to Lu Yueying in advance.

331
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,070
Not knowing which question
His Majesty would select,

332
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,290
he might have told her all three key lines

333
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,950
from the possible questions.

334
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,530

00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:46,910
[Same act, yet opposite results—why?]

The three examination questions
drafted for this year's imperial exams?

339
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,000
There may be something hidden behind this.

340
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,540
Leyu,

341
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,260
I know this is emotionally difficult
for you to accept,

342
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,990
but the evidence is right here.

343
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,100
But there are still doubts in this case.

344
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,570
For example,

345
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,590
why would Lord Ming Qian,
as an Imperial Academy official,

346
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,350
write the exam topics

347
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,610
in his own poem?

348
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Could this poem

349
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,640
be forged?

350
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,270
But Lord Ming Qian just said

351
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,170
these poems are indeed his work.

352
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,600
This case still requires careful investigation.

353
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,130
Yin Cong,

354
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,730
we must not alert the suspects.

355
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,360
Very well.

[Taiji Palace]

357
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,520
Your Majesty,

358
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,240
it has been a while since the case of the Number Three Scholar

359
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,420
Lu Yueying's exam fraud.

360
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,960
If you don't hold a re-examination,

361
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,930
you will need to come to the Imperial Academy in seven days

362
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,600
along with the other passed candidates

363
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,550
to pay respects.

364
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,790
If anyone among them is involved in the fraud,

365
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,840
wouldn't that be a disgrace to Confucius

366
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,010
and bring shame to our Dacang?

367
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,720
This matter concerns our national dignity.

368
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,030
The Justice Bureau is investigating.

369
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,870
But Your Majesty,

370
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,020
I heard that

371
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,630
Director Yin has already identified

372
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,290
the person who assisted Lu Yueying in cheating.

373
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:06,470
Director Yin,

374
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,200
is that true?

375
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:11,910
Your Majesty,

376
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,640
I am currently investigating this case.

377
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,480
There are many suspicious points that need verification.

378
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:15,960
I...

379
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,920
Director Yin,

380
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:19,490
the Justice Bureau handles major cases.

381
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,220
You should indeed be cautious.

382
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,790
But the situation is urgent now

383
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,119
and concerns the state.

384
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,170
Progress is either there

385
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,849
or it isn't.

386
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,570
What does "still needs verification" mean?

387
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,880
Your Majesty,

388
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,830
I...

389
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:34,490
What?

390
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,810
Are the noble families

391
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,140
going to shield those guilty of cheating?

392
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,480
Lord Wang,

393
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,520
what reason would I have to shield anyone?

394
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,980
It's just that this case is full of suspicious points.

395
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,350
Full of suspicious points?

396
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,930
Director Yin, are you trying to delay things

397
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,200
to find excuses

398
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,750
for the suspect?

399
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,750
Lord Wang, please watch your words.

400
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,100
Current evidence points to

401
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,250
Lord Ming Qian being involved in the fraud case.

402
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,510
How is that possible?

403
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,350
That can't be.

404
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,310
How could it be Lord Ming?

405
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,480
Yes.

406
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,970
Lu Yueying's exam topic is identical

407
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,140
to Lord Ming Qian's poem.

408
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,660
Absurd!

409
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,920
How could my poem

410
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,190
appear on Lu Yueying's exam paper?

411
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,210
Lord Ming,

412
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,230
this case does indeed have doubts.

413
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,360
I am investigating.

414
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,240
But the poem found in your room

415
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,350
is exactly the same as the one

416
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,880
on Lu Yueying's exam paper.

417
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,220
Let me see it.

418
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,410
[Having swept the fairy
courtyard's jade-like mossy ground,]

419
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,030
[I see the languid breeze and brilliant
moon through windows come around.]

420
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,920
This...

421
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,220
Someone must be framing me!

422
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,450
Lord Ming,

423
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,120
this poem was obtained from you by Director Yin,

424
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,740
and your reaction just now

425
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,880
clearly proves

426
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,190
it is your handwriting.

427
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,030
Am I wrong?

428
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,460
This is not my writing.

429
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,240
Someone forged my handwriting

430
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,120
to frame me!

431
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,240
Your Majesty,

432
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Ming Qian and Lu Yueying were originally teacher and student.

433
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,640
Lu Yueying, a woman,

434
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,510
only had the chance to take the imperial exams

435
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,460
because of Ming Qian's recommendation.

436
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,180
I believe Ming Qian

437
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,730
deliberately placed his student

438
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,230
in the position of Number Three Scholar.

439
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,660
You, Wang Zhan!

440
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,980
You are slandering me!

441
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,990
The handwriting is clearly yours.

442
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,890
Are you still trying to deny it?

443
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,240
If someone wants to condemn another,

444
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,990
they'll always find an excuse!

445
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,070
Lord Ming,

446
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,510
you are a scholar yourself.

447
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,530
The evidence is now conclusive.

448
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,960
How can you claim you're being falsely accused?

449
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,220
Are you trying to deny it

450
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,160
in front of His Majesty?

451
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,680
You...

452
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,840
Your Majesty,

453
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,480
I earnestly request that Ming Qian

454
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,070
and Lu Yueying's exam fraud case

455
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,070
be swiftly judged

456
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,640
to give the scholars of the world an explanation.

457
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,240
You...

458
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,310
Ming Qian.

459
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,720
Ming Qian must have a guilty conscience.

460
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,810
As the Dean of the Impartial Academy,

461
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,230
it's perfectly normal for him

462
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,960
to want to promote his student.

463
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,410
This is despicable.

464
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,880
-Yeah.
-That's despicable!

465
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,750
I never expected this.

466
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,520
Indeed.

467
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,760
I, Ming Qian, have always been honest and upright,

468
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,510
yet in the end,

469
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,080
my good reputation is ruined by a petty person.

470
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,640
Who is the petty person here?

471
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,960
The evidence is irrefutable.

472
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,690
Are you still trying to deny it?

473
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,850
Secret manipulations and cheating—

474
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,400
you are the petty one.

475
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,000
Your Majesty,

476
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,080
I

477
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,050
have failed the nation.

478
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,880
Please judge fairly.

479
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,980
If one day my name is cleared,

480
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,130
those scoundrels

481
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,870
will have nowhere to hide!

482
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,920
-Lord Ming!
-Lord Ming!

483
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,250
-Lord Ming!
-Lord Ming!

484
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,480
Lord Ming!

485
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,490
Call the imperial physicians!

486
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,310
Lord Ming!

487
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,090
Lord Ming!

488
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,440
Lord Ming, wake up!

489
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,110
Lord Ming!

490
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,160
Servants! Call the imperial physicians!

491
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,980
Hurry!

492
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,500
Lord Ming!

493
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,290
Lord Ming!

494
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,360
Lord Ming!

495
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,990
Call the imperial physicians!

496
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,890
Lord Ming sacrificed himself for his principles.

497
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,190
I admire him greatly.

498
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,350
Wang Zhan!

499
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:00,410
Yin Cong!

500
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:02,840
Come in quickly.

501
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,610
Yin Cong,

502
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,210
what's wrong?

503
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,540
What happened?

504
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,890
Leyu,

505
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,780
I think I've made a mistake.

506
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,050
This morning at court,

507
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,650
Lord Ming Qian, trying to prove his innocence,

508
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,120
died by throwing himself against a pillar.

509
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,920
The court was in complete chaos,

510
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,390
and even His Majesty could not suppress it.

511
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,070
He used such a brutal way

512
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,400
to prove his innocence.

513
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
It's all my fault.

514
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,030
I'm the one who caused it.

515
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,880
I brought this upon him.

516
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,880
I never imagined they would use

517
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,480
Lord Ming Qian's poem to create such a scandal.

518
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,330
They used such a vicious method—

519
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,490
and you—

520
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,870
to drive Lord Ming to his death.

521
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,200
It's utterly despicable and outrageous.

522
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,460
Yin Cong, remember,

523
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,150
you must act

524
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,810
with even greater caution from now on.

525
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,510
You cannot be used by them again.

526
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,110
Yes.

527
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,820
Also,

528
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,550
from now on,

529
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,410
we probably cannot act together.

530
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,040
If you are implicated by me,

531
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,510
this case

532
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,060
may never be solved.

533
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,260
Don't worry.

534
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,370
I will see justice done

535
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,610
for the wrongful case against me,

536
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,650
Lady Lu's death,

537
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,640
and Lord Ming's grievance.
