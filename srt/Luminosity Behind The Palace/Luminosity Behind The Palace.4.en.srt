They're gone.

5
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,150
Something is bad.

6
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,930
Something's going to
happen at Luofeng Village.

7
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,330
Is anyone in there?

8
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,560
Check over there too.

9
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:50,970
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,509
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,780
Go that way.

12
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,780
Search thoroughly.

13
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,350
Yes, sir.

14
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,090
You, go over there.

15
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,650
Yes, sir.

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,040
Nothing here either.

19
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:05,920
Search thoroughly.

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,450
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:08,990
Check that side as well.

This village isn't registered

27
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,329
in the provincial records.

28
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:28,470
We don't know
how many people lived here.

29
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,030
So...

30
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,980
we're not sure if anyone survived.

31
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,350

Who's there?

Go after her!

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,530
No need to chase her.

36
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,430
Why?

37
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,830
She could be the only survivor!

38
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,050
She's not.

[Ningzheng Hall]

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,030
Mr. Wang.

41
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,870
Last night, a great fire broke out
in Luofeng Valley,

42
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,000
and strange events occurred
near Changding Bridge.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,530
Why didn't you report to me?

44
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,620
Your Majesty,

45
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,310
it's precisely because
this case is full of doubts

46
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,110
that I have to take it seriously.

47
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,540
That is why I am

48
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,280
reporting to you directly.

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,760
Your Majesty,

50
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
the fire was suspicious.

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,190
In just one night,

52
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,020
the entire village was wiped out.

53
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,660
I...

54
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,960
have ordered my men
to surround Luofeng Valley,

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,420
hoping to find clues
to solve this case soon.

56
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,800
But unexpectedly, a woman

57
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,400
of unknown identity appeared at the scene.

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,860
She showed up for no reason

59
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,270
and acted suspiciously.

60
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,530
I'm afraid...

61
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,470
the crime scene
has already been compromised.

62
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:54,970
Your Majesty,

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,430
I've always been

64
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,910
swift and decisive

65
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,170
in my investigations.

66
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,840
If I...

67
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,280
find anyone else suspicious at the scene,

68
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,280
I ask for your permission

69
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,170
to execute them

70
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,020
right on the spot.

71
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,230
It's rare for Mr. Wang
to show such dedication.

72
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,770
How could I refuse?

73
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,960
Rise and speak.

74
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,110
It's my duty

75
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,430
to serve Your Majesty.

76
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,040
Who are you?

77
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,190
Greetings, Miss Su.

78
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,650
Since Zhao is unwell
and has left the palace,

79
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,430
from now on,

80
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,480

-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

83
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,750
You may leave now.

84
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,160
Your Majesty, what brings you here today?

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,950
Su Leyu.

87
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,720
Did you sneak out of the palace

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,480
to Luofeng Valley

89
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,680
and disrupt Mr. Wang's investigation?

90
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Since Your Majesty's last warning,

91
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,630
I haven't stepped outside the palace once.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,270
Are you saying Mr. Wang
accused you falsely?

93
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,720
If someone wants to condemn another,

94
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,950
they'll always find an excuse.

95
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,270
It seems

96
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,950
I've spoiled you so much

97
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,240
that you've forgotten your place.

98
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,270
I sentence you to Xuanji Pavilion

99
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,870
to reflect on your mistakes.

105

If one day

106
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,530
Changyan faces danger,

107
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,470
and Dacang is in peril,

108
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,120
would you be willing

109
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,320
to shoulder this immense burden for me,

110
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,780
and protect our people?

111
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,670
Your Majesty.

112
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,090
What are you reading, Leyu?

113
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,870
In today's morning lesson,

114
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,470
my teacher spoke of history.

115
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,870
When he talked about
the empresses and consorts,

116
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,070
the books only praised their virtues.

117
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,910
Not a single historical record

118
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,640
describes their heroic deeds.

119
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,920
I was confused,

120
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,720
so I borrowed many history books,

121
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,120
and I'm still searching.

122
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,450
Did you find anything?

123
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,190
This vast ocean of history

124
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,850
is hard to navigate,

125
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,490
so I still haven't found anything.

126
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,800
It seems to me

127
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,190
that you

128
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,430
have the talent to assist and advise me.

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,830
In the future,

130
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,280
would you like
to make a name for yourself?

131
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,240
If it's not in the history books,

132
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,030
why not write yourself into history?

133
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,380
If that day truly comes,

134
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,320
I will do my best

135
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,840
to create a new path,

136
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,770
and protect our Dacang

137
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,530
for an era of peace and prosperity.

138
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,850
Greetings, Your Majesty.

139
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,790
Do you know why

140
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,300
I sent you to Xuanji Pavilion
as punishment?

141
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,720
Because Song

142
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,390
is Wang Zhan's spy.

143
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,270
After all, no one dares

144
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,980
to enter the Xuanji Pavilion.

145
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,730
Today he deliberately mentioned you.

146
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,120
His words were full of threats against me,

147
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,630
saying he would execute anyone suspicious

148
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,680
right on the spot.

149
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,810
He has already recognized you,

150
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,920
and I'm afraid he might harm you.

151
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,230
How's the investigation
of Luofeng Village going?

152
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,070
I discovered

153
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,240
a huge secret in Luofeng Village.

154
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,360
The villagers are all skilled
in martial arts,

155
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,620
and they're all women.

156
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,330
It seems the Ghost Soldiers Passing

157
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,800
is likely related to them.

158
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,080
I suspect the reason Luofeng Village

159
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,670
was burned down

160
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,780
has something to do with this.

161
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,930
When Wang Zhan and Xi Zimo

162
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,270
were at the scene,

163
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,570
they didn't seem to be investigating.

164
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,970
Instead, it was more like
they were searching for something.

165
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,230
Could it be...

166
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,960
this is what they were looking for?

167
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,550
Perhaps if we figure this out,

168
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:57,590
[Pingyang]

169
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,720
we can solve the mystery
of the Ghost Soldiers Passing,

170
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,150
and also find clues
for the Changding Bridge case.

171
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,480
This looks like a military command token.

172
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,780
But I've never seen

173
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,700
our Dacang army use

174
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,960
a military name like "Pingyang."

175
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,600
All of Dacang's military tokens

176
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,260
must be officially recorded.

177
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,510
I think the Archives

178
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
may have records.

179
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,790
Then tomorrow morning,

180
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,720
we'll go to the Archives and check.

181
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,720
Your Majesty,

182
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,720
I'll need you to cause a scene

183
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,570
so I can investigate in secret.

184
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,450
That way, we won't alert them.

185
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,750
The chief of the Archives, Yue Menglin,

186
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,320
might be useful to us tomorrow.

187
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,850
Your Majesty is truly wise.

188
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,960
Do you remember
this mandarin duck lantern?

189
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,020
It was you who chose the design for us.

190
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,820
This book, "The Tale of Zhang Shunmei
and the Phoenix Lantern",

193
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,230

her red silk handkerchief

202
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,390

who found the handkerchief,

The storage rooms for the Ministries
of War, Justice, and Revenue

233
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,030
have been in disrepair for years,

234

and they are severely leaking.

235
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,260
If this continues,

236
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,020

will inevitably be destroyed.

237

the Ministry of Revenue
hasn't allocated any funds,

240

so I can't make the repairs.

241
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,600
Your Majesty,

242
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,380
Dacang has always
budgeted based on income.

243

All of this year's funds
have already been allocated,

244
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,440

we should ignore state affairs

Could he find out anything

The Xi family has already
dealt with all the old files,

264
