1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,230
You are the most outstanding children

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,750
of the noble clans.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,510
We are fortunate to have you

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,040
accompanying Prince Ji

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,850
and Prince Qi in their studies.

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,360
I believe you will become

7
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,830
pillars of governance for Dacang
in the future.

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,650
[Luminosity Behind The Palace]

9
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,390
Be careful.

10
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:41,900
[Luofeng]

11
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,259
Leyu!

12
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,570
Changyan!

13
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,000
Your Majesty,

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,930
are you alright?

15
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,110
This place is unsafe.

16
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,060
Let's go back to the inn first.

17
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,560
Your Majesty, your life is priceless.

18
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,160
You shouldn't have risked your life
to save me.

19
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,050
This time,

20
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,829
I owe you one.

21
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,630
I remember when we were young,

22
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,730
every time
I got hurt practicing swordsmanship,

23
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,040
it was you who treated my wound.

24
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,810
Does it hurt?

25
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,750
It's just a little wound.

26
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,010
It doesn't hurt at all.

27
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,040
Every time you get hurt
while practicing martial arts,

28
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm the one who tends to your wounds.

29
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,660
So,

30
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,310
Changyan,

31
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,450
you don't need to act tough
in front of me.

32
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,370
I've forgotten...

33
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,580
most of the past.

34
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,600
Why did you come
to investigate the case alone?

35
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,930
The noble clans control the court,

36
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,630
making it difficult to uncover the truth.

37
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,230
Why do those ghost soldiers
carry blue flames?

38
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,120
Besides,

39
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,750
the ghost soldiers are afraid of arrows?

40
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,000
That makes no sense.

41
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,360
When I fought
with those ghost soldiers earlier,

42
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,760
I noticed the word

43
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
"Luofeng" carved on their weapons.

44
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,870
[Luofeng]

45
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,530
Sir,

46
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,890
your noodles are ready.

47
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,659
Let's go eat something first.

48
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,920
Here, have some hot tea.

49
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:50,720
Here.

50
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,600
Enjoy.

51
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,360
Sir.

52
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,710
Have you heard about the “Ghost Soldiers
Passing” at Changding Bridge?

53
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,970
You encountered them?

54
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,750
You met the ghost soldiers

55
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,190
and managed to return alive?

56
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,750
You guys are quite something.

57
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,760
Sir,

58
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,160
does this happen often?

59
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,020
Ever since that incident,

60
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,130
it has occurred here frequently.

61
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,130
What incident?

62
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,590
Back then,

63
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,000
when they were repairing Changding Bridge,

64
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,270
there were also continuous heavy rains,

65
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,000
and the repairs

66
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,340
kept getting delayed.

67
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,180
So the court

68
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,790
dispatched a troop to help.

69
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,800
The repairs were soon completed.

70
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,690
But then,

71
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,030
a strange thing happened.

72
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,230
Ghosts!

73
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,159
Ghosts!

74
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,510
They devoured the entire army

75
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,750
and dragged them to the underworld.

76
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,930
Since then,

77
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,000
the legend of

78
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,200
the "Ghost Soldiers Passing"
has begun here.

79
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,730
Do you know

80
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,080
which troop it was?

81
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,120
It happened too long ago.

82
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,120
I do not know.

83
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,150
Thank you, sir.

84
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,440
Enjoy.

85
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,070
Your Majesty.

86
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,550
If what he said is true,

87
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,530
those who play with supernatural tricks

88
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,640
might be connected to Luofeng.

89
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,440
I want to investigate further

90
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,040
to see if there are any clues.

91
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,000
I need to return to court tomorrow

92
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,130
to buy you some time.

93
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,270
While I'm away,

94
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,860
take care of yourself.

95
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,770
In that case,

96
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,030
thank you, Your Majesty.

97
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,660
Be careful in everything.

98
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,360
[Grand Preceptor's Mansion]

99
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,320
Grand Preceptor, you truly are a prophet.

100
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,570
His Majesty said he was plagued
by nightmares

101
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,770
and wanted to visit the imperial tombs,

102
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,670
but he indeed went to Changding Bridge

103
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,770
with Su Leyu.

104
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,170
By now, they must

105
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,030
have discovered something.

106
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,910
It seems what the Xi family did

107
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,440
can no longer be concealed.

108
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Grand Preceptor,

109
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,390
Su Wencheng is imprisoned,

110
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,820
so the military power
the Su family holds...

111
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,360
Su Wencheng has not yet been convicted.

112
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,710
If Su Leyu marries His Majesty,

113
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,770
it would make him even stronger.

114
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,160
Therefore,

115
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,570
we must not only seize military power

116
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,570
but also prevent Su Leyu
from becoming a consort.

117
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,980
It seems

118
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,390
we need to put some pressure

119
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,120

the Ministry of Justice

laborers, and management costs.]

132
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,710
of the construction.

133
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,720
There are no issues in the records.

134
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,720
That's strange then.

135
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,690
Mr. Xi has no issue,

136
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,030
the Ministry of Works has no issue,

137
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,600
and Marquis Jingyuan claims
he has no issue.

138
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,870
Everyone claims innocence.

139
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,810
Could it be the work of ghosts?

140
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,100
Marquis Jingyuan did say he encountered

141
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,630
the "Ghost Soldiers Passing."

142
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,960
These ghosts are probably

143
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,670
only in Marquis Jingyuan's mind.

144
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,760
Your Majesty,

145
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,810
Marquis Jingyuan deliberately delayed
military operations in the north,

146
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,540
causing the front to collapse.

147
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,550
If the Su family continues
to hold the military power,

148
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,360
it will surely spark rumors.

149
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,840
We need to quickly arrange
a reliable person to take over

150
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,790
and stabilize the army's morale.

151
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,390
An army cannot go a day
without a commander.

152
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,320
Ministers,

153
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,480
do you have any candidates?

154
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,390
Liu Zhenglin,
Director of the Justice Bureau,

155
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,000
comes from a humble background.

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,670
He is both wise and courageous.

157
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,070
He's the perfect choice for this position.

158
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,070
Your Majesty,

159
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,790
for someone of a humble background to be
recommended by the Grand Preceptor

160
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,120
surely indicates exceptional talent.

161
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,520
It is worth considering.

162
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,630
Choosing who will take over
the Su family's command of the army

163
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,030
is of utmost importance.

164
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,550
I must select carefully.

165
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,670
Mr. Feng.

166
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,030
I'm here.

167
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,510
The Su Wencheng case
must be handled with utmost rigor.

168
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,510
Only when both witness testimony
and physical evidence are complete

169
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,510
can a verdict be reached.

170
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

171
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,810
Sir,

172
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
have you ever heard of the word "Luofeng?"

173
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Luofeng?

174
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,770
I've never heard of it.

175
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,790
But deep in this dense forest

176
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,170
there is a village

177
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,260
in a hollow,

178
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,640
which from above

179
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,450
looks like a phoenix's tail.

180
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,110
Could this

181
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,510
be the place you mean?

182
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,960
This must be Luofeng Village.

183
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,660
This spear technique...

184
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,730
Where is she?

185
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,770
She's gone.

186
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,320
Miss,

187
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,710
what brings you here?

188
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,560
I was heading to Dingzhou,

189
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,390
but with the collapse of Changding Bridge,

190
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,550
I had to find another way
across the river.

191
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,630
I lost my way in the mountains and,

192
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,770
upon hearing a bell,

193
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,310
followed the sound here.

194
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,480
No outsiders ever come to our village.

195
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,720
Whenever we see strangers,

196
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,840
we ring the bell.

197
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,950
I see.

198
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,270
Ma'am,

199
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,150
I've been traveling

200
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,720
and am terribly thirsty.

201
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,490
Could I trouble you

202
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,720
for a bowl of water?

203
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,600
Let her leave after she drinks the water.

204
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes.

205
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,300
Drink the water and leave quickly.

206
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,240
Thank you.

207
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,290
Ma'am,

208
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,000
judging by the calluses on your hands,

209
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,910
you must be a martial artist, right?

210
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,230
Martial artist?

211
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,150
These are from farm work.

212
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,750
Your hands

213
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,160
don't look like they belong to a farmer.

214
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,870
It's...

215
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,450
the phosphorescent powder
I deliberately scattered?

216
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,440
Just now, the spear technique
you practiced outside the village—

217
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,870
is that Dacang Army's spear technique?

218
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,930
You recognized it?

219
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,840
My father and brothers
all served in the army.

220
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,170
I know a little about it.

221
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,140
It's getting late.

222
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,050
I'll see you out of the village.

223
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,200
Yang Yun!

224
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,910
Stay home today.

225
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,970
Don't go anywhere.

226
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,690
Miss, this way, please.

227
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,360
Please.

228
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,030
Ma'am,

229
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,100
may I ask a bold question?

230
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,720
Why are there

231
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,490
only women in this village?

232
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,670
The men

233
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,550
died in war.

234
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,270
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

235
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,450
Are you alright?

236
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,190
I'm fine.

237
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,300
Go home now.

238
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,800
It has nothing to do with you.

239
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,450
Alright.

240
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,120
Miss,

241
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,080
keep going forward
and you'll reach the village exit.

242
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,010
I won't accompany you any farther.

243
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,840
Ma'am,

244
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,570
goodbye.

245
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,930
There are many older women in this village

246
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,120
who are all trained in martial arts

247
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,520
and skilled in military spear techniques.

248
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,630
This village

249
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,180
is no ordinary place.

250
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,160
7:45 PM,

251
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,850
at the Mountain God Temple?

252
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,400
You really do have something to tell me.

253
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,480
Yes, my name is Yang Yun.

254
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,859
I came here without telling the Ma'am.

255
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,550
Let's get straight to the point.

256
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,480
I'm afraid you can't hide this from her.

257
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,369
I knew you had other intentions.

258
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,850
Everyone's here now.

259
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,040
Why don't we

260
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,340
have an open talk?

261
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,610
I have nothing to talk about with you.

262
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,340
Judging by your demeanor,

263
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,030
you must be from the government.

264
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,000
Ma'am, why?

265
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,070
Haven't we been waiting for this day?

266
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,680
You...

267
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,640
Miss, we were originally...

268
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,590
Yang Yun, you...

269
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,160
Ma'am, don't stop me!

270
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,130
Don't you want to clear your name?

271
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,510
Ma'am!

272
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,880
Ma'am!

273
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,110
Ma'am!

274
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,120
I shouldn't have done this!

275
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,110
Ma'am!
