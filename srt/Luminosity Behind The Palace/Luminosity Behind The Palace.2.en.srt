you're cheating.

You deliberately set a trap to lure me in.

You can do this on the chessboard,

00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,790
stake yourself in the court?

you're the eldest miss of the Su family.

You should have
recused yourself from this case,

but I'm also a citizen of Dacang.

57
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,370
I humbly request Your Majesty

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,060
I could have you imprisoned

193
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,090
along with Su Wencheng.

194
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:45,890
Your Majesty,

195
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,240
do you truly believe my brother

196
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,460
would delay the battle?

197
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,200
Whatever I believe,

198
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,910
it's no excuse

199
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,310
for your defiance.

200
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,340
I only want to save my brother.

201
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,220
But just because I'm from the Su family,

202
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,150
must I be a piece

203
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,210
dragged in your power struggle game?

204
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,050
We were already on the board long ago.

205
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,680
There was no "dragging you in."

206
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,570
I remember
when Your Majesty once faced the game

207
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,320
and made that bold promise

208
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,920
to prove your path
even at the cost of your life.

209
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,030
But now as the player,

210
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,050
both black and white pieces
serve your purpose.

211
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,440
Yet Your Majesty

212
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,000
has been blinded by these colors.

213
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,590
I can overlook

214
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,270
your unauthorized
departure from the palace.

215
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,000
Whatever you wish
to uncover in the future,

216
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,460
I can also turn a blind eye.

217
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,710
You asked for a few days,

218
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,050
and I've granted them.

219
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,510
But after that,

220
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,660
regardless of the outcome,

221
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,560
the conferment ceremony

222
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,370
will proceed as scheduled.

223
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,320
I forbid you to die.

224
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,450
Your Majesty means...?

225
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,640
Exactly what I said.

226
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,360
Su Leyu,

227
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,440
you only have a few days.

228
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,160
Brother,

229
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,560
what's Ghost Soldiers Passing all about?

230
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,280
That night,

231
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,960
I was leading my troops forward,

232
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,930
when we approached Changding Bridge,

233
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,270
a thick fog suddenly appeared,

234
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,400
and I got separated from the main army.

235
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,440
Then I saw them.

236
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,270
I followed the ghost soldiers' trail

237
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,740
to Changding Bridge.

238
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,550
To my surprise,

239
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,170
the bridge had collapsed.

240
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,620
Under the collapsed bridge,

241
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,040
there was a message
hidden in a fish belly.

242
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,380
[Smashing jade in fury, kill the king to
usurp the throne. Ghost soldiers descend.]

243
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,900
Smashing jade in fury,

244
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,420
kill the king to usurp the throne.

245
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,510
[Heaven shaken,
Dacang doomed to fall by its hand.]

246
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,910
Ghost soldiers descend.

247
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,750
Dacang

248
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,650
doomed to fall by its hand.

249
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,310
Smashing jade in fury?

250
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,580
You ungrateful son!

251
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,650
What happened next?

252
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,720
After I found my scattered troops,

253
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,120
I had to find another route,

254
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,200
forced to take a detour
to the Northern Territory.

255
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,800
The delay cost us the battle.

256
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,150
The collapsed bridge,

257
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,510
the message in a fish's belly,

258
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,910
Ghost Soldiers Passing,

259
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,760
all these strange omens

260
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,700
somehow point to His Majesty.

261
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,280
It seems this matter

262
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,970
isn't just targeting the Su family,

263
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,600
but perhaps aims to take down

264
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,130
both our family
and His Majesty in one stroke.

265
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,330
Time is short.

266
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,670
We need to find clues

267
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,800
in the Changding Bridge case quickly.

268
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,690
Your Majesty,

269
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,720
Marquis Jingyuan has
delayed military operations,

270
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:10,960
causing our soldiers to die in battle,

271
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,960
[Taiji Palace]

272
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,510
and rumors of the fish-belly message

273
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,510
are spreading wildly.

274
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,210
I believe

275
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,790
all of this is Marquis Jingyuan's fault,

276
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,790
and he should be convicted immediately.

277
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,590
Your Majesty,

278
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,750
Lord Xi speaks the truth.

279
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,630
If Your Majesty hesitates because

280
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,960
the Marquis bears the Su surname,

281
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
I'm afraid it will

282
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,200
disappoint your people's heart.

283
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,400
Your Majesty,

284
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,050
I must speak even at the risk of my life.

285
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,270
Marquis Jingyuan delayed the battle,

286
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,600
allowed rumors to spread—

287
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,260
his crimes are unforgivable.

288
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,240
If Your Majesty cannot
bring yourself to act,

289
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,940
we shall resign our positions

290
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,240
and guard the borders

291
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,600
to show our determination.

292
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,630
Your Majesty should seek other advisors.

293
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,120
Your Majesty,

294
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,000
I too am willing

295
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,480
to resign and guard the borders.

296
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,990
I am also willing

297
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,980
to resign and guard the borders.

298
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,800
Your Majesty,

299
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,960
I too have a few words.

300
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,080
Grand Preceptor, go ahead.

301
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,120
Our Dacang has stood for a hundred years.

302
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,080
The court officials
are the foundation of the state.

303
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,410
They must not be shaken.

304
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,030
Court affairs

305
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,360
require their cooperation.

306
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,250
Please do not disappoint

307
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,540
the entire court for the sake of one man.

308
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
Grand Preceptor,

309
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,000
I will continue to rely on your guidance

310
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,770
and the assistance of
all my loyal ministers.

311
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,360
As for Marquis Jingyuan,

312
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,160
I will consider the matter carefully.

313
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,350
Your Majesty,

314
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,030
Miss Su is approaching Changding Bridge.

315
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,600
Shall we send someone?

316
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,660
This young lady's pretty.

317
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,790
Looking for a room?

318
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,810
One guest room, please.

319
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,500
I'm terribly sorry, miss,

320
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,910
due to today's heavy rain,

321
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,150
all our rooms are full.

322
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,830
Our inn

323
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,100
only has a few rooms,

324
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,290
so you'll have to share a room.

325
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,150
Otherwise, you'll have to use
the common sleeping area.

326
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,390
Alone, huh?

327
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,750
I'll pay you well.

328
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,240
It's not about the money.

329
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,580
I'll pay extra.

330
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,590
Fine then,

331
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,460
who can say no to money,

332
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:52,970
right?

333
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,270
This way, please.

334
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,130
Wait!

335
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,300
You're changing the rules so easily?

336
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,730
We can pay extra too,

337
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,670
and share a room with the young lady.

338
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,390
Exactly.

339
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,360
Right, sharing a room would work.

340
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,360
Sir, that wouldn't be appropriate.

341
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,550
That wouldn't be proper.

342
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,550
Yeah, innkeeper,

343
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,360
I'll pay extra too.

344
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,750
I'll share a room with her as well.

345
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,850
Right, fellows?

346
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,600
I'm willing to share a room with her.

347
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,040
Misunderstanding.

348
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,690
It's a misunderstanding, sir.

349
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,120
Dear guests,

350
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,080
it's getting late,

351
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,410
let's all get some rest.

352
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,520
Your Majesty.

353
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,720
What are you doing here?

354
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,040
Just passing by.

355
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,270
It's late,

356
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,690
Your Majesty should rest now.

357
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,240
Where are you going?

358
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,690
Your Majesty is of noble birth,

359
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,540
I dare not overstep.

360
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,920
Your Majesty came here late at night...

361
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,610
is it also for the Changding Bridge case?

362
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,680
That message hidden in the fish belly

363
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,210
was written so explicitly,

364
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,690
clearly targeting me.

365
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,680
Today in court,

366
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,480
the nobles spoke with one voice,

367
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,310
merely wanting to use my hand

368
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,110
to weaken the Su family's power.

369
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,570
No matter what the Qin,

370
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,050
Xi, or Wang families

371
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,790
have said or done,

372
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,170
our Su family

373
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,220
will always remain loyal to Dacang.

374
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,420
Your Majesty know in your heart
who's loyal and who's not.

375
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,740
We'll never betray our principles

376
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,630
for survival.

377
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,310
Please return, Your Majesty.

378
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,680
Good night.

379
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,750
Greetings, Your Majesty.

380
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,000
No need for such formalities.

381
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,480
Your Majesty haven't
returned to the palace?

382
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,310
I used visiting the royal tombs
as an excuse to leave the palace.

383
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,710
I was concerned about you

384
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,310
investigating this case alone.

385
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,110
This official road bridge should

386
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,750
have been built of solid stone.

387
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,160
But the Changding Bridge

388
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,110
was piled up with broken rocks.

389
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,380
This official road bridge

390
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,170
was built under the supervision of
the Ministry of Works and Revenue.

391
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,170
If the stones were indeed switched,

392
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,070
we need to find concrete evidence.

393
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,310
I just noticed

394
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,550
many thick tree stumps under the bridge.

395
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,810
The bridge's collapse

396
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,720
must be related to these stumps.

397
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,570
The collapse was definitely deliberate.

398
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,840
The bridge was built
with substandard materials,

399
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,060
and someone deliberately

400
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,550
placed thick logs in the river,

401
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,470
causing the bridge to collapse.

402
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,970
So the message in the fish belly

403
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,310
and Ghost Soldiers Passing

404
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,110
were deliberately fabricated.

405
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,780
Whoever did this

406
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,030
must be extremely familiar with the area

407
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,490
around Changding Bridge.

408
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,630
I'll go gather information nearby.

409
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
Your Majesty should return to the palace

410
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,040
and investigate the collapse thoroughly.

411
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,660
Let's find shelter from the rain first.

412
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,160
Okay.

413
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,500
The rain has stopped.

414
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,310
I've heard that Ghost Soldiers Passing

415
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,910
usually happens on foggy days after rain.

416
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,900
Feels like...

417
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,790
the setting for such a tale.

418
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,540
Are you scared?

419
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,780
I'm from the Su family.
How could I fear such things?

420
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,170
Careful!
