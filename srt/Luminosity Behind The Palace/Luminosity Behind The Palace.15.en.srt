2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,760
Your Majesty.

3
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,450
How did you get injured so seriously?

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,850
The board has shifted.

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,570
They've finally made their move.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,110
I didn't expect

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,640
that they'd actually get Prince Qi
to come back to Zhongdu.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,550
Prince Qi has appeared in Zhongdu,

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,430
and they've tried to
assassinate Your Majesty.

10
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,070
Could it be...

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,930
If I die,

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,410
Yin Zhiyi will be
the most suitable successor.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,730
My being alive is

14
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,270
the greatest threat to them.

15
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,080
That's why Your Majesty

16
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,600
pretended to be killed by the assassins

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,200
to make them believe
their plan had succeeded.

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,390
Now that the political situation
has largely stabilized,

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,030
they won't act rashly.

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,330
As long as I live,

21
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,710
those traitors will never
reveal themselves.

22
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,910
Your Majesty.

23
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,000
Servants! Summon the imperial physician!

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,460
Don't call the physician.

25
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,980
This matter must remain secret.

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,760
Eunuch Xu.

27
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,400
Su Wencheng is probably about to
arrive in the city.

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,730
Arrange to receive him.

29
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

[Justice Bureau]

32
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,720
Su Leyu is full of schemes.

33
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,650
If she turns Prince Qi against us,

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,400
can you manage the situation?

35
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,400
Grand Preceptor, you worry too much.

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,460
Prince Qi is just a puppet on strings.

37
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,900
Were it not for Su Wencheng's army,

38
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,360
we wouldn't have to be so cautious.

39
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,660
We are walking on the edge of a cliff,

40
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,320
so we have to be extra careful
about everything.

41
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,829
Su Wencheng has sneaked into the city
in disguise.

42
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,520
There must be more to it.

43
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,940
Our spies report
that His Majesty has met with misfortune,

44
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,670
but they're keeping it secret.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,600
He has come to the city now...

46
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,930
Could Su Leyu be behind this?

47
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,500
Whatever Su Wencheng's purpose is,

48
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,170
now that he has shown himself,

49
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,630
we should eliminate him as well

50
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,230
to prevent future problems.

51
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,090
Understood.

52
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,560
Marquis Jingyuan may think he's clever,

53
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,460
but you and I will be the ones
claiming the prize.

54
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,250
This is the Qin family's military token.

55
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,280
From now on,

56
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,780

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,890
you must proceed with the utmost caution.

Your Majesty.

103
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,430
His Majesty's wound is not serious,

104
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,390
but from the way he's coughing up blood,

105
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,120
it appears he's been poisoned.

106
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,060
Poisoned?

107
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,820
Though the stab wound isn't fatal,

108
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,080
it has triggered the poison to
spread throughout his body.

109
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,630
In the blood that His Majesty coughed up,

110
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,760
there's a faint scent of ancient wood.

111
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,260
It seems he's been poisoned by miasma.

112
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,390
But Zhongdu lies in the Central Plains,

113
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,740
where the air is dry

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,440
and there is no miasma.

115
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,270
I am also perplexed by this.

116
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,620
Is there a cure for His Majesty's poison?

117
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,820
His Majesty's poison

118
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,010
would pose no threat
without external wounds,

119
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,040
but today...

120
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,390
having been stabbed...

121
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,590
I'm afraid...

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,260
I'm afraid there's no hope for recovery.

159
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,300
Father, your foresight has proven true.

160
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,720
As expected, Su Wencheng was
up to something.

161
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,120
The imperial guards reported
that Su Wencheng is dead.

162
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,560
We nearly fell for Su Wencheng's trick.

163

Until the very last moment,

164
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,080
we must not let our guard down.

165
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,900
Your Majesty has passed away.

166
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,760
The empire is now without a ruler.

167
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,180
After today's court session,
the empire's fate will be decided.

168
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,480
The court officials are still unaware of
this matter,

169
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,400
so some will inevitably take
desperate measures.

170
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,430
Position our men around the main hall.

171
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,270
Only when we enthrone Prince Qi

172
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,110
and seize control of the court

173
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,240
can everything be considered settled.

174
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,280
There won't be any problems
with Prince Qi, right?

175
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,490
Su Leyu is his weakness.

176
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,820
And we have leverage over them.

Why hasn't he

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,200
arrived yet today?

182

it's already this late,

184

and His Majesty hasn't arrived yet.

that today is different from usual.

00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,770
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

190
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,250
I was late to court today.

191
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,250
You have been waiting a long time,

192
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,570
right?

193
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,200
Your Majesty,

194
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,270
are you feeling unwell?

195
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,730
Prime Minister Lu.

196
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,290
I am in excellent health.

197
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,150
What the Grand Preceptor said just now
was right.

198
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,340
Today is indeed

199
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,000
different from other days.

200
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,160
Previously, to protect my child
from being harmed by treacherous people,

201
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,790
I had to falsely claim
that Consort Su had miscarried

202
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,050
and was sent to Yuzhen Temple to recover.

203
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,430
Last night,

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,960
Consort Su gave birth

205
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,760
to a prince

206
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,240
at Yuzhen Temple.

207
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,030
Though it was a difficult birth,

208
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,090
fortunately, both she and the child
are safe.

209
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,360
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

210
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,320
This is truly wonderful news!

211
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,080
Consort Su giving birth to a prince

212
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,340
is truly a blessing for our country!

213
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,050
Now that Consort Su has given birth
to a prince,

214
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,530
she cannot remain at Yuzhen Temple.

215
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,240
In recent days,

216
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,220
there have been many rumors
among the people,

217
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,190
likely because the position of Empress
has remained vacant for too long.

218
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,790
Your Majesty speaks wisely.

219
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,750
There must be a virtuous woman
elevated to the position of Empress

220
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,910
to quell such talk.

221
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,710
Your Majesty,

222
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,040
Consort Su is virtuous and wise,

223
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,000
with great administrative abilities.

224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,580
And now she has given birth to a prince,

225
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,750
so she is the perfect choice for Empress!

226
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,510
I propose

227
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,500
that Consort Su be appointed as Empress.

228
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
Prime Minister Lu,

229
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,510
previously,

230
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,140
the celestial signs were inauspicious,
and rumors were rampant.

231
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,380
Those ill omens pointed to Consort Su,

232
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,800
yet you still propose
making her Empress at this time?

233
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,640
Isn't that inappropriate?

234
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,030
Grand Preceptor, your words are
utterly absurd!

235
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,720
Her Highness giving birth to a prince is

236
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,650
a heavenly blessing from above!

237
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,830
If a consort can become Empress
just by giving birth,

238
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,400
then what becomes of

239
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,810
the country's laws and rituals?

240
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,440
You!

241
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Grand Preceptor!

242
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,830
Our laws honor merit,

243
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,170
and our rituals uphold
virtue and wisdom.

244
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,860
Consort Su is virtuous
and loves the people,

245
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,790
and she has given birth to a prince.

246
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,710
Does that not count as merit and virtue?

247
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,810
This matter is settled.

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,260
We'll choose a date
for the Empress Investiture Ceremony.

249
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,850

From this day forward,

Su Leyu shall oversee all matters
of the imperial harem

255
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,200
and assist with state matters.

256
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,960
With the honor of the Empress,

257
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,710
she shall attend to state matters!

258
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,640

259
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,010

260
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,500
from now on,

261
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,460
with the realm as my witness...

262
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,810
I grant you a life as radiant as
a garden in full bloom.

263
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,000
The Xianming Hall

264
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,610
remains exactly as it was when you left,

265
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,320
without a speck of dust.

266
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,670
Thank you, Your Majesty.

267
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,390
This jade pendant...

268
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,910
I had craftsmen piece it back together.

269
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,260
But that Six-Petal Knot...

270
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,290
No matter how I weave the knot,
it's never as good as the one you gave me.

271
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,290
Why are you smiling?

272
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,530
Has Your Majesty forgotten?

273
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,930
I've already made
a Six-Petal Knot for you.

274
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,930
It's just that, at that time,

275
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,700
Your Majesty didn't accept it.

276
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,460
Your Majesty.

277
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,360
Now...

278
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,790
it can pair perfectly with the jade.

279
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,160
You've been carrying it with you
all this time?

280
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,160
It looks so beautiful on you.

281
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,470
Your Majesty?

282
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,000
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

283
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,730
Your Majesty, are you alright?

284
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,770
I'll summon the imperial physician.

285
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,900
Don't summon the imperial physician.

286
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,380
Don't call the physician.

287
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,590
I've already seen the physician.

288
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,700
The poison has spread
throughout my organs.

289
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,270
There's no cure for me.

290
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,770
Poison?

291
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,230
How could Your Majesty have been poisoned?

292
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,160
I've been poisoned for some time.

293
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,550
It wouldn't have been this severe.

294
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,260
But the injury from a few days ago

295
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,550
has accelerated the spread of the poison.

296
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,600
Now,

297
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,700
the poison has reached my bone marrow.

298
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,590
I'm afraid...

299
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,400
Afraid of what?

300
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,700
It can't be.

301
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,730
There must be a cure.

302
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,630
Your Majesty,

303
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,800
there must be a cure.

304
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,170
There is a remedy
that can cure every poison in the world.

305
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,410
I'll go find it right now!

306
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,400
I will definitely find it!

I'll cure you.

317
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,240
which weighs more?

319
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,599
weighs more?

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,960
She shall assume the principal position
in the imperial harem

374
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,990
and serve as the mother of the empire.

375
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,240
I hereby elevate her
to the position of Empress.

376
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,480
Let all within the realm know!

377
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,130
We pay our respects to Her Majesty,
the Empress!

378
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,740
[Grand Preceptor's Mansion]

379
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,650
One oversight,

380
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,330
and all is ruined.

381
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,320
Had His Majesty died,

382
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,210
and Su Leyu not made it back
to the palace,

383
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,250
the empire would have been mine!

384
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,270
But now that Su Leyu has ascended
to the position of Empress,

385
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,000
we have no choice but to
take desperate measures.

386
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,660
Only by facing death
can we find a way to live.

387
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,150
Since this is a matter of life and death,

388
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,920
let them see who is more ruthless!

389
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,720
Who are you people?

390
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,250
How dare you trespass
in the imperial palace?

391
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,430
First, take control of the inner court

392
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,070
and seize anyone who attempts to resist.

393
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,730
-Yes!
-Yes!

394
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,060
Leyu,

395
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,540
I'll end all of this with my own hands.
