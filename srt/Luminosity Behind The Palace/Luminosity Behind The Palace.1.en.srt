00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,190
Yin Changyan.

187
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,750
I would rather die

188
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,030
than marry a usurper.

189
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,080
His Majesty is here!

190
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,090
Greetings, Your Majesty.

191
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,920
Please forgive my rudeness.

192
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,200
I don't dare to accept the gifts

193
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,320
from Your Majesty.

194
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,120
But as for my own stuff,

195
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,540
please return it to me, Your Majesty.

196
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,720
Leyu.

197
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,630
Changyan, this is a gift for you.

198
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,440
This knot is called Brocade Knot‌,

199
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,390
which is also known as Six-Petal Knot.

200
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,750
It symbolizes success in everything

201
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,210
and a bright future ahead.

202
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,890
Do you like it?

203
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,840
Yes, I do.

204
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,510
Your stuff?

205
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,410
All things in the country
belong to the emperor.

206
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,950
How could you call it your stuff?

207
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,200
The late empress taught me this principle.

208
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,350
It's better to shatter as jade

209
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,170
than survive as a tile.

210
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,670
It's the late empress's decree

211
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,070
to let you enter the palace
and be a consort.

212
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,220
I really can't submit myself

213
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,240
to a usurper.

214
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,730
With such disobedience,

215
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,770
aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

216
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,250
As a member of the Su family,
how would I be afraid of death?

217
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,610
Your Majesty,

218
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,980
please grant me death.

219
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,410
So what you mean is that

220
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,200
you would rather die

221
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,330
than enter the palace to be my consort?

222
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,840
Do you really hate me so much?

223
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,630
Should I not hate you?

224
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,910
It's not difficult to die.

225
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,120
I have already reported our marriage

226
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,380
to the ancestors at the Imperial Temple.

227
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,270
Now in front of you,

228
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,800
there are only two options.

229
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,350
You can either

230
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,330
put on the wedding gown
and be my Consort Xian

231
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,590
or kneel and kowtow
at the Imperial Temple by yourself

232
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,770
to beg forgiveness from the late empress.

233
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,210
I'll obey the imperial decree.

234
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,980
Do you really hate me so much?

235
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,580
It's better to shatter as jade

236
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,590
than survive as a tile.

237
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,930
Leyu, one day if you marry me,

238
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,230
I'll personally make a crown
for your coronation.

239
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,610
How about making it with these camellias?

240
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,120
Changyan.

241
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,350
Being an emperor

242
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,970
means enduring a life of loneliness.

243
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,010
You'll have to hide the truth
from everyone,

244
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,130
including Leyu.

245
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,370
Your Majesty!

246
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,040
Your Majesty!

247
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,360
Bad news!

248
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,790
Marquis Jingyuan, Su Wencheng...

249
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,720
Su Wencheng had an accident!

250
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,310
Brother.
