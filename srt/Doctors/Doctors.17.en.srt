00:00:26,597 --> 00:00:28,717
Episode 17

3
00:00:28,717 --> 00:00:31,837
Truth that cannot be punished by the law.

4
00:00:31,837 --> 00:00:35,017
Truth that can only lean on strong pride.

5
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:40,417
To hear a sincere apology, I have come to this place in search of the truth.

6
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:43,557
Looks like the area is a lot higher than I expected.

7
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:46,657
Shine the light properly, geez!

8
00:00:46,657 --> 00:00:48,847
Yes!

9
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:51,407
Is this idiot drunk?

10
00:00:55,037 --> 00:00:58,377
You bast*rd, don't ever come back into my operating room again!

11
00:00:58,377 --> 00:01:00,087
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:05,057
- She's bleeding.
- Suction!

13
00:01:05,057 --> 00:01:07,677
Tell them to bring more blood.

14
00:01:07,677 --> 00:01:10,107
We need more blood ASAP.

15
00:01:18,707 --> 00:01:21,047
I think you're going to have to do a laporotomy.

16
00:01:24,397 --> 00:01:26,197
It's cardiac shock!

17
00:01:27,757 --> 00:01:29,267
Her blood pressure is dropping!

18
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:31,627
- Let's open her abdomen.
-Yes.

19
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:39,937
It's an arrest!

20
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:52,347
The moment I learn the truth,

21
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:57,187
I don't know how my life is going to change.

22
00:01:58,387 --> 00:02:00,597
Guk Il Medical Center

23
00:02:00,597 --> 00:02:02,837
57th Ad Hoc Disciplinary Action Meeting
Date and Time: 10 AM, August 26th, 2016 | Location: Guk Il 12th floor conference room

24
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:07,367
Starting now, as Assemblyman Na Min Soo's attending physician, who has tainted the honor of Guk Il Hospital,

25
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:11,787
Neurosurgery Department fellow Yoo Hye Jeong, we will start your disciplinary action meeting.

26
00:02:11,787 --> 00:02:13,987
First of all, I would like to give my thanks.

27
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:20,067
I have learned through this incident that I am someone important enough to taint the honor of Guk Il Hospital.

28
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:22,967
Personally, I think it's an honor.

29
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:30,497
- Fellow Yoo Hye Jeong, are you Na Min Soo's attending physician?
- Yes.

30
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:35,157
As the attending physician, when Na Min Soo was in distress, why didn't you answer his call?

31
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:38,467
He is a patient with covert cerebral arteriosclerosis.

32
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:42,787
I asked a fellow colleague to be on call while I was in surgery and went ahead to perform surgery.

33
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:47,317
Why are you talking about a fellow colleague? The fact that you turned over your responsibility is a problem!

34
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:49,887
Did you have to do that surgery at that time?

35
00:02:49,887 --> 00:02:55,867
It was my outpatient, and covert cerebral arteriosclerosis is the same thing as having a time bomb in your brain.

36
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:57,457
I couldn't put it off.

37
00:02:57,457 --> 00:03:00,787
Then, Fellow Yoo Hye Jeong, about this case involving Assemblyman Na Min Soo,

38
00:03:00,787 --> 00:03:03,417
you don't think you did any wrong?

39
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:08,387
No. I'm thankful that the hospital thinks of me as an important figure, but

40
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:11,977
I believe that I did the right thing in this situation.

41
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:16,027
Covert cerebral arteriosclerosis: The patient exhibits no symptoms of the disease.

42
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:21,477
Isn't it so unfair? Why does Doctor Yoo have to be disciplined?

43
00:03:21,477 --> 00:03:23,757
I know. Doctor Jin was around too.

44
00:03:23,757 --> 00:03:25,627
She just conveniently left.

45
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:29,077
How can people without a parent's support live?

46
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:32,617
Do you know what you call that situation?

47
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:34,667
Wh-What, what, what?

48
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:39,017
Oh my gosh, you scared me! Did you come?

49
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:41,457
Why does it seem like the atmosphere became strange after I came?

50
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:43,077
Oh no, it's not!

51
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:45,327
How could we?

52
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:47,297
Ahn Joong Dae, what is it?

53
00:03:47,297 --> 00:03:51,567
You see...we... We think that with Doctor Yoo getting disciplined,

54
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:55,247
we feel very sad for her!

55
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,887
Go change the dressing for patient Lee Tae Sik.,

56
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:02,007
Ah, yes, I understand.

57
00:04:04,587 --> 00:04:08,967
Doctor Jin Seo Woo, the director is looking for you upstairs.

58
00:04:16,637 --> 00:04:18,317
Yes?

59
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:30,647
Are you still mad at Dad? Why do you keep avoiding me?

60
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:32,457
Weren't you in the middle of the disciplinary action meeting?

61
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:36,277
The questioning is over. We're eating lunch and then making the final decision.

62
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:39,647
When we decide, I'm going to reveal this.

63
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:45,257
Yoo Hye Jeong File

64
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:48,627
Why didn't you tell me that Professor Hong was your homeroom teacher in high school?

65
00:04:48,627 --> 00:04:52,027
And on top of that, Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong was the one who caused you to get burnt in that fire?

66
00:04:52,747 --> 00:04:56,947
Please just leave this hidden. I don't want my name to be used again with this incident.

67
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:59,707
Why would you hide such a good card like this?

68
00:04:59,707 --> 00:05:03,757
Dad called you in to compliment you since I felt I was being too hard on you lately.

69
00:05:03,757 --> 00:05:09,097
What am I to you, Dad? Last time you hit me; now you're throwing me a bone?

70
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:12,657
I don't wish for your compliments anymore.

71
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:15,987
After I hit you, I couldn't sleep a wink.

72
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:17,997
Don't you know how much I love you?

73
00:05:17,997 --> 00:05:22,947
Just don't do it! This is a thorn in my side.

74
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,527
Do you know how long I suffered because of this?

75
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,827
If you reveal this, I'm going to kill myself.

76
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:57,387
Are you going somewhere?

77
00:05:57,387 --> 00:06:02,187
The punishment is already decided. It's just a matter of time. I'm organizing some of my things.

78
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,777
Do you think it's my fault?

79
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:08,377
Yeah. I think it's your fault.

80
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:12,047
You got my call, and pushed it over to Yeong Gook.

81
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:18,437
But if I think like that, this matter will never be resolved. So I don't think that.

82
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:20,017
Then?

83
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:22,187
I was really unlucky.

84
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:26,907
A second ago, my heart was shaking.

85
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:30,737
You too, like me, are someone with emotions.

86
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:35,147
To be normal, you should despise me. But as always, Yoo Hye Jeong is different.

87
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:38,987
This time, you were upset because I didn't hate you?

88
00:06:38,987 --> 00:06:42,247
Do the people around you get resentful in this kind of situation?

89
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:46,237
Yeah. All the people around me are like that.

90
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:51,447
Don't criticize me because I'm not like the people around you.

91
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:53,997
Does it look like I'm criticizing you?

92
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:59,347
Even back then, I never criticized you. I always admired you.

93
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:03,227
You're lucky you're so remarkable.

94
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,657
I heard you opened up a disciplinary action meeting?

95
00:07:23,657 --> 00:07:26,777
Did you have to go and make a big deal? Why didn't you just quietly get over it?

96
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:30,757
You have to freshen up the air once in a while. The employees have no tension.

97
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:36,967
Be careful. With all this happening like mini explosions, I don't have a good feeling.

98
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:40,167
No matter how I think about it, I think it's since then.

99
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:47,297
It's okay Father. You're getting weak.

100
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:50,257
If that was the case, I wouldn't be standing here today.

101
00:07:50,257 --> 00:07:52,527
Alright. Do well!

102
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:53,977
Yes.

103
00:07:54,947 --> 00:07:59,637
The Disciplinary Action Committee's punishment options are a warning, salary reduction, or permanent leave.

104
00:07:59,637 --> 00:08:03,077
I think a warning for Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong is adequate punishment.

105
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:05,437
It's already come this far. What do you mean, just a warning?

106
00:08:05,437 --> 00:08:09,177
On top of that, she's not even reflecting on her actions! We need to fire her!

107
00:08:09,177 --> 00:08:14,567
If we fire her for this kind of reason, the hospital will be under fire.

108
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:18,587
This isn't just Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong's problem. It's a problem of the entire neurosurgery department.

109
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:21,737
I don't believe that one person has to take the entire blame.

110
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:24,917
Aren't these your personal emotions, Professor Hong?

111
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:28,007
If anything, aren't these your personal feelings, Director?

112
00:08:36,497 --> 00:08:38,647
This punk isn't picking up his phone.

113
00:08:39,897 --> 00:08:41,987
Has everyone eaten?

114
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:45,587
- Did you take patient Kim Soo Gyeong's CT?
- Ah...

115
00:08:45,587 --> 00:08:46,897
I'm going to take them right now.

116
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:49,637
Phone. Why don't you pick up your phone?

117
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:52,847
Because of you, the entire neurosurgery department is in chaos.

118
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:55,307
Did you forget again?! Lost in your own mind!

119
00:08:55,307 --> 00:09:00,267
You can't even do your own work properly. Do you think you have time to take care of other business?

120
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:07,517
Huh? Wh-Why isn't he talking back?

121
00:09:07,517 --> 00:09:11,057
Geez, you should stop now. Kang Soo is probably having a hard time.

122
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:13,747
He adored Doctor Yoo, and now it looks like he's getting her fired.

123
00:09:13,747 --> 00:09:18,597
I'm going to keep doing it more more more more. It's because all of you guys are so out of it that things like this are happening!

124
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,047
It's been a while.

125
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:35,447
I've been waiting, but you finally gave me a call.

126
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:37,957
It feels good, because you're greeting me so cheerfully.

127
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:42,137
It must've been hard for you to come all the way up here. Would you like to eat something? It's my treat.

128
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:46,847
No, thank you. Thank you for your hospitality.

129
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:52,387
I was wondering, does the offer from last time still stand?

130
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:54,987
Of course. It's still valid.

131
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:05,277
Hong Hong Hong

132
00:10:05,277 --> 00:10:06,597
Yes, teacher.

133
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:10,717
I have two pieces of good news, and one bit of bad news. Do you want to hear them now?

134
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:17,037
Please tell me. The good news first, please.

135
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:19,977
- I only want to tell you one piece of good news.
- Why?

136
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:23,127
Because good things aren't something that come to people easily.

137
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:26,797
I want the unlimited giving tree back. I miss Mr. Daddy Long Legs.

138
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:29,317
No, I don't want to come back.

139
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:36,827
The good news, I came to tell you your punishment.

140
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:39,437
It's better than hearing it from someone else, right?

141
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:43,277
Yes, you're right. What about the bad news?

142
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:48,507
The punishment. It's a month-long suspension.

143
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:52,537
It's less than I expected.

144
00:10:55,667 --> 00:11:01,557
You were cool today. I became very proud that you're my girlfriend.

145
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:05,327
I'm glad that you asked the questions.

146
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:08,957
It wasn't a place to receive my punishment from Director Jin Myeong Hoon.

147
00:11:08,957 --> 00:11:13,627
I wanted to show you how much I've grown.

148
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:19,247
The second piece of good news is that we're moving locations.

149
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:24,867
Call! But what will happen with Patient Lee Young Hwan without me?

150
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:36,467
What are you doing here? It's not your job.

151
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:40,367
Your patients are my patients. Since when did we start separating patients?

152
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,817
You don't have to be sorry to me.

153
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:45,387
I adjusted the IV.

154
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:52,277
It's only a one month suspension. Take care of her while I'm gone.

155
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:06,687
Neurosurgery Department Kang Kyeong Joon

156
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:08,917
Kang Kyeong Joon.

157
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,717
Did you do Patient Lee Soon Jin's dressing properly?

158
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:11,677
I told Kang Soo to do it.

159
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,307
Is "I told Kang Soo to do it" a trending repertoire?

160
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:18,217
When are you going to come to your senses? There's an inflammation. Aren't you going to take care of things properly?

161
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:19,177
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:20,587
Is "I'm sorry" it?

163
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:22,907
I will go.

164
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:28,627
Because you're acting like this, the younger ones act as they want.

165
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:31,877
A first-year ignores a notification and a second-year runs away.

166
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,917
When did the neurosurgery department become like this?

167
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:37,797
Kang Kyeong Joon. Are you still the chief resident after all this?

168
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:45,507
Professor, it's all my fault. Hyung Gyeong Joon didn't do anything wrong..

169
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:50,217
Stay still. Why are you interfering when the professor is speaking?

170
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:53,187
Because you're like this,

171
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:57,327
I'm getting cursed at. What did I do wrong to you guys?

172
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:59,247
Where were you? Why didn't you pick up?

173
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:01,397
I was taking patient Kim Soo Kyung's CT.

174
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:04,067
Why were you taking the CT just now?

175
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,767
How could you not improve after hearing all of this just now?

176
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:08,987
Are you still a doctor?

177
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:14,667
Why don't you have anything to say? You were clearly answering me. Why don't you have anything to say?

178
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:18,797
If you're going to work like this, quit. Doctor Yoo got suspended because of you.

179
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:22,847
- When are you going to stop hurting others?
- Stop it!

180
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,847
I said that I'm sorry.

181
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:32,747
I haven't been able to say anything because I'm sorry.

182
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:37,187
What do I say in this situation?

183
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:47,687
Kang Soo!

184
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:49,087
Kang Soo! Kang Soo!

185
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:50,937
Kang Soo!

186
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:54,017
Kang Soo! Get the intubation kit.

187
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:56,207
Check the vitals.

188
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:59,807
Kang Soo! Kang Soo!

189
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:01,567
Choi Kang Soo!

190
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:09,497
What do you see?

191
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:12,487
There is a meningioma near the sphenoid ridge.

192
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:14,887
It's large in size.

193
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:15,657
You're right.

194
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:19,007
The tumor is located near the optic and motor nerve,

195
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:22,567
so it can cause visual damage or motor problems.

196
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:27,737
Now that I see this, I remember he took medication for migraines frequently.

197
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:29,597
Kang Soo hates being in pain.

198
00:14:29,597 --> 00:14:31,427
He was also dazed a lot of the time.

199
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:36,387
He said he was good at drinking, but he fainted after a one-shot at the dinner.

200
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:41,097
What are you guys? Are you witnesses? You're confessing a lot.

201
00:14:43,347 --> 00:14:45,587
Did Kang Soo wake up?

202
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:56,667
Are you okay? Lie down.

203
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:01,327
Are you embarrassed?

204
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:03,167
A little.

205
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,117
If you were hurting, you should've said so.

206
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:11,797
You... This is really upsetting. What do we become?

207
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:15,747
How long have you been in pain? Is this your first GTC (Generalized Tonic-Clonic seizure)?

208
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:17,137
I'm not sure.

209
00:15:17,137 --> 00:15:18,957
How bad is the migraine?

210
00:15:18,957 --> 00:15:24,317
Near the corner of my eye, the place that is hard hurts a bit.

211
00:15:24,317 --> 00:15:27,987
The pain is... about 7 out of 10?

212
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:31,827
Our Kang Soo is in a lot of pain. Your eye hurts but is your vision okay?

213
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:37,717
Hyung, I think the vision in my left eye has decreased.

214
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:39,337
I also have absence seizures.

215
00:15:39,337 --> 00:15:40,207
Absence Seizure: A type of seizure where a person become reactionless for a few seconds.

216
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:44,787
Kang Soo, did you know you had meningioma and absence seizure?

217
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:48,827
Did you perhaps ignore the notification because of an absence seizure?

218
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:53,907
When I got the call from the VIP nurse, I had an absence seizure.

219
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:56,727
I didn't know because I had no memory of it.

220
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:02,387
Rest for now. You guys, follow me.

221
00:16:03,677 --> 00:16:06,717
Hyung Yeong Gook, Hyung Joong Dae.

222
00:16:08,027 --> 00:16:09,857
I'm sorry.

223
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:30,737
You have to go to work tomorrow. Is it okay to be out this late?

224
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:33,747
Well, it's good for me since I'm unemployed.

225
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:38,847
You are quick to change your attitude. You already found the pros of being unemployed?

226
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:42,577
Now that I found one, I'm going to find more during the month.

227
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:46,197
It seems like I'm going to be busy playing with my unemployed girlfriend.

228
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:47,707
Do you not like it?

229
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,947
No, I like it.

230
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,097
Now tell me the second piece of good news.

231
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,587
I'm anticipating it a lot.

232
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,247
After stalling for a bit, so that you are anxious to hear it.

233
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:17,247
You're home early.

234
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:18,117
You're here?

235
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:21,747
That's right. Even if you say whatever, your house is most comfortable, right?

236
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:27,597
If I can't kick you out, I'll just enjoy it.

237
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:30,267
But isn't Aunt coming?

238
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:33,587
She went home. She had interior construction going on before.

239
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,117
Oh, I see.

240
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:40,597
It must be hard for your department these days, although Ji Hong is having the hardest time.

241
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:44,567
Doctor Yoo is tough. Even though she received disciplinary action, she will make good use of her time.

242
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:47,647
Resting for a month isn't bad.

243
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:50,777
How did you come to like Ji Hong's girlfriend?

244
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:53,687
That's what I'm saying.

245
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:54,987
Meet another woman.

246
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:59,017
Your uncle knows a bunch of girls. I'll introduce you to the prettiest one.

247
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:02,387
I don't want to. It's been a while since I've felt such a nice emotion.

248
00:18:02,387 --> 00:18:06,577
It's true that the emotion, love, doesn't come easily.

249
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:08,847
How bad is it?

250
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:12,867
Uncle, you know how much I hate doing politics, right?

251
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:15,577
I know. I don't like it either.

252
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:20,187
But because of this woman, I wanted to go into the Board of Directors meeting.

253
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:21,097
Why?

254
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:24,827
Because I didn't want her to be punished again.

255
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:27,317
Ji Hong should be nervous.

256
00:18:45,347 --> 00:18:51,647
When I came fishing with my dad, I wanted to go home at times like this.

257
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,027
When you can't catch fish?

258
00:18:53,027 --> 00:18:58,047
No, I don't like long silences. It doesn't fit with me. I needed to do something.

259
00:18:59,947 --> 00:19:06,047
But being in a daze is nice. I think I know why my father liked fishing.

260
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:11,687
Why do we understand each other more when we're separated rather than when we're together?

261
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:16,407
I'm telling you to be good to me when I'm with you. Be good to me while I'm with you.

262
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,297
Yes sir!

263
00:19:19,757 --> 00:19:25,787
The second piece of good news. Chief Kim Chi Hyeon proposed a deal.

264
00:19:26,797 --> 00:19:30,387
What is he demanding in return for the anesthesia records?

265
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:34,227
I didn't accept his demands, but I gave him another road to pick.

266
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:37,647
I'm waiting for him to accept.

267
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:41,687
If he doesn't accept, I'm going to make him.

268
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:43,147
I'll do it.

269
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:48,957
You, just need to receive an apology from Director Jin after I receive the anesthesia records.

270
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:51,367
You just have to get out of this business.

271
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:18,847
Granny...

272
00:20:20,657 --> 00:20:23,847
Granny got on her knees in front of me.

273
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,867
Asking me to take good care of her granddaughter.

274
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:31,777
I want to ask her if I'm doing well right now.

275
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:38,007
You're doing well.

276
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:47,727
Do you know what this is?

277
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:52,707
You always hang it on your bag, right?

278
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:57,827
It's a keychain for my apartment before the accident.

279
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,467
My parents...

280
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:09,747
passed away unfairly. The people around made them miss their golden time.

281
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:13,867
I really wanted to crush the whole world.

282
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:19,337
Our family was really happy.

283
00:21:19,337 --> 00:21:23,477
I was happy with my grandmother too, up until the surgery.

284
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:26,427
I don't believe in tomorrow.

285
00:21:26,427 --> 00:21:29,407
This moment in today is the most important

286
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:31,827
because you could die tomorrow.

287
00:21:33,347 --> 00:21:37,907
What Granny wanted... was for you to be happy.

288
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:43,627
Not for you give up on today to research her death.

289
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:47,187
To me, that's why I'm living today.

290
00:21:47,187 --> 00:21:51,657
That's why I'm respecting and helping you. It's almost over.

291
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:17,877
- You're here?
- Hyung.

292
00:22:17,877 --> 00:22:20,347
- Did you finish the dressing?
- Yeah, I'm done.

293
00:22:20,347 --> 00:22:22,487
Is there anything for me to do? I'm bored to death.

294
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:26,897
You're back alive after one day, huh? Go and rest in your ward.

295
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:30,437
Oh.

296
00:22:30,437 --> 00:22:33,317
Chief, is there anything for me to do?

297
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:34,867
There's nothing.

298
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:39,137
- Why is he like that?
- I don't know.

299
00:22:39,137 --> 00:22:44,177
After seeing your scan in the CT room yesterday, he became a bit weird.

300
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:49,507
Neurosurgery Professor Hong Ji Hong

301
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,587
Yes?

302
00:22:54,647 --> 00:22:56,197
Sit.

303
00:23:03,297 --> 00:23:07,267
Hey, the MRI you showed me last time was yours.

304
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:09,827
Yes.

305
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:15,477
Let's do surgery.

306
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:21,437
The tumor is putting pressure on the optic and oculomotor nerves. So, we won't overdo it during the surgery.

307
00:23:21,437 --> 00:23:27,307
Professor, if it doesn't go well, will it be impossible for me to be a surgeon?

308
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:30,127
Let's not think of it not going well.

Neurosurgery Professor Jeong Yoon Do

310
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:39,617
- You have to do surgery now.
- Yes.

311
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:41,007
I'm going to do a total removal.

312
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:42,777
Total Removal: removal of the whole tumor

313
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:48,387
If you remove the tumor and accidentally hit something, my eyesight can worsen or I can lose my vision.

314
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:51,867
You don't have diplopia ( double vision ) yet. You're fine.

315
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:56,817
I'll clear my time just for you this week. Night surgery is fine too.

316
00:23:56,817 --> 00:23:58,837
Just tell me what time is alright for you.

317
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:12,347

Vice-President Office

320
00:24:33,397 --> 00:24:36,497
I saw your MRI. You have to have surgery.

321
00:24:36,497 --> 00:24:40,987
I think a subtotal removal will be better than a total removal.

322
00:24:40,987 --> 00:24:43,817
You aren't saying you'll do the surgery, right?

323
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:47,357
- Should I do it for you?
- No.

324
00:24:47,357 --> 00:24:50,917
Actually, I came to talk to you about that.

325
00:24:54,217 --> 00:24:56,437
Chief Kim Chi Hyeon

326
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:01,787
Did you think about it?

327
00:25:01,787 --> 00:25:03,617
You're impatient.

328
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:06,927
I feel like we should push forward on this type of matter in order to have a good result.

329
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:10,837
Don't I need to push you in order for you to have a good cause?

330
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:14,397
You really can't go with the original idea?

331
00:25:14,397 --> 00:25:17,847
- I can't.
- Then I'll think about it a bit more.

332
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:20,507
Since Jin Myeong Hoon's option is still available, as well.

333
00:25:20,507 --> 00:25:25,707
Think about it as much as you need to. It's a problem that will affect your next 20 years.

334
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:38,297
- It's tiring.
- You're working hard.

335
00:25:38,297 --> 00:25:41,607
Kyeong Joon, schedule Kang Soo's surgery.

336
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:43,127
Yes.

337
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:46,287
Professor Hong Ji Hong also said to schedule Kang Soo's surgery.

338
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:48,697
- Really?
- What?

339
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:50,957
Didn't you tell Professor Hong Ji Hong that I'm going to do the surgery?

340
00:25:50,957 --> 00:25:54,107
He came to work, looked at Kang Soo's MRI and asked to get ready right away,

341
00:25:54,107 --> 00:25:56,867
so I thought you figured it out between the two of you.

342
00:25:58,277 --> 00:25:59,907
Alright.

343
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:05,257
It seems like Doc Kang Soo's surgery got a bit twisted.

344
00:26:05,257 --> 00:26:07,837
But, where is Doc Kang Soo?

345

Surgical Management of Skull Base Meningiomas — An Overview

346
00:26:24,097 --> 00:26:25,847
Chief.

347
00:26:26,697 --> 00:26:29,057
Why are you avoiding me?

348
00:26:31,727 --> 00:26:33,557
Who's avoiding you?

349
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:36,387
You weren't there when I woke up either.

350
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:41,097
I'm sorry. I hit your head a lot.

351
00:26:41,097 --> 00:26:44,237
Why are you acting like a ordinary person? You're a doctor.

352
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,217
Ah, our Kang Soo, you were here. Why are you here?

353
00:26:49,217 --> 00:26:51,397
I was looking at how the surgery will be performed.

354
00:26:51,397 --> 00:26:54,717
Who are you going to get surgery from? Doc Hong? Doc Jeong?

355
00:26:54,717 --> 00:26:59,257
You're getting excited. You're excited. What's good about getting surgery?

356
00:26:59,257 --> 00:27:02,477
Who's going in for Kang Soo's surgery?

357
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:08,027
You guys aren't much to look at when you're serious.

358
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:11,887
Who's going into my surgery? Hands up.

359
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:17,937
I'm starting to be a little upset.

360
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:22,897
The other doctors are lined up to do my surgery. What are you hyungs doing?

361
00:27:22,897 --> 00:27:25,117
How do we open your head?

362
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:28,067
Well, I can't open it.

363
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:32,177
No matter how much you were mistreated,

364
00:27:32,177 --> 00:27:36,217
you didn't give up on your style, our Kang Soo.

365
00:27:39,987 --> 00:27:43,807
I'm a second year, so I can't go in.

366
00:27:49,027 --> 00:27:51,997
S-S-Sorry.

367
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:57,327
Those guys, seriously.

368
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:09,527
- Your drinks are here. Have a good drink.
- Yes.

369
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:13,937
Stay at home. Why did you come out?

370
00:28:13,937 --> 00:28:16,407
I was at home all day.

371
00:28:16,407 --> 00:28:19,797
- Didn't Teach Hong contact you?
- He did. He said he's coming.

372
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:22,317
Oh, he's here.

373
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:25,407
- Hey, Teacher!
- Hi.

374
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:29,287
It's hot. Give me a cold beer.

375
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:32,467
Wait for a bit.

376
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:35,917
- You look happy.
- I came to deliver a present.

377
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:39,187
- Is it possibly...
- As expected.

378
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:50,147
Anesthesia Record

379
00:28:53,397 --> 00:28:56,367
Now I've done everything I can for you.

380
00:28:57,877 --> 00:29:01,927
- Thank you.
- I hope you can be freed from Granny's case.

381
00:29:01,927 --> 00:29:05,157
That's the best present you can give me.

401
00:31:13,277 --> 00:31:14,807
Yes.

402
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:17,667
Welcome. Come in.

403
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:25,067
Did you bring the anesthesia records?

404
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:26,697
Yes.

405
00:31:32,217 --> 00:31:34,967
I will give you an accurate interpretation.

406
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:38,687
During the surgery around 12:15, the inferior vena cava ruptured.

407
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:40,567
- There's blood.
- Suction.

408
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,767
At 30 minutes, they cut the abdomen open.
 Let's open it quickly.

409
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,307
Yes.

410
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:48,577
At 50 minute, cardiac arrest happened.

411
00:31:48,577 --> 00:31:51,247
It's cardiac arrest!

412
00:31:51,247 --> 00:31:52,837
At 13:20, table death.

413
00:31:52,837 --> 00:31:55,387
Table Death: Death during surgery

414
00:31:56,427 --> 00:32:01,687
Due to excessive hemorrhage, an arrest occurred. After that, death during the surgery.

415
00:32:04,457 --> 00:32:08,937
I understand this record up until now.

416
00:32:08,937 --> 00:32:12,327
Then I'll go into the special details rather than the things you already know.

417
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:16,857
Performing a laparoscopy during a stomach cancer surgery means that the operating surgeon made an uncertain choice.

418
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:22,437
Performing a laparoscopic surgery in 2003 wasn't common, since it was first introduced then.

419
00:32:23,297 --> 00:32:27,237
I don't think I heard about a laparoscopic surgery.

420
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:31,487
But the thing that seems weird is that they didn't open up the abdomen right after the inferior vena cava ruptured,

421
00:32:31,487 --> 00:32:33,547
although there was that much hemorrhaging.

422
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:35,927
Was there an error by the doctor?

423
00:32:36,837 --> 00:32:41,577
I don't really know that. You should ask the surgeon himself.

424
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:48,857
In my opinion, the surgeon tried a new method in treating the patient,

425
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:52,187
but disturbed a major blood vessel by mistake, leading to hemorrhage.

426
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:55,887
If they had made the right decision quickly, cut open the abdomen and then closed it (the damaged vessel),

427
00:32:55,887 --> 00:32:58,567
I think he could have avoided this extreme outcome.

428
00:33:01,107 --> 00:33:05,607
So the operating surgeon definitely made a wrong decision.

429
00:33:20,447 --> 00:33:22,467
Dr. Yoo, aren't you still on suspension?

430
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,487
Yes.

431
00:33:23,487 --> 00:33:26,867
You are still coming to the hospital while on suspension. I can see your passion as a doctor.

432
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:31,477
I came today to turn in the homework that you had given me.

433
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:33,777
You don't remember me?

434
00:33:33,777 --> 00:33:38,257
Thirteen years ago, I was the guardian of Patient Kang Mal Ja.

435
00:33:39,907 --> 00:33:41,567
Let's go to office.

436
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:53,877
I knew you were going to talk to me someday, and I've been waiting.

437
00:33:53,877 --> 00:33:56,137
You found out who I am?

438
00:33:56,137 --> 00:34:00,937
You're going around spreading words about who you are. Wouldn't it be weird if I didn't know?

439
00:34:00,937 --> 00:34:02,457
You even called me once.

440
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,577
Then, did you pretend you didn't know me even though you did?

441
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:09,847
No, I don't have try to pretend that. There's also a possibility you wouldn't even come and talk to me at all,

442
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,787
since you're a realistic kid.

443
00:34:11,787 --> 00:34:17,537
Don't use informal speech on me, but use formal speech. There's no reason for you to.

444
00:34:17,537 --> 00:34:22,497
Don't use informal speech. It feels like we're getting closer so I don't like it.

445
00:34:24,097 --> 00:34:27,877
Thirteen years ago, you told me

446
00:34:27,877 --> 00:34:32,787
that if I had evidence that you didn't try your best, you would accept the consequences.

447
00:34:32,787 --> 00:34:36,367
So? (informal speech) No,

448
00:34:38,297 --> 00:34:40,177
I mean, so? (formal speech)

449
00:34:46,247 --> 00:34:47,347
This is the evidence.

450
00:34:47,347 --> 00:34:50,717
How can you prove that I didn't do my best with this?

451
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:54,987
Did you explain to my grandmother that you were doing a laparoscopic surgery?

452
00:34:54,987 --> 00:34:58,467
You only told her that you're opening up her stomach, right? You didn't say that it was a new surgical method.

453
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:03,647
Laparoscopy doesn't require opening the stomach, so it's a remarkable surgery that takes away the burden from the patient.

454
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:05,477
That was the best method at the time.

455
00:35:05,477 --> 00:35:09,347
The insurance application wasn't successful, so didn't you do it because of the money?

456
00:35:09,347 --> 00:35:12,207
I can't talk to you if you act like this.

457
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:14,887
How can a stomach cancer surgery become table death?

458
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:16,297
That's definitely a fault.

459
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:19,107
Fault cannot prove that I didn't try my best.

460
00:35:19,107 --> 00:35:22,297
I could still make a mistake when I try my best.

461
00:35:22,297 --> 00:35:24,997
Are you telling me that you did your best?

462
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:28,857
Then why do you think I let you check all these things?

463
00:35:28,857 --> 00:35:31,277
You probably did it because it wasn't a threat to you.

464
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:34,657
Through the law, you no longer can receive punishment, and if revealed there is no blow.

465
00:35:34,657 --> 00:35:38,817
You know that well. Do you think we only made mistakes on one or two occasions?

466
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:41,787
As a neurosurgeon, you should've grown.

467
00:35:41,787 --> 00:35:45,087
How can you still have your high school-like emotions?

468
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:49,797
I didn't torment you even though I knew who you were, and I actually even gave you a chance.

469
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:52,157
You're saying that there's nothing wrong with this surgery?

470
00:35:52,157 --> 00:35:56,527
I made a mistake, but I did my best.

471
00:35:56,527 --> 00:35:59,917
Therefore, I have nothing to be punished for.

472
00:36:01,277 --> 00:36:04,227
Despite that, I'll apologize.

473
00:36:04,227 --> 00:36:07,107
A mistake is still a mistake.

474
00:36:09,437 --> 00:36:14,037
Now, I'm not in debt to you anymore, right?

475
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:15,427
You're saying all of this by yourself.

476
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:18,157
One who has tied a knot must untie it (solve the problems you yourself create).

477
00:36:18,157 --> 00:36:23,667
You're dating Professor Hong lately, right? That was a good move.

478
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:27,387
You should live on thinking only the happy things. Life is short.

479
00:36:28,697 --> 00:36:33,577
I guess I am too naive. I judged you too quickly.

480
00:36:33,577 --> 00:36:35,727
You're really formidable.

481
00:36:37,617 --> 00:36:39,897
Did you think an apology would be enough?

482
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:44,807
However, I'm feeling even worse after receiving your apology.

483
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:52,197
I was wrong to expect a touching apology from you, the perpetrator, to me, the victim.

484
00:36:52,197 --> 00:36:56,017
Ask Professor Hong. He's also the same.

485
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:59,217
Everyone in the world who has lived enough is the same.

486
00:37:01,867 --> 00:37:03,107
I will leave today.

487
00:37:03,107 --> 00:37:05,307
Don't come to me about this anymore.

488
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:08,787
It would be even better if you can just stop coming to the hospital.

489
00:37:08,787 --> 00:37:13,447
Do you want to continue coming to the hospital that I am running?

490
00:37:34,637 --> 00:37:40,457
Alright. I'll do it through the law which you're scared of.

491
00:37:48,127 --> 00:37:49,587
Did you have a good talk?

492
00:37:49,587 --> 00:37:53,907
Do you know any lawyers? A capable one would be nice.

493
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:56,187
Why are you asking about a lawyer?

494
00:37:56,187 --> 00:37:59,157
I want to know if I can sue.

495
00:38:00,427 --> 00:38:01,897
Did the Director not apologize?

496
00:38:01,897 --> 00:38:04,977
He did, a soulless apology.

497
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:09,167
I wish he would get screwed over.

498
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:11,817
How can he act like that's nothing?

499
00:38:11,817 --> 00:38:15,107
I thought the anesthesia records would be the end, but I guess not.

500
00:38:15,107 --> 00:38:19,517
Nope. Now I have the evidence, I'll try everything that I can.

501
00:38:20,547 --> 00:38:22,587
Can't you just stop?

502
00:38:25,397 --> 00:38:30,487
Director told me that you would act the same,

503
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:33,537
that all the people who have lived enough would.

504
00:38:33,537 --> 00:38:38,387
Does it seem like I'm projecting adolescent-like emotions trying to reveal my grandmother's malpractice case?

505
00:38:38,387 --> 00:38:44,487
I... just feel sad that you are ruining your present by being so caught up in this.

506
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:49,357
Look at me and tell me, are you having the same thoughts as Director Jin?

507
00:38:49,357 --> 00:38:52,447
Why are you so aggressive? I'm on the same side as you.

508
00:38:52,447 --> 00:38:54,647
How can you do that to me.

509
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:59,957
Because I'm angry.

510
00:38:59,957 --> 00:39:05,847
I feel like no one in the world can understand me. Including you.

511
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:13,257
I'll introduce you to a lawyer.

512
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:18,637
Do whatever you want to.

513
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:34,417
I'm receiving my punishment for sending Doc two times to receive disciplinary action.

514
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:37,697
I am getting a surgery. See you in a month.

515
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:50,307
I'm sorry I can't be with you. I'll go visit you later.

516
00:40:02,597 --> 00:40:06,957
You are ready. Are you already done preparing for surgery?

517
00:40:09,727 --> 00:40:12,307
Who are you getting the surgery from?

518
00:40:12,307 --> 00:40:14,197
Please do my surgery, Doctor.

519
00:40:14,197 --> 00:40:16,967
Okay. I'm happy that you chose me. What's your reason?

520
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:18,667
I saw my MRI,

521
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:21,647
it seemed like the risk of damaging my eyesight was high.

522
00:40:21,647 --> 00:40:28,607
Right, to speak objectively, this won't affect your daily life at all,

523
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:32,177
but this could be the end for you as a Neurosurgeon.

524
00:40:32,177 --> 00:40:34,647
You know that the surgeries that we do are in fine detail.

525
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:38,267
You know that it's fatal if something happens to your sight, right?

526
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:42,857
If that happens...then it would be better to kill me.

527
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:48,157
Kang Soo, becoming a surgeon in the Neurosurgery Department isn't the answer to life.

528
00:40:48,157 --> 00:40:51,347
No, it's everything to me

529
00:40:51,347 --> 00:40:54,577
and that's the reason I chose you.

530
00:40:55,847 --> 00:41:00,347
Professor, I live with my younger sibling. It's just the two of us.

531
00:41:00,347 --> 00:41:02,497
I'm the head of the household.

532
00:41:05,427 --> 00:41:08,297
Since I was young,

533
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:14,257
I endured with the dream of becoming a really awesome doctor like you, Professor.

534
00:41:14,257 --> 00:41:18,387
I thought that there weren't that many years

535
00:41:18,387 --> 00:41:21,107
left for that dream to become a reality.

536
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:24,837
But what is this?

537
00:41:26,657 --> 00:41:30,857
I mean, everyone else seems to have it easy...

538
00:41:32,617 --> 00:41:35,507
But why is my life so hard?

539
00:41:58,787 --> 00:42:01,157
Sunflower Law Firm

540
00:42:02,197 --> 00:42:04,397
Sunflower Law Firm

541
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:08,637
I heard from Professor Hong Ji Hong.

542
00:42:08,637 --> 00:42:12,177
Yes. I told you roughly over the phone.

543
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,587
Surgery Record

544
00:42:16,587 --> 00:42:22,087
This is the surgery record and this is a copy of the record from the Anesthesia Department.

545
00:42:22,087 --> 00:42:23,997
I've said this over the phone as well.

546
00:42:23,997 --> 00:42:27,987
We can't sue for a medical accident from 13 years ago in either criminal or civil court

547
00:42:27,987 --> 00:42:29,717
because the statute of limitations has expired.

548
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:32,827
Still, if we look hard enough, won't there be a lawsuit we can pursue?

549
00:42:32,827 --> 00:42:36,637
Even if we file a lawsuit, it will be dismissed because of the statute of limitations.

550
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,867
Anything is fine. Can't we involve them by the law?

551
00:42:40,867 --> 00:42:45,167
If you're this desperate now, what were you doing for the past 13 years?

552
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:47,637
You should have came here 10 years ago.

553
00:42:51,957 --> 00:42:54,467
It's been a while. You don't come here often these days.

554
00:42:54,467 --> 00:42:58,787
I've decided to accept the beagles. Apparently Kang Soo chose you.

555
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:00,427
You said you were going to do a total removal right?

556
00:43:00,427 --> 00:43:02,907
- Where else would I go?
- That's why you need to go.

557
00:43:02,907 --> 00:43:05,557
- Doctor!
- Oh.

558
00:43:05,557 --> 00:43:10,387
I wanted to see Kang Soo's face before he goes into surgery, but he said that he won't do the surgery today.

559
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,727
Why?

560
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:14,807
I don't know. I'm looking into that now.

561
00:43:23,577 --> 00:43:26,127
- Oh, Kang Soo.
- Department Chief.

562
00:43:26,127 --> 00:43:29,227
Sit, sit, sit.

563
00:43:29,227 --> 00:43:31,297
- How's your condition?
- I'm fine.

564
00:43:31,297 --> 00:43:33,747
- Then why are you postponing your surgery?
- Ah,

565
00:43:33,747 --> 00:43:38,787
my younger brother said he would come but he's not here yet. I want to see him before I go in.

566
00:43:38,787 --> 00:43:43,157
You never know. I could lose my sight if the surgery goes wrong.

567
00:43:43,157 --> 00:43:45,457
Nothing will go wrong.

568
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:48,987
That's why I said, you never know.

569
00:43:48,987 --> 00:43:51,407
It's become a habit.

570
00:43:51,407 --> 00:43:54,897
I always tend to think of the worst possible scenarios.

571
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:04,757
You're not the only one. I tend to think like that too.

572
00:44:04,757 --> 00:44:08,737
This surgery is a fight against time. For 12 hours,

573
00:44:08,737 --> 00:44:10,827
both you and the medical team need to endure.

574
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:15,427
Hyungnim!

575
00:44:16,557 --> 00:44:19,187
My younger brother is here, Doctor. Hey,

576
00:44:19,187 --> 00:44:21,047
Choi Young Soo!

577
00:44:22,437 --> 00:44:27,567
Salute! First Class Private, Choi Young Soo! I received an order for vacation!

578
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:29,597
Salute.

579
00:44:30,947 --> 00:44:32,607
Did you eat?

580
00:44:33,467 --> 00:44:35,257
I didn't eat yet.

581
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,887
Hyungnim, look at this.

582
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:43,727
I received a license for Korean cuisine.

583
00:44:43,727 --> 00:44:46,937
While I'm at it, I'm going to get it for American and Japanese cuisines.

584
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:50,067
Do you see this? Huh? Do you? Do you?

585
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:53,547
I see it, I see it, I see it! You rascal.

586
00:44:53,547 --> 00:44:56,117
You're a man. Why are you talking so much?

587
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:03,857
Hyungnim, can you not become a doctor if you receive the surgery?

588
00:45:03,857 --> 00:45:06,287
Who said that?

589
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,827
Nothing, never mind. I was just asking.

590
00:45:08,827 --> 00:45:13,437
I think that my brother is the best in the world.

591
00:45:13,437 --> 00:45:15,887
I hope your surgery goes well.

592
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:20,767
And I... don't care if you don't become a doctor.

593
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,657
Understand?

594
00:45:26,187 --> 00:45:28,967
The surgery will take a long time. Sleep.

595
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:30,627
Hyungnim.

596
00:45:33,417 --> 00:45:36,997
I'm sorry for upsetting you.

597
00:45:41,277 --> 00:45:43,897
What did you upset me about, you rascal?

598
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:47,537
Raise your head.

599
00:45:49,087 --> 00:45:51,307
You're so handsome.

600
00:45:55,477 --> 00:45:58,157
- That hurts!
- Of course it hurts!

601
00:45:59,377 --> 00:46:01,877
- Do you already have abs?
- Ah, stop it.

602
00:46:01,877 --> 00:46:05,157
Wow, you have such a nice body.

603
00:46:05,157 --> 00:46:07,017
- Really?
- Yeah.

604
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:10,277
Operating time
Current time
Anesthesia time

605
00:46:16,457 --> 00:46:17,757
Don't you have any surgeries today?

606
00:46:17,757 --> 00:46:20,647
I do. I'll have to leave soon after watching a bit.

607
00:46:20,647 --> 00:46:23,667
Are you going to watch him for 12 hours?

608
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:27,337
I don't know. I guess I'll have to come in periodically.

609
00:46:27,337 --> 00:46:30,027
Everyone has to do well.

610
00:46:32,987 --> 00:46:34,677
Gown.

611
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:53,517
Today's surgery is a fight against time.

612
00:46:53,517 --> 00:46:58,257
With the patient that has to endure for a long period of time, let's all work hard.

613
00:47:13,927 --> 00:47:21,177
♫  Shining so brightly in my heart ♫

614
00:47:21,177 --> 00:47:28,627
♫ The rain which is you falls and slowly tinges me  ♫

615
00:47:28,627 --> 00:47:34,307

618
00:47:45,197 --> 00:47:46,847

633
00:49:05,697 --> 00:49:09,907
I'm going to do it now.

634
00:49:09,907 --> 00:49:11,827
Biopsy.

635
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:19,377
♫  Your warm touch, the melody of just the two of us ♫

636
00:49:19,377 --> 00:49:25,457
♫  The dream which everything will be made into ♫

637
00:49:32,407 --> 00:49:35,757
Isn't there a way to start it?

638
00:49:36,827 --> 00:49:41,177
There's nothing. The statute for limitations ended both for the civil and criminal cases. There's nothing we can sue over.

639
00:49:41,177 --> 00:49:43,357
I thought about it

640
00:49:43,357 --> 00:49:46,337
and the records of the Anesthesia Department and the surgery records are different.

641
00:49:46,337 --> 00:49:49,787
Then the possibility that one of the two was fabricated is high.

642
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:53,297
Is there no punishment for fabricating medical records?

643
00:49:53,297 --> 00:49:56,577
Medical Services Act Article 88 provides for punishment of three years in prison or a fine of 10 million won

644
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,637
for a violation of Article 22, the medical records provision.

645
00:49:59,637 --> 00:50:02,357
But, there is also a statute of limitations for this as well.

646
00:50:02,357 --> 00:50:04,987
When were the surgery records submitted?

647
00:50:05,827 --> 00:50:09,897
Probably at that time. I guess this won't work either.

648
00:50:09,897 --> 00:50:12,617
On top of that, I heard that you even came to a settlement.

649
00:50:12,617 --> 00:50:15,187
There is nothing we can do according to the law.

650
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:20,777
If we just had not settled, would it have changed?

651
00:50:20,777 --> 00:50:23,527
At the least, your sincerity wouldn't be considered suspicious.

652
00:50:23,527 --> 00:50:27,127
When you took the money, doesn't it mean you gave up all your rights?

653
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,757
Just one second.

654
00:51:00,647 --> 00:51:05,227
It looks like Seo Woo is really tired.

655
00:51:05,227 --> 00:51:07,317
Then you go and switch with her.

656
00:51:17,517 --> 00:51:19,457
Let's continue.

657
00:51:19,457 --> 00:51:21,427
Give me the bovie.

658
00:51:25,867 --> 00:51:31,987
Doctor Jin Seo Woo, I will assist. Please go out and rest your body for a while.

659
00:51:31,987 --> 00:51:34,237
No it's okay. I want to do it.

660
00:51:34,237 --> 00:51:37,477
You seem really tired.

661
00:51:37,477 --> 00:51:40,137
Thank you. Please go drink water at least.

662
00:51:40,137 --> 00:51:42,767
If I drank water then I would have to use the bathroom.

663
00:52:12,347 --> 00:52:15,207
You can't. Dissect.

664
00:52:30,017 --> 00:52:31,837
Give me the bovie.

665
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:48,787
We're almost there.

666
00:52:55,597 --> 00:52:57,617
Give me the bipolar again.

667
00:53:20,537 --> 00:53:22,557
You've worked hard.

668
00:53:23,837 --> 00:53:26,127
Let's rest for a bit and conclude it.

669
00:53:30,327 --> 00:53:32,567
It's finished.

670
00:53:32,567 --> 00:53:35,277
It's finished, Doctor.

671
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:46,007
Let's finish it.

672
00:53:54,947 --> 00:53:58,727
I made a mistake, but I did my best.

673
00:53:58,727 --> 00:54:02,247
Therefore, I have nothing to be punished for.

674
00:54:11,847 --> 00:54:14,167
Hong Hong Hong

675
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,367
Yes, Doctor?

676
00:54:21,367 --> 00:54:24,427
Did you sleep? Did I call you too late?

677
00:54:25,517 --> 00:54:27,237
No.

678
00:54:28,117 --> 00:54:33,107
Kang Soo's surgery went well. I thought you would be curious.

679
00:54:35,527 --> 00:54:37,477
That's a relief.

680
00:54:38,917 --> 00:54:42,617
I knew it would go well because it's Kang Soo.

681
00:54:43,757 --> 00:54:46,307
Because it's you.

682
00:54:46,307 --> 00:54:48,517
What's wrong with your voice?

683
00:54:51,047 --> 00:54:53,167
Did something happen?

684
00:54:56,327 --> 00:55:00,857
Yes there is, a lot.

685
00:55:14,147 --> 00:55:15,647
You've come?

686
00:55:15,647 --> 00:55:18,067
Yeah, I can come in, right?

687
00:55:18,067 --> 00:55:20,237
Yes come in.

688
00:55:32,587 --> 00:55:35,867
Did things not go well at the lawyer's office?

689
00:55:35,867 --> 00:55:38,707
I've thought wrong.

690
00:55:38,707 --> 00:55:42,877
I should've started a lawsuit immediately and sued when the malpractice done to Grandmother happened.

691
00:55:42,877 --> 00:55:47,617
How could a kid that hadn't even turned 20 prepare for a lawsuit at that time?

692
00:55:51,357 --> 00:55:56,747
They said it's the end. I wanted to report it to the press, but they didn't even face me.

693
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:00,457
I waited until I got power.

694
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:06,617
I have power now but I can't do anything.

695
00:56:09,017 --> 00:56:13,597
You wouldn't be here if that didn't happen to your grandma.

696
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:20,097
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

697
00:56:20,097 --> 00:56:23,657
I don't want to see your life ruined in the future because of this situation.

698
00:56:23,657 --> 00:56:27,447
Do you think I'm doing this to ruin my life?

699
00:56:29,967 --> 00:56:34,737
Do you think a person like Director Jin

700
00:56:34,737 --> 00:56:38,487
would give you a true apology after you showed him the evidence?

701
00:56:38,487 --> 00:56:40,947
He apologized. It's just that there was no soul.

702
00:56:40,947 --> 00:56:44,617
Is that an apology? That's not an apology. Since a kid is crying next to him,

703
00:56:44,617 --> 00:56:49,437
he's just putting a candy inside her mouth. That person doesn't think of you as an opponent at all.

704
00:56:55,777 --> 00:56:59,727
A true apology requires a proper compensation.

705
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:03,017
An apology isn't difficult.

706
00:57:03,777 --> 00:57:05,907
People don't like to give proper compensation.

707
00:57:05,907 --> 00:57:08,347
So I'm going to make him give me proper compensation.

708
00:57:08,347 --> 00:57:11,087
How? How are you going to do it?

709
00:57:11,967 --> 00:57:14,167
I'm going to kill him.

710
00:57:16,427 --> 00:57:20,217
If you want to catch a monster the only way to do that is to become a monster myself.

711
00:57:21,507 --> 00:57:26,157
I'll kill him for you since I don't want you to go to jail.

712
00:57:28,377 --> 00:57:33,337
Give me some time because I don't want to cause the people around me difficulty.

713
00:57:33,337 --> 00:57:35,627
So give me time to organize,

714
00:57:35,627 --> 00:57:37,757
because if I go to jail I might rot forever.

715
00:57:37,757 --> 00:57:40,197
You truly are smart.

716
00:57:41,217 --> 00:57:43,317
Did you think I'd give up if you said those things?

717
00:57:43,317 --> 00:57:48,207
You're also smart, considering how you understand what I'm saying.

718
00:57:49,107 --> 00:57:55,677
Doctor. There's time in between Chairman Hong collapsing and being discovered.

719
00:57:55,677 --> 00:57:59,857
You don't find that odd? I find it odd. There has got to be something.

720
00:58:02,787 --> 00:58:04,297
Did you look into it?

721
00:58:04,297 --> 00:58:07,377
I looked into it; there wasn't much.

722
00:58:08,217 --> 00:58:13,357
It is suspicious. But being drowned in that,

723
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:18,107
I won't give up the time that I can eat and spend with you as well as with my patients,

724
00:58:18,107 --> 00:58:19,927
because I know that's what my father wanted.

725
00:58:19,927 --> 00:58:21,437
How do you know that your father wanted that?

726
00:58:21,437 --> 00:58:26,137
Leaving out parents that are the exception, a parent wants their child to be happy.

727
00:58:27,827 --> 00:58:32,017
Revenge, ruining, punishment. I don't mold myself to those things.

728
00:58:32,017 --> 00:58:35,867
There's not even enough time to do the things I love, which is a waste.

729
00:58:37,307 --> 00:58:41,007
Because there is no tomorrow for me.

730
00:58:51,527 --> 00:58:55,477
I thought the world would change if the truth was uncovered.

731
00:58:55,477 --> 00:59:00,267
The world didn't change.

732
00:59:00,267 --> 00:59:07,317
♫  May be different from yesterday
don't think you are alone ♫
