Episode 9

2
00:00:26,197 --> 00:00:27,327
Three!

3
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:41,577
I can't do this anymore.

4
00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:56,317
Look at the stars.

5
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:03,307
It's amazing.

6
00:01:08,017 --> 00:01:10,387
- Hye Jeong.
- Yes?

7
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:15,147
I have long arms, right?

8
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:18,357
You can use my arm.

9
00:01:19,617 --> 00:01:21,677
So cheesy!

10
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:25,977
Revenge helps soothe the anger of being a victim.

11
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:30,667
Revenge gives you the strength to move forward.

12
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:35,357
I will not give up until I reach my destination.

13
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:39,537
But with this man, I'm falling asleep.

14
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:49,697
Open this for me.

15
00:02:49,697 --> 00:02:50,517
Stop drinking.

16
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:52,967
- Open it.
- You already drank a lot.

17
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:53,957
Stop drinking.

18
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:59,287
Hey. Aren't you going home? I need to close this place and go home too.

19
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:01,167
You came late and now you won't leave.

20
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,687
This is all because of you.

21
00:03:03,687 --> 00:03:05,637
Okay. I'm sorry.

22
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:09,587
What are you? Are you making fun of me?

23
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:11,757
She's making fun of me!

24
00:03:11,757 --> 00:03:12,377
Be careful!

25
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:15,617
Can't you do something with her?

26
00:03:15,617 --> 00:03:18,487
This is my first time seeing her drunk, so I don't know what to do either.

27
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:19,227
Oh, my head.

28
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:20,827
Lets go.

29
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:23,107
I don't want to leave!

30
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:25,317
I'm going to order more food.

31
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:27,147
Why are you being like that to me?

32
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:30,117
This is all because of you.

33
00:03:30,117 --> 00:03:33,357
If you hadn't left me for Hye Jeong,

34
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:35,977
my life wouldn't be this twisted!

35
00:03:35,977 --> 00:03:39,387
Ah.

36
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,717
If you want to order more food, do it tomorrow.

37
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:44,197
Let's go.

38
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:46,987
- You, you...
- Go, go...

39
00:03:46,987 --> 00:03:49,627
Get some food somewhere else. Go now!

40
00:03:49,627 --> 00:03:51,387
Aiyoo.

41
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,907
That girl.

42
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:57,557
They made a huge mess.

43
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:59,137
Ah! You scared me!

44
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:01,607
What are you doing here?

45
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:03,097
I'm Ahn Joong Dae.

46
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:07,517
Seriously. Who said I'll give you anything? Did you even ask? ("Joong Dae" sounds similar to give)

47
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:08,447
Did everyone leave?

48
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:11,657
They all left! Leave!

49
00:04:12,677 --> 00:04:15,197
Ah, why did they leave me and take off?

50
00:04:15,197 --> 00:04:18,487
Excuse me. Do you have ramen?

51
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:21,107
I'm feeling hungry after I slept.

52
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:25,627
I won't give you any, Mr. Ahn Joong Dae!

53
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:28,667
Guk Il Medical Center

54
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,777
You rascal. Do you know what we went through because of you?

55
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,377
I should just...

56
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:40,387
What is this?

57
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:43,897
What else? Glucose? You think it's abracadabra?

58
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:47,727
You said you could deal with alcohol. You little liar!

59
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:49,407
Did I faint?

60
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:53,047
Can you not understand me? It's such a relief Ahn Joong Dae brought some portable intubation kits. Otherwise we would've...

61
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:54,407
Oh my, what are you doing?

62
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:57,617
I'm ill. I'm going to sleep and rest.

63
00:04:57,617 --> 00:04:59,197
This bastard!

64
00:04:59,197 --> 00:05:02,297
See, see? Abracadabra...

65
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:05,927
Rest.

66
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:08,157
Why is he like that all of a sudden?

67
00:05:12,347 --> 00:05:14,657
Your arm hurts because of me, right?

68
00:05:14,657 --> 00:05:16,787
No. I'm just exercising my arm.

69
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:19,227
Is your arm okay? My head is really heavy, right?

70
00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:22,917
That was your head? I thought it was a feather!

71
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:29,597
Thank you, I was able to sleep well for a moment.

72
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:32,537
Are you coming in now?

73
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,087
You. Aren't you hanging out too late at night?

74
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,377
Hey, you seem like a school teacher.

75
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:41,817
Teacher. I'm her guardian.

76
00:05:41,817 --> 00:05:44,017
I think there are too many weird people lately.

77
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:50,177
Last time, when it was raining, there were these two people dancing like crazy outside.

78
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:54,637
What would happen if Hye Jeong gets caught up with those weird people?

79
00:05:56,827 --> 00:05:58,647
I'll go now.

80
00:05:58,647 --> 00:06:00,507
Bye!

81
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:03,337
- Bye!
- Okay!

82
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:06,717
Well, I guess whoever gets caught by Hye Jeong would be dead.

83
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:09,107
Hey! Come with me!

84
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,827
I have my reasons for coming late, but what about you? Why were you late?

85
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:20,497
It's past the time for your shop to close.

86
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:24,847
Seo Woo made a mess and left.

87
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:27,337
I guess she came late.

88
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:32,077
She brought the alcohol with her, as if it was stuck to her like rice cake, with that doctor Young Gook or something.

89
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:37,217
He's nice! So tall and handsome.

90
00:06:37,217 --> 00:06:39,787
Young Gook matches your ideal type, right?

91
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:41,167
Is it obvious?

92
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,467
Yes.

93
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:48,667
Bring him to the place more often! Are you going to date by yourself or not?

94
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,837
I want to date now that you are.

95
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:54,347
Is this dating?

96
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,347
That tall guy who came last.

97
00:06:57,347 --> 00:07:01,027
The one that looks like a dog. A Siberian Husky look-alike.

98
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:02,137
Dr. Jeong Yoon Do.

99
00:07:02,137 --> 00:07:04,607
That's his name?

100
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:07,697
But it was weird.

101
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:12,747
He kept staring at Teacher Hong and you!

102
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:15,977
Who does he like?

103
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,777
I bet 50 cents that he likes you.

104
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:54,237
Are you coming now?

105
00:07:55,167 --> 00:08:00,187
You seem like you aren't happy that I'm here. Going around, not being able to sleep.

106
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:01,867
I just had to think.

107
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:03,527
So are you done thinking?

108
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:05,207
Yes.

109
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:10,347
Doctor. I like Yoo Hye Jeong.

110
00:08:11,347 --> 00:08:12,627
Why are you telling me?

111
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:16,147
I heard that you have a special relationship with her.

112
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:19,517
Even if it's a special relationship, it's different than a loving relationship.

113
00:08:19,517 --> 00:08:23,227
I've also heard that it hasn't been very long since you met as a man and woman.

114
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:24,027
So?

115
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:26,937
- So?
- My thoughts have gone a bit too far,

116
00:08:26,937 --> 00:08:32,057
but if you guys haven't married, then I think it's fine for me to butt into your relationship.

117
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:33,187
Does Hye Jeong know this too?

118
00:08:33,187 --> 00:08:34,507
She knows.

119
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:38,727
Do you think I would confess without even confessing to her?

120
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:43,367
Right. Then what's your reason for telling this to me now?

121
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:47,737
I don't like stabbing someone in the back.

122
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:52,597
I don't want to be the guy in the back unless you guys are dating.

123
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,867
- How will you take her away? Who said I'd let you take her?
- Excuse me?

124
00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:59,947
That's good. You're a man. A man should be like that.

125
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:06,177
But the thing is, I haven't ever gotten anything taken away from me that I want.

126
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:10,167
I'm happy that even you acknowledge that Hye Jeong has charm.

127
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:16,047
I'm happy that Hye Jeong is the type who attracts people.

128
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:20,187
I mean... Aren't you nervous because of me?

129
00:09:20,187 --> 00:09:24,587
Why would I be? You're the person who let me know how special of a relationship Hye Jeong and I have.

130
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:25,827
Ah, Doctor!

131
00:09:25,827 --> 00:09:28,127
Do well in your butting in.

132
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:31,547
Huh?

133
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:34,337
Wow. What is that confidence?

134
00:09:34,337 --> 00:09:38,757
No one would know unless a couple marries!

135
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:42,367
What's this feeling that I've lost before I've started?

136
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:06,027
♫  You, who awakens my heart's dating cells  ♫

That's cute. How do you get those types of emoticons?

141
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:38,877
These are the ones that I have.

142
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:42,937
What are you doing tomorrow? It's your day off.

143
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:58,997
I'm very busy. I'm not telling you.

144
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:08,117
Then, how about the day after that?

145
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:10,557
I'm going to study.

Would you give me your time in the morning?

148
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:30,487
Okay.

Namyangju Guk Il Hospital

153
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:27,017
I'm sorry, but we can't give you the file for Kang Mal Soon.

154
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:29,957
- Why?
- We destroy files that pass the 10-year mark.

155
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,857
It has been destroyed.

Hello, it's the General Surgery Department of Guk Il Hospital.

159
00:13:05,227 --> 00:13:10,527
Do you know where a resident from 13 years ago, Doctor Kim Choi Yeon, would be?

160
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,737
Are you talking about Chief Kim Choi Yeon?

161
00:13:22,487 --> 00:13:25,807
He hasn't started his consultations yet.

162
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:29,997
I'm his junior. I'm here to see him before his consultations.

163
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:46,047
- Who are you?
- 13 years ago, you worked as a resident here, right?

164
00:13:46,047 --> 00:13:49,697
Ah, has it been 13 years? But how do you know?

165
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:51,397
I came as a patient's guardian.

166
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:56,477
But from what I remember, I did not treat the patient, but Chief did. You remember me?

167
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:09,477
You wrote this, right?

168
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:14,427
- What are you?
- Why are you reacting so sensitively?

169
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:18,757
If you wanted to ask about this, you should've requested a formal meeting. What are you doing?

170
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,837
If I had requested a meeting, would you have met me?

171
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:24,677
It's not even a surgery that I performed, so why are you doing this to me?

172
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:28,167
You were the assistant and wrote the chart.

173
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:32,817
I want to know about everything that happened on that day and time.

174
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:35,347
How would I remember a surgery from 13 years ago?

175
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:38,527
It's not like there haven't been multiple surgeries or multiple deaths.

176
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:41,137
If you can't remember, force yourself to remember.

177
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:44,847
Some people haven't stopped thinking

178
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:48,307
about what you have forgotten from 13 years ago, even for a day.

179
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:55,527
Even if you know, you can't sue. The statute of limitations is 10 years. 10 years have passed!

180
00:14:55,527 --> 00:15:00,807
I know that. Even if you did something wrong, it would be hard to go to court.

181
00:15:00,807 --> 00:15:05,687
But it's not like punishment is only given out by the court.

182
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:08,587
- What do you want?
- An apology, the truth,

183
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:13,737
payback for the mistake.

184
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:18,687
In a healthy society, these rules should be followed.

185
00:15:18,687 --> 00:15:23,987
Well, this is irrelevant to me because I did not perform the surgery. I'm sorry but I'm busy.

186
00:15:25,777 --> 00:15:28,807
I will leave this recording. Consider it carefully.

187
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,157
Contact me.

188
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:50,387
Welcome.

189
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:56,027
I want to look fancy. Can you choose a color that would look good on me?

190
00:15:56,027 --> 00:15:59,147
Ah, yes. I'll recommend a tint product.

191
00:16:04,387 --> 00:16:07,047
You must be going to see your boyfriend.

192
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:09,757
- No, that's not it.
- It must be a man that you like.

193
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:13,017
I'm going to see my grandma. She likes pretty things.

194
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:17,107
I'm jealous. My grandma passed away.

195
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:20,887
I'll get you a lot of samples. Please give them to your grandma.

196
00:16:51,647 --> 00:16:55,387
Grandma, do you like the flowers?

197
00:16:55,387 --> 00:17:01,007
You always like small and pretty things. I think you will like these.

198
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:05,177
No, it's enough if I like it.

199
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:09,507
When you bought the necklace for me

200
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:13,117
you said you were going to look at it.

201
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:33,787
Grandma, I won't forget.

202
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:38,437
The life that you loved until the end,

203
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,067
I will never forget that life.

204
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:50,727
Why am I talking to myself like you used to?

205
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:00,947
I miss you.

206
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:18,907
Don't look at a man. There is no man who loves you like I do.

207
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:24,457
Yoon Do is a manner-less bastard. He's so arrogant to adults. If it wasn't for his father, I would have done something.

208
00:18:24,457 --> 00:18:30,377
Don't go all out. Men are weak to women who wait until the end. Pretend that you're waiting.

209
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:32,217
How can I pretend?

210
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:36,027
It's business to play with someone's heart by pretending.

211
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:40,347
- I'm a doctor.
- You're a doctor who knows how to do business.

212
00:18:40,347 --> 00:18:43,707
Don't look at one thing, but look at everything and think.

213
00:18:51,557 --> 00:18:53,737
Hello, morning.

214
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:07,827
How much do you hate fishing that you need me?

215
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:11,197
No, it's not that I hate fishing; it's boring. I want to spend time with my dad.

216
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:13,477
If I'm with you, the problem is fixed.

217
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:39,767
My dad's here. Let's get out.

218
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:41,077
Okay.

219
00:19:47,957 --> 00:19:49,567
Dad.

220
00:19:51,597 --> 00:19:53,797
This is a junior.

221
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:55,527
Hello, I'm Yoo Hye Jeong.

222
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,757
Yoo Hye Jeong?

223
00:19:57,757 --> 00:20:01,347
Hye Jeong? It feels like I've heard that before.

224
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:04,897
Isn't she the one who called you when you were fishing?

225
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:07,437
Ah, you remember that?

226
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:10,597
Come here. Let's walk together.

227
00:20:10,597 --> 00:20:12,207
Okay.

228
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:19,007
What do you like about Ji Hong?

229
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:20,817
- Yes?
- Dad, what are you doing?

230
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:22,067
I'll say whatever I please.

231
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,597
- Grandfather!
- Welcome.

232
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:34,667
Father, you're here early.

233
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,897
Yeah, golf ended early.

234
00:20:36,897 --> 00:20:41,137
I called to show our Seo Woo something very nice.

235
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:43,987
This is where our dream starts.

236
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:46,777
Guk Il Joint Stock Corporation. How does it sound?

237
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:48,467
There's still a long way to go.

238
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:52,937
No. Taking the first step is half the journey. Your dad and I are doing it.

239
00:20:52,937 --> 00:20:56,317
You just have to pick the fruit. Understand?

240
00:20:56,317 --> 00:21:01,277
Yes. I will live for you, father and me in the future.

241
00:21:01,277 --> 00:21:03,157
Alright.

242
00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:07,917
It's today, right?

243
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,997
Yes. I'll be going now.

244
00:21:09,997 --> 00:21:13,187
I need to look around to see how things are proceeding.

245
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,667
What's that?

246
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:33,187
It said "National Tax Service" on the box.

247
00:21:33,187 --> 00:21:35,727
Quickly, move, move!

248
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,787
This way, quick, quick.

249
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:42,127
I didn't know it would become this big of a deal.

250
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:44,377
They say, "Incur a great loss pursuing a small profit."

251
00:21:44,377 --> 00:21:47,227
Compared to what will be lost later, this is worth a pack of gum.

252
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:49,727
It's the end for Chairman Hong now.

253
00:21:57,827 --> 00:22:00,327
Are both your parents alive?

254
00:22:03,397 --> 00:22:07,837
Ah, you're still young. They obviously would be alive.

255
00:22:07,837 --> 00:22:10,537
Why did I ask that?

256
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,557
My mom passed away.

257
00:22:13,557 --> 00:22:18,277
Maybe it's because my age is close to death.

258
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:24,507
When were you close with Ji Hong?

259
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:28,727
Spicy stew is only good if you catch the fish yourself.

260
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:31,557
Stop asking questions; she's getting nervous.

261
00:22:31,557 --> 00:22:33,057
Were you nervous?

262
00:22:33,057 --> 00:22:35,637
No. I'll do it.

263
00:22:35,637 --> 00:22:36,837
No, it's okay.

264
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:42,297
Yeah, it's okay. You're doing good by just sitting here.

265
00:22:42,297 --> 00:22:44,767
Do you know how to cook?

266
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:46,217
No, I'm not good at it.

267
00:22:46,217 --> 00:22:52,017
That's good too. You're doing great by just sitting down.

268
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:55,157
Father, that's so cheesy.

269
00:22:57,437 --> 00:22:58,927
Let's eat.

270
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:00,667
It's hot, so be careful.

271
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,667
Thank you. I'll eat well.

272
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,767
Okay, let's eat!

273
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:07,837
Doctor Kim Tae Ho

274
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:10,407
Father, I'll be back. I have to take this call.

275
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:14,757
There's a problem. The hospital review was released by the National Tax Service.

276
00:23:14,757 --> 00:23:17,847
Things got bigger due to your father's share holdings.

277
00:23:17,847 --> 00:23:22,507
I'm with my father right now. I'll call you back later.

278
00:23:22,507 --> 00:23:24,257
Yes.

279
00:23:24,257 --> 00:23:26,387
Eat this too. This looks tasty.

280
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:28,157
Thank you.

281
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:45,017
I want to look somewhat fierce. What do I need to buy for a smoky look?

282
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:46,517
Okay, I'll pick it for you.

283
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:50,087
Oh, Miss, your eye color is so pretty.

284
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:54,917
How's the brown eye shadow and black eye liner that match well with bright brown eyes?

285
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:55,927
Yes, I'll take that.

286
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:58,127
I'll pack it for you.

287
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,487
Father's driver will take you to the hospital.

288
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,697
I can take a taxi...

289
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:18,827
I'm sorry that I can't take you.

290
00:24:18,827 --> 00:24:21,057
It's okay.

291
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:23,787
Should I ask what's wrong?

292
00:24:23,787 --> 00:24:26,937
Hye Jeong, thank you. Father really liked that.

293
00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:30,087
I feel like I've been a bad son all this time. I feel bad.

294
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:33,437
Let's not ask.

295
00:24:41,137 --> 00:24:43,827
- Did you properly send her off?
- Yes.

296
00:24:45,537 --> 00:24:50,367
I'm speechless... For me to damage the hospital...

297
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:52,597
I can't believe it.

298
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:58,307
I worked for the hospital and patients all my life.

299
00:24:58,307 --> 00:25:02,777
I think someone has been involved in this. Otherwise, things wouldn't have proceeded so badly.

300
00:25:02,777 --> 00:25:08,357
I'm calling a board of directors' meeting. A decision must be issued.

301
00:25:08,357 --> 00:25:10,387
Are you going to quit?

302
00:25:11,647 --> 00:25:13,537
I need to quit.

303
00:25:14,617 --> 00:25:19,007
The people who planned this would love to hear that.

304
00:25:28,937 --> 00:25:33,357
What is this? Are you a food fighter?

305
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:35,017
You are eating quite diverse foods.

306
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:39,247
Hey, it's all mine.

307
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:40,897
Ah, Hyung!

308
00:25:40,897 --> 00:25:46,357
Hyungnim, hyungnim. Is our hospital going bankrupt? If it's to the point where auditors are coming from the National Tax Service...

309
00:25:46,357 --> 00:25:48,287
This is big enough to appear in the newspapers.

310
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:51,277
I wonder if we're all going to be jobless if the hospital goes bankrupt.

311
00:25:51,277 --> 00:25:55,977
That will never happen. There's no way for our hospital to go bankrupt. If we get fired, we get fired.

312
00:25:55,977 --> 00:25:57,117
How do you know that?

313
00:25:57,117 --> 00:26:00,727
I was a economics major. There's a plot behind this, for sure.

314
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:06,427
The National Tax Service doesn't ever touch hospitals. Someone pushed them.

315
00:26:06,427 --> 00:26:09,967
Right, right. This hyung used to work for the government.

316
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:11,227
Then who do you think they're trying to cut off?

317
00:26:11,227 --> 00:26:14,397
Between CEO Hong

318
00:26:14,397 --> 00:26:18,707
and General Manager Jin, a power struggle.

319
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:25,167
Joon Dae, you... Out of all the times I've seen you, you seem the most intelligent right now.

320
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:29,417
He also knows that it's slander. Eat a lot.

321
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:30,687
How?

322
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:33,047
Who are you?

323
00:26:33,047 --> 00:26:35,237
Seo Woo

324
00:26:35,237 --> 00:26:37,777
Hyung, you really sided with the right person.

325
00:26:37,777 --> 00:26:41,477
You'll probably become a professor. Professor Figure. Figure. (for being so calculating.)

326
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:45,647
You will be Teacher Dae. Teacher Dwaegi (Pig).

327
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,967
Eat a lot.

328
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:50,257
His words are a bit harsh.

329
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:07,177
What's with you?

330
00:27:07,177 --> 00:27:08,627
I'm going to go study.

331
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,667
- You're going to go dressed like that?
- Yes.

332
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:15,597
This is a hospital. No matter how much we let things slide, your appearance isn't appropriate for a doctor.

333
00:27:15,597 --> 00:27:17,307
Are you rebelling against Doctor Yoon?

334
00:27:17,307 --> 00:27:20,617
- Who is he that I have to rebel against him?  - Then?

335
00:27:20,617 --> 00:27:25,247
I'm going to live however I want. Up until now, I've lived being a kind person. But look at what I got in return.

336
00:27:38,117 --> 00:27:41,597
I'm always on your side, because we're friends.

337
00:27:41,597 --> 00:27:44,067
Why are you saying the obvious.

338
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,737
Why do you look so shocked? It's my office, who else is going to come in?

339
00:27:58,737 --> 00:28:01,097
I was on my way out.

340
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:04,347
Let's talk.

341
00:28:04,347 --> 00:28:08,787
You and I, we can't continue going on like this until whenever.

342
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,947
You've seen me at an institute for neurosurgery, right?

343
00:28:11,947 --> 00:28:16,717
And you avoided me. Otherwise it wouldn't make sense that we haven't bumped into each other until now.

344
00:28:16,717 --> 00:28:19,377
There weren't even many female neurosurgeon students.

345
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:23,507
You're right, I have seen you. You're also right that I avoided you.

346
00:28:23,507 --> 00:28:26,517
I may have left scars for you, but you've done the same to me.

347
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:29,517
- What have I done?
- Because I liked you.

348
00:28:29,517 --> 00:28:34,547
I was also envious of you. When you accepted me as a friend, I liked it.

349
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:38,527
We parted ways. And I found out that you were at this hospital.

350
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:43,997
I had time to prepare myself for meeting you; just preparing myself was hard too.

351
00:28:43,997 --> 00:28:47,487
So for you, who had no time to prepare, it must be even more difficult.

352
00:28:47,487 --> 00:28:49,887
I knew it was planned.

353
00:28:49,887 --> 00:28:53,687
You came to this hospital to steal everything from me.

354
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:57,187
Why? Was it not enough to have Doctor Hong?

355
00:28:57,187 --> 00:29:01,687
You knew at that time too, that I like Teacher Hong as a man.

356
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:03,287
You won't believe me, but I didn't know.

357
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:05,547
Why does the condition have to include that I won't believe you?

358
00:29:05,547 --> 00:29:08,717
Are you saying that you are conversing with me believing that I'm not going to trust anything you say?

359
00:29:08,717 --> 00:29:10,487
The reason I came to this hospital has nothing to do with you.

360
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:12,697
Then who does it concern?

361
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:16,097
It seems like you came here with a clear motive.

362
00:29:16,097 --> 00:29:20,597
But if that motive is something I can understand, I'll believe everything you say.

363
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:23,037
I can't tell you.

364
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:26,627
You are saying that you are going to give up your relationship with me?

365
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:33,137
You not answering means it's a yes, right?

366
00:29:38,327 --> 00:29:43,417
Let's make this clear. You rejected me right now.

367
00:30:08,837 --> 00:30:11,717
Hyungnim, you have suffered a lot!

368
00:30:13,977 --> 00:30:17,837
Do you still think I'm trash?

369
00:30:17,837 --> 00:30:19,207
Let me ask you for just one favor.

370
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:20,317
What is it?

371
00:30:20,317 --> 00:30:25,927
Don't harm that person. He was injured last time too.

372
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:33,887
Who? I don't know whom you're talking about.

373
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,267
Please don't return injured again.

374
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:11,977
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong of the Neurosurgery Department, please come to the basement. I repeat,

375
00:31:11,977 --> 00:31:16,977
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong of the Neurosurgery Department, please come to the basement.

376
00:31:50,197 --> 00:31:52,287
Adios.

377
00:31:57,517 --> 00:32:02,037
From now on, I'll listen to a woman. Thank you.

378
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:11,137
Hey!

379
00:32:24,127 --> 00:32:24,857
What's wrong with you all?

380
00:32:24,857 --> 00:32:28,477
You must be so happy. Later, please let me look at it.

381
00:32:28,477 --> 00:32:31,007
Give me the admission record of the gangster boss.

382
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:34,517
Why do you want that? Do you want to thank him?

383
00:32:36,557 --> 00:32:40,117
Doctor, did you see that car? We should all go take a look.

384
00:32:40,117 --> 00:32:44,687
Even if we live in the era of capitalism, let's think about its integrity.

385
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:46,777
If I were you, I wouldn't accept it even if he gave it to me.

386
00:32:46,777 --> 00:32:49,537
Same for me, I'm not going to take it even if he gives it to me.

387
00:32:49,537 --> 00:32:52,747
This number doesn't exist. Give me his secondary contact information, his guardian's number.

388
00:32:52,747 --> 00:32:56,327
I'm sure that number doesn't exist either. He wouldn't leave any traces behind.

389
00:32:56,327 --> 00:32:59,007
What do I do about that?

390
00:32:59,007 --> 00:33:01,277
Give it to me.

391
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:03,397
You shouldn't have mentioned integrity of capitalism.

392
00:33:03,397 --> 00:33:04,997
What's so funny?

393
00:33:04,997 --> 00:33:08,607
Doctor, our Doctor Yoo received a sports car as a present from a patient.

394
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:10,837
On top of that, it's a foreign car!

395
00:33:10,837 --> 00:33:12,617
Where is Doctor Jeong Yoon Do?

396
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:17,257
Ah... I guess she only cares about Doctor Jeong Yoon Do.

397
00:33:17,257 --> 00:33:18,877
He'll come soon.

398
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:20,917
Speak of the tiger, he's here! The tiger!

399
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:24,927
Are the preparations for Patient Kim Jin Han's surgery going well?

400
00:33:24,927 --> 00:33:26,547
Yes.

401
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:28,157
How does lunch at the hospital cafeteria sound?

402
00:33:28,157 --> 00:33:30,727
Later. I have something I need to see.

403
00:33:37,697 --> 00:33:39,367
Do you like it that much?

404
00:33:40,807 --> 00:33:42,747
Like what?

405
00:33:42,747 --> 00:33:45,657
Do you want to hear it here or do you want to hear it outside?

406
00:33:53,057 --> 00:33:56,207
Shouldn't you go in for your outpatient care?

407
00:33:56,207 --> 00:33:57,617
Are you worrying about me right now?

408
00:33:57,617 --> 00:33:59,947
I'm not worrying, just—

409
00:34:03,037 --> 00:34:04,677
Let go of me.

410
00:34:07,937 --> 00:34:10,577
Why do you turn me into the crazy b*tch who had an unrequited love?

411
00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:12,427
You clearly know how I feel.

412
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:15,387
You knew my feelings, but you...

413
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,287
told me to leave with your mouth, but told me to stay with your eyes. Am I mistaken?

414
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:23,717
Yeah, I was once drawn to you, but it was only for a brief moment.

415
00:34:23,717 --> 00:34:27,407
I find this quite unfair. You liked other people aside from me as well.

416
00:34:27,407 --> 00:34:31,107
I can endure you mocking me because I love you,

417
00:34:31,107 --> 00:34:33,267
but I can't endure you mocking my family.

418
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:37,107
Fine. For all the times you think I've mocked you until now,

419
00:34:37,107 --> 00:34:39,387
let's call it even with the slap.

420
00:34:39,387 --> 00:34:43,287
I felt sorry towards you, but now, I don't think I have to feel that way anymore.

421
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:45,647
My love isn't that light to just call it even with this.

422
00:34:45,647 --> 00:34:46,587
Then what do you want to do?

423
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:50,807
You've always been drawn to women who have many scars, women who were confident in whatever they did.

424
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:54,647
You love Hye Jeong? That's not love; it's just a complex.

425
00:34:54,647 --> 00:34:56,577
I'm going to get rid of your complex.

426
00:34:56,577 --> 00:34:57,897
You're analyzing other people's psychological problems too now?

427
00:34:57,897 --> 00:34:58,827
I'm going to become devious.

428
00:34:58,827 --> 00:35:01,637
People who'll really turn devious don't turn devious after reporting to someone that they'll turn devious.

429
00:35:01,637 --> 00:35:03,377
The world is wrong.

430
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:07,897
To live in this kind of world, I have no choice but to become devious.

431
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:11,527
How can someone like Hye Jeong live? How can someone like her live proudly as a doctor?

432
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:14,377
You're the one who should get rid of your inferiority complex against Yoo Hye Jeong.

433
00:35:14,377 --> 00:35:15,827
You find her charming too, don't you?

434
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:19,247
The things you can't even try because you're too busy calculating which one will benefit you more,

435
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:21,637
she accomplishes all of those things. On top of that, she's pretty.

436
00:35:21,637 --> 00:35:23,627
She's pretty?

437
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:26,877
You've really lost it.

438
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:29,857
She's pretty. She's prettier than you.

439
00:35:29,857 --> 00:35:33,067
You're going insane since I'm talking like this, aren't you?

440
00:35:33,067 --> 00:35:36,667
I know you well. I also know what can hurt you the most.

441
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:41,347
Don't force your strange analysis onto me. Do it to yourself instead.

442
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:45,867
I don't see you as a woman, but I do see you as somewhat of a sibling. That's precisely as far as it goes.

443
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:49,447
I'll accept all of your wrath until your wrath disappears.

444
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:53,507
As you said, I could've continued to lead you on.

445
00:35:53,507 --> 00:35:57,537
Still, don't slap me next time.

446
00:35:57,537 --> 00:35:59,207
I feel dirty.

447
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:23,177
- I got it!
- Okay?

448
00:36:24,037 --> 00:36:25,017
Doctor.

449
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,777
What?

450
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:30,647
About the car... You know the one Boss gave you, right?

451
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:35,627
Yeah, I don't know how I can get rid of it. There's no way I can return it either.

452
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,317
I'm thinking of donating it to the hospital.

453
00:36:37,317 --> 00:36:40,037
Where would a hospital have a need for a sports car?

454
00:36:40,037 --> 00:36:42,047
You should just drive it.

455
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:45,387
I'm someone who believes that nothing is free in this world so I can't do that.

456
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:49,087
Ah, I'm someone who thinks that anything can be free in this world.

457
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:51,867
I can't ask you to give it to me but can I drive it just once?

458
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:55,677
Doctor, please let me drive it once too.

459
00:36:55,677 --> 00:36:58,417
The chance of riding in a foreign car in my entire life is 5%.

460
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:03,857
I really don't think it's right to be born as a woman and die after living like that, Doctor.

461
00:37:03,857 --> 00:37:06,617
I lost at the word "entire".

462
00:37:09,247 --> 00:37:10,527
I said I'm fine.

463
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:12,697
I'm not fine.

464
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,167
I'll just say that I drank it.

465
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:16,547
You're not the only one who hates free things.

466
00:37:16,547 --> 00:37:21,037
I'm going to buy you that fresh kiwi juice you like!

467
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:28,387
GuK Il Medical Center Director Jin Myeong Hoon

468
00:37:32,077 --> 00:37:33,677
Yes, come in.

469
00:37:35,657 --> 00:37:38,827
Dr. Kim Choi Yeon from the general department is here.

470
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:48,707
I told you to just call. What was the reason you said we had to meet?

471
00:37:48,707 --> 00:37:50,047
This.

472
00:37:50,047 --> 00:37:51,057
What is this?

473
00:37:51,057 --> 00:37:55,577
When you were at Nam Yang Hospital, a family member of one of your surgery patients came to me.
 Surgery Record

474
00:37:55,577 --> 00:37:57,567
It was a young woman.

475
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,117
More than 10 years have passed. What is she going to do?

476
00:38:00,117 --> 00:38:04,967
She said that she had to know everything that happened in the surgery room and that she was going to make us pay.

477
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:07,537
The law can't do anything now.

478
00:38:08,867 --> 00:38:10,167
Does she know me?

479
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:13,527
Since you're famous, you come up on even basic internet searches.

480
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:16,757
She knew me but she went to you first?

481
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,417
She just wants some money.

482
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:20,837
I don't think that was the case.

483
00:38:20,837 --> 00:38:25,207
If she's not after money, then what else could it be? How can you still not read people?

484
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:26,957
I'm sorry.

485
00:38:28,487 --> 00:38:30,907
Use this chance to show that you're really one of my people.

486
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:34,267
Then when are you going to promote me?

487
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:49,417
You killed my grandma, didn't you? Did you kill her?

488
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:52,227
You said she'd live as long as you removed the cancerous area.

489
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:55,557
What are you doing with secure confidentiality?

490
00:38:55,557 --> 00:38:58,277
A patient medical record that shouldn't be reviewed leaked.

491
00:38:58,277 --> 00:39:00,207
Find out who searched for this file.

492
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:01,857
Understood.

493
00:39:05,897 --> 00:39:08,167
Aren't you going to the Board meeting?

494
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:09,077
I'm going.

495
00:39:09,077 --> 00:39:13,237
Doo Shik will declare his retirement. He couldn't stand it over his reputation.

496
00:39:16,307 --> 00:39:20,917
How some people here...

497
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:23,257
Jin Seong Jong

498
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:29,307
Some people here must think that our hospital

499
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:33,687
is in danger because of me.

500
00:39:33,687 --> 00:39:39,527
With this experience, I have personally learned many new things.

501
00:39:39,527 --> 00:39:44,627
If I'm to think of my own personal honor, then it would be right for me to resign as the Vice-President

502
00:39:49,037 --> 00:39:52,217
and show you that I'm in the clear.

503
00:39:52,217 --> 00:39:57,147
But I realized that resigning isn't the only solution.

504
00:39:57,147 --> 00:40:01,497
About the incident, I'll take full responsibility.

505
00:40:02,847 --> 00:40:05,167
Thank you.

506
00:40:17,577 --> 00:40:20,227
Special Board of Directors' Meeting.

507
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:24,747
57th GIMC Special Board of Directors' Meeting

508
00:40:26,117 --> 00:40:29,917
Have you changed? You're not like yourself.

509
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:33,427
This is why, when people get old, they disappear from business.

510
00:40:33,427 --> 00:40:35,147
What are you trying to say?

511
00:40:35,147 --> 00:40:39,017
It's just a regret that you turned into an old man who is greedy.

512
00:40:39,017 --> 00:40:43,357
Do you think that I fought to be director because of greed?

513
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:48,117
Then, is it not. Are you saving a spot for Ji Hong?

514
00:40:48,117 --> 00:40:50,567
When are you going to look at others and live?

515
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:54,057
He's not even your child. He's not blood related, so why—

516
00:40:54,057 --> 00:40:55,907
You bastard.

517
00:40:59,077 --> 00:41:02,757
Don't talk about Ji Hong like that.

518
00:41:05,127 --> 00:41:08,877
I can't ever let what happened slide.

519
00:41:08,877 --> 00:41:11,637
Our hospital received a tax audit because of you.

520
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:14,427
It doesn't make sense that you're not taking responsibility.

521
00:41:14,427 --> 00:41:17,157
If you had something to say, you should've said it when it happened.

522
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:20,257
But you did nothing then. Why are saying it all now?

523
00:41:20,257 --> 00:41:26,017
I thought that you'd step down from your position as chairman. Who knew that you were going to stay?

524
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:30,447
Someone distorted this incident purposely and leaked it to the National Tax Service.

525
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:36,617
If it's someone from inside the hospital, I need to find their motives.

526
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:39,597
The judgment is not dead,

527
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:43,337
so you shouldn't be rash.

528
00:41:56,257 --> 00:41:59,597
Don't listen to that bastard's words.

529
00:41:59,597 --> 00:42:00,507
What words?

530
00:42:00,507 --> 00:42:07,027
Before, talking about being a real child and such.

531
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:23,727
What is he doing?

532
00:42:23,727 --> 00:42:26,427
I got rid of those feelings long time ago.

533
00:42:26,427 --> 00:42:30,557
Like a child in adolescence, you used your fists.

534
00:42:31,347 --> 00:42:34,217
Are you making fun of me too?

535
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:48,467
Father! Are you okay?

536
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:50,777
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

537
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:55,077
Is falling something big?

538
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:59,167
- Father, how long has it been since your last check up?
- Why are you asking?

539
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:02,857
After the Schwannoma (benign tumor on the nerve for hearing) removal, have you been going to regular follow-ups?

540
00:43:02,857 --> 00:43:05,267
Ah, why would I do it when it's too bothersome?

541
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:06,987
Father!

542
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:10,607
You're so loud my ears hurt.

543
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:12,657
Since you came, have a check up.

544
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:14,707
Later, it's annoying.

545
00:43:14,707 --> 00:43:16,257
That's why you need to have it.

546
00:43:16,257 --> 00:43:22,487
If I do it now, even though there's nothing wrong, there's going to be a rumor that I have a terminal disease.

547
00:43:22,487 --> 00:43:26,187
With the situation at hand, I can't get a check-up just based on your speculation.

548
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,577
During your speech, you slurred your words twice.

549
00:43:28,577 --> 00:43:31,857
When your facial expression went bad, it seemed like facial numbness.

550
00:43:31,857 --> 00:43:34,927
No, no, it's not.

551
00:43:34,927 --> 00:43:36,707
Your facial expression is not good.

552
00:43:36,707 --> 00:43:38,877
It's because you're too sensitive.

553
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:42,357
And your body was tilted a bit. When you're walking, I think there's ataxia. ( Loss of control of movement)

554
00:43:42,357 --> 00:43:46,027
The Schwannoma may have recurred. ( Grown again )

555
00:43:46,027 --> 00:43:48,367
You need to be examined.

556
00:43:57,687 --> 00:43:59,707
It's normal.

557
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:03,987
Why did you only get hit?

558
00:44:03,987 --> 00:44:08,317
What happened? Does Chairman Hong know that you did it?

559
00:44:08,317 --> 00:44:11,287
If he knew, he's not the type of person to stay still.

560
00:44:11,287 --> 00:44:15,617
At this rate, what will I do if I get suspected for secretly creating the slush fund?

561
00:44:15,617 --> 00:44:19,037
There is no way that will happen. No way, Father.

562
00:44:23,877 --> 00:44:27,477
What were you doing until it became like this?

563
00:44:27,477 --> 00:44:31,857
The size is too big and it's pressing against the brain.

564
00:44:31,857 --> 00:44:34,177
The surgery will be difficult.

565
00:44:38,947 --> 00:44:40,157
It's my fault.

566
00:44:40,157 --> 00:44:43,367
No, it's my fault.

567
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:49,287
Calling him my mentor, I only called him life-time teacher with my mouth; I didn't follow-up on him.

568
00:44:51,027 --> 00:44:52,817
What should we do now?

569
00:44:52,817 --> 00:44:55,467
What do you mean? You can just do the surgery.

570
00:44:55,467 --> 00:45:00,297
How can I perform surgery on him? If something goes wrong, I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

571
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:04,587
Then who will do it? I can't do it.

572
00:45:09,267 --> 00:45:11,497
Doctor Jeong Yoon Do would be better than me.

573
00:45:11,497 --> 00:45:15,897
His hand movement is better than mine and he is one of the best.

574
00:45:15,897 --> 00:45:17,107
You can't tell anyone.

575
00:45:17,107 --> 00:45:22,407
Even if the surgery is a success, he would need months of rest to be stable.

576
00:45:22,407 --> 00:45:27,567
Tell him to let go of his position as chairman. There's nothing as precious as life in the world.

577
00:45:29,387 --> 00:45:33,457
Until my father makes a decision, make sure this doesn't get leaked out.

578
00:45:41,627 --> 00:45:45,167
This bastard, not even knowing his place. Why does he study so well?

579
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:47,277
Why don't you say anything?

580
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,477
Why do we have to get this type of stress because of you?

581
00:45:50,477 --> 00:45:56,307
No matter how well you do in your studies, your life is the lowest of the lows.

582
00:46:00,597 --> 00:46:03,167
Those with the lowest lives are you guys.

583
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:11,457
Do you think I'm getting hit because I'm weak. I'm letting you hit me because I'm an orphan.

584
00:46:11,457 --> 00:46:13,527
Pretending you're the best.

585
00:46:14,417 --> 00:46:18,297
Stop it for today.

586
00:46:18,297 --> 00:46:22,457
Either way, just like you guys said, I'm not someone to compete against you.

587
00:46:22,457 --> 00:46:24,417
Is this punk crazy?

588
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:26,907
What are you guys doing over there?

589
00:46:28,477 --> 00:46:32,717
Let's stop. Is today the only day? There's tomorrow too.

590
00:46:40,207 --> 00:46:41,807
Are you okay?

591
00:46:42,737 --> 00:46:44,347
I'm fine, Chairman.

592
00:46:44,347 --> 00:46:49,067
You are not fine. This will take at least two weeks to heal.

593
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:51,697
This amount of injury heals so it's fine.

594
00:46:55,697 --> 00:46:59,967
You must like action movies. Real life is not like the movies.

595
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:00,817
What?

596
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:05,947
Beating people up and not caring about the consequences. Overreacting and putting people around you in danger.

597
00:47:05,947 --> 00:47:10,647
Do you like that type of thing? Then you've caught the middle school second-year syndrome.

598
00:47:11,617 --> 00:47:13,377
Would you like to come with me?

599
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:17,427
No, would you like to live with me?

600
00:47:17,427 --> 00:47:20,817
I'm rejecting your offer. I'm going to marry a woman.

601
00:47:20,817 --> 00:47:23,747
Who said I was going to marry you?

602
00:47:24,817 --> 00:47:27,657
How about being my son?

603
00:47:32,037 --> 00:47:35,117
After receiving the congratulations, I'm congratulating you

604
00:47:35,117 --> 00:47:38,527
for fulfilling your dream of having the same occupation as your son.

605
00:47:59,517 --> 00:48:01,867
Why did you say to meet here?

606
00:48:06,157 --> 00:48:07,867
Is it mine?

607
00:48:11,437 --> 00:48:14,757
It's grown a lot since I've last seen it.

608
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:18,767
The thing called life is scary.

609
00:48:18,767 --> 00:48:23,307
Even the cancer cells are working hard to survive.

610
00:48:24,987 --> 00:48:30,747
It is really Schwann cells.

611
00:48:32,187 --> 00:48:34,427
It has a strong will.

612
00:48:34,427 --> 00:48:36,397
Be hospitalized.

613
00:48:37,577 --> 00:48:38,907
I'm not going to do the surgery.

614
00:48:38,907 --> 00:48:41,747
Nothing can be more important than your health.

615
00:48:41,747 --> 00:48:45,737
With things like this, you can't miss the surgery.

616
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:49,667
I can't do it right now.

617
00:48:50,517 --> 00:48:53,307
How can I, with everything that's going on?

618
00:48:55,527 --> 00:49:04,927
Father, I don't want to let go of someone I love, before me, anymore.

619
00:49:14,717 --> 00:49:17,267
Wow, the design is really awesome!

620
00:49:17,267 --> 00:49:21,507
Doctor! Doctor! Let's drive by the riverside. Then we can go to a hote—

621
00:49:21,507 --> 00:49:24,947
Hey! A hotel! Are you crazy!?

622
00:49:24,947 --> 00:49:28,157
We can't do that! We aren't in that type of relationship.

623
00:49:28,157 --> 00:49:30,777
Did anyone said to sleep? I said let's eat pizza.

624
00:49:30,777 --> 00:49:34,987
There's a place that makes good pizza below the hotel!

625
00:49:34,987 --> 00:49:39,507
Today, I'm cosplaying a rich family's daughter!

626
00:49:43,107 --> 00:49:44,167
What?

627
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:47,087
You have to open the door for me.

628
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:48,937
Oh that's right.

629
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:53,617
This is so nice! What are you looking for?

630
00:49:53,617 --> 00:49:55,267
This.

631
00:49:55,267 --> 00:49:58,257
I mean, you can just drive normally.

632
00:50:01,927 --> 00:50:07,047
Right now, this foreign car is like meeting a lot of men.

633
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:09,617
Oh, that Cinderella complex.

634
00:50:09,617 --> 00:50:15,257
Why did she lose her glass slipper to make all girls look for a prince?

635
00:50:15,257 --> 00:50:17,807
Hurry! Lets go!

636
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:30,347
How fascinating!

637
00:50:30,347 --> 00:50:31,577
Then shall we go?

638
00:50:31,577 --> 00:50:32,947
Yes!

639
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:35,537
We're only going to be driving around the parking lot once.

640
00:50:35,537 --> 00:50:36,787
Why?

641
00:50:39,147 --> 00:50:42,837
Well, my body isn't feeling that great and we don't want to get into an accident...

642
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:46,797
Why are you making a big deal all the sudden? Don't worry about it!

643
00:50:46,797 --> 00:50:48,767
You're a great driver so why would we get into an accident?

644
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:52,047
I might drive well but I d-d-d-on't have a license...

645
00:50:52,047 --> 00:50:54,947
Excuse me? What kind of man doesn't have a license?

646
00:50:54,947 --> 00:50:57,377
I was too busy so I couldn't get it. I was going to get it next year.

647
00:50:57,377 --> 00:51:00,057
If you want to enjoy the drive, you drive yourself, Nurse Hyeon.

648
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,037
What?!

649
00:51:02,037 --> 00:51:05,057
What am I doing cosplaying the daughter of a rich man?

650
00:51:05,057 --> 00:51:07,557
Stop, so I can drive!

651
00:51:07,557 --> 00:51:11,077
Okay... But why are you getting angry?!

652
00:51:23,217 --> 00:51:24,907
I'm in big trouble, really...

653
00:51:28,887 --> 00:51:31,337
What are we going to do now?!

654
00:51:33,897 --> 00:51:36,997
Geez...

655
00:51:44,937 --> 00:51:48,487
Hey. When you're eating, let's focus on eating.

656
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:52,457
Isn't that Doctor Yoo?

657
00:51:52,457 --> 00:51:54,987
- You're right.
- Why are you drawing that?!

658
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:56,807
Can you still not throw away your dreams of becoming a manga artist?

659
00:51:56,807 --> 00:52:00,657
Hyung. You don't throw away your dreams, you take care of them.

660
00:52:00,657 --> 00:52:03,807
Before I get beaten to death, this is my last one.

661
00:52:03,807 --> 00:52:05,507
Are you not going to eat?

662
00:52:08,387 --> 00:52:10,357
Hello. What brings you here?

663
00:52:10,357 --> 00:52:11,187
Would you like some jajangmyun (black bean noodles)?

664
00:52:11,187 --> 00:52:12,357
I'm fine.

665
00:52:12,357 --> 00:52:14,657
I can't live like this.

666
00:52:15,587 --> 00:52:18,067
- What are you doing down there?
- Oh, doctor...

667
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:20,437
Were you hiding from me?

668
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:21,947
No...

669
00:52:21,947 --> 00:52:23,677
Give me the car keys.

670
00:52:25,077 --> 00:52:28,517
Why do you look like you're going to cry?

671
00:52:30,867 --> 00:52:34,307
Maybe because the car is so great, even after hitting it that hard,

672
00:52:34,307 --> 00:52:36,467
this was the only damage.

673
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:38,267
How could you leave it like this?

674
00:52:38,267 --> 00:52:40,657
I was going to leave it at the shop, but

675
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,677
I'm always on duty so I didn't have time.

676
00:52:43,677 --> 00:52:45,227
Hurry up and fix it.

677
00:52:45,227 --> 00:52:48,407
- That's it?
- Yeah. Is that not enough? Do you want me to hit you?

678
00:52:48,407 --> 00:52:50,357
No, no.

679
00:52:50,357 --> 00:52:52,277
The bill is going to come out to quite a lot...

680
00:52:52,277 --> 00:52:57,347
If you're not going to drive it then would it be necessary to even fix it?

681
00:52:57,367 --> 00:52:59,047
I got it.

682
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:02,887
Oh, really...

683
00:53:12,797 --> 00:53:18,237
Doctor, do I still need to wait here? I need to go into surgery?

684
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,897
Come in.

685
00:53:26,517 --> 00:53:28,417
Both of you come this way.

686
00:53:31,837 --> 00:53:33,827
This patient,

687
00:53:33,827 --> 00:53:39,187
I would like for Doctor Jeong Yoon Do to lead and for Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong to assist for the surgery.

688
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:40,677
Who is it?

689
00:53:40,677 --> 00:53:43,037
President Hong Doo Sik.

690
00:53:43,057 --> 00:53:44,887
I don't want to do it.

691
00:53:44,887 --> 00:53:49,517
If it's the president, then the entire hospital will become interested, but I don't want that attention.

692
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:54,647
I would only like us three to know about this surgery. Don't ask why either.

693
00:53:55,547 --> 00:53:58,927
The size is big and it's protruding as well, so it doesn't seem easy.

694
00:53:58,927 --> 00:54:01,217
On top of that, you said it's a recurrance.

695
00:54:01,217 --> 00:54:02,857
Rather than complete removal,

696
00:54:02,857 --> 00:54:07,467
I think it'll be best for you to perform a lateral SOC surgery first and then radiosurgery for the rest.

697
00:54:07,467 --> 00:54:10,857
It's better to perform a complete removal surgery (surgical removal of the entire tumor) since there are complications with radiation.

698
00:54:10,857 --> 00:54:11,807
Complete removal?

699
00:54:11,807 --> 00:54:14,657
Paralysis of the optic nerve symptoms aren't bad. So, we can save the optic nerve.

700
00:54:14,657 --> 00:54:17,437
If we want to remove the tumor completely, trans-lab approach is the best route.

701
00:54:17,437 --> 00:54:19,807
Trans-lab approach – approach through the mastoid and semicircular canals to the internal auditory canal

702
00:54:19,807 --> 00:54:23,097
That surgery takes a long time and...

703
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:26,017
You can't. Take the safer route.

704
00:54:26,017 --> 00:54:29,807
If it's not a complete removal surgery, then I have no reason to do this.

705
00:54:29,807 --> 00:54:33,637
You know me. It's one or the other. All or nothing.

706
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:37,557
Don't be overly confident. Stay humble performing this surgery.

707
00:54:37,557 --> 00:54:40,837
If you can't trust me, then please ask someone else.

708
00:54:40,837 --> 00:54:44,447
It's not that I can't trust you. I'm asking you to be careful.

709
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:48,627
This isn't like you. All surgeries have risks.

710
00:54:48,627 --> 00:54:52,777
Telling me to be careful is another way of saying you're scared.

711
00:54:52,777 --> 00:54:58,547
If the surgeon is scared then it's the end. Even before the surgery starts, are you trying to scare me?

712
00:55:17,367 --> 00:55:18,917
Is it true that you're doing a total removal?

713
00:55:18,917 --> 00:55:20,597
Total Removal – completely removing the tumor

714
00:55:20,597 --> 00:55:26,017
Don't try... to go out of your way and just do it safely.

715
00:55:26,017 --> 00:55:28,277
Are you bringing up that darn safety issue again?

716
00:55:28,277 --> 00:55:32,217
I'm also for Sub Total Clear. Don't worry.
 Sub Total Clear – leaving behind portion of tumor to save overall brain

717
00:55:32,217 --> 00:55:33,607
I'm begging you.

718
00:55:33,607 --> 00:55:38,157
You act like an ordinary person, using pressure and pleas.

719
00:55:39,147 --> 00:55:43,107
You speak so rudely, Dr. Jeong.

720
00:55:44,397 --> 00:55:47,007
Do you talk to other patients' guardians in this manner too?

721
00:55:47,007 --> 00:55:52,077
Other patients' guardians do not talk to doctors this way. They trust us more than anyone else.

722
00:55:53,257 --> 00:55:55,107
Do you trust me?

723
00:55:59,717 --> 00:56:05,157
This is a patient I don't want. If you tell me to quit right now, I'll quit.

724
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:08,987
Well then. I have another surgery to attend to.

725
00:56:27,777 --> 00:56:31,387
Operating Room

726
00:56:34,697 --> 00:56:36,337
Irrigation.

727
00:56:43,277 --> 00:56:48,617
Doctor Hong is scared so that's why he's being like that. Just in case something goes wrong.

728
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:50,747
You're the same too.

729
00:56:50,747 --> 00:56:51,917
What do you mean?

730
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:56,307
You're scared that everyone might despise you if something goes wrong,

731
00:56:56,307 --> 00:56:59,157
so that's why you're making a fuss.

732
00:56:59,157 --> 00:57:01,127
Who's getting scared?

733
00:57:02,427 --> 00:57:06,987
Don't be scared. I'm assisting.

734
00:57:06,987 --> 00:57:09,737
I'll help you along the way, so you don't get scared.

735
00:57:09,737 --> 00:57:12,727
- You have a high sense of self-worth.
- Yes.

736
00:57:12,727 --> 00:57:18,427
In poor surroundings, admiring one's self greatly helps you to succeed in life.

737
00:57:18,427 --> 00:57:20,987
Should I remove this?

738
00:57:21,907 --> 00:57:24,897
Yes, I think it's good to remove it.

739
00:57:26,217 --> 00:57:27,737
Alright.

740
00:57:54,087 --> 00:57:58,687
Before you came, I did a background check on your past surgeries.

741
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:01,547
Seems like you're talking about an animal product track record.

742
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:04,987
You really do have skills.

743
00:58:08,667 --> 00:58:10,787
You asked if I trusted you, right?

744
00:58:12,107 --> 00:58:13,807
As a doctor, I trust you.

745
00:58:13,807 --> 00:58:16,197
Should I bow in thanks?

746
00:58:16,197 --> 00:58:18,747
But as a patient's guardian, I can't trust you.

747
00:58:21,077 --> 00:58:26,727
If this surgery goes wrong, you're going to die by my hands.

748
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:42,677
If a doctor becomes a guardian of someone they love,

749
00:58:42,677 --> 00:58:44,357
they are just weak.

750
00:58:44,357 --> 00:58:47,947
♫  Don't say you're sorry, No way  ♫

751
00:58:47,947 --> 00:58:51,497
♫  Don't leave me, No way  ♫

752
00:58:51,497 --> 00:58:54,927
♫  The breath you gave me once again  ♫
