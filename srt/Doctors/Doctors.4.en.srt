00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:32,016
Episode 4
You can enjoy many things once you succeed.

2
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:34,806
People look at you differently too.

3
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:38,856
Can you show me this one?

4
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:40,766
You're very pretty.

5
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:42,946
Thank you.

6
00:00:42,946 --> 00:00:46,406
I realized after I succeeded that

7
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:50,356
success is only sweet when you have someone to share it with.

8
00:00:52,346 --> 00:00:54,906
I lost my only family member.

9
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:58,256
I lost all desire to make a family.

10
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:02,776
So I chose a car over a house.

11
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:14,526
But, even though I lost it, there is something that I cannot forget.

12
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,696
What do you see?

13
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:28,996
Isn't it an brain edema (swelling caused by fluid retention)?

14
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:30,546
Are you sure?

15
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:36,376
Have some more confidence. It is a brain edema. And?

16
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:40,026
- Subdural hermorrhage (bleeding between the brain and its surrounding epidura or covering)
- Are you sure?

17
00:01:40,026 --> 00:01:41,716
Yes.

18
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:46,746
You're certain about uncertain things, and you're uncertain about certain things.

19
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:48,876
You can't differentiate between urine and feces can you? (Unable to tell the difference)

20
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:53,326
This is your 4th year here, so how can you not tell the difference between subdural hemorrhage and epidural hemorrhage?

21
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:55,876
Aren't you embarrassed in front of a 1st year resident?

22
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:59,176
(Epidural hemorrhage -- bleeding in the space between the epidura (covering of the brain) and the skull)

23
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:01,676
- Prepare for an emergency surgery.
-That's not possible.

24
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:04,986
- We need to get permission from the staff doctor on duty —
-If we delay, it's over for the patient.

25
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:09,416
There is an order to things at a hospital. If you're like this, I will get in trouble.

26
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,806
Are you going to put a patient in danger just because you're scared of getting in trouble?

27
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:14,766
But I won't be the only one in trouble. The doctor on duty will kill you, too.

28
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:17,496
Don't worry about me and schedule the surgery immediately.

29
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:30,486
She's not even on duty tonight. Why is she here being so bossy?

30
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:34,766
She should just go home and sleep. Don't you think so?

31
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:36,946
Yes, that's right.

32
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:39,046
If she orders me to do it, what choice do I have?

33
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:43,276
Why does she have so much energy? Did you see her earlier? She could've hit an ox.

34
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:48,486
She just flew there, and did a shoulder throw, and her kicks went like pow pow pow pow! Did you see her moves?

35
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:50,736
That's because everyone goes easy on her since she's a woman.

36
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:54,926
Ah.. So are you not going to schedule the surgery?

37
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:59,246
If I do, I'll get killed by Jeong Yoon Do.
If I don't, I'll get killed by Yoo Hye Jeong.

38
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:03,996
My reality is... I should listen to Yoo Hye Jeong.

39
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:15,946
It was just unbelievable earlier. And you still call yourself a doctor? How do you even hold a scalpel?

40
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:22,076
I gave you something to use against me for the rest of the year. Do you enjoying playing with someone's wound?

41
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:22,926
A wound?

42
00:03:22,926 --> 00:03:28,056
In high school, I almost got killed after getting called out to a building by a gangster who set it on fire.

43
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:35,176
I was traumatized ever since. This woman fell after I laid my hands on her.

44
00:03:35,176 --> 00:03:40,216
As much as I don't like being put in danger, I don't like endangering others.

45
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:43,846
A bright person like you had that kind of a past?

46
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:48,746
You're the first person I'm telling this to, Sunbae. I had a burn injury here.

47
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:53,216
It's gone now though. It hurts right now!

48
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,456
The girls nowadays play so fiercely.

49
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:59,416
Maybe it happened because you provoked her first by acting up.

50
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,516
What I did was throw a punch in the name of justice.

51
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:06,506
These days, she might be going in and out of prison.
Operating Room

52
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:11,286
I'll do it.

53
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:13,606
I'm supposed to do stuff like this.

54
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:15,226
Give it to me.

55
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:52,116
You're super fast!

56
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:55,086
You're overreacting.

57
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,206
I think it's Doctor Jeong Yoon Do.

58
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:58,406
Yoon Knife

59
00:04:58,406 --> 00:05:00,086
Doctor, I think I need to leave.

60
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:01,346
You can go out.

61
00:05:01,346 --> 00:05:03,136
Okay.

62
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:14,846
-Is the operating room ready?
-Yes, the 1st room.

63
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,626
Why the 1st room? What about the 2nd room?

64
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:20,786
The 2nd room is being used by the new fellow for an emergency operation for epidural hemorrhage.

65
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:22,726
Why is a surgery I don't know about taking place?

66
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:26,446
That's what I said! I kept on telling her that she can't but she insisted.

67
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:29,816
Then you should've contacted me! What the hell are you doing, Punk?

68
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:30,586
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:34,596
It's okay. You just need to take responsibility for what you're sorry for.

70
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:42,046
Why would you mess it up? He's the only person in the neurosurgery department with a screwed up personality and you can't even handle him?

71
00:05:42,046 --> 00:05:45,676
Doctor, have you seen the new fellow?

72
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:47,476
Why?

73
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:52,316
There's going to be blood. There cannot be two suns under one sky.

74
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:57,106
Why is he being like that?

75
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:02,396
("Fellow" -- some doctors receive additional specialized training after residency and may even supervise residents.)

76
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:07,176
Did you see the new fellow?

77
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:10,396
I heard that she fought off all the gangsters in the emergency room. Is that true?

78
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:13,746
Yes, I heard she's amazing. Like pew pew pew. Babapbap.

79
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:21,956
How did I not notice that extraordinary person? I've never seen her at the school.

80
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:24,366
I should become friends with her and use her as a bodyguard.

81
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:27,506
Are you that pretty that you need a bodyguard?

82
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:30,076
If someone sees us, they might think that we're friends.

83
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:32,316
We are friends.

84
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:37,336
I am beneath you when it comes to the social ladder, because I've been in med school for 10 years now.

85
00:06:37,336 --> 00:06:40,576
But you have to treat me well.

86
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:44,116
Why did you come to the hospital? I thought you were going to confess your feelings after the seminar.

87
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:47,076
I couldn't. He's in an emergency surgery right now.

88
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:48,696
Don't do it.

89
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:54,216
Jeong Yoon Do is not the type to be pulled into a relationship. He's the type to lead one.

90
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:57,526
Don't confess and make him do it.

91
00:06:57,526 --> 00:07:01,706
I like being the boss of things, whether it is relationship or work.

92
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:06,106
But isn't this a bad time to confess?

93
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:10,936
I hear he's mad about the new fellow ignoring the regulations and acting on her own.

94
00:07:10,936 --> 00:07:12,916
After the surgery, they're probably going to have a big fight.

95
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:16,516
Anyway, I want to be friends with her but she's rubbing me the wrong way from the first day.

96
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:20,786
There will be friction starting today. You guys need to compete for the staff position.

97
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:24,306
How could you say the fellow is my competition? She went to some no-name school outside of Seoul.

98
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:29,186
You really suck at getting the idea. That's why you fall down all the time, and that's why you are still a resident.

99
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:34,566
That fellow really has a hidden weapon. The chief recruited her.

100
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:52,316
The surgery went well but the patient needs to rest and be monitored for a while.

101
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:56,226
He's at the intensive care unit (ICU), so wait here until he gains consciousness.

102
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:59,966
ICU limits visitors.

103
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:02,116
Are you married?

104
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:05,006
I won't answer any personal questions.

105
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:08,706
You like it.

106
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:12,236
Are you laughing? I'm worried.

107
00:08:12,236 --> 00:08:16,996
Hey, clean those up now.

108
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:20,566
Tell Dr. Yoo Hye Jeong to see me after she's finished.

109
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:25,956
She's already done. Her hands are super fast and she even cuts the hair herself.

110
00:08:25,956 --> 00:08:28,286
I didn't have any work to do.

111
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:33,856
Are you mocking me? It's not important that she did it fast. Accuracy is the key.

112
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:37,466
What's the priority? Cuts the hair herself...

113
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:43,056
That's because she's full of suspicion because she can't trust you guys. She's a total psychopath!

114
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,186
I'm sorry, Doctor.

115
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:47,106
Why are you saying sorry again...

116
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:53,626
Anyway, tell her to wait. You're going to be punished for a week.

117
00:08:56,126 --> 00:09:00,756
Agh, it looks like I'm going to die from now on. It's hard to tolerate this guy, but

118
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:05,486
there's another person like that. Why is my life so difficult?

119
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:16,426
If Yoo Hye Jeong leaves, you're the one who's going to die.

120
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:20,796
Oh my god.

121
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:26,436
You're barging in. Can't you see I'm changing clothes?

122
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:30,696
Doctor Jeon Yoon Do told you to wait until his surgery is over.

123
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,026
Why?

124
00:09:32,026 --> 00:09:35,976
He's very angry. He's the doctor on call tonight.

125
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,786
Tell him that I'll talk to him tomorrow morning.

126
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:43,856
Doctor Jeong Yoon Do hates breaking the rules.

127
00:09:43,856 --> 00:09:46,866
What kind of surgery is he in right now?

128
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:50,056
Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by ruptured cerebral aneurysm.

129
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:58,366
I hate waiting.

130
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,686
She smells good.

131
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:14,986
This is Yoo Hye Jeong. I'll be waiting at Sooni Hawaii in front of the hospital.

132
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:19,266
She really has no sense of propriety.

133
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,137
What the heck?

134
00:10:32,137 --> 00:10:35,587
I was just testing if you were able to do what I taught you.

135
00:10:35,587 --> 00:10:36,987
Did I do good?

136
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:38,777
You did good.

137
00:10:38,777 --> 00:10:42,047
If you finished, you should've gone home. Why are you here?

138
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,187
So that we could go back together. Here, a present.

139
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:49,677
You thought of your grandma again, right?

140
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:53,537
Whenever you think to much about your grandmother, I benefit!

141
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,177
This is what I said I wanted!

142
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:02,507
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo!

143
00:11:02,507 --> 00:11:09,497
If you were a man, how good would it have been? I could have been a doctor's madam (wife). Ah, such a waste.

144
00:11:09,497 --> 00:11:12,597
Didn't people ask you why you came there again at 12?

145
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:15,667
No one asked, but there are people who want to meet me.

146
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:16,947
Seo Woo.

147
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:18,047
Why bring Seo Woo up?

148
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:21,117
The new hospital is Seo Woo's dad's hospital.

149
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:26,067
I heard that she became a doctor too. You mentioned that you've seen her at school, too.

150
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:29,987
If Seo Woo found out that you became a doctor, how would she feel?

151
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:32,387
Just thinking about it makes me feel satisfied.

152
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:35,307
Just thinking about it stresses me out.

153
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:38,537
If it's stress,

154
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:43,907
Something sweet is the best!

155
00:11:43,907 --> 00:11:47,057
It is the best.

156
00:11:47,057 --> 00:11:49,167
No matter how hard I think about it, I can't understand.

157
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,127
Why did I ever go to Guk Il Medical Center?

158
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,037
We definitely have telepathy.

159
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:56,197
A match made in heaven (soul mates).

160
00:11:56,197 --> 00:11:58,487
Right.

161
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:04,967
Eh, it must be that fussy person who asked you to wait. Why is he texting instead of coming?

162
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:07,547
Run over here right now.

163
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:09,607
When is he coming, tomorrow?

164
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:12,777
- This is Yoo Hye Jeong. I will be waiting at Sooni Hawaii, which is in front of the hospital.
- Run over here right now!

165
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,427
Just have one drink and go.

166
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:22,667
Dae Jeon Hospital Yoo Hye Jeong

167
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:26,517
[FOCUS] Dae Jeon Hospital Neurosurgeon Yoo Hye Jeong

168
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:29,497
She was famous in her region.

169
00:12:29,497 --> 00:12:32,457
Ah, that's why the Chief recruited her.
Beautiful doctor is Daejeon Hospital's first to introduce coiling

170
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:34,087
Coiling surgery?

171
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,857
Brain aneurysm clipping craniotomy

172
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,597
Wow! If this is the case, she will probably cross paths a lot with Doctor Jeong Yoon Do.

173
00:12:41,597 --> 00:12:45,117
But, why did she come as a resident fellow?

174
00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:50,237
Things are not lining up!

175
00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:56,027
But she's totally my style, I love strong girls.

176
00:12:58,227 --> 00:13:00,817
Hey! Are you looking up personal details after you have finished charting?

177
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:03,457
Ah, it hurts! I'm done!

178
00:13:03,457 --> 00:13:05,087
What about the dressing?

179
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:07,837
- Well, the dressing...
- Oh, Doctor Ahn Joon Dae!

180
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:10,947
Aigoo! Hello!

181
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:12,167
What is with the status of the ward?

182
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,187
There's nothing going on.

183
00:13:13,187 --> 00:13:15,667
But, why are we always on duty?

184
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:19,127
We should have breaks for at least a day.

185
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:20,547
Shut up!

186
00:13:20,547 --> 00:13:24,627
Shut up! Yes, I will train him again.

187
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:26,347
Just stay quiet.

188
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,617
Who wants to eat Jokbal (pig feet)?

189
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:30,007
-Me
-Me me!
-Let's make a bet to see who pays for it.

190
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:31,557
-Shall we?
-Yes.

191
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:33,427
Chief, do you also want to eat some?

192
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:35,507
I'm going crazy.

193
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:39,637
You are older. You could hit them if they need to learn.

194
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:41,057
He's saying that he doesn't hit, right?

195
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:42,767
-Of course!
-That's a relief.

196
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:46,077
These people! You are throwing oil on the fire.

197
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:51,437
Why is a upper year resident in the same class as a fellow? I'm not going to let it slide anymore.

198
00:13:51,437 --> 00:13:53,257
Thank you for letting it slide up until now.

199
00:13:53,257 --> 00:13:54,967
Get your head straight!

200
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,057
-Choi Kang Soo!
-Yes?

201
00:13:56,057 --> 00:13:58,087
Are you still continuing to check Patient Lee Cheol's vital signs?

202
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,527
Yes! They're normal!

203
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:01,007
- Ahn Joon Dae!
- Yes.

204
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,907
You're the same too! You're a 2nd year, but you are no better than a 1st year resident.

205
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:09,707
Giving, giving, Not giving. You make it seem like you are going to give everything. But because your surname is Ahn, you're not going to give.

206
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:11,647
(Ahn Joon Dae means does not give)

207
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:16,267
Don't push yourself by trusting in Doctor Jin's support.

208
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,257
I'm going to do rounds at the ICU.

209
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:24,407
I'm going to work without getting any sleep. You better follow my great example!

210
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:28,697
Pork feet? Ha! I'm also going to eat it.

211
00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:30,987
-Goodbye.
-Please take care.

212
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:32,687
Ward Lobby

213
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:36,657
Yes? Ah, yes I got it.

214
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,357
Emergency Room Jeong Yoon Tae
I'm going to go to the ward for a moment.

215
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:41,647
-Go ahead.
-Work hard!

216
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,717
Ah, what?!

217
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:00,157
Come in.

218
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:16,567
You walked here. I told you to run.

219
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:19,317
Did you not get the message to wait?

220
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,167
I heard.

221
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:27,207
You heard, but you still left? Are you trying to say "screw you" or something?

222
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:28,387
I left a memo.

223
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:30,037
Saying that you will be waiting at a cafe.

224
00:15:30,037 --> 00:15:34,817
Why do I have to meet with you alone in a private place?

225
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:39,427
I didn't think about that. I guess you can think of it like that. I'm sorry.

226
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:41,887
Yet another apology makes its appearance here.

227
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:48,037
What I dislike most are people who do things that need an apology.

228
00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:52,417
Let's just forget about the waiting part. But, why did you perform that emergency surgery?

229
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:57,447
Going into the emergency department on the first day of work is somewhat ceremonial to me. It's something that I usually do.

230
00:15:57,447 --> 00:16:00,307
I'm not saying something about coming to the emergency department.

231
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:04,337
Nobody wants to know about your personal excuses and emotions. What are you trying to justify?

232
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:08,057
There was no time to wait. You will know if you look at the records.

233
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:12,187
You didn't do it first because you wanted to show off?

234
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:17,287
You probably built your reputation by doing whatever you wanted at your local hospital, but it's different here.

235
00:16:17,287 --> 00:16:19,217
You say your assumptions are truth.

236
00:16:19,217 --> 00:16:22,067
Your actions confirm it.

237
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:27,527
I don't really like people who display showmanship.

238
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:33,047
Let's see it at the conference;

239
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:38,457
whether it was because you really needed to perform an emergency surgery or if you were just showing off.

240
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:42,107
Whether it's informal or formal, I ask that you stick with one.

241
00:16:42,107 --> 00:16:45,387
If something bothers you even a little bit, I guess you can't get past it.

242
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:47,127
That is similar to me.

243
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:53,127
Informally or formally, I'm going to switch between them. Let's agree on this.

244
00:16:54,517 --> 00:17:01,437
If you did the surgery even though there was enough time to wait, you will have to take responsibility.

245
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,157
I understand.

246
00:17:03,157 --> 00:17:08,567
If it's decided that there was no choice but to do an emergency operation, then you have to apologize to me.

247
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,487
Are you making a deal with me now?

248
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:16,317
I'm not even your mentee and you even heard an apology. I think you are speaking a bit harshly.

249
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:22,187
The apology that you dislike so much, at that time you'll have to do it.

250
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:27,627
Seeing the way you are acting towards me, it seems like you have no intention of becoming a staff member here.

251
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:29,787
If you have no intention of becoming a staff member, why are you here?

252
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:33,187
I believe you said you were uninterested in my thoughts and feelings.

253
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:35,087
I did.

254
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:39,937
I changed my mind. I fluctuate a lot. Let's hear it.

255
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:41,957
Why you came here when you don't even have the intention of becoming a staff member here.

256
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:47,857
I don't want to talk to someone that I'm not close with about my situation or my feelings.

257
00:17:54,247 --> 00:18:00,387
Then I'll never hear it, because I won't get close to you Doctor Yoo.

258
00:18:02,217 --> 00:18:05,337
The door is unlocked. You weren't at the break room.

259
00:18:06,157 --> 00:18:08,167
Then, I'll see you tomorrow.

260
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:11,667
Sorry, I didn't know you had a guest.

261
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:14,157
It's okay, I'm done working.

262
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:19,527
Wait a minute. Haven't we met somewhere before?

263
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:25,867
Yeah, say hello. She's the new fellow, Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong. And this is...

264
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:27,887
Yoo Hye Jeong?

265
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:32,427
You're that Yoo Hye Jeong?

266
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:35,057
It's me, Yoo Hye Jeong.

267
00:18:37,057 --> 00:18:39,447
You're a doctor?

268
00:18:39,447 --> 00:18:42,397
You still get mad when you see me?

269
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:52,497
Do you two know each other?

270
00:18:56,027 --> 00:18:57,857
Stop right there.

271
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,687
What's your purpose for being here?

272
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:06,747
Guk Il Medical Center is a place where many doctors want to work at.

273
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:09,797
The fact that I'm here isn't weird.

274
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:13,227
I can't believe it. How are you a doctor?

275
00:19:13,227 --> 00:19:15,297
How could you be working at the same hospital as me.

276
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:19,157
No, how could a person like you be at the same level as me.

277
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:21,327
Does my development cause your anger?

278
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:25,347
You'd thought that I'd congratulate you? Does the hospital know you used to be a gangster?

279
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:27,457
No, does your previous hospital even know?

280
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:31,027
I don't purposefully go around telling them. But, I also don't hide it.

281
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:34,547
Why? This time, are you going to post on SNS about it?

282
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:38,327
It's your speciality. Manipulating the power of a majority to destroy someone's life.

283
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:43,167
Even if I hadn't done that, you and Teacher Hong were already done for.

284
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,427
Aren't I right?

285
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:52,167
You're right. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have come this far.

286
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:58,967
Fine. Let me ask you one thing then. Are you still in contact with Hong Ji Hong?

287
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:02,277
I was so busy eating and living that I have had no leisure time to reminisce on memories of past acquaintances.

288
00:20:02,277 --> 00:20:04,027
Lying again!

289
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:07,227
In the past, you lied that you've never studied before and you used me.

290
00:20:07,227 --> 00:20:10,697
How can you have no doubt and be so sure about the things you believe?

291
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:12,497
If something goes beyond your knowledge, it's all lies?

292
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:15,427
You know that Teacher Hong Ji Hong is being reinstated at our hospital, right?

293
00:20:21,577 --> 00:20:24,767
Your plan was to come here because you knew.

294
00:20:27,117 --> 00:20:29,357
You won't believe whatever I say, right?

295
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:31,777
Get out of my hospital.

296
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:34,217
Then I'll believe you.

297
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:37,087
I will leave when I want to.

298
00:20:39,827 --> 00:20:45,437
Hong Ji Hong married In Joo. Don't dream about it.

299
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:59,887
Ladies and gentlemen, while you are getting comfortable in the cabin,

300
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:03,457
this is a reminder that all carry on

301
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:09,217
baggage must be secured either in the overhead bin or directly under the seat.

302
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:12,477
Why is my hand like this?

303
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:14,957
Have you had a check up?

304
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:16,787
This is a reminder that all passengers ...

305
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:21,577
Please don't get mixed up with me. I've noticed you've been looking at me for awhile.

306
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:25,287
You are very aggressive. You are overly defensive.

307
00:21:25,287 --> 00:21:26,877
How long has it been since your hand started trembling?

308
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:30,607
Why are you curious? Are you a doctor?

309
00:21:30,607 --> 00:21:32,767
Yes. I am a doctor.

310
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:35,347
So what?

311
00:21:35,347 --> 00:21:39,427
Your hand could be trembling because of the environment you are in, however

312
00:21:39,427 --> 00:21:43,027
it could be because there is something wrong with your body.

313
00:21:43,027 --> 00:21:48,147
I'm 25 years old. Why would there be anything wrong with me at such a young age?

314
00:21:48,147 --> 00:21:51,037
I understand that you are a doctor, but this is too much, don't you think?

315
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:56,307
This is too much, but I think it's important for doctors to overthink.

316
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:58,867
You speak well.

317
00:21:59,807 --> 00:22:04,167
You would've made a great news reporter as well.

318
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:06,517
If I made you uncomfortable, I'm sorry.

319
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:22,307
Hand me a cushion.

320
00:22:24,497 --> 00:22:27,347
-Are you a doctor?
-Yes.

321
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,417
-You have an emergency kit, right?
-Yes.

322
00:22:30,297 --> 00:22:33,227
- There's a Lorazepam inside there. Please bring it quickly.
- Yes.

323
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,717
Hold her here.

324
00:22:53,127 --> 00:22:57,077
When will we land? The patient doesn't have much time.

325
00:22:57,077 --> 00:22:58,967
Have you contacted the emergency center at Guk Il Hospital?

326
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:01,297
Yes. The emergency center is waiting.

327
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,897
This patient needs to be in surgery within 4 hours and 30 minutes.

328
00:23:04,897 --> 00:23:07,697
Otherwise it will get dangerous.

329
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:12,427
How do you feel?

330
00:23:13,457 --> 00:23:15,337
Try talking. How do you feel?

331
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:17,917
Of course, I don't feel good.

332
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:20,827
I wonder why I'm here.

333
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:24,057
The surgery went well, seeing that you don't like it here.

334
00:23:24,057 --> 00:23:26,667
Why is it good when I don't feel good?

335
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:29,307
You talk a lot.

336
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:33,057
It's funny that you talk a lot while bothering other people to get food.

337
00:23:33,057 --> 00:23:36,177
Are you trying to make my head burst by angering me?

338
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:40,387
Even if the surgery goes well, something could go wrong with the nerves.

339
00:23:40,387 --> 00:23:45,227
Consciousness, language, paralysis, and more could go wrong.

340
00:23:45,227 --> 00:23:49,637
However, since you are talking, I went a little overboard because I was happy.

341
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:53,367
Then you should've said that before.

342
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:57,837
Monitor him, and check if there is anything wrong. Examine him. If not, move him to a different patient room.

343
00:23:57,837 --> 00:23:59,257
Okay.

344
00:23:59,257 --> 00:24:03,217
Rest, sir. I will leave.

345
00:24:03,217 --> 00:24:04,847
Thank you.

346
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:08,747
What did you say?

347
00:24:12,177 --> 00:24:14,377
I said thank you.

348
00:24:14,377 --> 00:24:17,337
I can't hear well. Did you hear what he said?

349
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:20,497
-He said thank you.
-Ah!

350
00:24:20,497 --> 00:24:22,847
I'm also thankful to you too. You woke up healthy.

351
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:25,487
You just pretended not to hear my thank you.

352
00:24:25,487 --> 00:24:28,197
Of course. It's a thank you.

353
00:24:28,197 --> 00:24:30,657
Don't you remember what I did last night?

354
00:24:30,657 --> 00:24:32,907
You're tough.

355
00:24:32,907 --> 00:24:35,497
Yes. I'm tough.

356
00:24:35,497 --> 00:24:39,837
So from now on, I want you to follow my medical recommendations unconditionally.

357
00:24:39,837 --> 00:24:41,677
Then see you later.

358
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:49,417
Yes?

359
00:24:52,017 --> 00:24:53,567
Doctor!

360
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:57,507
A patient who fainted on an airplane is coming to our hospital on a helicopter right now.

361
00:24:57,507 --> 00:25:00,707
A doctor from our hospital discovered her and he wants an operating room right now.

362
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:04,267
In order to get to the operating room as soon as possible, he requested you be on standby at the helicopter pad.

363
00:25:04,267 --> 00:25:06,387
-When will the patient arrive?
-Soon.

364
00:25:06,387 --> 00:25:09,267
You arrange an operating room and go tell Yeong Gook to come here.

365
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:10,957
Alright.

366
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:14,887
25 years old. Female. Mental Stupor.

367
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:18,377
Pupils are 5mm and 3mm. There is no pupillary reflex on the right eye.

368
00:25:18,377 --> 00:25:22,387
- What about the presumed diagnosis?
- A suspected brain hemorrhage showing signs of status epilepticus.

369
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,107
The patient has been intubated, and her vitals aren't stable.

370
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,847
When did she start showing symptoms?

371
00:25:26,847 --> 00:25:30,917
-Ah, that...
-Not that answer. What's the time?

372
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:34,997
Doctor. Are you friends with that doctor?

373
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:38,837
Doctor Pi Yeon Gook. So are you asking me to be your friend?

374
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:44,327
Is the hospital a place about connections? I'm asking about the state of the patient and you're diverting to personal relationships?

375
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:47,327
-I'm sorry.
-If you want to work with me from now on, straighten out your head.

376
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:48,777
Okay.

377
00:25:50,597 --> 00:25:52,887
They should arrive soon.

378
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,697
Gook iI Hospital

379
00:27:18,647 --> 00:27:19,577
Resident Yeon Gook.

380
00:27:19,577 --> 00:27:22,947
Yes. I've heard a lot about you.

381
00:27:22,947 --> 00:27:25,717
-Take a CT right away.
-Okay.

382
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:50,817
♫  Some day, you stood by me  ♫

383
00:27:50,817 --> 00:27:57,937
♫  You were so lovely. You changed  ♫

384
00:27:57,937 --> 00:28:01,147
How long has it been since the patient lost consciousness?

385
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:05,857
4 hours 45 minutes.

386
00:28:05,857 --> 00:28:09,727
Have you been well?

387
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:12,177
Did you get married?

388
00:28:12,177 --> 00:28:14,137
No.

389
00:28:14,137 --> 00:28:16,537
Do you have a boyfriend?

390
00:28:16,537 --> 00:28:18,617
No.

391
00:28:18,617 --> 00:28:20,067
Okay then.

392
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:25,807
♫ You're an unexplainable miracle. ♫

393
00:28:31,427 --> 00:28:34,317
80cc is confirmed for the right brain.

394
00:28:34,317 --> 00:28:36,257
Are you going with navigation?

395
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:37,937
(Navigation: An instrument that confirms the location of brain hemorrhage through 3-D imaging)

396
00:28:37,937 --> 00:28:39,597
I'm going to do freehand aspiration.

397
00:28:39,597 --> 00:28:41,587
-What?
-Doctor!

398
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:44,187
It's been five hours since the patient lost consciousness.

399
00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:47,737
The preparation time for an x-ray is over half an hour, the patient might as well die.

400
00:28:47,737 --> 00:28:50,847
-That's too dangerous.
-That's why I'm doing it.

401
00:28:50,847 --> 00:28:53,667
Have an anethesiologist ready and prepare an operating room.

402
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:55,737
I already prepared that.

403
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:05,367
You're going in?

404
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:09,897
What are you? You don't seem like a resident, because your coat looks simple.

405
00:29:09,897 --> 00:29:12,967
Are you trying to catch up with me right now?

406
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:14,447
Yeah, can't I?

407
00:29:14,447 --> 00:29:17,487
Do you have to do it? Freehand?

408
00:29:17,487 --> 00:29:21,297
-We can drop the blood pressure...
-Yoo Hye Jeong.

409
00:29:23,267 --> 00:29:25,787
Every time I came to Korea I looked for you.

410
00:29:25,787 --> 00:29:28,597
-In Joo is doing well, right?
-Why are you asking me about In Joo?

411
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:29,617
You're married to her.

412
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:32,377
I got married? When?

413
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:51,087
How are you feeling?

414
00:29:51,087 --> 00:29:55,627
Why are you curious about how I am you bastard!

415
00:29:57,407 --> 00:29:58,917
Has he been like this all throughout?

416
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:00,317
Yes.

417
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,427
Call the psychiatry department and schedule a consultation.

418
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:18,647
What's with your clothing? I told you not to wear surgery clothes around, right?

419
00:30:18,647 --> 00:30:22,257
I told you not to forget the dignity of neurosurgeons in any situation.

420
00:30:22,257 --> 00:30:24,017
I apologize.

421
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:26,737
What is...?

422
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:33,947
Why'd you do it? There has to be a reason.

423
00:30:33,947 --> 00:30:39,187
The new Doctor Hong Ji Hong said he's going to do a surgical drainage by freehand, without navigation.

424
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:45,217
So you all want to watch it together? That's why you were going like that?

425
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:50,917
Where's the operating room?

426
00:30:56,617 --> 00:31:00,097
Operating Room

427
00:31:01,197 --> 00:31:05,037
Without using navigation and knowing where it is, how are they saying that they're going to insert a catheter?

428
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:06,077
Have you seen something like that?

429
00:31:06,077 --> 00:31:10,647
This is the way they did it in the past during the Goryeo dynasty, when there wasn't navigation.

430
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:14,167
Please move the monitor so I can see it on my left side.

431
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:15,627
Yes.

432
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:26,507
Scalpel.

433
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:40,057
Give me the drill please.

434
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:49,917
What if the drill hits something else?

435
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:53,157
Please. I don't even want to think about it.

436
00:31:53,157 --> 00:31:57,077
Either way, no matter what method they use, that patient is going to die.

437
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:01,007
How's it going? Has blood come out?

438
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:02,777
They didn't insert it yet.

439
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:05,107
Come out, please.

440
00:32:21,487 --> 00:32:23,047
Pull.

441
00:32:25,997 --> 00:32:28,047
Get the syringe ready to draw blood.

442
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,927
Ah, he failed.

443
00:33:41,977 --> 00:33:44,067
Wow, he's so skilled.

444
00:33:44,067 --> 00:33:47,017
Oh it's not a joke. Girls are going to be standing in lines.

445
00:33:47,017 --> 00:33:49,337
He's married to a school classmate.

446
00:33:49,337 --> 00:33:53,967
He didn't get married. Why do you make a fine bachelor into a married man?

447
00:33:58,447 --> 00:34:02,077
I heard that he was married. You heard that too right?

448
00:34:02,077 --> 00:34:04,127
You're the one that told me.

449
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,147
Oh that's right...I'm the one who told you.

450
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:08,107
You should fix your wi-fi network.

451
00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:10,967
Just because I was wrong this one time doesn't mean you can be suspicious about all the information I've told you.

452
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:13,617
- Even if he didn't get married, isn't he a playboy?
- Bingo!

453
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:14,807
Or he could've just lived with her.

454
00:34:14,807 --> 00:34:18,827
Is it fun playing around like this? Aren't you going to get ready for the conference?

455
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:28,357
But, those two seem to know each other. Do you know them too?

456
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:33,207
Shall I close it up?

457
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:34,217
Can you do it?

458
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:37,037
Yes. It's what I've always done.

459
00:34:37,037 --> 00:34:40,727
I haven't seen what you've always done. I'm curious.

460
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:41,947
Then, you do it.

461
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:44,917
I'll believe you. You close it up.

462
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:47,867
- You worked hard.
- You worked hard.

463
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:58,577
From the beginning, your entrance is over the top

464
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:04,917
This kind of stuff is awkward.

465
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:07,147
Since things have turned out this way, start work today. Say your greetings too.

466
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,427
Are you another mean employer? Let me finish my vacation first.

467
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:12,967
Then finish it.

468
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:15,107
Instead, go and say your greetings first.

469
00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:16,957
Okay, I'll see you later.

470
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:17,907
Where are you going?

471
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,057
I have to confirm something.

472
00:35:25,517 --> 00:35:27,127
Why did you come back?

473
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:32,147
I'm checking to see if you're doing well. I passed the finishing onto you without even knowing how skilled you are.

474
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:35,947
As if someone can't tell you're a neurosurgeon. So much suspicion.

475
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:39,627
Are you laughing? If it's funny, you should laugh.

476
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,307
You're good.

477
00:35:48,297 --> 00:35:49,837
You're really good.

478
00:35:49,837 --> 00:35:51,417
Cut.

479
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:56,917
Teach me how to insert a catheter without navigation.

480
00:35:56,917 --> 00:36:02,447
Having a passion for learning is good, but you became slightly rude.

481
00:36:02,447 --> 00:36:06,027
You've met your teacher again after a long time and all you're doing is taking what you need?

482
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:10,177
Well, it seems like you ate an entire truckload of butter.

483
00:36:10,177 --> 00:36:13,137
What? Are you saying that I'm being greasy?

484
00:36:14,877 --> 00:36:17,037
Don't laugh.

485
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:27,867
You're quite hard on me.

486
00:36:28,697 --> 00:36:32,757
Why are you like that? You were like this then too. Rejecting my money

487
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:37,457
and why did you disappear with a guy on a motorcycle? Is he doing well?

488
00:36:37,457 --> 00:36:40,927
Did you search for me to ask those questions?

489
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:43,337
I was curious about how you were doing.

490
00:36:43,337 --> 00:36:46,697
It's been a long time since I've been living in society.

491
00:36:46,697 --> 00:36:50,247
I can understand your actions.

492
00:36:50,247 --> 00:36:56,207
Although I haven't gotten married, I've seen a lot of male sunbaes switching shifts because they don't want to go home

493
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:57,957
I've also seen a lot of bad relationships.

494
00:36:57,957 --> 00:36:59,847
Why are you saying this to me?

495
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:02,217
Please treat In Joo Unni well.

496
00:37:02,217 --> 00:37:03,947
Why are you bringing up In Joo?

497
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:07,467
Marriage is sacred.

498
00:37:11,317 --> 00:37:16,157
That's right. Marriage is sacred. What in the world.

499
00:37:16,157 --> 00:37:21,257
In conclusion, she's telling me to treat a marriage with In Joo as sacred.

500
00:37:21,257 --> 00:37:27,857
But why does she keep telling me to get married? Why do I keep talking to myself?

501
00:37:38,237 --> 00:37:40,417
Hello.

502
00:37:44,877 --> 00:37:45,927
Please give it to me.

503
00:37:45,927 --> 00:37:51,837
You have to have an owner's consciousness. If this was your house, would you leave garbage lying around?

504
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:53,967
Give a warning to the person responsible for cleaning.

505
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:55,497
Yes.

506
00:37:55,497 --> 00:37:56,827
Ah, Chairman.

507
00:37:56,827 --> 00:37:58,937
You came?

508
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:02,687
Are the preparations for the meeting going well?

509
00:38:02,687 --> 00:38:04,177
Hey, we're going on our own.

510
00:38:04,177 --> 00:38:05,767
Yes.

511
00:38:10,377 --> 00:38:11,757
Have you gotten all the votes from the executives?

512
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:17,657
Yes. I've confirmed over half of the votes. They say they'll vote for us, but it's uncertain until the results are out.

513
00:38:17,657 --> 00:38:19,647
40 years of friendship is nothing really.

514
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:22,337
I am not sure how they can treat you like this despite my goodwill.

515
00:38:22,337 --> 00:38:26,887
Seeing as they were the founders, I let them be up to now. But now I can't. I'm preparing a big project.

516
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,837
You have to do it quickly.

517
00:38:28,837 --> 00:38:32,137
Because of Chairman Hong, the longer we delay, the more disadvantageous it becomes for us.

518
00:38:32,137 --> 00:38:37,167
His attack on you this time is to push me into a corner, to chase you and me out.

519
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:40,837
After I became chairman, we've had a surplus for two years. With what reason is he trying to chase me out?

520
00:38:40,837 --> 00:38:43,017
They are against the elder health center...

521
00:38:43,017 --> 00:38:47,857
and accusing us of trying to turn this into a family-run enterprise. That is plenty of nonsense.

522
00:38:47,857 --> 00:38:49,937
In the future, the elderly are the only way to make money.

523
00:38:49,937 --> 00:38:54,097
As time passes, he'll know that my decision is right.

524
00:38:54,097 --> 00:38:56,407
The doors are opening.

525
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:59,057
56th
2016
Special Board of Director's Meeting

526
00:38:59,057 --> 00:39:01,237
Entrance of Board Directors

527
00:39:01,237 --> 00:39:05,847
This conference was prepared in order to get agreement from the board members regarding the elderly health center.

528
00:39:05,847 --> 00:39:12,917
Matching the life expectancy of 100 year, the core business project of Guk Il Medical Center will be this is an elderly health center.

529
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:18,777
The passion of the chairman, who is personally doing the presentation, is very high.

530
00:39:18,777 --> 00:39:23,807
Even if we don't do the elderly health center, there are many things we can do. Why are we doing this?

531
00:39:23,807 --> 00:39:26,617
Also what is the reason for building a health center

532
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:30,657
for our VVIP elders?

533
00:39:31,817 --> 00:39:35,097
If I were to say it simply, it's because of money.

534
00:39:35,097 --> 00:39:39,797
The government will not approve the medical fees we ask for.
If we keep pestering the public,

535
00:39:39,797 --> 00:39:45,157
people will neglect our institution due to the infighting.

536
00:39:45,157 --> 00:39:47,877
Then, do you want the hospital to starve?

537
00:39:47,877 --> 00:39:50,647
I think your thinking is too extreme.

538
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:53,497
Even if there isn't a lot of profit from medical treatments, there is still a surplus.

539
00:39:53,497 --> 00:39:55,857
We still have a surplus after many other expenses.

540
00:39:55,857 --> 00:40:00,157
Building a elderly health center for a profit,

541
00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:03,917
it's something that business people do.

542
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:07,597
Running a hospital is like riding a bicycle with no brakes.

543
00:40:07,597 --> 00:40:11,677
If you stop, you fall. If you don't expand through other projects, it will fail.

544
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:14,637
The hospital is not a business enterprise.

545
00:40:14,637 --> 00:40:19,467
Of course it's good to make money. But for public benefit, we have to give it up.

546
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:24,597
Even though these words provoke a bit, I said the hospital will fail. Does that not provoke you?

547
00:40:24,597 --> 00:40:29,307
So, is that why you decreased the Burn Center's budget by 50%?

548
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:32,487
Are you going to build the elderly health center after cutting that budget?

549
00:40:33,467 --> 00:40:36,627
Is this how Director Jin manages the hospital?

550
00:40:36,627 --> 00:40:40,837
Then, will you close down the departments that are unprofitable?

551
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:50,037
We are doctors.
If we do things that make us lose dignity as doctors,

552
00:40:50,037 --> 00:40:52,667
it's better for the hospital to go bankrupt.

553
00:40:55,067 --> 00:41:01,207
Now, now if we continue like this there will be no end. Let's vote.

554
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:19,927
How long do we have to endure him pushing us around?

555
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:23,307
But, we lost the vote by a small amount.

556
00:41:23,307 --> 00:41:26,747
If he doesn't have a business mindset, he should step down and just watch.

557
00:41:26,747 --> 00:41:30,037
Is this Joseon Dynasty period? Why does he have to care so much about dignity and honor?

558
00:41:30,037 --> 00:41:32,197
So, will you give up on the health care center?

559
00:41:32,197 --> 00:41:36,637
I will never give up.
Doctors are pathetic.

560
00:41:36,637 --> 00:41:38,207
Especially the ones who came from top med schools.

561
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:42,427
They're just kids who studied as the adults told them so they don't have the mindset for new challenges!

562
00:41:42,427 --> 00:41:44,587
That's why I like the ones from the third-rate schools.

563
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:48,917
They know how life works, because they've been stomped on before.

564
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:52,577
Well, they say it takes one to know one.

565
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:54,887
Who knew that you would have such a good business mindset?

566
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:58,057
You can turn negative figures to positive figures. Who else can do this?

567
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:04,077
I'll proceed with this project ASAP, and get rid of Chairman Hong. Today again, he was such a roadblock.

568
00:42:04,077 --> 00:42:09,077
It won't be easy. Doo Sik even brought in Ji Hong.

569
00:42:09,077 --> 00:42:10,587
What are you doing, Father?

570
00:42:10,587 --> 00:42:14,417
Why are you being pushed around by Chairman Hong? What are you lacking?

571
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:18,317
This son of a b*tch... Why would your father be pushed around?

572
00:42:18,317 --> 00:42:23,577
He's my life-long friend so I'm giving him respect. You don't even know...

573
00:42:27,777 --> 00:42:29,417
I came to work without a single day of rest.

574
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:31,267
That's right.

575
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:36,857
This place would be great for building an organ transplant center.

576
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:44,247
The future, life extension and quality of life will be decided by organ transplant technology.

577
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:48,187
Director Jin thinks that it will be the wellness center.

578
00:42:48,187 --> 00:42:50,717
We already have a wellness center.

579
00:42:51,757 --> 00:42:54,117
He wants to make money.

580
00:42:54,937 --> 00:42:58,757
He has great business mindset, but he's very lacking.

581
00:42:58,757 --> 00:43:03,757
Father, why don't you stop thinking about the hospital for a moment and hang out with me. How about dinner?

582
00:43:03,757 --> 00:43:08,067
I'll greet some people quickly and go home to unpack and make something delicious.

583
00:43:08,067 --> 00:43:09,717
Shall we?

584
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:16,067
The wind is nice.

585
00:43:17,837 --> 00:43:23,147
32 Male. After getting hit by someone, he suffered from a scalp laceration.

586
00:43:23,147 --> 00:43:25,697
When the patient was admitted into the hospital, he was in a blurred mental state.

587
00:43:25,697 --> 00:43:30,687
According to the CT, an acute epidural hemorrhage of a size of the thickness of the bone was found.

588
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,607
So, we performed an emergency operation.

589
00:43:32,607 --> 00:43:36,337
He didn't have a serious epidural hemorrhage. Why did you have to have an urgent operation?

590
00:43:36,337 --> 00:43:37,537
There was a spasm—

591
00:43:37,537 --> 00:43:40,017
The patient was young and conscious when he came in.

592
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:43,927
If he gained consciousness after the spasm, shouldn't he have been monitored longer?

593
00:43:43,927 --> 00:43:47,257
The patient regained consciousness briefly through a lucid interval and

594
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:50,377
his mental state deteriorated through a stupor so we carried out the surgery.

595
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,397
According to the CT scan, the blood clotting wasn't critical.

596
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,467
Didn't you improperly check his mental state?

597
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,757
I didn't do it incorrectly.

598
00:43:57,757 --> 00:44:00,327
Then shouldn't there be another reason that his mental state deteriorated?

599
00:44:00,327 --> 00:44:03,167
You should've checked his CT if his mental state really deteriorated.

600
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:06,957
According to the OP Field, there was continuous bleeding from the middle meningeal artery.

601
00:44:06,957 --> 00:44:10,397
And the blood clot was confirmed to be more than 50 cc.

602
00:44:12,307 --> 00:44:14,687
The OP field (Operation field) is under the surgeon's jurisdiction.
(The area where surgery is to be performed.)

603
00:44:14,687 --> 00:44:20,467
If you don't believe me, I can no longer try to justify the reason why the emergency operation was needed.

604
00:44:29,237 --> 00:44:32,457
That's right. OP Field is subject to the the surgeon's decision.

605
00:44:32,457 --> 00:44:37,487
If we don't respect each others' decision, who would?

606
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:41,737
We'll end this here.

607
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:48,157
I have someone to introduce. Doctor Hong Ji Hong.

608
00:44:48,157 --> 00:44:49,897
Come forward.

609
00:44:52,817 --> 00:44:58,597
Doctor Hong is transferred to our department as a staff member. You've all heard great things about Doctor Hong.

610
00:44:59,487 --> 00:45:03,177
Infra skull cerebral tumor. He's a global rising star.

611
00:45:03,177 --> 00:45:05,847
It was difficult to bring him here.

612
00:45:07,717 --> 00:45:11,107
I am Hong Ji Hong. Please take care of me.

613
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:19,117
- Doctor Jin.
- Yes?

614
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:20,227
Whom are you under right now?

615
00:45:20,227 --> 00:45:22,337
Doctor Jeong Yoon Do.

616
00:45:22,337 --> 00:45:24,487
Doctors Hong Ji Hong and Jeong Yoon Do will choose

617
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:28,657
either Jin Seo Woo or Fellow Yoo Hye Jeong as their assistants.

618
00:45:28,657 --> 00:45:30,777
Let me know your decisions.

619
00:45:32,037 --> 00:45:37,047
Also, Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong and Doctor Jin Seo Woo, if there's a doctor that you'd like to follow,

620
00:45:37,047 --> 00:45:39,817
leave a good impression, and get chosen.

621
00:46:02,047 --> 00:46:05,157
You're not busy on Monday right? Are you free-

622
00:46:05,157 --> 00:46:07,097
Teacher!

623
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:10,787
Oh, hey! It's been awhile.

624
00:46:10,787 --> 00:46:13,227
What's going on? Hye Jeong is here too.

625
00:46:14,087 --> 00:46:18,117
I really enjoyed reading your thesis article in Neurosurgery Magazine.

626
00:46:19,367 --> 00:46:23,777
Ah looking at you guys makes me think of the old days. It's nice.

627
00:46:23,777 --> 00:46:25,637
You two already knew each other?

628
00:46:25,637 --> 00:46:28,057
She was my student. And so was Doctor Yoo.

629
00:46:28,057 --> 00:46:31,847
Oh really? Then, you turned 2 of your students into neurosurgeons?

630
00:46:31,847 --> 00:46:35,627
I'm feeling very proud thanks to my students.

631
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:37,237
Please take care of me from here on.

632
00:46:37,237 --> 00:46:39,017
Okay.

633
00:46:39,017 --> 00:46:42,897
Doctor Jin, are you trying to lobby your way into becoming Doctor Hong's disciple?

634
00:46:42,897 --> 00:46:45,197
She doesn't need to do that. I already know the answer.

635
00:46:45,197 --> 00:46:48,507
If you want to work under me, tell me.

636
00:46:48,507 --> 00:46:51,247
I still have a lot to learn from Doctor Jeong Yoon Do.

637
00:46:51,247 --> 00:46:54,447
Alright, then. Let's be close now.

638
00:46:54,447 --> 00:46:57,497
That's also what I want.

639
00:46:57,497 --> 00:47:01,157
You have to get along well with the new Doctor Hong Ji Hong in your division.

640
00:47:01,157 --> 00:47:04,607
Although I know you get along with everyone.

641
00:47:04,607 --> 00:47:10,157
There's something that I'm planning with Doctor Hong Ji Hong. Okay?

642
00:47:10,157 --> 00:47:11,707
Okay.

643
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:18,667
Doctor.

644
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:20,177
Yeah?

645
00:47:21,037 --> 00:47:23,087
I have something to tell you.

646
00:47:23,097 --> 00:47:25,677
Vice President's Office

647
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:28,107
I want to know how Yoo Hye Jeong got recruited here.

648
00:47:28,107 --> 00:47:31,217
I don't want to judge her, but she's from a third-rate school—

649
00:47:31,217 --> 00:47:35,747
I don't want you to judge someone according to their school.

650
00:47:35,747 --> 00:47:40,087
Even your father went to a provincial school, but he's leading Guk Il Medical Center at this moment.

651
00:47:40,087 --> 00:47:44,017
Skill is the main standard to get qualified for our hospital's fellow doctor program.

652
00:47:44,017 --> 00:47:46,717
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong qualified according to the standard.

653
00:47:46,717 --> 00:47:49,617
She was already working as a chief at a regional provincial hosptial.

654
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:53,407
Unless she had other motives, she wouldn't have made this decision.

655
00:47:53,407 --> 00:47:58,327
I'm curious about that too. Why would she have followed me here.

656
00:47:58,327 --> 00:48:04,017
Although it was a countryside hospital, it's difficult to become a chief at her age. She was making a lot of money too.

657
00:48:05,957 --> 00:48:08,497
Doctor. There's nothing else to do today right?

658
00:48:08,497 --> 00:48:11,777
Yes, I just have to check the ICU rooms.

659
00:48:11,777 --> 00:48:14,267
Who do you want to learn from first?

660
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:17,457
I'm just going to accept their choice. It's annoying.

661
00:48:17,457 --> 00:48:19,367
Wow, you're so cool.

662
00:48:20,137 --> 00:48:22,217
What's cool?

663
00:48:22,217 --> 00:48:25,187
Just... cool.

664
00:48:26,027 --> 00:48:27,987
This reminds me of the past.

665
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:32,667
When I was in high school, I think I acted like you towards my homeroom teacher.

666
00:48:45,287 --> 00:48:49,607
You don't still think I was wrong in doing the surgery right?

667
00:48:52,517 --> 00:48:56,287
I didn't see the OP field, and because I didn't see it

668
00:48:56,287 --> 00:48:58,427
I can't apologize.

669
00:48:58,427 --> 00:49:00,997
I thought you'd be hard to get along with, but this is surprising.

670
00:49:00,997 --> 00:49:02,747
Are you making fun of me right now?

671
00:49:02,747 --> 00:49:05,367
Looking at your stubborn face, it's like a kid.

672
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:09,537
I was worried about you being picky, but now I am relieved.

673
00:49:09,537 --> 00:49:10,087
What?

674
00:49:10,087 --> 00:49:14,297
Even if it isn't something you saw yourself, please have some trust in people.

675
00:49:14,297 --> 00:49:16,937
Your actions, seem narrow-minded.

676
00:49:16,937 --> 00:49:18,707
Cheapskate?

677
00:49:21,457 --> 00:49:23,937
Who are you exactly?

678
00:49:25,627 --> 00:49:28,817
Do you think you're a gangster after fixing up a bunch of gangsters in the emergency center?

679
00:49:28,817 --> 00:49:32,707
Why are your words so rough? Why are you so rude to me?

680
00:49:32,707 --> 00:49:35,807
You were the one who was rude first.

681
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:40,367
I have a habit of returning everything I receive.

682
00:49:42,467 --> 00:49:44,527
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong!

683
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:59,887
I'm sorry. About the epidural hemorthage surgery.

684
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:01,757
Now we don't owe each other anything.

685
00:50:01,757 --> 00:50:06,967
Just a heads up, I also have a habit of returning what I receive.

686
00:50:16,527 --> 00:50:18,907
What if it's because of Doctor Hong?

687
00:50:18,907 --> 00:50:19,967
Doctor Hong?

688
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:22,227
I can't tell you anymore because of privacy, but

689
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:28,077
it would be good if Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong leaves the Neurosurgery Team.

690
00:50:28,077 --> 00:50:32,017
Is Doctor Yoo scary?

691
00:50:32,017 --> 00:50:32,797
Why would I...?

692
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:35,637
Because the poor girl from a third-rate med school

693
00:50:35,637 --> 00:50:38,927
is now in the same position as Doctor Jin.

694
00:50:39,797 --> 00:50:45,177
Please keep your composure like a daughter from a 3- generation doctor family.

695
00:50:45,177 --> 00:50:50,527
People can't develop by themselves. Doctor Yoo will be a good competitor for you.

696
00:50:51,497 --> 00:50:54,577
There's s nomination for a position of professor next year. There's only 1 vacancy.

697
00:50:54,577 --> 00:50:58,267
I will show you that you were wrong

698
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:01,267
in the opinion that Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong and I will become competitors,

699
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:06,737
Saying that you have private matters that you can't talk about

700
00:51:06,737 --> 00:51:11,427
is much more of a personal attack than saying that there are private matters you can talk about.

701
00:51:11,427 --> 00:51:15,307
There was a new side to you, Doctor Jin.

702
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:40,677
Warning: Inaccessible

703
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:43,257
Search patients

704
00:51:44,627 --> 00:51:47,077
Warning: Inaccessible

705
00:51:51,787 --> 00:51:55,507
Doctor. Are you not getting off work?

706
00:51:55,507 --> 00:52:01,427
Can't doctors look at all the hospital patient's records? I could at the previous hospital that I worked at.

707
00:52:01,427 --> 00:52:06,767
Out of all the patients, not even doctors can look at the VIP's records.

708
00:52:09,027 --> 00:52:10,967
Who's record are you trying to look at?

709
00:52:10,967 --> 00:52:12,447
My grandmother.

710
00:52:12,447 --> 00:52:14,137
Why?

711
00:52:14,137 --> 00:52:16,127
How do I see someone's medical record?

712
00:52:16,127 --> 00:52:18,767
You can go and ask at the administration department.

713
00:52:23,497 --> 00:52:28,727
Something must be going on. Who is this grandmother?

714
00:52:36,337 --> 00:52:40,547
You can't see the record of Kang Mal Soon. The security is high.

715
00:52:40,547 --> 00:52:45,377
If you would like to see it, you can submit a request to view medical records. I don't know if it'll be accepted, though.

716
00:52:59,867 --> 00:53:01,967
Your collar is unfolded.

717
00:53:04,037 --> 00:53:07,927
If I do this to most female doctors, do I get reported for sexual assault?

718
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:11,307
It's sexual harassment. To put it in words, it's sexual assault.

719
00:53:11,307 --> 00:53:16,827
Oh is it? Let's trust each other. Has the world gotten so harsh?

720
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:19,747
I won't accuse you.

721
00:53:19,747 --> 00:53:22,267
What a clever mate. Are you from the capital?

722
00:53:22,267 --> 00:53:25,257
No, I came up from the country.

723
00:53:25,257 --> 00:53:29,447
Do your best. Our hospital is a land of opportunity for the doctors who seek it.

724
00:53:29,447 --> 00:53:35,307
It may not be much, but these little things can determine whether a doctor is trustworthy or not.

725
00:53:36,337 --> 00:53:37,637
Work hard.

726
00:53:37,637 --> 00:53:39,117
Yes.

727
00:53:52,547 --> 00:53:54,127
Watch!

728
00:53:56,937 --> 00:53:58,677
Doctor.

729
00:53:58,677 --> 00:54:01,647
By any chance, did you come out with Yoo Hye Jeong?

730
00:54:01,647 --> 00:54:04,127
I didn't receive the roster for the entire neurosurgery team yet.

731
00:54:04,127 --> 00:54:05,347
Should I get you it?

732
00:54:05,347 --> 00:54:07,387
- What's your name?
- My name is Choi Kang Soo.

733
00:54:07,387 --> 00:54:09,617
Kang Soo. I like it.

734
00:54:09,617 --> 00:54:12,377
If there's anything else you're curious about, please ask me.

735
00:54:12,377 --> 00:54:17,837
I probably know Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong better than anyone in the neurosurgical department.

736
00:54:31,877 --> 00:54:35,697
Although it's unfortunate, I did my best, so I have nothing left to say.

737
00:54:35,697 --> 00:54:38,227
I feel like I finished up well, too.

738
00:54:39,557 --> 00:54:44,587
If you prove that I didn't do my best, I will receive my punishment as you wish.

739
00:54:58,777 --> 00:55:01,327
Father, it's all done. Come sit.

740
00:55:01,327 --> 00:55:05,527
Isn't it right to eat Jjajangmyeon (Black Bean Noodles) when you moved in?

741
00:55:05,527 --> 00:55:08,787
It was easier to make pasta than Jjajangmyeon. I'll make you it next time.

742
00:55:08,787 --> 00:55:12,427
No, no. I like pasta.

743
00:55:12,427 --> 00:55:15,777
It's lonely with just two men.

744
00:55:15,777 --> 00:55:20,337
What do you mean it's lonely? Are you not satisfied with me?

745
00:55:23,517 --> 00:55:26,287
Have you contacted In Joo?

746
00:55:27,787 --> 00:55:29,657
No.

747
00:55:29,657 --> 00:55:32,017
They got divorced.

748
00:55:33,017 --> 00:55:35,527
I feel sorry towards In Joo.

749
00:55:35,527 --> 00:55:41,277
How nice would it have been if you two had got married? How much would you guys have understood each other?

750
00:55:44,187 --> 00:55:46,957
You... are unethical.

751
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,527
Hey!

752
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:59,167
Let's go in. You'll get a cold.

753
00:56:02,597 --> 00:56:04,997
I thought it would work if I tried hard.

754
00:56:04,997 --> 00:56:11,097
I tried my hardest, and all you say is, "I can't do it?"

755
00:56:11,097 --> 00:56:12,717
I'm sorry.

756
00:56:15,017 --> 00:56:19,957
You don't say it, but I know who's in your heart.

757
00:56:21,947 --> 00:56:24,457
Should I tell you who?

758
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:51,447
Yoo Hye Jeong

759
00:56:51,447 --> 00:56:53,387
Yoo Hye Jeong

760
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:10,097
I heard you still beat people up. I heard it all from Kang Soo.

761
00:57:14,247 --> 00:57:17,737
Why did you ask to meet? We're going to see each other at the hospital anyway.

762
00:57:17,737 --> 00:57:22,647
Something keeps bothering me. If I didn't figure it out right now, it wouldn't work.

763
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:23,537
What is it?

764
00:57:23,537 --> 00:57:25,807
Why do you keep telling me to get married?

765
00:57:25,807 --> 00:57:29,607
I didn't tell you to, you did it yourself.

766
00:57:29,607 --> 00:57:31,137
Ah, you've changed.

767
00:57:31,137 --> 00:57:35,817
Why would you believe people and judge when you haven't heard from the person themself? I'm not married!

768
00:57:35,817 --> 00:57:39,067
I know that you didn't. I'm going now.

769
00:57:39,067 --> 00:57:41,427
This girl really...

770
00:57:45,267 --> 00:57:47,177
After I got hit by you, I was determined,

771
00:57:47,177 --> 00:57:50,457
that I wouldn't get hit by you again.

772
00:58:23,547 --> 00:58:24,717
I withdraw. Give up!

773
00:58:24,717 --> 00:58:26,207
Oh.

774
00:58:35,507 --> 00:58:41,947
An unresolved past comes back to find you. Whether it's love, or resentment.

775
00:58:41,947 --> 00:58:48,947
♫ You are my life's everything. The reason that I live. ♫

776
00:58:48,947 --> 00:58:56,467
♫ The unexplainable miracle. ♫
