00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,600
Episode 18

2
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,090
Uncle!

3
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,040
Ah yes, what do you have to tell me? I have to get back to work soon.

4
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,400
What is going on?

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,960
It's not under my name. It's under someone else's. Did you sell the house?

6
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,160
Yes, I sold it.

7
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,920
For a young person, you're very bright. You kept up with this piece of paper?

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,300
It's my house, the house that I used to live in with Mom and Dad.

9
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,150
I'm your guardian. You should repay your gratitude.

10
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,450
After your parents passed away in the accident, I took you in for a year.

11
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,180
I loved you more than I loved on my own children!

12
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,280
I did enough for you.

13
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,120
Hello!

14
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,500
Intern Hong Ji Hong

15
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,100
Ji Hong!

16
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,870
You were on my mind lately, so I asked for information.

17
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,690
You became a doctor.

18
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,530
Your dad will be proud from heaven.

19
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,800
Why are you here?

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,150
I'm getting kidney dialysis.

21
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,920
I see.

22
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:06,780
I'm leaving. My heart is more at ease now that I've seen you.

23
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,320
I knew you would always be blessed.

24
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,780
I've dreamt of revenge before.

25
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,150
Kill everyone and kill myself.

26
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,400
There is such a thing that you reap what you sow. In the midst of it,

27
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,290
that's not where I am, but where the world is.

28
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,000
Teacher, think about the time between Chairman Hong collapsing and when he was found.

29
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,620
Isn't it weird? I think it's weird. There's definitely something.

30
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,470
Did you look into it?

31
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,380
I looked into it. There's nothing odd.

32
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,260
I do feel a little suspicious.

33
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,980
But I won't focus on that, because the time that I eat, time I can spend with you,

34
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,180
and the time I spend with patients is precious. I won't give them up.

35
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,990
I know that's what my father would've wanted.

36
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,540
How do you know that's what your father wanted?

37
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,000
Because other than the exception, all parents want their children to be happy.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,260
Revenge, ruining people, fighting back is not something I'm going to do.

39
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,460
Even when doing things that I love today, time is precious.

40
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,280
Because there is no tomorrow for me.

41
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,510
Please leave.

42
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:39,010
I hope we never have to talk about this kind of thing ever again.

43
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,320
We keep talking about our different situations.

44
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,880
I think it would be good to stop.

45
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,020
- Why isn't he waking up yet?
- I know, right?

46
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,610
- Is he awake?
- Not yet.

47
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,290
I guess he's catching up on all the sleep he missed out on.

48
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,190
He's awake!

49
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,460
Kang Soo! Can you see us?

50
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,570
The voice sounds like it's the chief...

51
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,350
You can't see?

52
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,960
Director, the color of your necktie looks awesome.

53
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,640
This punk. You really scared the crap out of me!

54
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,830
He's probably more freaked out by the sound of your voice. Does your head not hurt?

55
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,680
- Yes, I'm okay.
- Then it's fine.

56
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,020
- Notify Professor Hong Ji Hong.
- Yes.

57
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,440
The director is so cool. "It's fine, then."

58
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,680
Our Kang Soo is sleeping again.

59
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,570
We should leave too.

60
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,260
Even if you pursue a suit for this case, because the statute of limitations is over, it will be difficult.

61
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,680
I made a mistake. However, I tried my best,

62
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
so I shouldn't have to be punished to your liking.

63
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,890
I'll apologize, because mistakes are still wrongdoings.

64
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,360
In the future I don't want to see you ruin your life because you're dragged into this mess.

65
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,730
Deputy Director.

66
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,930
You're already finished making your rounds, Director?

67
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,500
Yes. We'll be going together.

68
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,820
I'm convincing the shareholders right now. Half have come over to our side.

69
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,680
It won't be enough with half. I'm also trying to convince them as well.

70
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,890
At the next shareholder's meeting, I'll make sure to pass the Geriatric Wellness Center.

71
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,550
What are you going to do with Ji Hong? Are you still planning on taking him with you?

72
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,150
I guess you have no choice but to do so.

73
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,600
All the shareholders are leaning towards him because of Doo Shik.

74
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,940
And on top of that, there's no dirt on him.

75
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,500
If we want to get dirt on him, there's something we can do.

76
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,320
- What is it?
- I'll tell you later.

77
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,890
Father, you should continue to convince the shareholders.

78
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,800
We have to get a third of them on our side.

79
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,040
Who's Professor Kim Tae Ho meeting up with lately?

80
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,160
He's continuing to meet up with the MH Medi Tech Team.

81
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,260
- What about Professor Hong Ji Hong?
- Hospital, dating, and Professor Kim Tae Ho.

82
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,690
Fellow Yoo Hye Jeong

83
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,670
- Hello?
- Hello, this is Yoo Hye Jeong.

84
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,210
- What's the matter?
- I want to meet you in person.

85
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,290
I thought we finished our conversation.

86
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,030
I have a new story to tell.

87
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,180
When are you free?

88
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,330
Hey, what's up with your clothes? Hurry up and change so we can go together.

89
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,380
No thanks. Go with Doctor Hong.

90
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,500
Just give me some coffee.

91
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,240
I don't mess with Ji Hong lately because he's so serious about Doctor Yoo.

92
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,250
His focus is all on her.

93
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,530
Why is it so serious?

94
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,110
Doctor Yoo's been continuously looking into her grandmother's medical accident case.

95
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,470
I guess she's onto something. She brought me the anesthesiology records and asked me for my opinion.

96
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:44,840
Then when you told me last time, "We have something to talk about." That was about the medical accident case?

97
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,140
You remember that?

98
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,330
Of course I remember that. All of my focus is on that woman.

99
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,410
Just keep it in mind, but don't act on it.

100
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,430
And if I can't do that?

101
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,370
Even though I can't stop you, I won't be on your side.

102
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,120
Who's the director who caused the medical accident?

103
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,280
Director Jin Myeong Hoon. He's very close with our family.

104
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,320
Don't butt in.

105
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,580
Yes?

106
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,930
Professor Jeong Yoon Do is here.

107
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,410
Come on in. Have a seat.

108
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,220
What's going on? You're in my office, of all places.

109
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,940
The offer that you mentioned before, about being on the hospital board. Is that still valid?

110
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,810
- You're always welcome.
- Thank you.

111
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,650
So, let's meet at the next shareholders meeting. The topic will be the Geriatric Wellness Center.

112
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,190
All you have to do is cast a vote for yes.

113
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,760
Please don't come see me again for this issue.

114
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,890
It would be even better if you never came back to the hospital.

115
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,540
Neurology Doctor Jeong Yoon Do

116
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,680
Yes, Doctor?

117
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,850
What are you doing? Never mind, let me try to guess.

118
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,450
- You just worked out, right?
- Yes.

119
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:24,060
I have something to tell you. Let's meet up. I'll come to you. Where would be good?

120
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,210
You don't have to come to me. I'm going to the hospital later. And I have to see Kang Soo anyway.

121
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,740
Okay, then.

122
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,070
Kang Soo, how are you?

123
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,380
My head hurts a bit, but it's nothing.

124
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,220
You give me the briefing.

125
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,910
Twenty-seven-year-old male patient. Mentally alert.

126
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,260
Aside from the onset of pain due to surgery,

127
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:04,400
the feeling, reaction time of the upper half of the body is all completely normal.

128
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,030
In terms of right side motor coordination,

129
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,140
I feel that there is a slight temperature drop.

130
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,820
Let me see.

131
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,200
Lift it up.

132
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,460
Put it down. Again.

133
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,460
Alright, let's see the other hand.

134
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,070
Lift it up.

135
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,960
Put it down. Do it again.

136
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,940
Alright.

137
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,040
There's nothing wrong.

138
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,830
Then can I be a surgeon again?

139
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,450
You can.

140
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,970
Thank you.

141
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,290
Wow, your whole face is lit up.

142
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,260
Although you can't at this time, we'll monitor progress while putting you on anti-convulsants.

143
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,510
If there are no further abnormalities, you can rest for a semester and come back.

144
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,780
You want me to rest?

145
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,300
Yes.

146
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,630
Transfer him to the patient ward.

147
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:09,000
Administer ceftriaxone for one more day. As for anticonvulsant, prescribe Levetiracetam 500mg twice daily.

148
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,590
- Rest up.
- I'll see you later.

149
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,140
Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit

150
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,130
But Kang Soo...

151
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,050
What about him?

152
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,420
There's nowhere for him to go. When he started residency, he said he didn't get a place.

153
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,330
His brother's in the army too. Since he didn't need it.

154
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,930
Oh great minds think alike. I was about to visit you, Prof.

155
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:44,680
We found out who leaked the director's stock ownership in the medical care company.

156
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,030
I had anticipated as much, but I was doubtful.

157
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,350
How can he throw the hospital into danger just for his own success?

158
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,680
He's basically someone who will do anything if it'll benefit him.

159
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,520
According to the reporter that I spoke with,

160
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,110
he said it was clearly obvious that he intended to turn public opinion against Director Hong.

161
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,830
Between Father and Chairman Jin Seong Jong,

162
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,620
I think there was some incident before Father died.

163
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,920
I felt suspicious, so I kept investigating. Would you please have a look?

164
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,670
If you estimate how long the chairman stayed at the VIP patient ward, it's about 20 minutes.

165
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,290
And?

166
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:39,130
If you calculate the time that father had collapsed and lay neglected,

167
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,910
I think he collapsed immediately after the chairman came out.

168
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,030
Director Jin said he would back down.

169
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,990
He's not one to volunteer to step down.

170
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,850
I think Professor had held those two people's weaknesses.

171
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,250
What could it be?

172
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,280
Well in terms of weak links, there are tons. The question is which is the most fatal.

173
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,000
Which one do you think it may be?

174
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,960
The subcontractors that manage the hospital on-site amenities and facilities are Director Jin's companies.

175
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,840
What about them?

176
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,810
Do you think that the profits from the on-site facilities actually go back to the hospital?

177
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,330
Some amount probably goes into Director Jin's pockets. That's embezzlement.

178
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,750
Well that's not something out of the ordinary.

179
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,270
Could that be a fatal weakness?

180
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,970
I'll start by investigating that.

181
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,260
Oh and about Kang Soo.

182
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,600
What about Kang Soo?

183
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,140
The kid says he doesn't have a place to return to.

184
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,000
Haeng-nim!
(Gyeongsang Province dialect for Hyung)

185
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,720
Ah, stop it's gross.

186
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,590
Let me hug you.

187
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,770
I thought I was going to suffocate to death.

188
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,750
They said that I can only visit the ICU twice a day.

189
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,550
They only give me 30 minutes too.

190
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,270
Is that so?

191
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,470
Did you eat?

192
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,310
No, I didn't eat. I thought we could eat together.

193
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,950
I'm going to steal all your food, Hyung-nim.

194
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,170
Sure. You stuff yourself with it all, you pig.

195
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,610
Director's Office

196
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,600
Yes.

197
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,560
Take a seat.

198
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,110
Let's hear what you have to say first.

199
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,610
I kept looking into it after speaking with you.

200
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:38,350
I found a way to address my grievances about Grandmother's incident through the law.

201
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,380
You found one?

202
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,160
There were none. So I found another method.

203
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,740
I'm going to kill you.

204
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,820
Since I cannot kill you directly, I'm going to wring you out dry.

205
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,500
I will not let you alone for a single moment. I will stand by and watch.

206
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,360
Observe. You'll just encounter more things to be irritated about.

207
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,020
Then every time there is a slip up, I will bother you.

208
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,540
Why am I warning you in advance?

209
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,680
I'm not one to hide. I like to reveal things in the open.

210
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,320
Well even so, it's over if I fire you.

211
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,390
Fire me. Then I'll go with the law which you seem to love very much.

212
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,490
For firing without appropriate circumstance, I will file a injunction against you.

213
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,680
I became sort of famous thanks to you, Director.

214
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,490
People seem to have the idea that we're on good terms.

215
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,050
Don't you think that it would be a bit damaging to you?

216
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:39,980
When I complete the suspension, I'm going to continue to come to work. I'm planning on remaining at this hospital until the very end.

217
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:46,390
I'm going to watch you slowly crumble, Director.

218
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,540
Are you threatening me?

219
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,940
Yes.

220
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,960
I'm scared.

221
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,040
That's fortunate. I wanted to scare you even more.

222
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,730
Look forward to it.

223
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,430
Chairman Choi Tae Jin

224
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,850
Yes, Chairman.

225
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,590
Why is that only our Dr. Yoo has to face disciplinary action. It was Dr. Jin who didn't pick up the call.

226
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,710
- She's the daughter of the director.
- That's what I'm saying.

227
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,590
We dirt spoons cry.
(Dirt spoons - of low socioeconomic status).

228
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,700
You were here, Doc?

229
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,260
Yes.

230
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,830
She must not have heard us.

231
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,240
If she did, she wouldn't have just stayed still, right?

232
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,460
Yeong Gook!

233
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,980
Yes?

234
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,000
What is it?

235
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,280
I have something I want to ask. Do people talk bad about me?

236
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,160
- Why? Did someone say so?
- No.

237
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,980
People don't like you much because of the disciplinary probation.

238
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,340
You're the director's daughter after all.

239
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,380
Doesn't Director like Dr. Yoo?

240
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,790
Why did he suddenly shift gears?

241
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,260
Yes.

242
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,890
My daughter's here! I didn't even call for you.

243
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,910
I came because there's something I'm curious about.

244
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,770
What is it?

245
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,150
Why did you take disciplinary action against Hye Jeong? Don't you like her?

246
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,030
I acted according to hospital regulations. One should make a distinction between private and public matters.

247
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,290
You told me to participate in hospital management.

248
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:25,070
If you are excluding me from such low level matters, then how are you going to be able to tell me important things in the future?

249
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,720
It is quite high level. Not low key at all.

250
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,050
I don't understand what you're saying.

251
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,980
Either way I'm glad that you've taken an interest in hospital matters.

252
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,730
Let's start it like this.

253
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,520
Mom

254
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,660
Yes, Mom?

255
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,180
You're going to go on a blind date this Saturday. Don't make any prior engagements.

256
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,310
Mom!

257
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,100
Don't call me like that.

258
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,690
You're the kind of kid where I have to be your guide in order for you to make progress in your life.

259
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,910
When was I?

260
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,950
Who's the one that got you to where you are today?

261
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:01,820
It's me. If I leave things to you, I don't think you'll be able to get married until you're 40.

262
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,630
She told you to go on a blind date, right? She should've been proactive earlier.

263
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,430
Finally your mother's taking the reins.

264
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,190
What brings you here?

265
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,650
I just stopped by after meeting the Director. This is my office too.

266
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,790
You met my father? Why?

267
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,100
Because we had something to talk about.

268
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,860
What is that "something"?

269
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,050
I don't want to explain everything to you.

270
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,880
- You moved Kang Soo to a patient room, right?
- Yes.

271
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,230
Let's go.

272
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,160
Doctor Yoo!

273
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,510
- You came Doctor Yoo.
- Yes.

274
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,100
I missed you.

275
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,180
What is this? You're glad to see me? I guess I've lived long enough.

276
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,420
- Did you come to see Kang Soo?
- Yes.

277
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,520
We're going to go see Kang Soo right now. Let's go together.

278
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,490
- Let's go.
- Yes.

279
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,610
He's sleeping.

280
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,520
I guess he is.

281
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,200
You startled me!

282
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,220
I'm not sleeping.

283
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,240
You heard everything?

284
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,520
I heard everything.

285
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,460
Are you okay? You ignored me and received the surgery from Professor Hong Ji Hong.

286
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,890
I'm sorry.

287
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,740
I'm really sorry to you too, Doctor Yoo. You received disciplinary action because of me.

288
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,990
Is your body okay?

289
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,420
It hurts at the level of a patient who got surgery.

290
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,620
You talk well.

291
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,900
I have to at least talk well. I'm unemployed now.

292
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,900
I can't do anything that requires strength. I'm thinking of looking into an academy.

293
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,700
I'm quite good at this.

294
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,130
You got better.

295
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,950
Does it show?

296
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:05,610
Doctor Yoo! Spare me some of your time.

297
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,930
What is it you have to tell me?

298
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,260
I met the director earlier.

299
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,460
He offered me a position on the board, and I accepted today.

300
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,700
Why?

301
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,050
To help you Doctor Yoo.

302
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,840
Help me with what?

303
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,650
Why you rejected a staff position in the hospital in your region and why you came to this hospital,

304
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,100
I heard all about it.

305
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,260
Don't you think my actions are irresponsible? They're not realistic.

306
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,190
That's your charm. You're keeping that charm alive, you're doing well.

307
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:54,010
Hurry and eat. I need to go. I have an outpatient waiting on me.

308
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:05,540
Director, at this board meeting, about the proposal to increase the social welfare budget

309
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,580
Please give me one vote.

310
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,960
Since you're asking me so directly, I can't refuse.

311
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,620
Thank you.

312
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,840
Director Jin Myeong Hoon

313
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,870
Yes, Director.

314
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,910
Let's meet.

315
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,460
I'm a bit busy right now.

316
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,560
Then forget about it... This is about fellow Yoo Hye Jeong.

317
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,440
You must be busy

318
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,440
pretending to be a doctor, dating, pretending to be a board member.

319
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,840
It's all thanks to you.

320
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,100
- About Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong...
- Yes?

321
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,580
She came to me saying that she would kill me.

322
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,120
Isn't it understandable that she would be that mad over your attitude?

323
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,090
Don't you think being ungrateful has its limits? Thanks to who is she able to earn a living,

324
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,150
and thanks to who did she earn fame? Yet she decides to attack me?

325
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,890
Your words are a little harsh.

326
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,360
I'm going to kill you.

327
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,500
Are you threatening me?

328
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,660
Yes.

329
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,220
- I'm scared.
- That's a relief.

330
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,650
I want to scare you more.

331
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,610
Look forward to it.

332
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,090
I'm going to sue her for threatening me.

333
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:44,600
Criminal threatening won't be valid in this case. She only said so since she was angry without taking any action.,

334
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,910
Professor Hong, this is why a person's past is important.

335
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,820
Depending on the person who said the words, the weight of the words change.

336
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,620
Please don't go in circles and tell me directly.

337
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,530
She was quite something in high school. She caused a fire, injured someone and was expelled.

338
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,640
She also had to transfer schools multiple times after fighting. Wow, she's awesome.

339
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,520
I really like that type of person.

340
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,440
What do you want from me?

341
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,700
Since you were busy all this time, take a break. Focus on the DBS (deep brain stimulation) Dopamine Sensor research.

342
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,820
Live as a researcher, not a doctor.

343
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,450
What if I say I can't do that.

344
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,540
Fellow Yoo Hye Jeong won't be able to continue in this medical field.

345
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,450
Isn't it difficult to open a private neurosurgery practice?

346
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,320
Doctor.

347
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,270
Are you coming back from Soon Hee's?

348
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,910
Yes, I helped her with something. What brings you here?

349
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,030
I'm upset to hear those words.

350
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:06,030
- Upset to hear what?
- We're in a relationship where it's acceptable for either of us to come over abruptly.

351
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,060
You're right. Aren't you mad at me?

352
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,320
What about you? Are you not mad?

353
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,580
I'm mad. I'm still not over that anger.

354
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,030
I like your honesty.

355
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,280
I was mad before, but now I'm not.

356
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,490
- Why?
- Just because.

357
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:30,190
When someone says "just because", they usually have a huge meaning behind it. What is it?

358
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,900
You met the hospital director today, didn't you?

359
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,340
How do you know that? Are you going to scold me again?

360
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,640
I'm not going to scold you. You did well.

361
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,060
Are you still mad?

362
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,710
Yes, because I was so upset.

363
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,030
Hye Jeong.

364
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,290
When did you wash your hair?

365
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,060
- Does it smell?
- Yes.

366
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,360
Oh no! But I washed it today.

367
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,510
So that's why it smelled good.

368
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,030
What is this? Why are you teasing me?

369
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,370
So you can laugh. You aren't smiling these days.

370
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,560
You're acting suspicious. I think something happened.

371
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,620
Something did. I am leaving to serve as the Center Chief for the DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) Research Center.

372
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,330
Then will anything change?

373
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:35,120
I can't see patients anymore.

374
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,390
- I don't like that.
- I don't like it either.

375
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,250
Then why are you doing it? By any chance...

376
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:47,570
Do you know about that? You really hate it but at the same time, you really want to do it.

377
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,550
I hate complicated things like that.

378
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,960
If I want to do it, I do it. If I don't want to, I don't.

379
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,990
I'll go inside now.

380
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,720
You're still mad. You hold grudges for a long time, don't you?

381
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,650
I felt as if I didn't come to see you by tonight,

382
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,270
you would never see me again.

383
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,610
I'm sorry.

384
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,830
For what?

385
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,430
For not being able to treat you well.

386
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:50,210
That's not right. You're doing really well right now.

387
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,120
Doing what well?

388
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,990
Remember that time my father said you were doing well just sitting right beside me? You're sitting beside me now, right?

389
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,800
I want to see the vice-president.

390
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,840
Me too,

391
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,890
but isn't the term, "vice-president" not fitting anymore?

392
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,480
-Father-in-law?
-Mm.

393
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,250
Yeah, father-in-law.

394
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,450
We should have called him that when he was still alive.

395
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,990
You were good at everything, but you couldn't do that.

396
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,640
You still call my grandma "Granny", so what?

397
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,480
Look at you. Just a few minutes ago, you apologized but you don't want to lose.

398
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,350
Sorry.

399
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,550
I'm also sorry.

400
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,440
For what?

401
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,120
Because you're not happy. Because I said I love you, but I can't make you happy.

402
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,890
That's not right.

403
00:29:53,890 --> 00:30:00,950
It's because of my nature. I've never been happy, so when I am happy, I tend to look for misery.

404
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,800
Can you not overcome that?

405
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,180
I don't know.

406
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,120
For now, won't an answer come out if we get to the end of this issue?

407
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,850
Don't forget that I'm right beside you.

408
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,170
♫  I'm here with you ♫

409
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,750
♫ For me you've become a cloud  ♫

410
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,470
♫ You come down into my love  ♫

411
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:39,920
♫  For only you my feeling can grow so that  ♫

412
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,520
♫  your warm touch ♫

413
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,460
♫  The melody of just the two of us ♫

414
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:52,250
♫  The dream which everything will be made into ♫

415
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:12,760
Doctor, she has a fever. Her entire body is hot.

416
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,830
Oh here.

417
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,580
39 degrees Celsius.

418
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,950
It's quite high.

419
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,050
It might not be good for the fetus, so rather than fever reducers, use cold saline or cooling pads.

420
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,360
Yes.

421
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,420
Don't worry too much. We can just lower her body temperature.

422
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,350
Could I place cooling pads on her?

423
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,740
Yes.

424
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,660
Neurosurgery Kang Gyeong Joon

425
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,740
Yes, what is it?

426
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,980
Patient Lee Hyeong's guardian wants to speak to you.

427
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,120
Put him on.

428
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,820
Hello?

429
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,560
Hello, this is Yoo Hye Jeong. I'm sorry,

430
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,680
due to a personal issue, I wasn't able to go to the hospital. I wasn't able to do my best.

431
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,910
I want to take my wife off the ventilator.

432
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:34,880
Neurosurgery ICU

433
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,760
Mr. Kim Woo Jin.

434
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,390
I...

435
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:52,740
I said I loved my wife more than anyone else,

436
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,290
but I'm the one who's giving her the most pain right now.

437
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,080
Her face has become so swollen and coarse that I cannot find any trace of her former appearance.

438
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,120
I guess I'm really selfish.

439
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,550
If you were selfish, you wouldn't have come this far.

440
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,820
I want to give everything up.

441
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:20,610
I want to let everything go and allow her to rest in the ground.

442
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:27,130
If you give up now, then everything the mother did all of this time to save the child will be for nothing.

443
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,900
Won't she resent me?

444
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:38,540
The reason your wife is still enduring is because she loves you both, you and her child.

445
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,250
As her husband, you have to hang on too.

446
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,840
If you're going to hang on, then I will too.

447
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,780
I love you, Hyeong.

448
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,440
Hyung.

449
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,460
What is this?

450
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,990
Use it for your hospital fees.

451
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,620
You crazy bastard, have you really lost your mind?

452
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:40,000
What's wrong? I didn't even go to the PX (postal exchange, the grocery on base) and saved up one penny at a time.

453
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,310
Use it for yourself punk! I gave this to you to use as your allowance. What is this nonsense?

454
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,940
Why are you acting like this, seriously?!

455
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,360
I want to do something for you too!

456
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,760
Yeong Soo,

457
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,330
if you want to do something, can't you do something more productive?

458
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,070
Go take this back. Go buy things at the PX and eat the things you want.

459
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,970
Hey Monsoon Beast! (brother's a marine)

460
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,940
Your haeng-nim's a doctor! I only have to pay half of the hospital fees.

461
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,540
and my salary's 40 million won. I'm a bit high rolling you know?

462
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,290
I know.

463
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,320
We have to find a house. You said that you won't be able to become a doctor for a while.

464
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,220
Don't worry about useless things and just stuff your face with whatever you want to eat!

465
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,390
I got it, I got it! This is nice, I don't have to spend my money on you.

466
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,970
Haeng.

467
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,490
What?

468
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:40,920
Don't be in pain. I was really worried.

469
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,820
Hey, what's there for you to be worried about?

470
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,950
Am I someone who loses?

471
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,720
No.

472
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,210
Salute!

473
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,820
Salute.

474
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
I'm going.

475
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,670
I'll send you off.

476
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,020
Director.

477
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,700
Oh, Choi Kang Soo. I came to see you but was on my way out because you weren't in.

478
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,320
I'm on my way back from sending my younger brother off.

479
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,940
What are you going to do after you're discharged?

480
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,220
I don't know yet.

481
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,510
Do you have any thoughts of being hired by neurosurgery?

482
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,080
What? As what?

483
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,250
As a secretary to the administrative station.

484
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:34,010
Well the person said they're quitting due to personal matters. For you, continuing residency at present is difficult.

485
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,970
While working for the next six months to a year you can focus on your recovery,

486
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,560
then you can go back to your residency.

487
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,040
Thank you.

488
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,880
Thank you for what?

489
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,190
Do well.

490
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,940
Director.

491
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,940
Take care of yourself well, you rascal.

492
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,440
Thank you.

493
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,550
Hong Ji Hong

494
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,010
Hey, Ji Hong.

495
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,040
Neurosurgery
Hong Ji Hong

496
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,780
I heard; what just happened?

497
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,630
I'm sorry to you.

498
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,580
Hey, at least let me know the reason.

499
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:29,470
Does it make sense that you'll no longer be a surgeon, but become the head of the research team? For a kid like you?

500
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,450
I'm just... thinking of it as a little break.

501
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,470
Do you think you can live being away from patients? Even if it's just for a short time?

502
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,810
It's just for a short time, Prof.

503
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,900
Did you look into Director Jin's embezzlement of the contracting fees?

504
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,410
We can reveal his real estate property holdings and personal assets.

505
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:54,890
If we look into it in detail, we should be able to find out what he does with his under-the-table earned money.

506
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:58,690
Well if the earnings are for at least ten years or longer, then the amount accumulated in the slush funds will be enormous.

507
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:03,210
If that's so, then it seems big enough for Chairman Jin to have been fearful

508
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,550
if Professor had wielded such a card.

509
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,530
There's a high possibility. Let's investigate.

510
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,220
I got it.

511
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,320
Are you not going to attend the board meetings either?

512
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,150
No, of course I have to attend.

513
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,650
I have to observe the Geriatric Wellness Center fail to pass.

514
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,640
Alright then. Let's go.

515
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,520
The votes are for sure, right?

516
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,280
I'm the vice-president.

517
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,770
Oh, hello.

518
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,510
Hello.

519
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,590
Let's go inside.

520
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,800
Oh, Yoon Do!

521
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:44,130
- Hello.
- It's a good thing you came. Let's go in.

522
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,830
Yes.

523
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,190
Instead of the director, I will lead this meeting.

524
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,910
We have two topics to discuss today.

525
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:59,980
First, the building of the Geriatric Wellness Center. Second is the budget for social welfare foundation.

526
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:05,210
Since we did a thorough presentation of these two items at the last meeting, we will skip over any additional explanation.

527
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,700
Please examine the documents in front of you.

528
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,190
Let's move ahead to the vote.

529
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,460
Alright then. We'll proceed to the vote.

530
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,700
Geriatric Wellness Center vs. Social Welfare Budget

531
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,860
3 weeks later

532
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,770
After finishing early morning church services, she suddenly collapsed.

533
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,990
Yes, I'll take a look.

534
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,720
Are you okay? Was she unconscious from the start?

535
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,380
Yes.

536
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,310
Did you take a CT scan?

537
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,680
Yes, it looks like subarachnoid hemorrhaging.

538
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,170
What about her guardian?

539
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,410
We contacted them. They said they would come to the hospital.

540
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,230
Call the anesthesia team and book an operating room.

541
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,420
Which professor should I call?

542
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,350
Doctor Hong Ji Hong doesn't do surgeries, so call Doctor Jeong Yoon Do.

543
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,230
Yes, I understand.

544
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,440
How is the progress on the building of the geriatric wellness center?

545
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,060
The hospital management team is working on drafting a detailed budget.

546
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,660
Oh, Professor Hong.

547
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,670
Have you been well?

548
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,320
Are things going well? What about the research?

549
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,350
So so. Then, goodbye.

550
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,640
You've accumulated the money that you need already, right?

551
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,180
I will go over the construction plan presentations and start the bidding.

552
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,330
I also planned for additional staff, so we should be able to proceed quickly.

553
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,350
Alright.

554
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,480
They're so confident.

555
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Because they won.

556
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,460
I gathered the evidence.

557
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:56,520
It's the profits that weren't transferred to the hospital from last month's rent collected from the onsite facilities.

558
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,130
The tenants did pay the managing company,

559
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,930
but the managing company didn't deposit to the hospital.

560
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,500
How much is it?

561
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,840
500 million won, as of last year.

562
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,040
Five-hundred million...500 million won is too small of an amount to indict the vice-president.

563
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,790
It is small enough for him to be able to maneuver out of.

564
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,840
How much is it?

565
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,060
Ten-billion won.

566
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,250
It is big. Is Ji Hong's DBS sensor really all that?

567
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,150
Well if it is completed, it should be alright.

568
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:27,470
But, why aren't you letting him operate? Why don't you completely revoke his rights as a chairman.

569
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,730
Father, don't you know anything about a surgeon?

570
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,250
They hate just taking care of things from the sidelines because they want to be onsite.

571
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,270
Watch what happens if Hong Ji Hong continues to receive patients and performs surgery.

572
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,380
In a few years, we won't even be able to put up a fight against him.

573
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:43,820
About the expenses involved in building the geriatric wellness center,

574
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:48,550
can't we make a workaround with the investment that Ji Hong had secured?

575
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,770
It seems that they are creating a workaround from the rent money.

576
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,450
Since when did the hospital have such an increased profit in tenant fees?

577
00:41:54,450 --> 00:42:01,470
It's been quite a while because it's been over 20 years since a funeral home was established in the hospital.

578
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:08,230
I...can't stop thinking about the fact that my father had a record of his slush funds.

579
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,930
Let's reorganize our thoughts.

580
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:14,710
Director Jin first attacked Professor. He had the hospital acquire stocks and also started a tax audit on the hospital.

581
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,680
Then the forced resignation at the board meeting.

582
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,580
Then he resigned by himself. His attack worked.

583
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:27,180
That means that there is no other weapon more potent than that.

584
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:32,540
What kind of argument did they have for 20 minutes? Did he take the slush fund from him?

585
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,030
That was the thing that made Director Jin resign.

586
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:38,090
Then couldn't it be that Director Jin found all the evidence and mounted a counterattack?

587
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,610
It seems like the most logical hypothesis.

588
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:47,610
But Ji Hong, we know him well.

589
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,410
Of course we do.

590
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,840
- There's more.
- There's more.

591
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,420
There's definitely more evidence.

592
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,440
There's no way he would have just made one copy. If you were him, would you only make one copy?

593
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,900
Of course not. I would have made multiple copies and spread them out.

594
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,520
Search for it. It's definitely near you.

595
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,020
Yes, please look around you as well.

596
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:16,500
If we can just find evidence of the slush fund, this tiresome fight will come to an end.

597
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,440
I told you to come to my office. Why did you ask to meet me here?

598
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,760
You said that you were with the vice-president. I only wanted to meet with you.

599
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,140
Why? To apologize?

600
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,390
I asked you to come to the board meeting and give me some power

601
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,680
but you threw your vote in favor of Professor Hong?

602
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,820
It is my principle to vote according to my beliefs.

603
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:45,020
If it bothered you, Director, I'd like to apologize.

604
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,130
It's fine. Even if you do that, only 1/3 of the Board members are on his side.

605
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,900
Do you like standing on the losing side? Your father wasn't like that.

606
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:57,400
I like winning as well so I looked into this.

607
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,210
What is this?

608
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:02,710
It's the earnings report from our hospital subcontractors.

609
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:05,200
- It was a bit different than what was reported.
- What?

610
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,880
I won't be able to do anything big with this, but I'm sure I'll be able to put you in some danger.

611
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,090
Hey, Jeong Yoon Do!

612
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,960
Let Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong off the hook,

613
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,230
then I will take my hands off as well.

614
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,100
Patient Hong Seong Tae was transferred to the inpatient ward right?

615
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,080
Yes as soon as he was intubated he was brought upstairs.

616
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:38,680
Doctor! You bought ours too, right?

617
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,290
Of course I did!

618
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:42,300
You should have brought some snacks while you were at it.

619
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,330
Of course, I brought that as well.

620
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,590
Wow, you're amazing.

621
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,980
You were born to be a secretary, you were born to be one.

622
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,800
You must be lucky to be born with a lot of things.

623
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,680
- Doctor!
- You're back!

624
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,380
- Shouldn't she eat some tofu?
- Doctor...

625
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,040
Did I come out from jail?

626
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,740
I'm sorry.

627
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,070
Gyeong Joon, is the subarachnoid hemorrhage patient okay?

628
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,450
Patient Oh Chang Shik? He's fine.

629
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,030
That's a relief.

630
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,180
Your hair grew a lot.

631
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,290
I can even get a perm.

632
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:15,150
Hey, you look like a chestnut burr.

633
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,050
It's cute.

634
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,560
Have you been well?

635
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,120
Yeah.

636
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,020
Yes, Dad.

637
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,900
I'm going to eat lunch with your grandfather. Come with us.

638
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,830
I can't go. I have to get ready for a surgery.

639
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:16,260
You know...

640
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,270
- Did something happen between you and my dad?
- Why are you asking that?

641
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,760
It's weird. My dad liked you,

642
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,280
but suddenly his attitude changed and he took severe disciplinary action against you.

643
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,960
Ask your dad about it.

644
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,030
I asked, but it seems as if he's avoiding my questions.

645
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:40,180
- What?
- If I hurt you, do you think it'll hurt your dad?

646
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,200
Do you want to hurt my dad?

647
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:49,040
I'm sorry. It's a matter that doesn't concern you.

648
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,370
If you hurt me, then it's possible that you'll hurt my parents even more.

649
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:55,570
Tell me what happened between you two.

650
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,820
You know, when I look at you...

651
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,520
I think of the times when we played after our midterms.

652
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:12,510
Back then, I would have never imagined becoming a doctor.

653
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:33,150
♫  This moment, I cannot believe it. ♫

654
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:37,830
♫  one by one blooming slowly ♫

655
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:40,450
Oh, these flowers are so pretty!

656
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,120
Careful, careful.

657
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:44,950
Did you do well on the test?

658
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:47,310
I don't know. I've never done well on a test.

659
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:51,750
I'm a PWGM, a person who gave up on math.

660
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,480
Ugh, seriously! Seo Woo, how are you so good at math?

661
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,000
Because I try hard; you don't!

662
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,490
Effort won't betray you.

663
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:07,570
You're saying the same things as my dad.

664
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:13,960
Ah, really. I wish I could graduate high school and just get married.

665
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,080
I'm going to have just one child.

666
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,520
I'm never going to have a late child!

667
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:25,480
But between the three of us, I think you'll be the first to get married.

668
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,590
No! I'm going to become a doctor like my dad.

669
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:34,890
Even if I get married, I have to at least graduate from medical school. Medical school lasts 6 years.

670
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,620
Hye Jeong, what are you going to become?

671
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,810
I'm... going to run the rice soup restaurant with my grandma.

672
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:47,070
Grandma's Rice Soup Joint 1 and Joint 2! I'm going to work hard to earn lots of money so I can pamper my grandma.

673
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,590
I'll run Joint 3!

674
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:52,030
Hey, me too! Let me do it, please! I'll pay for everything, please?!

675
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,390
I'll think about it.

676
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,170
I'll run Joint 4 and 5!

677
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,760
And all the latest hit items too! It's all on me!

678
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,040
Hey, what's that? I have to go to the bathroom.

679
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:11,020
♫ The past days, that made me forget it all ♫

680
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:16,400
Yeong Gook, do people dislike my dad?

681
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:22,150
Not everyone likes him, but there are a lot of people that do.

682
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:24,340
I don't want to know about those people.

683
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,270
I'm going to stop everything here.

684
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,190
Doctor.

685
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,770
- Are you not going to eat?
- I should eat.

686
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,700
Let's eat together.

687
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,430
Think about what I've done for you.

688
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:57,870
I became a board member for you.

689
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:04,070
Yet, you can't even eat with me as a friend? We're friends now, right?

690
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:05,740
Let's go.

691
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,970
Is revenge working out well?

692
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:14,990
There's no progress. The only thing I can apparently do right now is continue working here.

693
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:18,190
Good job. Let's go eat now.

694
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,240
Yoon Do!

695
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,200
Where are you headed?

696
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,610
We're going to eat. What about you?

697
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:38,190
Us too.

698
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,940
But, why are you two together?

699
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:47,250
We're comrades in the Neurosurgery Department. Then, we'll leave now.

700
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:56,500
The fellow that was disciplined is back to work now. I like her because she's strong.

701
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,820
Such a rotten punk. I need to kick her out somehow.

702
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:03,290
If it weren't for her, Father— I should've kicked her out already.

703
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:06,580
You must be experiencing a lot of stress.

704
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:10,160
What are you ranting about? What are you uneasy about?

705
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,490
Who's uneasy?

706
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:14,910
Your actions show that you're uneasy, as if you're being chased by someone.

707
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:18,830
- When did I (act like that)?
- It appears that way. There's no need for that.

708
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:21,170
This is your world now.

709
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:25,010
Let's go, come on.

710
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,050
It's not here.

711
00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:00,380
I'm going to kill you.

712
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,820
When my suspension ends, I'm going to come back

713
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,770
and I'm going to remain until the end at this hospital.

714
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:12,170
I'm going to watch you slowly fall right here.

715
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,850
Welcome.

716
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:27,410
Take a seat.

717
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:36,290
Operating Room

718
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,510
Soon Hee

719
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:47,610
Oh. What's going on for you to be calling me?

720
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,160
I have something to ask you.

721
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,270
What?

722
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:55,260
If you ever thought of me as a friend, you can't lie right now.

723
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:01,140
You really came back to work. I never thought that you would return.

724
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,930
I keep my word.

725
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:07,120
How can you live while keeping every single word? Words are just thoughts you say without thinking.

726
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,940
Because you and I are different.

727
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,730
Do you really want to earn your living under someone who's so different from you?

728
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:17,020
When I was temporarily locked up in the holding cell...

729
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:21,210
You'll know what kind of place that was since you did a background check on me.

730
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:24,390
When I was locked up, my grandma packed me some food and came to visit.

731
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:27,880
I told her I couldn't eat the food because I didn't have a right to

732
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,590
and she replied, "What right do you need to to eat food?

733
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:34,020
You eat if you're alive."

734
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:39,150
I think that I earn my living because I work for it,

735
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:42,020
not because someone else works for my living.

736
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:47,270
The values I hold while I earn my living are important.

737
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:51,170
What you value is worthless to me.

738
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:54,110
You're not ordinary, are you?

739
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:58,720
You might've been able to come this far because of that, but do you think you're something great?

740
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,930
Do you think I'm letting you off the hook because you're so great?

741
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:03,140
Don't cross the line.

742
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,100
Isn't that how we'll be able to have a proper conversation?

743
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:13,270
Do you know why Professor Hong went to the DBS Research Center as Center Chief?

744
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,960
It's because of you, Fellow Yoo Hye Jeong.

745
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:22,260
Your past, your present.

746
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,760
Everything will only become a stumbling block for Professor Hong.

747
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:33,750
Do you know who took the responsibility for all of your rude actions towards me?

748
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:37,650
Professor Hong Ji Hong.

749
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,260
Leave.

750
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:45,610
Don't be a hindrance to others.

751
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,580
That's what you want, isn't it?

752
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,570
You want me to leave, don't you?

753
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,880
That's why I won't leave.

754
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,070
I already told you that I keep my word.

755
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,230
Father.

756
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,320
Slush Fund Records

757
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,340
Current Assessment of Profits from Facilities Rent at Guk Il Medical Center

758
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,270
2015 Current Assessment of Profits from Facilities Rent at Guk Il Medical Center

759
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:10,380
Past ten years gross total of tenant fees: 23 billion 983 million 700 thousand 
Past 10 years JJ Medicom's Deposit Difference: 5 billion 16 million 180 thousand won

760
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,950
- Who is it?
- Me, Hye Jeong.

761
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:27,150
Come on in.

762
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:32,380
We must be connected in heart and soul. I really wanted to see you.

763
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,640
This is cheating.

764
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,750
What is?

765
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:42,670
This is really cheating.

766
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:44,330
Why why, what is it?

767
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,650
Why can't I be of any help to you?

768
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,090
Why am I only harming you?

769
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:53,330
What did Director Jin say for you to have transferred to the research center?

770
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:54,590
Why didn't you tell me?

771
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:58,690
Just how many questions do you have? Do I have to answer them all right now?

772
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,700
I'm embarrassed​. I feel like a loser.

773
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,900
I want to be confident...

774
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:12,210
In times like these, this is what you taught me to do.

775
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,880
Grasp both your arms.

776
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,330
Wrap them around my waist.

777
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:35,340
♬ You are my entire life, you are the reason I live ♬

778
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:40,980
♬ It's an unexplainable miracle ♬

779
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:50,330
♬ If love is needing my comfort ♬

780
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:54,740

Justice flows like a river in a place that cannot be seen.

♫ never expected we would be in love I miss you ♫
