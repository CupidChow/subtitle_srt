1
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:26,757
You got more cool!

2
00:00:26,757 --> 00:00:29,737
- Episode 8 - 
You're growing facial hair. You look like Wolverine! Wolverine!

3
00:00:29,737 --> 00:00:31,667
Wolverine isn't it.

4
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:35,277
The thing I envy most when a man and a woman are in love is

5
00:00:35,277 --> 00:00:39,007
meeting someone who can bring out playful feelings.

6
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:42,947
This is some kind of sign of manhood!

7
00:00:42,947 --> 00:00:46,097
It's okay! She said he's a friend.

8
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:04,117
Playfulness in a relationship between a man and a woman is healthy.

9
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:08,727
Playfulness is the best present I can show to someone.

10
00:01:11,707 --> 00:01:13,107
Yes, Teacher.

11
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,207
Your voice is very bright.

12
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,767
I'm on my way to work with my friend.

13
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:17,587
With Soon Hee?

14
00:01:17,587 --> 00:01:20,517
No, Soo Cheol. He was a friend from when I lived however I wanted to.

15
00:01:20,517 --> 00:01:23,107
Hey! Don't go around with him.

16
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:26,467
You shouldn't tell me to not go around with a friend.

17
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:38,627
Jeez...You're a bit...

18
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:40,757
Do you like him that much?

19
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:46,867
What's wrong? What happened?

20
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:50,487
Hye Jeong! Where are you right now?

21
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,327
Call 911!

22
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:37,977
Can you recognize me?

23
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:43,747
Don't nod your head.

24
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:50,627
Can you move your arms and legs?

25
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:54,867
No... There's no strength.

26
00:02:56,887 --> 00:03:02,037
What about your fingers? Try moving your fingers.

27
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:12,957
No....

28
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:19,107
No!

29
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:32,767
- Are you okay?
- Teacher.

30
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:36,047
- What happened?
- I suspect nerve damage.

31
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:38,907
But I don't think all of the nerves are damaged

32
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:40,097
911?

33
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:41,987
We called already.

34
00:03:41,987 --> 00:03:43,407
You did well.

35
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:45,797
I kept on holding his hand.

36
00:03:45,797 --> 00:03:48,547
You did well.

37
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:52,967
You're a doctor. You can't lose it here.

38
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:56,117
If you lose it, your friend will be in danger.

39
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:09,547
We have to move him very carefully. Bring the neck brace first.

40
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:11,407
Will you help?

41
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:16,737
Be careful. One wrong move and it could be the end.

42
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:20,957
Gradually.

43
00:04:23,707 --> 00:04:26,687
Hold it. Have you got it?

44
00:04:35,257 --> 00:04:38,087
Let go slowly.

45
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:42,717
We'll let you down slowly.

46
00:04:44,177 --> 00:04:45,617
He can't breathe.

47
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:49,007
Get me the stethoscope.

48
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:08,477
He needs to go to the hospital immediately.

49
00:05:08,477 --> 00:05:11,207
If we don't stabilize his breathing within 30 minutes, it will be really dangerous.

50
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:14,867
Bring the gurney.

51
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:24,947
It is a motorbike TA (traffic accident). We're going straight to the treatment room.

52
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:34,927
The ribs are fractured. They must've punctured the lungs when they fractured.

53
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:37,757
His diaphragm could've been torn.

54
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:42,607
Blood is pooling in the lungs.

55
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,857
Prepare a 28 French chest tube.

56
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:07,057
Hold the patient, Hye Jeong.

57
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:14,787
Give me the tube.

58
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:34,377
Cut.

59
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:58,777
We've passed the critical stage. Let's take the CT right away.

60
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:12,647
Thirty-one-year-old male, the patient was involved in a motorcycle accident.

61
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:15,127
The blood pressure is being maintained above 100, and

62
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:17,727
a chest tube has restored his oxygen saturation to 90 and above.

63
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:20,957
The CT scan showed a ruptured spleen that needs to be removed through surgery.

64
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:25,237
- How is the bleeding?
- It is grade 2, but seeing that the radiocontrast agent decayed, it seemed to be active bleeding.

65
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,397
Get an operating room quickly.

66
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:31,307
The neurosurgeons will be going into surgery first.

67
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,467
- Who? Ji Hong?
- Yes.

68
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:41,017
Gyeong soo, you take an MRI of the cervical vertebrae and notify anesthesiology to prepare for surgery.

69
00:07:41,017 --> 00:07:43,567
Call and ask general surgery if they can take over immediately after us.

70
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:45,287
You don't need to check; we're here.

71
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:48,487
Your timing is killer. Come and take a look.

72
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:51,787
There isn't much bleeding.

73
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,387
However, if you spend too much time in the surgery,

74
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:56,407
excessive bleeding can occur and the blood loss will cause him to go into hypovolemic shock.

75
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:59,987
Do it quickly and pass it onto me. Quickly.

76
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:02,127
I'll go prepare for the surgery.

77
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:04,927
- Call quickly once you're finished.
-Okay.

78
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:14,897
Make your decision now. Do you want to come in or not?

79
00:08:14,897 --> 00:08:18,627
You did well so far. You don't need to do more.

80
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:22,277
If you come into the surgery and something goes wrong, it will be hard for you to bear.

81
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:26,447
If I go in and the surgery goes well, will my mind get stronger?

82
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:28,227
Your mind needs to stop getting stronger.

83
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:30,627
How can you live in this world without getting stronger?

84
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:34,087
Being weak is not bad. Being weak is okay.

85
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:37,587
I don't want to go in.

86
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:39,117
Okay.

87
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,977
Teacher Hong is going to do the surgery.

88
00:08:57,977 --> 00:09:00,277
If you do the surgery, you can ride your motorcycle again and

89
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:02,477
I don't want any other doctors.

90
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:06,447
Teacher Hong is a really good doctor.

91
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:10,227
I'm scared.

92
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:16,127
But if you do it, I won't be scared.

93
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:20,717
Because I know that you can do anything.

94
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:25,167
You're going to do it for me, right?

95
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:33,977
Doctor, the operating room is ready. They said to bring the patient up.

96
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:50,147
I'll do it. I'll be by your side.

97
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:16,587
Hong Ji Hong

98
00:10:39,277 --> 00:10:41,217
I'm going in too.

99
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:43,847
Okay.

100
00:10:57,987 --> 00:10:59,537
Yes?

101
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:03,297
What is it that you came all the way here?

102
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:06,187
I came because you ignored my calls.

103
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,787
I was looking at new surgeries.

104
00:11:09,787 --> 00:11:12,017
I was going to call you.

105
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:18,167
Did you know that Chairman Hong was in an article?

106
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:21,737
I didn't know. You're not a person to update me every day.

107
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:25,357
If he's harming Guk Il Medical Center because of that stock issue, then he should remain quiet.

108
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:28,317
Do you know how worried I was about the chairman because of that?

109
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:31,657
Director, let's not lie to each other.

110
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:35,157
Hasn't it been a while since we fought?

111
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:36,557
Let's respect each other.

112
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:38,917
Then should I be honest with you?

113
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:40,147
Just leave it be.

114
00:11:40,147 --> 00:11:43,807
The owner of this hospital is me. In any case, you're just an employee.

115
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:46,447
Isn't it enough if the owner eats well and lives well?

116
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:48,957
This is why I don't like you.

117
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:52,737
Can't you try to have some class? Do you have to be so blunt and forward?

118
00:11:52,737 --> 00:11:56,777
No matter how much you insist upon having "class," once the chairman takes a step back you're like a kite without a string.

119
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:59,557
While I was born with a golden spoon,

120
00:11:59,557 --> 00:12:02,897
let the Chairman hold a press release as often as he wants and let him go to the very end.

121
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:06,677
He has to go all the way to be completely clear on what his limitations are.

122
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:20,367
Isn't the actual owner of the medical care stocks, Guk Il Medical Center?

123
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:24,957
The medical care stocks are my personal assets. They are not related to the hospital.

124
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:28,087
I would like to sincerely apologize for cutting down our hospital's honor with this incident.

125
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:29,887
We deeply apologize.

126
00:12:29,887 --> 00:12:32,427
Using the hospital funds and making it seem like it was done by an individual,

127
00:12:32,427 --> 00:12:35,547
there's talk that it'll be absorbed back into the same hospital as a type of donation.

128
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,287
Who exactly is going around saying those kinds of things?

129
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:42,387
Do you think that I, Hong Du Sik, would be one to engage in those kinds of shameless actions?

130
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,247
As reporters, how can you be influenced

131
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:47,797
by such groundless rumors instead of the facts?!

132
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:02,697
You came?

133
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:07,647
What's the use of confessing? People will believe only what they want to believe.

134
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:13,057
There's been some evil plotting afoot. This Hong Du Sik has never messed up with this kind of calamity before.

135
00:13:13,057 --> 00:13:17,597
I will definitely expose all the falsehoods and I must change all the personnel on the board.

136
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,467
Doo Sik, why do you do whatever you want?

137
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:24,187
Shouldn't you go over it with me too? You're planning on changing the board whenever you please?

138
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:26,487
You're thinking wasn't like mine?

139
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:29,237
I'm here being framed and you're okay?

140
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:33,197
If something like this happened to you, I would have done everything to figure it out.

141
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:36,617
So, I'll do it and you can rest a little.

142
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:39,877
You're a perfectionist. You always do everything by yourself.

143
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:41,777
About Myeong Hoon,

144
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:47,067
he still hasn't given up on the nursing home, nor the health maintenance center, right?

145
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:49,527
Why are you curious about that all of a sudden?

146
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:52,687
The person who probably wants me to be in as much of a bind as possible

147
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:56,177
seems to be Myeong Hoon.

148
00:13:57,397 --> 00:14:00,907
Our Myeong Hoon isn't someone to be able to devise such underhanded methods.

149
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:04,257
He only thinks about how to help the hospital grow.

150
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:12,467
You guys can leave.

151
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:22,447
You can't underestimate Doo Sik.

152
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:25,727
I thought he'd step back if his reputation was damaged, but I was wrong.

153
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:28,337
Then we should draw blood too.

154
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:32,157
I guess my hand is forced to make that underhanded play.

155
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,227
Lee Ga Jin

156
00:14:38,197 --> 00:14:40,917
- You're not uncomfortable anywhere, right?
- No.

157
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:42,687
You can be discharged tomorrow.

158
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,067
Thank you, Doctor.

159
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:47,457
I will schedule your outpatient visit for next Tuesday.

160
00:14:47,457 --> 00:14:53,127
Since the illness can strike again, you must be sure to keep up with your outpatient treatments every single time.

161
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:54,717
I'll be off then.

162
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:58,547
You worked hard.

163
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:04,407
Doctor!

164
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:10,647
This... I came to give this as a token of my thanks.

165
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:15,417
It's nothing much. You're Hye Jeong's coworkers,

166
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:18,887
but I wasn't able to give you the proper treatment. It seemed like I was only burdening you all.

167
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:23,027
We will enjoy it!

168
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:27,357
But... Where is our Hye Jeong right now?

169
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:34,197
There might be a lot of blood, causing hypovolemic shock, so please pay special attention to the patient's vital signs.

170
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:36,167
Please give me an incision scalpel.

171
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:57,657
Elevator.

172
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,697
Give me a gown.

173
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:15,657
Change up.

174
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:22,457
Raise the bed.

175
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:26,367
Stop.

176
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,377
Suction on the right side.

177
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:36,627
Suction!

178
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:41,717
Give me the gauze. (Diathermy ) forceps.

179
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:44,617
- Blood pressure's dropping.
- Bring more blood.

180
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:01,217
Who did well? Who did?

181
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:03,777
I'm just curious. Who did well?

182
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:05,397
I haven't been sleeping...

183
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:07,757
It's obvious that a first year resident won't get any sleep.

184
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:09,807
I've stayed up for a whole week before.

185
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:12,637
Of course, people who can't work always use excuses.

186
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:14,257
It's not that Kang Soo can't work.

187
00:17:14,257 --> 00:17:17,327
Look at him. Butting in.

188
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,927
Who are you to butt in?

189
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:23,257
What were you doing? Are you going to keep pretending to give and not to give me, because there's a lot of time?

190
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:27,997
I'm giving it to you, not not giving it to you. I've scanned my textbook.

191
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:32,417
It's my book, but Chief said he didn't have money to buy one.

192
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:35,427
Okay, thanks.

193
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:38,887
- Hyung, can't you do mine too?
- I can't.

194
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:41,397
You're bad. You're a bad hyung.

195
00:17:41,397 --> 00:17:45,067
We're freshly minted residents. Don't worry; the chairman of the department will give us books as presents.

196
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:48,377
But why doesn't chief have one? The chairman should've given him one too.

197
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:50,357
In my time they gave out something else.

198
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:52,457
- Just eat this.
- What is it?

199
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:55,997
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong's dad gave it to us to eat.

200
00:17:57,097 --> 00:17:59,787
What is this now?

201
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:04,287
You're too good at finding food by the smell. You're not in surgery?

202
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:07,877
I was, but Doctor Hye Jeong said she'd assist. Since there was nothing to do, I came out.

203
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:10,237
Why don't you have anything to do? Even watching is work.

204
00:18:10,237 --> 00:18:13,297
That's why you're always behind everyone else.

205
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:15,767
You're old and you like being with little kids?

206
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:17,357
I like it.

207
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:21,147
- Are you going to eat this now?
- Ah, really!

208
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:24,787
Why don't we put it in the refrigerator and have some every time we're hungry? It's soup.

209
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:27,147
Let's divide some of this and put it in the fridge.

210
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,817
Shall we, Hyungnim?

211
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,817
I've been to Doctor Yoo's dad's restaurant.

212
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:33,917
It tastes so good.

213
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:35,977
Kang Soo, put this up on your blog.

214
00:18:35,977 --> 00:18:39,287
Because you're advertising for Dr. Yoo, she might like you.

215
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:40,517
Will she really?

216
00:18:40,517 --> 00:18:43,407
The second you upload it to advertise, you're out in her book.

217
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:44,817
They're not really in a father-daughter relationship.

218
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:46,187
But he's her biological dad.

219
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:50,807
But why are we spending this precious time talking about Doctor Yoo's private life?

220
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:52,127
Are you not going to work?

221
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:55,927
But you started it first. You're mean.

222
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,207
Mean? Is he out of his mind?

223
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:00,667
- Are you not going to work?
- I scanned a book.

224
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,947
- Okay, acknowledged.
- Thank you.

225
00:19:02,947 --> 00:19:06,427
Then I will put this in the freezer.

226
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:08,387
You're really going to make me explode.

227
00:19:08,387 --> 00:19:10,377
What happens when your insides explode from rage?

228
00:19:10,377 --> 00:19:12,587
You become like this.

229
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:17,787
You're mean.

230
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,957
Operating Room

231
00:19:23,937 --> 00:19:26,897
My dad and grandfather asked to eat dinner together.

232
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:28,387
Today's the welcome dinner.

233
00:19:28,387 --> 00:19:31,787
You can afford to be late. It's the elders' request.

234
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:33,967
Do I accept everything because it's requested from an adult?

235
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:38,757
I told them it's the welcome dinner, and told them we'll just go and eat.

236
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:43,777
If you don't want to, I'll tell them. But my dad would probably call you.

237
00:19:43,777 --> 00:19:46,027
Where are we planning to meet?

238
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:51,037
Hemostat (controls bleeding).

239
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:05,487
That's it.

240
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,887
Take out the loop and bring it here. Take it out.

241
00:20:16,857 --> 00:20:19,097
Prepare the sutures.

242
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:24,817
Cottonoid here, please.

243
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:29,657
♫ Blooming one by one  ♫

244
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:33,007
I think systemic arteries are damaged. Would it turn into cerebral infarction?

245
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:36,637
Don't jump to conclusions. Have an angiography done as soon as the surgery is over.
(angiography: x-ray imaging of blood vessel flow via radiocontrast dyes)

246
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:42,757
We can avoid this non-dominant artery.

247
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:47,557
- The blood pressure is dropping.
- Squeeze the blood bag.

248
00:20:52,827 --> 00:20:54,977
♫  Where it may be,  ♫

249
00:20:54,977 --> 00:21:00,617
Done.
♫  I can't stop myself ♫

250
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:04,517
♫  My thoughts ♫

251
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:09,037
♫  have stopped, so I cannot  ♫

252
00:21:09,037 --> 00:21:16,307
♫  You are more beautiful than flowers  ♫

253
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:18,237
♫  Those days past... ♫

254
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:19,857
Do you want to finish up?

255
00:21:19,857 --> 00:21:21,557
Yes.

256
00:21:21,557 --> 00:21:26,597
Call general surgery.

257
00:21:47,157 --> 00:21:48,917
Hey.

258
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,057
Please take care of him.

259
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:54,817
Even if you didn't ask, I would do well.

260
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:57,097
Let's get ready.

261
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:01,677
We should go too.

262
00:22:03,797 --> 00:22:05,537
Do well.

263
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:25,177
Doctor!

264
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,387
- Why are you here?
- There's an awake surgery to do in the afternoon.

265
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:33,847
That surgery is really important. It needs to be successful for the hospital.

266
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:36,377
How did it go?

267
00:22:36,377 --> 00:22:37,857
Let's eat together sometime.

268
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,667
Doctor!

269
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:46,577
Doctor Yoo. You underestimate me. I won't kill the patient.

270
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:52,287
Of course, it was a success this time too.

271
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:02,917
Doc, Patient Kim Soo Cheol's surgery is finished. I prepared the angiography.

272
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:04,587
Let's go.

273
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:13,207
Doctor.

274
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:17,737
After patient Kim Soo Cheol finished his surgery, we immediately put him in ICU. His vitals are okay.

275
00:23:17,737 --> 00:23:21,067
I told them to call as soon as he regains consciousness.

276
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,737
Good job.

277
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:26,187
I'm glad the systemic artery we stitched up was non-dominant.

278
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:29,097
Yeah, fortunately the other side is flowing quite well.

279
00:23:29,097 --> 00:23:30,967
Doctor!

280
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:36,617
Don't you need to prepare for the surgery?

281
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:39,897
Aren't you? You're the assistant.

282
00:23:39,897 --> 00:23:42,437
- Teacher.
- What?

283
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:45,457
I'm going to do something right now.

284
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,697
It's human to human. Humanity.

285
00:24:15,057 --> 00:24:16,627
I guess it wasn't folded properly.

286
00:24:16,627 --> 00:24:18,387
What were you imagining?

287
00:24:18,387 --> 00:24:21,007
What can I imagine?

288
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:25,427
Geez, you're now joking around after a dying patient got saved.

289
00:24:27,377 --> 00:24:28,837
Thank you.

290
00:24:28,837 --> 00:24:30,707
For what?

291
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:32,677
Everything.

292
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:44,647
Did she just play with me?

293
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:14,277
You can't move your legs and arms well, right?

294
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:15,207
Yeah.

295
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:19,607
I explained to you before the surgery. Cervical spine C1 and C2.

296
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:24,977
What I'm saying is, the first and second vertebrae at the top of your neck are fractured.

297
00:25:24,977 --> 00:25:29,267
But all the nerves that enervate the body pass between the cervical vertebrae in the neck, you know?

298
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:33,567
You said you'd straighten out the broken bones and put a screw to hold them together.

299
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:38,177
The surgery was a success. I did everything I needed to.

300
00:25:38,187 --> 00:25:40,107
It's your turn now.

301
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:44,357
Can I not walk anymore?

302
00:25:46,117 --> 00:25:49,947
You were by my side when I wanted to die.

303
00:25:49,947 --> 00:25:56,387
You didn't lecture me about what decisions to make. You waited until I made one.

304
00:25:57,287 --> 00:26:01,107
You were considerate even when you were young.

305
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:03,587
I am kind of cool.

306
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:06,097
No, you're very cool.

307
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:09,567
Now my head and body can't laugh as one?

308
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,797
Stop saying things to comfort me.

309
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:15,097
Try moving your fingers.

310
00:26:15,097 --> 00:26:19,537
If I can't move my arms and legs, how do I move my fingers?

311
00:26:21,857 --> 00:26:23,617
I can't.

312
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:38,757
You can.

313
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:43,977
You're right. I can!

314
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:50,147
Okay, now it's my turn.

315
00:26:50,147 --> 00:26:53,777
This person, Kim Soo Cheol is going to show you just how cool I am.

316
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:56,447
You were always a cool guy.

317
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:59,817
You don't need to show me anymore. Meet a good woman.

318
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:03,047
Hey! You're the one who should meet a good guy.

319
00:27:03,047 --> 00:27:07,277
The doctor who operated on me, wasn't he a teacher?

320
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:08,407
You're right.

321
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:10,357
That teacher already got married, right?

322
00:27:10,357 --> 00:27:11,607
No!

323
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:13,377
Don't date that old fogey.

324
00:27:13,377 --> 00:27:18,647
You're too good even for a chaebol son ( wealthy conglomerate-owning family). Not sure about me, though.

325
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:24,067
You're all alive now, Kim Soo Cheol.

326
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,597
Imaging Reading Room

327
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:36,187
During DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) surgery, we have to do micro-recording. Why?

328
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:39,437
- To pinpoint the location that causes trembling.
- Right.

329
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:43,247
So, when the trembling goes away, how do we check the patient's motor function?

330
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:44,767
She needs to pull back the bowstring.

331
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:46,657
- During the surgery?
- Of course.

332
00:27:46,657 --> 00:27:50,967
You assist and monitor the patient. When you find the tremor spot, you let me know. Hye Jeong, you keep observing the patient.

333
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:53,167
- Okay.
- Let's go.

334
00:28:22,477 --> 00:28:24,287
Look, there's the tremor cell.

335
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:27,747
Tremor cell - neurological pathway from the thalmus related to tremors

336
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,247
It's the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus.

337
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:32,597
MD - the 2nd largest thalmic group. It actively processes information, integrates into neural circuits for successful cognition, and interacts heavily with the prefrontal cortex.

338
00:28:32,597 --> 00:28:36,817
It's weird. I can't feel anything.

339
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:38,567
Did something go wrong?

340
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:42,397
The brain can't feel pain. Don't be afraid.

341
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,277
It's the target.

342
00:28:47,317 --> 00:28:50,937
We're almost there. Talk to the patient.

343
00:28:51,957 --> 00:28:53,857
How are you feeling?

344
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,617
I feel like my head is empty.

345
00:28:56,617 --> 00:29:00,647
I feel like the main character in The Matrix.

346
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,357
What about the hand tremor?

347
00:29:03,357 --> 00:29:05,327
It's the same.

348
00:29:07,757 --> 00:29:09,587
There.

349
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:15,057
130 arch, 0. arm pair set, right?

350
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,777
- Give 1 volt of stimulation.
- Yes.

351
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:31,347
The tremor is still the same.

352
00:29:31,347 --> 00:29:33,827
Did something go wrong?

353
00:29:44,237 --> 00:29:46,087
I can't see.

354
00:29:46,877 --> 00:29:49,727
I can't see the front well!

355
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:52,417
The patient is saying that her vision is decreasing.

356
00:29:58,477 --> 00:30:00,447
The signal is weird.

357
00:30:08,457 --> 00:30:10,337
It's hemorrhaging.

358
00:30:11,317 --> 00:30:14,437
After removing the probe, I think it would be good to wait for the hemorrhaging to stop.

359
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,007
Let's not do that, but stop the bleeding now.

360
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:19,727
Why don't we disinfect the area using a biopsy needle, and then keep suctioning off the area, until it stops?

361
00:30:26,557 --> 00:30:28,547
Give me the biopsy needle.

362
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:43,397
I can't see! I can't see anything!

363
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:45,537
Something is wrong, isn't it?

364
00:30:50,137 --> 00:30:52,637
- Why is her hand shaking?
- Something must be wrong!

365
00:30:52,637 --> 00:30:55,137
Stop making a fuss.

366
00:31:01,717 --> 00:31:06,087
There's a small hemorrhage in the brain. Doctor Hong will take care of it. Don't worry.

367
00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:09,007
Will something happen to my eyes like this?

368
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:14,117
Trust us... and yourself who chose this surgery.

369
00:31:17,017 --> 00:31:19,207
Maybe waiting right now would be...

370
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:21,487
We made a choice. Let's go.

371
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:28,357
Blurry sight is only temporary during the surgery. It'll return soon.

372
00:31:28,357 --> 00:31:31,227
The preparation is almost complete.

373
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:35,987
- Doctor!
- The doctor says to wait.

374
00:31:57,837 --> 00:32:01,427
I got it. Lets continue.

375
00:32:26,847 --> 00:32:29,387
I can see properly now.

376
00:32:33,037 --> 00:32:35,367
Do you see your hand too?

377
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:44,367
It's not shaking!

378
00:32:57,997 --> 00:33:00,927
Hold my hand for a second.

379
00:33:02,387 --> 00:33:03,937
How fascinating!

380
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:07,267
It's fascinating, right? Okay, let's lower your right arm.

381
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:10,057
And slowly lift your right arm back up again.

382
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:13,757
Slowly move it left and right. Slowly.

383
00:33:13,757 --> 00:33:16,347
You got it.

384
00:33:19,147 --> 00:33:22,157
Touch your nose with your pointer finger.

385
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:25,997
Lastly, make a "V".

386
00:33:27,637 --> 00:33:30,137
Thank you!

387
00:33:36,537 --> 00:33:40,977
Now, let's give her the archery bow. Where's the bow? Come on, hurry and bring it.

388
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:46,037
Hold the bow. If you're uncomfortable, you have to tell me.

389
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:54,157
Now, the Olympic gold medalist Lee Soo Jeong is pulling the bow.

390
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:09,147
Ten points!

391
00:34:19,677 --> 00:34:22,007
The surgery was a success!

392
00:34:26,317 --> 00:34:28,157
You've worked hard.

393
00:34:30,057 --> 00:34:32,887
Finish it off.

394
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:37,917
Ah, this is so exciting! Lee Soo Jeong! Lee Soo Jeong!

395
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:39,947
I'm so excited!

396
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:58,597
What were you doing earlier?

397
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,107
What?

398
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:03,537
"The doctor says to wait!" Did you have say that?

399
00:35:03,537 --> 00:35:05,847
Did you want to look that good in front of Doctor Hong?

400
00:35:05,847 --> 00:35:08,267
Like you said, what are you going to do showing that attitude in the middle of the surgery?

401
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:13,027
What did I do? It would've been fine to wait when I said to.

402
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:17,317
There was the blood loss to consider over waiting. Why do you think she had temporary loss of vision?

403
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:18,947
It's because the hemorrhaging put pressure on the optic nerve.

404
00:35:18,947 --> 00:35:22,127
So did you have to do that because you're all that great?

405
00:35:22,127 --> 00:35:24,367
It's important to calm the patient down.

406
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:28,887
How nervous would the patient be if we acted like that?

407
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,887
Professor Hong Ji Hong
Come to my office. It's about patient Lee Soo Jeong.

408
00:35:38,547 --> 00:35:40,937
Hong Ji Hong

409
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:45,857
Come in.

410
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:50,987
Sit down.

411
00:35:55,467 --> 00:36:00,527
Seo Woo, I can't just let your attitude from today go.

412
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:05,387
That was not an appropriate action as a doctor. It's the worst for the team.

413
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,567
Do you think what I'm saying is unfair?

414
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:11,567
I think it's excessive.

415
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:14,037
Seems like you don't understand the situation yet.

416
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:18,997
This was an awake surgery. The patient was awake.

417
00:36:18,997 --> 00:36:22,617
How would you feel if someone else touched your head when it's wide open?

418
00:36:22,617 --> 00:36:26,597
Is it wrong that I stated my opinion during surgery?

419
00:36:26,597 --> 00:36:31,067
I'm not saying anything about your opinion right now. Why are you pretending not to know?

420
00:36:31,067 --> 00:36:33,467
Or are you stupid?

421
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:40,007
If a decision was made, then you should follow that decision.

422
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:44,067
We already made the decision to move on, but how can you hold back and wait?

423
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:47,397
Then the patient doubts my decision. How's the result going to be if they doubt me?

424
00:36:47,397 --> 00:36:50,057
Would you talk to Hye Jeong like this if she acted like me?

425
00:36:50,057 --> 00:36:54,327
Of course I would. I'm talking about work attitude right now.

426
00:36:55,437 --> 00:36:59,657
How long are you going to compare how I treat you and Hye Jeong differently?

427
00:36:59,657 --> 00:37:01,797
Until I die.

428
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:04,737
Seo Woo...

429
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:14,747
I'm not going to persuade you about this any more because I realize this is a problem that can't be resolved.

430
00:37:14,747 --> 00:37:18,457
Don't come into my surgeries for a while. You can go.

431
00:37:28,837 --> 00:37:30,997
I'm seriously going to go crazy.

432
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:39,387
Hye Jeong.

433
00:37:39,387 --> 00:37:44,177
Hello, Father. We ate your food really well. Thank you.

434
00:37:44,177 --> 00:37:49,637
What thanks... If you want to eat, come whenever.

435
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:52,407
Our restaurant.

436
00:37:54,757 --> 00:37:56,687
I'll see you around, Ajusshi.

437
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:03,527
She's being discharged tomorrow.

438
00:38:03,527 --> 00:38:04,987
Okay.

439
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:14,677
How are you feeling?

440
00:38:17,907 --> 00:38:20,997
You would've heard from Hye Jeong.

441
00:38:20,997 --> 00:38:24,527
What makes you think I heard from Hye Jeong?

442
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:26,837
Aren't you two dating?

443
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,327
Does it look like that?

444
00:38:28,327 --> 00:38:33,047
I guess not. I heard you weren't married yet.

445
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:36,037
- Did you get married?
- Yes.

446
00:38:37,427 --> 00:38:40,307
You got married?

447
00:38:40,307 --> 00:38:45,587
You did well. Hey! You need to marry early.

448
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:55,407
I'll transfer you to the rehabilitation department in a week. If you work hard in physical therapy, you can be back to your old self.

449
00:38:55,407 --> 00:38:56,677
What a lie.

450
00:38:56,677 --> 00:39:01,197
It's a small lie. Not a big lie. You're a good guy, getting married and all.

451
00:39:01,197 --> 00:39:04,587
I knew you were a good guy when I first saw you.

452
00:39:05,847 --> 00:39:08,577
Your face is handsome too.

453
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:12,777
Tell me if anything is uncomfortable at any time.

454
00:39:12,777 --> 00:39:16,587
- Okay...
- Okay. Rest well.

455
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:27,197
He's been in stupor since the surgery for the past 14 days. His motor functions are normal.
(stupor - unconscious patient responding to painful stimuli only, state below coma)

456
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:30,787
Are you doing CT follow ups?

457
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:33,067
Since he's old, he'll be physically weak.

458
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:36,857
Check the nutrition levels and change his position frequently.

459
00:39:36,857 --> 00:39:38,557
Okay.

460
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:43,217
Don't worry too much. He'll wake up soon.

461
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:45,527
Thank you, Doctor.

462
00:40:06,117 --> 00:40:07,997
Why did you want to see me?

463
00:40:07,997 --> 00:40:10,617
What did I do that was so wrong?

464
00:40:13,797 --> 00:40:19,457
You left. Even before you left, you gave me so much grief.

465
00:40:20,637 --> 00:40:24,527
After you left, there was never a time I when I wasn't concerned.

466
00:40:24,527 --> 00:40:28,767
- Wondering whether or not you're properly eating—
- I can't hold back if you continue to be like this.

467
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:31,847
What were you holding back?

468
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:34,687
Just what have I done to you!?

469
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:37,997
I'm trying to get along with you. What's so wrong with that!?

470
00:40:37,997 --> 00:40:40,327
Why are you suddenly trying to get along with me?

471
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:45,057
We suddenly met!

472
00:40:45,057 --> 00:40:49,227
A child may be able to forget a parent, but a parent doesn't forget their child.

473
00:40:49,227 --> 00:40:52,517
Between a child and a parent is also a human relationship.

474
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:55,437
We've never been close, so how do we become close?

475
00:40:56,527 --> 00:41:00,727
All because you say, "Let's get along," we instantly get along?

476
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:07,007
We never spent time together; we never had feelings towards each other.

477
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,307
Neurosurgery Kang Kyeong Joon

478
00:42:03,017 --> 00:42:04,817
Yes, Kyeong Joon.

479
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:08,907
Shall I bring out my style?

480
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:14,347
Why are you bringing that?

481
00:42:14,347 --> 00:42:17,457
During the welcoming event, they have a bowl ceremony. They make you drink a lot of alcohol.

482
00:42:17,457 --> 00:42:21,067
If someone loses consciousness, we need this.

483
00:42:21,067 --> 00:42:24,937
There's no need for that. I'm strong with my alcohol.

484
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:26,727
Is that so?

485
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:28,747
Aish.

486
00:42:36,057 --> 00:42:40,627
My exceptionalism is quite outstanding. To already have my celebration over leading my first surgery!

487
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:44,177
Hyung, have you ever been dropped from residency?

488
00:42:45,587 --> 00:42:50,517
I know exactly why Chief Kyeong Joon wanted to hit you now.

489
00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:51,447
Ah, is that a wound?

490
00:42:51,447 --> 00:42:55,857
It is a wound, but you're putting salt in it.

491
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:04,597
What?

492
00:43:04,597 --> 00:43:07,877
You came? Patient Kim Jin Hwan has glioblastoma...

493
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:11,377
Twenty-seven year old college student admitted with headaches and nausea.

494
00:43:11,377 --> 00:43:14,967
This is Doctor Jeong Yoon Do's patient, and he's scheduled to have surgery tomorrow afternoon.

495
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,687
How impressive!

496
00:43:16,687 --> 00:43:19,137
You looked into every patient who has been admitted?

497
00:43:19,137 --> 00:43:20,987
Don't go overboard in trying to flatter me.

498
00:43:20,987 --> 00:43:25,967
Doctor Jeong Yoon Do commanded me to get you ready for surgery.

499
00:43:25,967 --> 00:43:28,317
Where is Doctor Jeong Yoon Do?

500
00:43:29,037 --> 00:43:32,307
Why would I go into the board of directors? Director Kim.

501
00:43:32,307 --> 00:43:35,907
I know that you are doing this because of father's commands.

502
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:39,167
I am someone who has no interest in building up my career.

503
00:43:45,637 --> 00:43:48,107
When did you get here?

504
00:43:48,107 --> 00:43:49,237
Patient Kim Jin Hwan's surgery...

505
00:43:49,237 --> 00:43:50,787
In glioblastoma surgery,

506
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:53,487
rather than surgical techniques, quick judgment is more important.

507
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:55,217
You're aware of that right?

508
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:57,717
Do it with Doctor Jin.

509
00:43:57,717 --> 00:43:58,497
Why?

510
00:43:58,497 --> 00:44:01,217
- She originally did it with you—
- If she originally did it, does she have to keep doing it?

511
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:06,477
Do you only become close with people you originally knew? Do you only date people you originally knew?

512
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,107
That's quite a stretch.

513
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:13,497
We decided on that issue during the meeting—to utilize fellows based on the staff's discretion.

514
00:44:13,497 --> 00:44:16,317
Following that decision, I told you to come do the surgery.

515
00:44:16,317 --> 00:44:21,307
Since you are using the term "originally", I'm mad.

516
00:44:24,117 --> 00:44:29,217
It's nice that you're smiling. Do you know that your father gave me soup because he was thankful?

517
00:44:29,217 --> 00:44:30,537
I didn't know.

518
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:32,447
That's something that you should know.

519
00:44:32,447 --> 00:44:37,167
It would be great if you knew that I... ate it very deliciously.

520
00:44:39,247 --> 00:44:41,317
I guess this was so-so.

521
00:44:41,317 --> 00:44:42,477
Pardon?

522
00:44:42,477 --> 00:44:44,507
You didn't smile.

523
00:44:48,237 --> 00:44:51,887
Looking like that, is very nice.

524
00:44:51,887 --> 00:44:53,737
Why are you like that? So cringy (cringe-worthy).

525
00:44:53,737 --> 00:44:55,647
Girls like cringe-worthy things.

526
00:44:55,647 --> 00:44:58,947
At first they say it's cringy and reject it, but in the end they fall for it.

527
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:03,287
This cringy thing is quite addictive. Cringe, cringe.

528
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:05,417
Doctor!

529
00:45:06,797 --> 00:45:09,277
I'm thinking of you as a woman.

530
00:45:11,827 --> 00:45:14,527
Let's eat the cafeteria food together tomorrow.

531
00:45:14,527 --> 00:45:17,777
Let's eat together and go into the surgery.

532
00:45:18,797 --> 00:45:21,387
The answer is, yes.

533
00:45:37,327 --> 00:45:39,457
One, two, One two...

534
00:45:39,457 --> 00:45:42,927
Mic test, mic test. Can you hear my voice?

535
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:43,787
Yes!

536
00:45:43,787 --> 00:45:44,957
Yes, thank you.

537
00:45:44,957 --> 00:45:49,817
From now on, Guk Il Medical Center's Neurosurgery Department, Doctor Choi Kang Soo's welcome ceremony

538
00:45:49,817 --> 00:45:54,327
and Doctor Bi Yeong Gook's lead surgeon ceremony will start!

539
00:45:57,677 --> 00:45:58,847
Yes, thank you.

540
00:45:58,847 --> 00:46:03,977
Today's appointed MC, Guk Il Medical Center's Neurosurgery Department, eternal cutie

541
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:07,877
Kang Kyeong Joon. I'll greet everyone. Nice to meet you!

542
00:46:07,877 --> 00:46:10,667
Joong Dae, don't eat. Clap.

543
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:15,317
Now, first. Neurosurgery Department's Chief. Our eternal leader.

544
00:46:15,317 --> 00:46:20,267
We will have Chief Kim Tae Ho's congratulatory message and toast.

545
00:46:22,827 --> 00:46:24,807
Kim Tae Ho! Kim Tae Ho!

546
00:46:24,807 --> 00:46:26,147
Kim Tae Ho!

547
00:46:26,147 --> 00:46:27,417
- Chief!
- Kim Tae Ho!

548
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,397
- Chief!
- Kim Tae Ho!

549
00:46:29,397 --> 00:46:33,807
On this type of night, it's best to say something typical.

550
00:46:33,807 --> 00:46:36,657
The neurosurgery department deals with brains.

551
00:46:36,657 --> 00:46:40,447
The brain governs a human's body. So!

552
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:44,377
Neurosurgery department governs everything!

553
00:46:48,587 --> 00:46:49,927
Yes, come quickly.

554
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:52,317
Grandpa!

555
00:46:52,317 --> 00:46:55,517
We live in the same building, but I don't see you often. Are you going to be like that?

556
00:46:55,517 --> 00:46:56,897
I'm sorry.

557
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,807
- Sit.
- Yes.

558
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:03,957
We always said that you were going to eat, but it kept getting delayed.

559
00:47:03,957 --> 00:47:05,987
I'm sorry. I was also careless about it.

560
00:47:05,987 --> 00:47:10,397
We ordered the food. I have an appointment so I have to leave in two hours.

561
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:13,917
I met your father and he was upset that you haven't contacted him.

562
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:16,047
- Call him.
- Yes.

563
00:47:16,047 --> 00:47:18,877
With you two sitting like that, you resemble each other.

564
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,837
Oh that's right.

565
00:47:21,687 --> 00:47:23,697
- Yoon Do.
- Yes.

566
00:47:23,697 --> 00:47:28,117
In the future, you have many many things to do. We need talent.

567
00:47:28,117 --> 00:47:31,187
The hospital will expand multiple times from what it is now.

568
00:47:31,187 --> 00:47:33,957
In the future, when it becomes privatized and our medical center becomes a shared company,

569
00:47:33,957 --> 00:47:37,397
a new world totally different from now will open up for us, doctors.

570
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:40,357
The expectation for you guys is big.

571
00:47:41,377 --> 00:47:44,477
Seo Woo will do well.

572
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:48,147
You'll do well too.

573
00:47:48,147 --> 00:47:49,857
I'm not going to be involved in the career aspect.

574
00:47:49,857 --> 00:47:54,817
If I were to do that, I would have gone into my father's company and competed with my younger siblings.

575
00:47:54,817 --> 00:47:57,187
I decided not to do so because I wanted to be free.

576
00:47:58,247 --> 00:48:02,057
Then, provide help. Our Seo Woo will do it all.

577
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,537
Excuse me for a moment.

578
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:14,317
Excuse me.

579
00:48:19,907 --> 00:48:23,627
Sunbae! Sunbae!

580
00:48:25,417 --> 00:48:27,627
Are you uncomfortable?

581
00:48:27,627 --> 00:48:28,617
I'm going.

582
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:30,757
What? It's tedious and uncomfortable.

583
00:48:30,757 --> 00:48:34,887
But you're going to leave in the middle of a meal with elders? You're not that type of person.

584
00:48:34,887 --> 00:48:37,957
The meal hasn't started yet. Talk to them.

585
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:41,967
- Why should I?
- That makes it more embarrassing for you, right?

586
00:48:41,967 --> 00:48:47,317
I'm confused these days. I am beginning to see a different side of myself.

587
00:48:47,317 --> 00:48:50,417
Eating with my family was such an empty affair for you?

588
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:52,657
Enough to flip my insides upside down?

589
00:48:52,657 --> 00:48:54,917
A woman and a man met for ten years and there wasn't a spark.

590
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:56,397
If one side sparked, then it sparked.

591
00:48:56,397 --> 00:48:57,607
A fire doesn't happen if only one side sparks.

592
00:48:57,607 --> 00:49:02,377
I will guarantee this, Sunbae. You will become miserable for sure.

593
00:49:02,377 --> 00:49:06,727
Everyone who loves Hye Jeong becomes miserable. That's her curse.

594
00:49:06,727 --> 00:49:10,937
Then I guess I'll become miserable.

595
00:49:20,397 --> 00:49:22,897
♫ My tummy's full with alcohol from the bar

596
00:49:22,897 --> 00:49:25,387
♫ Whenever someone curses me, I find a place to drink ♫

597
00:49:25,387 --> 00:49:28,917
♫ Flap your arms & legs and hold onto them, Da, Da, Da ♫

598
00:49:28,917 --> 00:49:34,307
♫ Nothing ever lasts forever. In the end,♫

599
00:49:34,307 --> 00:49:37,497
♫ Tonight I'll be crooked.♫

600
00:49:39,787 --> 00:49:45,447
♫  What should I do with you? What should I do with you? ♫

601
00:49:45,447 --> 00:49:48,597
♫ Shake that booty that booty booty!  ♫

602
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,847
Bang! Nice shot!

603
00:49:51,847 --> 00:49:53,887
That was awesome!

604
00:49:53,887 --> 00:49:55,997
For Chief. For Professor Hong.

605
00:49:55,997 --> 00:49:58,517
For you, and for our pretty Hye Jeong.

606
00:49:58,517 --> 00:50:01,147
Two of these for me.

607
00:50:01,147 --> 00:50:03,157
She's over there.

608
00:50:08,757 --> 00:50:12,647
Dr. Jeong Yoon Do! Now you arrive!

609
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:16,077
You can't just sit! What do we do if you just came now?

610
00:50:16,077 --> 00:50:18,977
Since you're late, you get to drink three times. First shot take off!

611
00:50:18,977 --> 00:50:21,427
This bastard ...

612
00:50:24,017 --> 00:50:25,897
One shot!

613
00:50:32,477 --> 00:50:36,817
One more shot! One more shot! One more shot!

614
00:50:36,817 --> 00:50:43,277
One more shot! One more shot! One more shot!

615
00:50:55,167 --> 00:51:00,777
Now, it's the final pledge of allegiance shot that not even staff can avoid.

616
00:51:00,777 --> 00:51:03,727
First, Doctor Hong Ji Hong!

617
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,437
What is this? How do you do that?

618
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,477
I'll do it first.

619
00:51:15,437 --> 00:51:17,547
Please take care of me!

620
00:51:27,777 --> 00:51:29,327
Hey, how can I do something like this.

621
00:51:29,327 --> 00:51:33,487
Oh my. How can a guy not do this? A girl even did it.

622
00:51:33,487 --> 00:51:34,847
She's not just a girl.

623
00:51:34,847 --> 00:51:40,347
Ah, Teacher! I'll be the black rose. Doctor Hong Ji Hong is usually weak at this kind of stuff.

624
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,967
Give it to me. I can do it.

625
00:51:44,777 --> 00:51:48,547
What is this. You put it here, and you just do it.

626
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:57,247
- Oh my what do we do. Doctor, it's red here. Doesn't it hurt?
- It doesn't hurt.

627
00:51:57,267 --> 00:51:59,867
- It looks like it hurts.
- I will do it again.

628
00:51:59,907 --> 00:52:02,997
No, no, no. Don't do it. Doctor Hong usually isn't good at this stuff.

629
00:52:02,997 --> 00:52:04,907
Doctor Yoo can just be the black rose.

630
00:52:04,907 --> 00:52:09,347
Ah, what, no. I said I'll do it. Why are you like this right now?

631
00:52:09,347 --> 00:52:11,237
Here, I just do it.

632
00:52:11,237 --> 00:52:13,577
Please take care of me.

633
00:52:39,377 --> 00:52:41,057
Eat.

634
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:43,827
I'm sorry.

635
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:47,667
How easy do you have to look that he doesn't even greet us properly?

636
00:52:49,037 --> 00:52:50,167
It's not like that.

637
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,867
Then was it because I look easy?

638
00:52:57,287 --> 00:53:01,167
Relations between men and women are the same. The stronger one wins.

639
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:06,267
You can't even handle this type of small relationship. Do you think you'll be able to get Guk Il Hospital like this?

640
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,677
How can I entrust this hospital to you?

641
00:53:08,677 --> 00:53:10,697
Stop it. Let her eat.

642
00:53:10,697 --> 00:53:13,027
Father.

643
00:53:49,987 --> 00:53:53,827
We're playing like this. When are you coming?

644
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,977
Jeong Yoon Do, you f**king bastard

645
00:54:25,827 --> 00:54:27,677
Just kill him today! Whoa!

646
00:54:28,957 --> 00:54:30,147
This is nothing, Kang Soo.

647
00:54:30,147 --> 00:54:32,427
You detestable person.

648
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:34,947
Give me a glass!

649
00:54:34,947 --> 00:54:38,487
- Me too? Forget it.
- Hold on, hold on

650
00:54:41,557 --> 00:54:43,327
Then, how about water?

651
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:45,207
That's okay.

652
00:54:47,047 --> 00:54:48,547
Now it's endless.

653
00:54:48,547 --> 00:54:51,077
- Okay!
- Good!

654
00:54:51,077 --> 00:54:53,407
- Wow.
- Go ahead!

655
00:54:58,117 --> 00:55:01,757
Neurosurgery first year Choi Kang Soo will work hard!

656
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,837
Anyway, he is a man.

657
00:55:28,797 --> 00:55:30,157
Hey, Kang Soo!

658
00:55:30,157 --> 00:55:32,937
Kang Soo! Hey, Choi Kang Soo!

659
00:55:32,937 --> 00:55:36,587
Hey, Choi Kang Soo! Wake up! Choi Kang Soo!

660
00:55:38,067 --> 00:55:40,767
- He's not breathing.
- Do intubation.

661
00:55:40,817 --> 00:55:42,857
Here? Without instruments?

662
00:55:42,857 --> 00:55:45,247
Ah, it's hard if you don't have instruments, right?

663
00:55:45,247 --> 00:55:47,467
Sunbaenim.

664
00:55:50,057 --> 00:55:52,157
Shall we do intubation?

665
00:55:53,727 --> 00:55:57,537
Joon Dae! You are really giving! Yah!

666
00:56:06,297 --> 00:56:08,417
What do you have to say?

667
00:56:09,437 --> 00:56:12,897
You became my black rose. Don't I have to do something for you too?

668
00:56:12,897 --> 00:56:14,527
What will you do?

669
00:56:14,527 --> 00:56:16,297
What will I do?

670
00:56:33,507 --> 00:56:35,057
There was a place like this?

671
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:38,667
- There was. Have you tried shooting?
- No.

672
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:42,807
Watch me do this. Do it like this...

673
00:56:44,157 --> 00:56:46,987
It's not working well.

674
00:56:49,227 --> 00:56:51,397
Try it. I think the gun

675
00:56:51,397 --> 00:56:55,417
is a little bit weird.

676
00:56:59,487 --> 00:57:01,257
You're different, really.

677
00:57:01,257 --> 00:57:03,807
Ah, what the heck, Doc.

678
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:07,347
Two-point. 
♫  Breath-takingly  ♫

679
00:57:07,347 --> 00:57:11,647
Two-point. Three-point. Three-point. Two-point.

680
00:57:11,647 --> 00:57:14,787
Seven hundred thirty five!
Yoo Hye Jeong (735)

681
00:57:14,787 --> 00:57:19,577
- I want to write too. Three hundred eighty six.
Hong Ji Hong (386)

682
00:57:19,577 --> 00:57:21,866
Let's go try other ones!

683
00:57:21,866 --> 00:57:29,826
♫  It seems that my destiny will change because of my meeting of you  ♫

684
00:57:29,826 --> 00:57:32,206
♫  I don't know anything but you  ♫

685
00:57:32,206 --> 00:57:35,306
This is so fun. I feel like I became a young child.

686
00:57:35,306 --> 00:57:36,716
You like competition, don't you?

687
00:57:36,716 --> 00:57:38,336
Yes.

688
00:57:39,046 --> 00:57:42,916
Today, with everything you like, it's a combo set!

689
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:44,516
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

690
00:57:44,516 --> 00:57:50,866
♫  Can you see that your gaze, and every movement  ♫

691
00:57:50,866 --> 00:57:52,706
♫  Tell me that you love me  ♫

692
00:57:52,706 --> 00:57:57,316
The person who gets to the end first wins.

693
00:57:57,316 --> 00:58:00,836
One, two, three!

694
00:58:02,116 --> 00:58:05,836
♫  Hey beautiful lady  ♫

695
00:58:05,836 --> 00:58:11,836
♫  Can you see? Can you see me?  ♫

696
00:58:14,586 --> 00:58:19,336
♫  I just wanna fall in love  ♫

697
00:58:19,336 --> 00:58:21,616
I won!

698
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:24,156
- Are you that happy?
- Yes.

699
00:58:25,266 --> 00:58:28,666
- Should we do it again?
- Sure.

700
00:58:44,676 --> 00:58:49,396
♫  You are everything in my life. ♫

701
00:58:49,396 --> 00:58:51,726
I'll lose to you this time.

702
00:58:51,726 --> 00:58:57,396
♫  A miracle that I can't explain. ♫

703
00:58:59,116 --> 00:59:02,136
♫  If love is needing my comfort  ♫

704
00:59:02,136 --> 00:59:06,296
For the first time, a girl held my hand first.
♫ from my love  ♫

705
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:11,246
♫ Take another step closer  ♫

706
00:59:12,956 --> 00:59:16,486
♫ Because your fragrance is nice.  ♫

707
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:20,056
♫ Because I'm just so happy  ♫
