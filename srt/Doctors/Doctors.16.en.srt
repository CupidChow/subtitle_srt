00:00:24,597 --> 00:00:25,567
Episode 16

2
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:30,077
You said you can review the medical records for the last five years, right?

3
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:34,227
I'm contacting you because you said you would send me the medical history, but you didn't do it yet.

4
00:00:34,227 --> 00:00:37,187
Yes, I gave you the fax number.

5
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:40,327
Yes.

6
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,067
Medical Records Search History

7
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:54,537
Department and Title: Namyangju Guk Il Medical Center Surgical Director
Name: Kim Chi Hyeon

8
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:57,947
Danger doesn't come without sending a signal first.

9
00:00:57,947 --> 00:01:03,027
I thought that my past would be safe while I was digging up someone else's past.

10
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:08,967
Others aren't relaxing when I work.

11
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:31,627
The vitals and hemoglobin count are normal, but for the APCT (an abdominal and pelvis CT)

12
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:32,877
there are signs of bleeding.

13
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:34,467
Okay, I'll go.

14
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:36,617
Yes, I understand.

15
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:44,927
Sleep, sleep. You're always talking about mental states.

16
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:48,707
Hey, take care of your own mental health, you kid.

17
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:52,367
- I've let you off the hook so many times and look—
- Look? Look what? Are you going to hit me?

18
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:54,697
You're so small I could just knock you out with just one punch—

19
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:04,747
Hey, call me a kid one more time. Then I'll knock you down and crush you.

20
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:06,387
Blood...

21
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:10,547
Ah, seriously.

22
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:15,007
What happened to you? Did you get hit? By whom?

23
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:18,587
Ah, seriously. It hurts.

24
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:23,337
Why did you guys do that? Why do you hit people?

25
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:24,857
Does it hurt a lot?

26
00:02:24,857 --> 00:02:25,997
I'm okay.

27
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:29,217
In this situation, of course he'd say he's okay. Would he say it hurts? You should teach your kids properly.

28
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:31,817
You should teach your kids properly.

29
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:36,087
Who is it that hit our kid?

30
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:37,477
He's coming.

31
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:40,237
Let me see. Double nose bleed.

32
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:42,017
Hey, don't you really dislike violence?

33
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:44,067
I do.

34
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:54,047
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:54,047 --> 00:02:55,637
Why did you hit him?

36
00:02:55,637 --> 00:02:57,317
He kept aggravating me.

37
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:59,697
Hey, how did I aggravate you? I was just joking.

38
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:04,077
I can listen to it once or twice, but your jokes are—

39
00:03:04,077 --> 00:03:09,107
We're doctors. The highest level intellectuals. Do you not have self-restraint?

40
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:10,117
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:12,987
What are you sorry for?

42
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:17,967
Kang Soo, I didn't know what kind of kid you were because I only saw you from time to time, but you're alright.

43
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:22,847
From now on, if someone treats you unjustly in this way, respond reasonably. You can leave.

44
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,007
Go.

45
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:33,957
Hey. This isn't right.

46
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:35,217
I also don't think this is right.

47
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:37,697
What's with the cotton for a nose bleed.

48
00:03:37,697 --> 00:03:41,947
You're a doctor. Is this some Hollywood action scene?

49
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:43,947
Are you really going to be like this?

50
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:46,147
The arm always bends inwards (Korean proverb for tending to take care of your young.)

51
00:03:49,947 --> 00:03:53,727
If you get hit again next time, I won't stand still.

52
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:57,147
Let's just go get something to eat. Hey, you're big for nothing.

53
00:03:57,147 --> 00:03:59,467
I-It's because it was a surprise attack...

54
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:02,267
What do mean by surprise? Let's go.

55
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:16,437
Why are you like that? Are you tired?

56
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:19,117
Well all first years are like this.

57
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:23,957
No method or strategy works in your first year in residency. But try to use your time wisely.

58
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:25,817
Thank you, Doctor.

59
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:27,637
High five.

60
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:47,947
How can you eat? Our child didn't come back.

61
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:51,637
Why are you like that, it's nothing new. There were lots of days she didn't come home because she was on duty.

62
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:53,227
I told you I yelled at her.

63
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:56,247
You did well. She has to lose affection for her father

64
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:58,847
to know how precious her mother is.

65
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:00,227
What?

66
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:05,027
She always loved and followed you since she was young. You two always left me out.

67
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:07,707
Don't say useless things. Go and bring her back.

68
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:13,067
Exactly how much did you scold her? I'm sure you didn't hit her.

69
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:16,437
Never mind. Forget it.

70
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:22,857
Patient, how are you?

71
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:25,027
It still hurts a lot.

72
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:27,107
Where does it hurt?

73
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:33,197
My eye... and my head hurts too. Pus keeps oozing out.

74
00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:35,267
You're still using antibiotics, right?

75
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:38,497
Yes, we're working with the infectious medicine department.

76
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:41,637
If the patient's conditions improve, stop TPN and let him eat.

77
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:45,327
TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) - Daily nutrition given by IV

78
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:48,087
Director Jin Myeong Hoon

79
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:58,037
It's difficult to meet with you.

80
00:05:58,037 --> 00:05:59,547
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,397
Didn't your father contact you?

82
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:05,917
I heard. The suggestion to come in as a director of Guk Il Medical Center.

83
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:10,017
I'm trying to recommend you as a director at the next Board of Director's conference. I'm saying recommend, but it's more like confirming.

84
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:13,897
I cannot accept that.

85
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:18,547
There isn't much to do. All you have to do is take on the position and help Seo Woo later.

86
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:21,177
I like this hospital. I want to continue working.

87
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:22,957
Why don't you have ambition?

88
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:28,027
I like being a doctor. A doctor that fixes illnesses. I like that.

89
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,107
- Did you see our Seo Woo today?
- Yes.

90
00:06:32,107 --> 00:06:36,767
Bring her and come to the VIP patient room. You know Assemblyman Nam Il Soo was hospitalized, right?

91
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:39,847
Because you need to show your face. Even if you don't want to,

92
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:42,317
you at least have to do the minimum in order to maintain the relationship you have with your parents.

93
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:45,777
No matter if Chairman Jeong says that you're 'free'.

94
00:06:58,337 --> 00:07:00,487
You look really tired.

95
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:04,267
First years are like that. If you get over this well, it gets better in the second year.

96
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:05,817
Yes.

97
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:11,467
He's really calling a lot.
VIP ward's nurse

98
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:13,967
Yes, I'll go up soon.

99
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:17,127
- Is it that Assemblyman?
- Yeah.

100
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:20,437
Go and dress Patient Lee Jin Joo, check her mental state, and notify me.

101
00:07:20,437 --> 00:07:22,287
Okay.

102
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:37,077
How are you?

103
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:40,177
I called Doctor Yoo, but Professor Hong came.

104
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:42,237
I'm regularly on rounds.

105
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:46,687
Oh, really? Then I will receive the regular rounds.

106
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:51,577
Hello.

107
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:58,307
I was going to tell Doctor Yoo, but Professor Hong came personally.

108
00:07:58,307 --> 00:07:59,427
How are you?

109
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:03,427
Goodness, it keeps hurting. Are you sure the painkillers are being used properly?

110
00:08:03,427 --> 00:08:05,887
- Are you doing the pain control properly?
- Yes.

111
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,327
If he continues to say that it hurts, give him an additional NSAIDS (Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug).

112
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:10,747
Are you not going to do a surgery?

113
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:15,017
You don't need a surgery. According to the exam results, you just have the symptoms of early spinal disk degeneration.

114
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:18,467
If you receive medicinal and physical therapy for a week, you should be able to be discharged.

115
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:22,477
Why is it so simple? Are you doing this properly, Professor Hong?

116
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:25,507
Yes. Please don't worry and rest comfortably.

117
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:28,817
Doctor Yoo, go out a little later.

118
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:30,927
Let's talk a bit.

119
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,667
While I'm at the hospital, I want to hear about other people's lives.

120
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,207
Okay.

121
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:45,417
How much is your annual salary? Is it over a million?

122
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:47,077
It isn't as high as you think.

123
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:50,367
Should I be a matchmaker for you?

124
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:08,017
Let's go in.

125
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:16,447
Doctor Yoo, you were here. How is his condition?

126
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:19,347
It's okay. I'll take my leave.

127
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:27,937
She has such a good social life. You need those skills.

128
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:35,637
You got out already.

129
00:09:35,637 --> 00:09:39,867
He told me to leave since I wasn't saying anything. I should have gone in together with Kang Soo.

130
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,847
Yeah, well, he'll leave in a few days so just bear with it.

131
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:45,797
I'm holding it in because I have to make a living.

132
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:46,757
You grew a lot.

133
00:09:46,757 --> 00:09:50,847
I'm all grown already. Did you take the vitamin D yet today?

134
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,927
Not yet.

135
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:53,717
I like a person who is diligent.

136
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:57,327
If you've started, you should continue taking them until you finish, without missing a single dose. What about the antioxidants?

137
00:09:57,327 --> 00:10:00,857
Nagging. I'm still healthy. I don't have to take those vitamins.

138
00:10:00,857 --> 00:10:05,067
Even so, you're 9 years older than me. I don't want you to die before me.

139
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:06,957
Hey, why is death coming up all of a sudden.

140
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:09,327
It's not sudden.

141
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:13,727
The people I love can't die before me.

142
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:16,817
That... You have to promise.

143
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,837
How is Patient Lee Hee Young's condition?

144
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:22,287
Do you want to go check right now?

145
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,127
I'm finally wearing a wedding dress.

146
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:52,247
- Do you like it that much?
- Yes.

147
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:54,687
Our Jin Jin.

148
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:58,167
I wanted to finish all the procedures before our Jin Jin was born

149
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:01,017
I'm sorry and thank you.

150
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:04,267
No, you had a harder time.

151
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:07,547
Tirelessly working and being obsessive.

152
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:12,867
We're getting married and when Jin Jin is born, we only have happy things left.

153
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:16,667
Honey, I love you.

154
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:21,227
Are you not going to answer, Oppa?

155
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:26,827
I said I love you!

156
00:11:51,027 --> 00:11:53,867
- What about her vitals?
- Her systolic blood pressure is being maintained at 120,

157
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:58,447
and we're maintaining her temperature to be between 36 and 37 degrees celsius.

158
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:00,377
Even though it's bothersome, keep checking up on her.

159
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:02,237
Okay.

160
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:03,947
Yes.

161
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:15,337
Hey. Maintain the temperature and blood pressure to normal.

162
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:18,727
Send in her blood tests tomorrow and check her vitals and hormone levels.

163
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:21,147
If her status changes notify me immediately.

164
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:24,527
- Tell the gynecologist to come by daily.
- Okay.

165
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:28,427
The two of you seem to have good chemistry.

166
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:30,077
What does that mean?

167
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:32,187
It doesn't mean anything.

168
00:12:32,187 --> 00:12:34,817
You're saying useless things.

169
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:38,477
Doctor.

170
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:46,497
How long does she have to endure for the baby to be safe?

171
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:52,177
It needs to be at 24 weeks to move the baby into the incubator, then the chances of survival will be high.

172
00:12:52,177 --> 00:12:59,847
But, we're in a situation that it wouldn't be surprising for the patient to die in 10 minutes.

173
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:09,647
I'm so regretful, Doctor.

174
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:15,547
Don't blame yourself. You're doing well right now.

175
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:17,217
No...

176
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,497
I couldn't tell her I loved her.

177
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:26,877
I regret that the most.

178
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:36,017
Because it was too precious on a precious day,, I wanted to say it after saying our wedding vows, but...

179
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:46,897
I think she knows your feelings.
♫  The first time I saw you ♫

180
00:13:46,897 --> 00:13:52,627
She is desperately protecting the child.
♫  You seemed as anxious as a child  ♫

181
00:13:54,657 --> 00:14:02,717
♫ One day when you were standing beside me ♫

182
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,177
Where are you?
♫ You had changed  ♫

183
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:10,267
♫ to be so lovely. Did you know? ♫

184
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:15,487
On my way to the fellow room.
♫ I never expected we would be in love ♫

185
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,367
Don't move an inch.
♫ I miss you  ♫

186
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:22,807
♫ I love you  ♫

187
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:26,387
♫ You are my entire life  ♫

188
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:29,797
Don't move an inch.
♫ You are the reason I live  ♫

189
00:14:29,797 --> 00:14:37,367
♫ It's an unexplainable miracle. ♫

190
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:44,467
♫ If love is needing my comfort  ♫

191
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:49,817
♫ Take another step closer  ♫

192
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:57,877
♫ Yes I believe my destiny  ♫

193
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,017
Did something happen?

194
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:13,247
I haven't said those words before, right?

195
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,167
What words?

196
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:22,547
I love you, Hye Jeong.

197
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:26,657
♫ You are my entire life ♫

198
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,887
You came in a rush to say that?
♫ You are the reason I live  ♫

199
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:34,367
Yeah.
♫ It's an unexplainable miracle  ♫

200
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,937
So I don't regret anything if something bad happens at any time, any moment.

201
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:44,227
♫ If love is needing my comfort  ♫

202
00:15:44,227 --> 00:15:49,217
Come.
♫ Take another step closer ♫

203
00:15:51,437 --> 00:15:56,677
♫ Yes I believe my destiny  ♫

204
00:15:57,847 --> 00:16:04,577
♫ In your lovely warm breath  ♫

205
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:11,867
♫ Every single feeling is so precious  ♫

206
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:15,117
♫ Can anything we say  ♫

207
00:16:15,117 --> 00:16:18,177
We can't keep being like this in the hospital.
♫ express it?  ♫

208
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:21,547
♫ I miss you  ♫

209
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,827
♫ I love you  ♫

210
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:29,277
Why aren't you saying it?
♫ You are my entire life  ♫

211
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:34,707
What? I'm not going to say it.
♫ You're the reason I live ♫

212
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:35,697
Why?
♫ It's an unexplainable  ♫

213
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:39,687
It's so precious, that I can't dare say it yet.
♫  Miracle  ♫

214
00:16:40,727 --> 00:16:44,137
♫ If love is needing  ♫

215
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:47,757
Hye Jeong.
♫ my comfort  ♫

216
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:51,987
♫ Take another step closer  ♫

217
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:57,897
I'm going to do homework later. This is my last time seeing you today.
♫ Because your fragrance is nice ♫

218
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:01,377
♫ Because I'm just so happy  ♫

219
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:06,657
♫ I guess it probably now is our love  ♫

220
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:13,567
Yes, I understand.

221
00:17:14,437 --> 00:17:18,277
But Doc Bi, where did Doctor Ahn Joong Dae say he ran away to?

222
00:17:18,277 --> 00:17:21,187
It's still a mystery. A mystery.

223
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:23,527
I worried for no reason.

224
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:27,477
- You're giving Patient Lee Mi Ja the painkillers, right?
- Yes.

225
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:31,547
- Increase it by half an ampule.
- I understand.

226
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:37,847
Yeong Gook.

227
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:44,987
I thought about it.

228
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:49,317
Why? Did your feelings become confused after I did something bad to you?

229
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:54,757
A little. I don't want to question your feelings, because I'm important.

230
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:58,307
I hope we can continue to be friends.

231
00:17:58,307 --> 00:18:00,027
Okay then.

232
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:04,737
No, I changed my mind.

233
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:07,747
I'm suddenly curious about your feelings.

234
00:18:10,137 --> 00:18:14,577
I don't want to say them. We're friends anyway.

235
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:16,277
Friend.

236
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:27,637
Namyangju Guk Il Medical Center

237
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:41,817
Yes.

238
00:18:47,957 --> 00:18:53,097
You're really persistent. Aren't you tired of hearing the same thing over and over again?

239
00:18:54,937 --> 00:18:58,047
That's why I brought something new to talk about.

240
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:01,727
It seems as though you viewed my Grandmother's medical records.

241
00:19:02,447 --> 00:19:07,067
Right before you disposed of them. Why?

242
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:14,447
Medical Records Search History

243
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:17,987
You have it with you right? The anesthesia records.

244
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:19,597
Why would I have them?

245
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:21,807
If you have no intentions to take possession of them,

246
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:25,877
why did you view the medical records of a surgery you participated in 10 years ago?

247
00:19:25,877 --> 00:19:29,217
Are you someone who doesn't have anything to do?

248
00:19:29,217 --> 00:19:35,177
There's nothing that will change with your life even if you tell me, since it's beyond the statute of limitations.

249
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:40,537
I'm telling you as a doctor.

250
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,267
Give me some time to think.

251
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:56,427
Hyung. Ah, my head. Acetamin—

252
00:20:02,757 --> 00:20:05,657
Ah my head, my head.

253
00:20:14,057 --> 00:20:17,237
Kang Soo, what are you looking for?

254
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:18,817
Acetaminophen.

255
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,007
I think your head is hurting often.

256
00:20:21,007 --> 00:20:23,597
It's not that. I don't even like a little bit of pain.

257
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,427
If it seems like it'll hurt, I take medicine. If it hurts, I take medicine. It's something like that.

258
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:30,837
Ugh, you crybaby.

259
00:20:30,837 --> 00:20:35,117
Ah, move out of the way. Let's see.

260
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:36,537
Acetaminophen

261
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:38,827
- Here.
- Thank you.

262
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:40,287
Water?

263
00:20:41,257 --> 00:20:43,147
Thank you.

264
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,327
I'm all better. Hyung Yeong Gook!

265
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,807
I came to find what I ordered yesterday.

266
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:58,737
Ah, yes.

267
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:03,327
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

268
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:04,567
Have a good day.

269
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:08,927
Wow, Joong Dae, you're studying so hard. You'll become a professor at this rate.

270
00:21:08,927 --> 00:21:11,767
Even if you study like this for a 100 days, you won't get the score you want.

271
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:14,337
You need to have the previous tests.

272
00:21:14,337 --> 00:21:16,327
Hyung, do you have the previous tests?

273
00:21:16,327 --> 00:21:18,127
No.

274
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:20,217
- Do you not study?
- You won't be able to take the test.

275
00:21:20,217 --> 00:21:23,827
These are quite useless. You just need to be humiliated a few times.

276
00:21:23,827 --> 00:21:26,597
Ah, I'm hungry! Order something to eat.

277
00:21:26,597 --> 00:21:31,077
- Hey, this won't work...
- Hey!

278
00:21:31,077 --> 00:21:35,277
Since when did our neurosurgery department become so inhospitable?

279
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:39,957
You're all hungry, right?

280
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:43,797
- What in the world? What's going on?
- Wow!

281
00:21:43,797 --> 00:21:45,857
Nothing's going on.

282
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:47,537
Here, eat.

283
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:51,347
- Wow! It's going to be so delicious.
- What's going on?

284
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:54,427
- I was hungry anyway.
- I guess you noticed Professor Hong.

285
00:21:54,427 --> 00:21:56,037
Do you feel some rivalry?

286
00:21:56,037 --> 00:21:59,077
Hey, why can't you just purely accept the things I give you?

287
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:02,477
Ah, I'm purely sorry. Wow, this looks so delicious!

288
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:04,807
Wow, I'm going to record this day.

289
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:08,547
Today is the memorable first day I received food from Doctor Jeong in my 3 years here as a resident.

290
00:22:08,547 --> 00:22:13,097
Wow, you're all funny. Still, didn't I treat you all to dinner sometimes and stuff?

291
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:15,617
- I don't remember at all.
- Me either.

292
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:19,187
If we eat now, we'll remember.

293
00:22:19,187 --> 00:22:21,967
Wow, it's like I've come out of the frying pan only to jump into the fire. What?

294
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:25,827
What do you want to eat? You pig and Humpty Dumpty, Thing 1 and Thing 2.

295
00:22:27,557 --> 00:22:29,557
Humpty Dumpty? Who is Thing 1?

296
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:33,657
- 1! 1! 2! 2!
- Are you crazy?

297
00:22:33,657 --> 00:22:36,067
Ah, don't hit him! He's going to leave again.

298
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:40,347
- Do you know how tired he is?
- Hey, you're right! I'll be Thing 2, okay?

299
00:22:41,657 --> 00:22:44,527
Hey, but am I really Humpty Dumpty?

300
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:59,687
Should I help you with something?

301
00:22:59,687 --> 00:23:02,347
No, stay still.

302
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:17,347
Am I the first to eat Yoo Hye Jeong's first homemade food?

303
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:22,587
But, you're just making me taste this before you give this to Doctor Hong, aren't you?

304
00:23:22,587 --> 00:23:28,107
Hey, are you changing the genre to drama? It's a conspiracy theory and beggars are running rampant.

305
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,717
You hold grudges for a long time.

306
00:23:30,717 --> 00:23:36,377
I mean, he asked me to hide him so what could I do? He said he had no where else to go.

307
00:23:36,377 --> 00:23:40,267
- Do you accept anyone if they have nowhere to go?
- No.

308
00:23:41,217 --> 00:23:45,277
Ah, it's been such a long time since we've had time like this to ourselves.

309
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:48,467
Did something good happen today?

310
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:52,157
Nervousness is slowly disappearing from my life these days.

311
00:23:52,157 --> 00:23:55,677
Doctor Hong did a great thing.

312
00:23:55,677 --> 00:23:58,557
If you weren't here, how would I have been today?

313
00:23:58,557 --> 00:24:01,037
Vice versa.

314
00:24:01,037 --> 00:24:03,667
I think my grandma's issue will be resolved easily too.

315
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:07,157
I think the doctor who was in the surgery room at the time will tell everything.

316
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:13,437
Seo Woo came and asked me if I knew why you went to Guk Il Medical Center.

317
00:24:13,437 --> 00:24:16,907
I said I didn't know, even though I did. I can't tell her

318
00:24:16,907 --> 00:24:22,767
that your dad performed the surgery on Hye Jeong's grandma.

319
00:24:23,387 --> 00:24:26,987
Cheon Soon Hee, I like you so much.

320
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:31,737
Yoo Hye Jeong, I like you so much too.

321
00:24:33,257 --> 00:24:35,357
But you know,

322
00:24:36,427 --> 00:24:39,477
since I can't bring up the topic of your grandmother easily,

323
00:24:40,257 --> 00:24:44,347
I continuously prayed for you to be happy with Doctor Hong.

324
00:24:44,347 --> 00:24:48,287
If that happened, then I thought that you would drop your grandmother's case.

325
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:53,027
- But you didn't.
- My grandma is my grandma and Doctor Hong is Doctor Hong.

326
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:56,377
Truthfully speaking, Doctor Hong is helping me on this matter too.

327
00:24:58,727 --> 00:25:02,687
I guess I need to divorce you. We've lived together for too long.

328
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:09,737
Still, you look happy, so I'm happy too.

329
00:25:09,737 --> 00:25:11,047
Here.

330
00:25:15,687 --> 00:25:20,237
Ah, this is nice!

331
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:24,027
How are you giving Patient Kim Tae Soo his medication?

332
00:25:24,027 --> 00:25:26,107
We're giving him Rivotril (clonazepam), P.O. (orally)

333
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,237
- What about his symptoms?
- Symptoms? Just a minute.

334
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,087
Collect Call

335
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:35,407
Professor, can I take this call? It's a call from my younger brother who is in the military right now.

336
00:25:35,407 --> 00:25:38,297
Alright, I'll go down first.

337
00:25:39,627 --> 00:25:42,167
Oh, hello? Yeong Soo?

338
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,547
Yeah, are you doing well?

339
00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:48,127
I'm so busy I don't have time to visit you.

340
00:25:50,377 --> 00:25:54,327
- You heard the explanation when you signed the surgery permission form, right?
- Yes.

341
00:25:57,327 --> 00:26:00,947
The strength in your arm is still fine. Don't worry too much.

342
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:04,827
Put in a C-line (Central venous catheter). After the surgery, she'll be placed in ICU right away, so arrange a spot in advance.

343
00:26:04,827 --> 00:26:06,727
Yes.

344
00:26:06,727 --> 00:26:12,037
By the way, what are you going to do if the VVIP patient calls you when you're in surgery?

345
00:26:12,887 --> 00:26:14,987
VIP's Ward Nurse

346
00:26:17,897 --> 00:26:19,697
It's okay that I pulled you over here, right?

347
00:26:19,697 --> 00:26:21,847
Even if it's not okay, I have to say it is.

348
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:24,607
He keeps calling. Did he get worse?

349
00:26:24,607 --> 00:26:28,187
He wouldn't have called us if he got worse, he would have called Doctor Hong.

350
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,257
- Here you go.
- Yes.

351
00:26:43,747 --> 00:26:45,627
You said you have pain?

352
00:26:45,627 --> 00:26:48,087
It hurts. It hurts so much.

353
00:26:48,087 --> 00:26:50,027
How does it hurt?

354
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:52,277
Everything hurts.

355
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:56,507
You can't tell us so generally. You need to tell us your specific symptoms.

356
00:26:56,507 --> 00:27:01,817
First, the back of my head is heavy and I feel dizzy, as if my blood sugar dropped.

357
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:07,227
I feel a bit better since I'm eating.

358
00:27:08,197 --> 00:27:12,377
For now, we'll give you a painkiller shot. Please notify us if you're in pain again.

359
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:14,927
Give an order to prescribe the diclofenac shot.

360
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:17,317
Why gives orders? Just give it to me personally.

361
00:27:17,317 --> 00:27:20,637
Assemblyman, can't I be the one to give you the shot?

362
00:27:20,637 --> 00:27:23,897
- Whatever.
- I'll leave now.

363
00:27:32,047 --> 00:27:34,207
I need to give you a shot so what should I do?

364
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:36,467
Why even ask? Just give me the shot.

365
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:39,337
Not there...Your butt...

366
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,827
Give it to me.

367
00:27:49,527 --> 00:27:52,737
Neurosurgery - Kang Gyeong Joon

368
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,917
- Yeah?
- The patient is still in the process of receiving anesthesia.

369
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:57,877
I think you'll need to wait a little.

370
00:27:57,877 --> 00:28:03,087
Alright. I'll go in after transferring the VVIP patient to Doctor Jin Seo Woo. Yeah.

371
00:28:11,977 --> 00:28:16,687
I have to go into a surgery right now, it'll take around five hours.

372
00:28:16,687 --> 00:28:20,637
Assemblyman Na Min Soo is calling me to his ward too often, so look after him in place of me.

373
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:22,077
I have to go to a seminar soon.

374
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:24,727
I'll be finished with the surgery and out before you leave.

375
00:28:24,727 --> 00:28:26,657
The director said a fellow should take care of him.

376
00:28:26,657 --> 00:28:29,057
I said I can't. I have to look at this.

377
00:28:29,057 --> 00:28:31,587
Look. You can look at that while you wait to be called.

378
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:34,737
He has a mid-back sprain, and the beginning stage of a disc. We all need to make a living, right?

379
00:28:34,737 --> 00:28:36,947
I'll take it that you'll manage him. I have to go into surgery now.

380
00:28:36,947 --> 00:28:39,237
Hey! Hey!

381
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:47,397
Yes, I understand.

382
00:28:47,397 --> 00:28:51,787
I'm going into surgery right now so if there's a problem with the Assemblyman, please call Doctor Jin Seo Woo.

383
00:28:51,787 --> 00:28:53,597
I understand.

384
00:28:56,127 --> 00:29:00,017
Goodness, these frustrating people. Tsk, tsk.

385
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:08,957
Seo Woo

386
00:29:15,677 --> 00:29:17,967
Yeah, what?

387
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:19,597
Be on call for Assemblyman Na Min Soo.

388
00:29:19,597 --> 00:29:21,867
That's the responsibility of the fellows.

389
00:29:21,867 --> 00:29:23,587
Ah, Hye Jeong is in a surgery right now and I have to leave.

390
00:29:23,587 --> 00:29:26,217
I think she keeps pushing stuff onto me because I'm here.

391
00:29:26,217 --> 00:29:29,467
I stayed up all night being on duty.

392
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:34,127
While I was on duty, there were three emergency surgeries. Can you take it easy on me?

393
00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:37,307
There isn't anyone except you I can trust and leave this to.

394
00:29:51,297 --> 00:29:53,747
What are you doing?

395
00:29:53,747 --> 00:29:55,357
Ah, I was planning to get some sleep.

396
00:29:55,357 --> 00:29:58,067
Don't sleep. Be on call for Assemblyman Na Min Soo.

397
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:00,357
- I already went to him earlier.
- Really?

398
00:30:00,357 --> 00:30:03,107
Then you can continue to watch him.

399
00:30:03,107 --> 00:30:07,207
Ah, I'm going to sleep. You, get out!

400
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:11,277
You still aren't qualified to get some sleep yet.

401
00:30:13,747 --> 00:30:16,277
Ah, that's right! I need to do another dressing.

402
00:30:24,007 --> 00:30:26,017
Assemblyman, what's wrong?

403
00:30:26,937 --> 00:30:29,587
Call a doctor! Quickly.

404
00:30:30,727 --> 00:30:34,677
Why am I suddenly like this? Ah, my head, my head.

405
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:38,897
I'm going to check your blood pressure.

406
00:30:39,677 --> 00:30:41,967
Why am I feeling like this all of a sudden?

407
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:53,837
Neurosurgery - Jin Seo Woo.

408
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,837
Put cotton here.

409
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:18,787
VIP Ward's Nurse

410
00:31:18,787 --> 00:31:22,807
The nurse from VIP room keeps calling you.

411
00:31:24,387 --> 00:31:25,857
Let's concentrate here.

412
00:31:25,857 --> 00:31:27,277
Yes.

413
00:31:28,317 --> 00:31:30,097
Micro scissors.

414
00:31:32,177 --> 00:31:34,117
Hello.

415
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:40,177
Yes?

416
00:31:40,177 --> 00:31:44,907
Doctor, Assemblyman Na complains of a severe headache and his blood pressure is 170/100.

417
00:31:44,907 --> 00:31:47,407
And he's saying that his bowel movement and migraines have worsened, as well.

418
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:50,307
What are you doing? Get a doctor here now!

419
00:31:50,307 --> 00:31:53,407
Hurry. He keeps calling for a doctor!

420
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:02,477
Doctor! Dr. Choi Kang Soo!

421
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:06,507
Are you listening? Please come to the VIP room immediately!

422
00:32:15,177 --> 00:32:16,777
ER Jeong Yoon Tae

423
00:32:16,777 --> 00:32:19,237
Aish.

424
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,467
What, what, what?

425
00:32:22,947 --> 00:32:26,617
That trauma semicoma patient? Alright, I'll be right there.

426
00:32:33,037 --> 00:32:37,147
He was complaining about nausea and headache, and his pulse suddenly dropped.

427
00:32:44,277 --> 00:32:46,867
- I'm going to do an intubation.
- Okay.

428
00:32:58,147 --> 00:33:00,807
Operating Room

429
00:33:06,267 --> 00:33:09,087
5 Missed Calls: VIP Room Nurse

430
00:33:11,817 --> 00:33:13,847
Assemblyman Na MinSoo's pulse dropped.

431
00:33:13,847 --> 00:33:17,637
Dr. Choi Kang Soo said he would come, but he didn't.

432
00:33:24,597 --> 00:33:25,567
What happened?

433
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:28,797
Let's talk after saving the patient first. Prepare for SOC. (Suboccipital Craniotomy)

434
00:33:28,797 --> 00:33:30,377
Yes.

435
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:45,237
School Records, Yoo Hye Jeong

436
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:55,127
This is very interesting.

437
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:03,867
Assemblyman Na Min Soo is unconscious.

438
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,137
What? Why?

439
00:34:05,137 --> 00:34:08,637
After going to the washroom, he complained about headache, and suddenly fell unconscious.

440
00:34:08,637 --> 00:34:10,887
What's the attending doctor doing at that time?

441
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:15,217
They say that Fellow Yoo Hye Jeong left the call to Jin Seo Woo and went into surgery.

442
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:17,607
Why would Seo Woo be involved in this?!

443
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:20,487
I heard Professor Hong Ji Hong did an emergency surgery.

444
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:24,747
We're in trouble. If the media gets a hold of this, they'll play it big. Block this incident, now!

445
00:34:24,747 --> 00:34:26,327
Yes.

446
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:30,007
What bad luck... We were recently investigated for tax evasion, unethical recruiting practice...

447
00:34:30,007 --> 00:34:33,687
To cover all that up, I ran around putting on a show cleaning up our image. That's useless now.

448
00:34:33,687 --> 00:34:35,587
Which operating room is it?

449
00:34:40,957 --> 00:34:42,077
Are you prepared?

450
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:44,567
Yes, we can start right away.

451
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:47,837
Dr. Yoo Hye Jeong?

452
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:53,367
Where are you going?

453
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:56,567
As the attending doctor, you didn't take care of the patient properly and put him in that state.

454
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:59,387
How are you going to be responsible for this?

455
00:34:59,387 --> 00:35:01,537
I will take responsibility.

456
00:35:01,537 --> 00:35:03,317
Assemblyman Na Min Soo is my patient.

457
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:06,957
Of course, that's how it should be. Go in now.

458
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:09,437
Dr. Yoo Hye Jeong shouldn't do the surgery as the assistant.

459
00:35:09,437 --> 00:35:14,017
He's my patient. I will accept the consequences after the surgery.

460
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:15,097
No, you can't do that.

461
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:16,937
She can.

462
00:35:16,937 --> 00:35:21,197
I am the doctor in charge. I can decide on who is my assistant.

463
00:35:21,197 --> 00:35:23,487
Go in and prepare, Dr. Yoo.

464
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:33,077
Fine. I was also a surgeon. I'll let you have the privilege as a surgeon.

465
00:35:33,077 --> 00:35:37,167
- However, a privilege is accompanied with responsibilities. You know that right?
- I know that.

466
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:41,317
Then please save him. That's what I really want.

467
00:35:49,017 --> 00:35:54,177
- I heard Dr. Yoo is the attending doctor of Patient Na and you're helping her.
- Yes.

468
00:35:54,177 --> 00:35:56,567
But how did things like this happen?

469
00:35:56,567 --> 00:36:00,637
If you had gone there a bit earlier, things wouldn't have been this bad.

470
00:36:00,637 --> 00:36:01,747
I'm sorry.

471
00:36:01,747 --> 00:36:06,007
Just tell me the facts! This is an situation that threatens the whole neurosurgery team.

472
00:36:06,007 --> 00:36:08,167
Chief, I don't know anything.

473
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:11,507
It's true that I was checking in on the Assemblyman Na's room as Dr. Yoo Hye Jeong's assistant, but—

474
00:36:11,507 --> 00:36:13,877
The VIP room nurse called you.

475
00:36:13,877 --> 00:36:16,877
She said you told her that you'll be there, and wasted time waiting for you.

476
00:36:16,877 --> 00:36:20,157
No, I really didn't receive a call.

477
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:29,577
Irrigation.

478
00:36:50,227 --> 00:36:52,767
What kind of unexpected situation is this?

479
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:56,437
Assemblyman Na Min Soo is someone who could become a presidential candidate.

480
00:36:56,437 --> 00:36:57,757
I am blocking the media.

481
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,127
If this thing gets out, it'll be big news.

482
00:37:00,127 --> 00:37:04,857
What is this? There's no peaceful time. None.

483
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:06,787
Elevator.

484
00:37:11,127 --> 00:37:12,927
Put on my gown.

485
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,737
Give me the bipolar.

486
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:35,137
Prepare the sutures.

487
00:37:48,797 --> 00:37:50,587
Edison tweezers.

488
00:37:57,657 --> 00:37:59,987
Give me the microscope.

489
00:38:05,707 --> 00:38:07,437
Put cottonoid there.

490
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:13,727
Clean this area here.

491
00:38:22,257 --> 00:38:24,507
Get the hemostat ready.

492
00:38:35,697 --> 00:38:37,307
Cottonoid.

493
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,577
What's happening now?

494
00:38:54,577 --> 00:38:56,527
Checking if the bleeding has stopped.

495
00:38:56,527 --> 00:38:58,947
If it keeps on bleeding, then it's the end.

496
00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:02,307
Just stop talking. We're all watching right now.

497
00:39:08,887 --> 00:39:11,017
The bleeding stopped.

498
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:12,697
That's fortunate.

499
00:39:12,697 --> 00:39:15,187
I think they stopped the bleed.

500
00:39:16,657 --> 00:39:18,857
The brain edema is getting worse.

501
00:39:28,587 --> 00:39:31,827
It's fine. Increased blood flow can cause swelling.

502
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:35,037
What's that?

503
00:39:35,037 --> 00:39:39,487
Father, stay put. Every time you say something I get nervous.

504
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:41,187
Okay, I got it.

505
00:39:41,897 --> 00:39:43,667
It's swollen due to an increased blood flow.

506
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:47,757
It will subside once the Cisterna Magna drains and the cerebrospinal fluid flows to the spinal cord.

507
00:39:47,757 --> 00:39:50,267
Does that mean it's a success?

508
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:51,977
Yes.

509
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:55,857
Suction.

510
00:39:57,447 --> 00:39:59,747
Bring suction up, please.

511
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:03,407
Bring it up!

512
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:10,677
The cerebrospinal fluid has been removed from the spinal cord.

513
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:18,857
It has subsided.

514
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:20,807
It's all finished.

515
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:28,127
Good work. Close the epidural.

516
00:40:28,127 --> 00:40:29,647
Yes.

517
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:34,667
Professor Hong, finish it up.

518
00:40:37,427 --> 00:40:40,687
Don't leave it to the assistant who messed up.

519
00:40:46,837 --> 00:40:48,537
Continue.

520
00:41:40,487 --> 00:41:45,237
Check on him every hour and notify me when he regains consciousness.

521
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:47,377
Isn't there a way to wake him up?

522
00:41:49,067 --> 00:41:51,717
As of now, all we can do is wait.

523
00:41:59,227 --> 00:42:02,857
That's all until he wakes up.

524
00:42:02,857 --> 00:42:04,337
Yes.

525
00:42:17,457 --> 00:42:19,277
What brings you here?

526
00:42:19,277 --> 00:42:22,317
I thought that something happened to you.

527
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:27,067
I walk an indecent path right? Take a seat.

528
00:42:29,497 --> 00:42:32,747
That's Kang Soo. I called him because I had to ask him some things.

529
00:42:32,747 --> 00:42:34,317
Come in.

530
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:46,007
We have to come to a conclusion based on facts alone. That's my motto.

531
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:49,027
Now, let's organize.

532
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:52,227
There's some time in between. The nurse in the VIP patient room

533
00:42:52,227 --> 00:42:55,637
called Doctor Jin and because she didn't pick up, she called Doctor Yoo.

534
00:42:55,637 --> 00:42:58,547
Since she didn't pick up either, she called you.

535
00:42:58,547 --> 00:43:00,187
Why didn't you immediately go up after receiving the call?

536
00:43:00,187 --> 00:43:02,427
Ah, so...

537
00:43:02,427 --> 00:43:07,757
I'm about to go crazy because I never received a call from the VIP patient room.

538
00:43:07,757 --> 00:43:09,397
- Kang Soo.
- Yes?

539
00:43:09,397 --> 00:43:11,817
I'm not trying to criticize you right now.

540
00:43:11,817 --> 00:43:13,657
This problem isn't the fault of one person.

541
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,477
This involves all of the fellows in the Neurosurgery Department.

542
00:43:16,477 --> 00:43:18,947
I'm doing this so all of us can survive together.

543
00:43:21,507 --> 00:43:24,707
So, I'm really telling you the truth right now.

544
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:41,937
Is a ghost pranking me? She really did call me...

545
00:43:41,937 --> 00:43:42,987
I'm telling you she did.

546
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,827
No, this is an error!

547
00:43:47,037 --> 00:43:49,357
Just a minute, let me check.

548
00:43:50,767 --> 00:43:55,487
VIP ward nurse

549
00:44:01,207 --> 00:44:03,097
She called you, didn't she?

550
00:44:04,787 --> 00:44:06,187
Yes.

551
00:44:07,127 --> 00:44:11,017
Do you have some sort of problem in your brain? Why can't you remember?

552
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:15,957
I'm really sorry.

553
00:44:15,957 --> 00:44:17,957
I'll go and tell them.

554
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:22,027
No, it's my responsibility. It was something I was put in charge of in the first place.

555
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:24,527
There's nothing you have to take responsibility for.

556
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:32,787
Director's Secretary's Officr

557
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:37,917
Yes, this is Yoo Hye Jeong.

558
00:44:37,917 --> 00:44:40,547
The Director wants you to come up.

559
00:44:48,047 --> 00:44:51,527
Now, let's talk about what happened.

560
00:44:51,527 --> 00:44:52,907
I'll take responsibility.

561
00:44:52,907 --> 00:44:55,527
I like your attitude.

562
00:44:55,527 --> 00:45:00,057
I'm going to follow the rules, open a disciplinary committee, and make you take responsibility for your actions.

563
00:45:01,037 --> 00:45:04,897
I don't know what you think of me, but I'm that type of person.

564
00:45:04,897 --> 00:45:07,667
Reasonable and generous.

565
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:10,027
I already let you off the hook last time.

566
00:45:11,427 --> 00:45:13,107
Not this time.

567
00:45:13,107 --> 00:45:14,967
I understand.

568
00:45:30,587 --> 00:45:32,447
What happened?

569
00:45:34,987 --> 00:45:38,167
Doctor Yoo is going to go to a disciplinary committee.

570
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:43,117
It's hard to cover. The neurosurgery department and the fellows are all affiliated.

571
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:44,687
They just need a sacrificial lamb.

572
00:45:44,687 --> 00:45:48,557
That's not it. It's true that Doctor Yoo was the doctor-in-charge.

573
00:45:48,557 --> 00:45:52,027
Even if he wasn't an emergency patient, she still shouldn't have left him

574
00:45:52,027 --> 00:45:54,977
or she could have ordered her many friends to notify her if something happened.

575
00:45:54,977 --> 00:45:59,997
It can't be for the disciplinary committee though. If she is referred because of this matter, it's not common as a doctor.

576
00:45:59,997 --> 00:46:02,217
Do you think I don't know that?

577
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:07,527
Still, we can't turn this into a problem of the neurosurgery department itself.

578
00:46:15,867 --> 00:46:19,627
Why are you coming out from there? By any chance, are you coming from the fellow's room?

579
00:46:19,627 --> 00:46:22,827
-Yeah.
-So you could meet Hye Jeong and console her?

580
00:46:22,827 --> 00:46:24,727
If I can be of comfort.

581
00:46:24,727 --> 00:46:26,627
Why do something so useless?

582
00:46:26,627 --> 00:46:30,327
Do that to her for a hundred days; she'll still continue to only love Hong Ji Hong.

583
00:46:30,327 --> 00:46:32,877
It's love because it's useless.

584
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:35,307
You had a pure love side to you too?

585
00:46:35,307 --> 00:46:38,447
I did, it was deeply asleep inside my heart.

586
00:46:38,447 --> 00:46:41,347
Ah, I don't know. I don't know anymore! I have no interest in Doctor Yoo.

587
00:46:41,347 --> 00:46:43,437
You're really pathetic.

588
00:46:43,437 --> 00:46:47,157
Do you not even hate Hye Jeong? She won't accept your feelings for her.

589
00:46:47,157 --> 00:46:51,217
I do what I want and she does what she wants.

590
00:46:51,217 --> 00:46:54,637
Everyone is going to do what they want, so what?

591
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:13,127
You're here?

592
00:47:18,277 --> 00:47:22,317
We can't make Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong take responsibility for this alone.

593
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:23,707
I know.

594
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:26,517
Ugh, it would be nice if Assemblyman Na Min Soo woke up quickly.

595
00:47:26,517 --> 00:47:28,967
If he doesn't, it'll really get complicated.

596
00:47:28,967 --> 00:47:33,257
Isn't a little unfair though? How can you know they have hypertension caused by cerebral hemorrhage before they faint?

597
00:47:33,257 --> 00:47:34,497
You can only know after they faint.

598
00:47:34,497 --> 00:47:35,737
It didn't even show up on the exam results.

599
00:47:35,737 --> 00:47:37,427
How are they asking us to take responsibility?

600
00:47:37,427 --> 00:47:39,797
I know, they're asking us to take all sorts of responsibility.

601
00:47:39,797 --> 00:47:41,857
He can just recover from the surgery.

602
00:47:41,857 --> 00:47:43,237
Right.

603
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:02,677
Sleep, sleep!

604
00:48:08,697 --> 00:48:11,317
I think you have headaches often.

605
00:48:12,577 --> 00:48:14,327
Yes, Doctor.

606
00:48:15,827 --> 00:48:19,537
Do you have a problem in your brain? Why can't you remember?

607
00:48:26,817 --> 00:48:29,157
CT Reception

608
00:48:38,297 --> 00:48:41,137
One shot, one shot, one shot!

609
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:56,917
Hyungnim.

610
00:48:56,917 --> 00:48:58,857
Oh, you're here?

611
00:49:01,327 --> 00:49:04,247
I have a favor to ask you.

612
00:49:04,247 --> 00:49:06,097
What kind of favor?

613
00:50:19,537 --> 00:50:21,437
Yes?

614
00:50:21,437 --> 00:50:22,817
Professor.

615
00:50:22,817 --> 00:50:25,277
Kang Soo, what brings you here?

616
00:50:25,277 --> 00:50:27,737
- I have something to ask you. Do you have time.
- Yeah,

617
00:50:27,737 --> 00:50:29,587
I have time. Sit down.

618
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:35,827
These are the CT scans and MRI pictures my friend sent me. I was wondering if you could take a look.

619
00:50:35,827 --> 00:50:39,537
If he took a CT scan, he should have a doctor-in-charge.

620
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:45,747
Since he's scared and uneasy, I think he's looking into other hospitals aside from the one he usually visits.

621
00:50:45,747 --> 00:50:48,417
Can't you make a judgment?

622
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:52,417
I can. It looks like it's meningioma. (A tumor in the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord .)

623
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:55,197
There is an meningioma near the sphenoid bone.

624
00:50:55,197 --> 00:50:57,287
It's quite big too.

625
00:50:58,607 --> 00:51:01,917
I think he has absence seizure too.
( Short periods of blanking out or staring into space.)

626
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:06,527
He said he blacks out often by himself and often can't remember things.

627
00:51:06,527 --> 00:51:10,127
It seems like the meningioma is combined with absence seizure. It is a bit unique.

628
00:51:10,127 --> 00:51:13,567
Hey, tell him to hurry and get treated. Is he a close friend?

629
00:51:45,287 --> 00:51:51,257
I came after meeting the director. He said that he would proceed with this situation in a legal manner.

630
00:51:51,257 --> 00:51:53,757
I was planning on seeing the director after I met you.

631
00:51:53,757 --> 00:51:57,277
I wish that you wouldn't request anything of the director.

632
00:51:57,277 --> 00:52:01,797
I'm not doing this because it's you. I would have done the same if anyone went through what you just did.

633
00:52:01,797 --> 00:52:05,997
I want to keep my pride, at least in front of him.

634
00:52:07,267 --> 00:52:11,317
I was the doctor-in-charge. It was my fault.

635
00:52:12,177 --> 00:52:16,457
I met Chief Kim Chi Hyeon. His attitude changed a bit.

636
00:52:16,457 --> 00:52:20,717
I have hope that my grandma's medical accident might be uncovered soon.

637
00:52:20,717 --> 00:52:23,597
That's a relief.

638
00:52:23,597 --> 00:52:29,837
For a person who likes to settle issues in a legal way, I want to respond in a similar manner.

639
00:52:31,087 --> 00:52:36,207
I hope you would just watch how I handle these things.

640
00:52:36,207 --> 00:52:38,657
I know, but that's not easy for me.

641
00:52:39,347 --> 00:52:43,937
Not doing anything in this situation is hard for me.

642
00:52:47,837 --> 00:52:50,747
What did I say for you to do if this happens?

643
00:52:50,747 --> 00:52:53,287
I definitely told you.

644
00:52:54,517 --> 00:52:56,617
I can't do it here.

645
00:52:57,627 --> 00:53:00,357
You can do it at a place without people.

646
00:53:26,137 --> 00:53:27,377
Doc.

647
00:53:27,377 --> 00:53:29,757
That's right. Someone will come.

648
00:53:36,567 --> 00:53:42,467
It has been learned that Assemblyman Na Min Soo after surgery for a brain hemorrhage is unconscious.

649
00:53:42,537 --> 00:53:45,337
Guk Il Medical Center claims that appropriate treatment method has been used.

650
00:53:45,337 --> 00:53:48,947
After a successful surgery, they insist that he is in the recovery phase.

651
00:53:48,947 --> 00:53:52,437
But his slower than usual recovery is causing concern.

652
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:55,317
What is the exact diagnosis of Assemblyman Na Min Soo?

653
00:53:55,317 --> 00:53:58,277
It is a brain hemorrhage caused by hypertension.

654
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:01,207
For a long period of time, the brain capillaries have been damaged.

655
00:54:01,207 --> 00:54:04,257
The small vessels could not endure the pressure. And as they ruptured,

656
00:54:04,257 --> 00:54:08,877
without any other contributing factors, it caused a hemorrhage in the brain.

657
00:54:09,887 --> 00:54:13,307
How is Na Min Soo's condition? Is it possible that he will awake?

658
00:54:13,307 --> 00:54:17,117
The surgery has ended successfully. We are monitoring his progress now.

659
00:54:17,117 --> 00:54:20,547
You say that you are monitoring the progress, but I heard that he's still unconscious.

660
00:54:20,547 --> 00:54:23,267
This is an expected finding in a brain hemorrhage patient.

661
00:54:23,267 --> 00:54:28,907
As of now, we cannot tell you anything for certain. Thank you.

662
00:54:50,347 --> 00:54:53,717
He improved from a mental semi-coma to a stupor.

663
00:55:01,117 --> 00:55:03,347
It's all done now.

664
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:07,357
Continue to check his vitals and redo dressings on time.

665
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:11,477
We've returned to a state where we can be relieved.

666
00:55:11,477 --> 00:55:15,097
You worked hard. Ah seriously.

667
00:55:15,097 --> 00:55:21,037
With this opportunity, I'm going to set the new discipline of this hospital. Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong will be the example.

668
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:48,727
Why did you call me?

669
00:55:48,727 --> 00:55:51,937
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

670
00:55:51,937 --> 00:55:56,387
It's not your fault. Something that should have happened to me just happened to me.

671
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:58,797
I'll take all the responsibility.

672
00:55:59,517 --> 00:56:02,007
Do you think anyone can take responsibility?

673
00:56:02,007 --> 00:56:06,327
I'm taking responsibility because it's me. Because I'm quite successful.

674
00:56:08,847 --> 00:56:13,057
As expected, your comforting is different.

675
00:56:13,057 --> 00:56:18,007
Thank you for realizing this is my comfort. Don't worry.

676
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:20,647
I'm going to be punished.

677
00:56:56,487 --> 00:56:59,697
Incoming Collect Call

678
00:56:59,697 --> 00:57:04,037
Yeah, Yeong Soo. Can you talk now?

679
00:57:06,787 --> 00:57:11,527
Why are you calling me saying you saw Grandma in your dream?

680
00:57:15,837 --> 00:57:17,937
It's a silly dream. Just a silly dream.

681
00:57:19,907 --> 00:57:22,817
Nothing's wrong with me. Don't worry.

682
00:57:27,307 --> 00:57:32,147
Don't even go to dangerous places.

683
00:57:34,307 --> 00:57:38,287
Don't get discouraged, okay?

684
00:57:43,457 --> 00:57:45,237
Yeong Soo.

685
00:57:47,087 --> 00:57:51,497
You know, I...think about you a lot, right?

686
00:58:22,357 --> 00:58:26,927
Ad Hoc Disciplinary Committee Meeting

687
00:59:01,197 --> 00:59:02,927
As danger comes closer,

688
00:59:02,927 --> 00:59:07,457
I feel as if I'm one step closer to the truth I'm searching for.

689
00:59:07,457 --> 00:59:10,267
I have to turn danger into an opportunity.
