1
00:00:29,787 --> 00:00:33,907
Entering someone's life means not asking about the scars

2
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:37,997
they don't tell me or can't tell me about.

3
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:40,607
Being by their side and not asking.

4
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,707
First, I have to find out what the scar is.

5
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,297
Yes, welcome!

6
00:00:54,297 --> 00:00:56,247
Ah, Doctor!

7
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:58,467
- Have you been well?
- You came!

8
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:00,467
I thought of the rice soup that Granny made for me.

9
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:06,417
It doesn't matter why! Anyone who is close with our Hye Jeong is always welcome!

10
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:09,467
I'm not going to dine in, but I'll take three orders to go.

11
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:12,337
Then wait a moment. I'll bring it right out.

12
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:16,487
By the way, you know Doctor Jeong Yoon Do right?

13
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:17,467
Yes.

14
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:19,307
He came.

15
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:25,067
Please give me a lot of seasoned red-pepper sauce.

16
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:26,887
Okay.

17
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:31,977
You knew about this place, too?

18
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:36,127
Yes. That's when I scored a lot of points.

19
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:39,377
You still haven't given up?

20
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:43,517
I wish there was a zipper on my heart

21
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:45,237
so I could open and close it whenever I want.

22
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:47,797
I figured out the reason you were rejected.

23
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:52,087
That zipper on your heart stuff, don't say things like that.

24
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:54,587
There's no reason for the rejection.

25
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:57,017
It was because the freedom to choose was taken away.

26
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:59,537
The take-out is here.

27
00:02:00,157 --> 00:02:03,837
Here. I packed yours, too.

28
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:05,417
Thank you.

29
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:12,687
You went to my father?

30
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:15,267
I went to Granny's Rice Soup.

31
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:16,567
That's the same thing.

32
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:19,137
That isn't the same thing. The purpose is different.

33
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:22,207
I went to buy rice soup. You said that was okay.

34
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:28,707
I did, but thinking that you met my father again, I don't feel too good.

35
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:31,997
You saying that it makes you feel bad makes me feel bad.

36
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:35,597
- Why are you like that?
- What?

37
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:38,487
Why don't you let yourself lose to me?

38
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:44,597
Because I keep losing to you, you don't understand the significance of it.

39
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,837
In the midst of all this, you know you really seem like a teacher?

40
00:02:46,837 --> 00:02:49,987
My career is being a teacher. Of course I'm like a teacher.

41
00:02:49,987 --> 00:02:51,167
Teacher!

42
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:55,397
You need to experience it too! The mental pain and confusion I had to go through because of you...

43
00:02:55,397 --> 00:02:57,257
You have to experience it once too.

44
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:59,857
People really don't change.

45
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:02,097
You still hold grudges like you used to.

46
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:05,537
Look who's talking. You're the same.

47
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:08,617
Eat.

48
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:24,627
I told you to start tapering (slowly lessening medication to prevent withdrawal) the steroids. Why haven't you done it?

49
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:28,457
I was going to tell Kang Soo to do it, but the emergency room was really busy...

50
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:32,417
Is Kang Soo the only one in the neurosurgery department? If Kang Soo was busy, you should have done it yourself.

51
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:36,037
You're still apprenticing. Are you already getting used to receiving notifications and sending orders?

52
00:03:36,037 --> 00:03:37,067
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:41,577
Do you always have to do your work like crap and piss people off so early in the morning?

54
00:03:41,577 --> 00:03:44,787
It shouldn't adversely affect Hae's radiation therapy. Let it go.

55
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:50,127
Hurry up and find Joong Dae. Or make sure the place runs smoothly even without him.

56
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:51,697
Let's go.

57
00:03:56,507 --> 00:03:58,407
Joong Dae, this brat. Where in the world is he?

58
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:03,737
♫ Tonight, tomorrow night, la la la la ♫

59
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:05,397
Ah, that surprised me.

60
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:08,577
- What are you doing right now?
- I'm cleaning.

61
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:12,637
Are you not going to the hospital? I think it's already been two days...

62
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:16,087
I'm not going back. They're not going to make a huge deal just because I disappeared.

63
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:18,707
I'm going to receive healing here for a week, and then I'm going home.

64
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:20,847
You're going to receive healing, here?

65
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:23,077
Yes, it's comfortable here.

66
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:25,747
What should I do after I finish cleaning?

67
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:26,877
Did you eat?

68
00:04:26,877 --> 00:04:29,577
Of course. I opened your fridge and ate.

69
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,517
Why are you opening someone else's fridge whenever you want?

70
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:36,587
I did that because you locked the door and left, so I couldn't leave. Was I supposed to starve to death?

71
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:39,537
Did I tell you to die?! You could have called and asked me to open the door!

72
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:43,797
Then what if I'm caught by Doctor Yoo? She'll drag me to the hospital.

73
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:46,697
I can just directly tell Hye Jeong.

74
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:48,677
You wouldn't do that.

75
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:52,147
I think you're that kind of person.

76
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:55,107
Someone who doesn't snitch. Shh.

77
00:04:56,337 --> 00:05:01,137
T-Then, just work hard! Think of it as your housing fee!

78
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:02,817
Scrub scrub scrub!

79
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:07,337
Scrubbing, scrubbing, scrubbing!!

80
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,277
You came?

81
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,037
I'm going crazy because Joong Dae isn't here.

82
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:13,657
That's how it is originally.

83
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:15,917
How could he not come in without a word?

84
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:18,517
- We heard from him.
- Really?

85
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:23,267
I can no longer tolerate defamation of character.

86
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:26,407
Hyung, I was grateful. I won't come back again.

87
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:29,927
What the? Who insulted him?

88
00:05:31,037 --> 00:05:32,217
Me?

89
00:05:32,217 --> 00:05:35,617
- Yes. Chief, you're too old-school.
- I am?

90
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:37,757
What time are we in? How could you hit him?

91
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:39,237
Hey, that was all for your good—

92
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:43,307
For people's good, you set them straight without hitting them, like Yeong Gook.

93
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:45,227
I let you guys get away with too much.

94
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:48,817
How is it a second year is running away when even a first year isn't?

95
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:51,837
Exactly. That's why you should have been nicer to him! You were always hitting him in his stomach!

96
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:53,627
Oh my goodness!

97
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:56,007
It's so easy to make someone out to be the bad guy in a split second.

98
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,917
The person who ran away is in the wrong.

99
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:00,897
I'm the one who really wants to leave!

100
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:10,347
Oh my oh my... Try and call Joong Dae.

101
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,407
- Hi.
- Hi!

102
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:23,327
For Hae and for Dal.

103
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:25,287
Hae, do you feel good today?

104
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:27,127
Yes.

105
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:30,897
Hae, you know you're starting radiation therapy with me today, right?

106
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:32,467
Yes.

107
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:35,877
You're going to wear a helmet like your favorite robots and lie down.

108
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:39,007
You can do it for around 30-40 minutes right?

109
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,067
Yes.

110
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,817
Since today's the first day, shall we say "fighting" together?

111
00:06:46,217 --> 00:06:47,937
I'll see you later.

112
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:57,697
Did Nam Dal and Nam Hae's guardian come?

113
00:06:57,697 --> 00:07:01,457
He needs to pay for the surgery and hospitalization fee, but I can't get in contact with him.

114
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:03,017
I think he's coming in the evening.

115
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:05,437
If you see him, please give us a call at the administrative department.

116
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:06,927
Okay.

117
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:10,647
"I'll Do It For You Ahjussi" is so pitiful.

118
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:14,607
I heard his wife died of cancer, so he's left with a lot of debt.

119
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:17,747
And on top of that he's got his babies' hospitalization fees too.

120
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:19,107
Should we go?

121
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:20,817
Hello.

122
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,807
For Nam Dal's post surgery pain,

123
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:26,407
I've prescribed some pain relievers, and he barely has any pain.

124
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:27,737
Any paroxysmal episodes (spasms or seizures) post-surgery?

125
00:07:27,737 --> 00:07:30,007
There were none. What are you doing after rounds?

126
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:32,847
I have to meet the chief to talk about a project we're working on.

127
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:34,037
What project is it?

128
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,337
DBS (deep brain stimulation) dopamine sensor project.

129
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:38,517
What is that?

130
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:42,287
If it goes well, we can turn around the hospital's authority.

131
00:08:01,307 --> 00:08:04,917
Hae, Dal, we came.

132
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,917
Doctor!

133
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:11,387
Come slowly.

134
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:13,657
Dal, what were you doing?

135
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:15,037
Waiting for Dad.

136
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,097
Dal, does it hurt a lot?

137
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,447
It hurts, here.

138
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:20,577
A lot?

139
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:23,157
No, not that much.

140
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:25,267
How do you know, when it's your brother who's in pain?

141
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:27,787
I know everything. Right?

142
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:30,567
Yes, Hyung knows everything.

143
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:34,327
Because we do everything together. Right?

144
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:37,107
My dad told me to take good care of my brother

145
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:39,977
when Dad isn't around. Right?

146
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:44,607
Yes, he said to listen to Hyung, when he isn't around.

147
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,197
- Right?
- Right?

148
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:47,967
Jinx.

149
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:53,567
They're not feeling nauseous or anything?

150
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,997
Yes, they eat well.

151
00:08:55,997 --> 00:08:58,327
It would be nice to see their dad. Did he go somewhere?

152
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:02,947
During the day he manages a parking garage, and he's started a night job as a substitute driver.

153
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:09,297
Yes, yes.

154
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:14,507
Go safely.

155
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:20,697
Guk Il Medical Center Administrative Office

156
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:24,667
Yes, hello?

157
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:28,087
This is the Guk Il Medical Center Administrative Office. You're Nam Hae and Nam Dal's guardian, right?

158
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:29,857
Yes, that's right.

159
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:32,327
The surgery and hospitalization fees haven't been cleared.

160
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:35,687
Just the surgery fees alone are going to be about twenty million won (about $18,000).

161
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:40,197
The total hospital fee will depend on their hospitalization time and the treatment they receive.

162
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:42,217
Yes, I'll pay as soon as possible.

163
00:09:42,217 --> 00:09:45,557
When you come by the hospital, please stop by the administrative department.

164
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:47,837
Yes, I understand.

165
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:11,047
What brings you here?

166
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:14,277
He's Dal's older brother. I have rights to the patient's brother too.

167
00:10:14,277 --> 00:10:15,067
Nosy.

168
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:18,247
I believe doctors should be a bit nosy.

169
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:23,587
Be quiet. Must you say something like that at this very moment? You have no common sense.

170
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:26,617
I do think Doctor Jeong lacks some common sense.

171
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:31,907
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong, the way I see it, you have a tendency to only exempt yourself.

172
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:40,037
The broadcasting team is here.

173
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,587
The doctor is going to be here very soon.

174
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:48,577
Oh, Doctor.

175
00:10:48,577 --> 00:10:50,927
This is the producer of Focus People.

176
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:54,937
Hello. I'm Focus People's Kim Do Jin.

177
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,937
I'll be leaving now.

178
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:59,497
I'm going to die because of the Hyung Joong Dae.

179
00:10:59,497 --> 00:11:01,457
Work hard.

180
00:11:01,457 --> 00:11:02,527
Please have a seat.

181
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,747
I think I'm supposed to say that.

182
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,777
Oh, you're right. This is your place.

183
00:11:07,777 --> 00:11:09,437
How will you proceed?

184
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:11,637
Dopamine Sensor Development Project
Once the DBS dopamine sensor is developed,

185
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,687
instead of the standard treatment for those with hand tremors,

186
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:18,277
it will be less of a burden on them. Yes.

187
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,767
I'll let you know the details once I discuss everything with Doctor Hong Ji Hong.

188
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:23,437
Yes.

189
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,857
The MH Med-Tech said that they'll take on the project.

190
00:11:29,497 --> 00:11:32,267
On the condition that if they give us more money for research and funding,

191
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,017
they want both the patent grant and the royalties.

192
00:11:34,017 --> 00:11:36,387
Give them that then. How much did they say they could invest?

193
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:38,157
Six-trillion won.

194
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:44,167
Oh, that's good. Attend the upcoming board meeting and stop the elderly rehab center and beat them to the punch.

195
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:48,177
Would you like some coffee? I'll bring some.

196
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:13,507
You're like a baby.

197
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,807
I leave him to your care, Nurse Yoo.

198
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:28,677
Yes?

199
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:34,207
Come in. Sit down.

200
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:44,307
I wanted to ask you for the longest time, but I was hoping you'd come and tell me first.

201
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:46,387
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:49,357
I was so sorry that I couldn't help but think about what you thought of me.

203
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:53,967
If I had stayed at my post, the chairman wouldn't have become like that.

204
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:59,297
You're right. If we'd discovered it earlier then he wouldn't have become like that.

205
00:12:59,297 --> 00:13:00,557
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:00,557 --> 00:13:04,657
What was the emergency reason that you had to leave your spot for so long?

207
00:13:04,657 --> 00:13:09,907
Oh, Chairman Jin said he wanted to have a talk and told me to leave,

208
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:12,357
and then I got a call from the president.

209
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:14,917
Chairman Jin Seong Jong came by?

210
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,377
Yes.

211
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:26,567
What is it that you want to say?

212
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:30,707
I heard that you were the last person to meet my father in his condition.

213
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:33,167
I was?

214
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:37,947
By chance, did you not notice anything strange before he collapsed?

215
00:13:39,147 --> 00:13:40,797
If I noticed anything,

216
00:13:41,657 --> 00:13:43,307
do you think I would have left him in that state and left?

217
00:13:43,307 --> 00:13:46,747
That night, even when he ate dinner with me, there was nothing wrong with him.

218
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:50,627
I was wondering by chance if anything happened after you two had a talk together.

219
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:52,847
No, no. We didn't talk about much.

220
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:58,247
Doo Sik and I are the type of people who don't even need to say a word and can still communicate through emotions.

221
00:13:58,247 --> 00:14:02,937
Nurse Yoo said that you had something special to discuss and told her to leave.

222
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:06,097
Did you tell her to leave to talk about everyday things?

223
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:09,387
What are you trying to say?

224
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:15,377
Between you two, I know there was an argument about management associated with the hospital.

225
00:14:15,377 --> 00:14:16,367
So?

226
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:19,077
I wish for my father's last moments to have been happy.

227
00:14:19,077 --> 00:14:24,197
That's my wish as a son who wasn't able to be there during his final moments.

228
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:27,557
If his final moments weren't like that,

229
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,477
I don't think I'd be able to forgive whoever made it like that.

230
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:36,177
We always argued with each other,

231
00:14:36,177 --> 00:14:40,187
but then we always made up. This time it was no different.

232
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,217
Father

233
00:14:54,757 --> 00:14:55,867
Yes?

234
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:59,627
I was shopping and stopped by briefly on my way back.

235
00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:01,927
Why are you doing this?

236
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:03,887
I have something to give you.

237
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:16,327
Because I thought you'd want this,

238
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,407
I had exactly one left.

239
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:32,507
This was taken during your mom's 2nd year of college.

240
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:36,807
It was about six months after she met me that it was taken,

241
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:43,557
but because of my inferiority complex, I wrecked her.

242
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:50,107
Even if I say this, I wouldn't be able to hear anything good from you anyway.

243
00:15:53,477 --> 00:15:56,677
Does it bother you that you can't hear good things from me?

244
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:03,627
Even if I hadn't become a doctor, would you have been as nice to me as you are right now?

245
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:08,447
Would you have tried to become as friendly as you are right now?

246
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,417
You... You think of me too badly.

247
00:16:12,357 --> 00:16:16,047
I'm not that bad of a person. Think about yourself.

248
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:21,047
Even if you despise me so badly, you have to resemble me in some way.

249
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:31,097
This is rice soup.

250
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:50,807
Yes?

251
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:54,097
Oh.

252
00:16:56,297 --> 00:17:00,117
Since I took you back home last night, this time, you take me home.

253
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:03,567
I will gladly. What is that?

254
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:07,947
My father came to meet me. You eat it instead.

255
00:17:07,947 --> 00:17:12,477
What wrong did the food commit? You want to eat it too.

256
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:17,767
I think you should separate food and your father in my opinion.

257
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:19,387
I can't seem to separate them just yet.

258
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:23,867
Okay, I'll eat it all. Shall we go?

259
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:27,197
Before we go home, let's go do homework together.

260
00:17:27,197 --> 00:17:29,967
- Homework sounds good.
- I have a request.

261
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:41,777
You stay here.

262
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:43,437
We weren't meeting altogether?

263
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,467
I'm not supposed to show him all of my cards.

264
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:50,977
If I try my hardest and it still doesn't work out, I want to incorporate you to my advantage.

265
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:54,177
Incorporate me. Okay, I got it. Just give me your orders.

266
00:18:10,597 --> 00:18:15,377
What is your job? You gave me your number and gave me no other personal information.

267
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:18,367
If your occupation is honorable, then why can't you reveal it?

268
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:21,267
It isn't because it's not honorable that I can't reveal it,

269
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:25,107
but because I'm not yet certain whether you're someone worthy

270
00:18:25,107 --> 00:18:27,757
of revealing my identity to and conversing with.

271
00:18:27,757 --> 00:18:29,587
I think I've seen you at the hospital before.

272
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:33,217
We passed each other by chance, but the more I think about it, I think I'm right.

273
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:36,197
Why are you suddenly interested in my identity?

274
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:38,917
Because I wanted to converse with you.

275
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:43,567
Because more than Doctor Hong Ji Hong, it seems like you're more suited to talk with me.

276
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:46,387
I'm a fellow at Guk Il Hospital.

277
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,547
You're a fellow?

278
00:18:49,547 --> 00:18:51,517
Then you've even got your board certification.

279
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:53,537
And you're still being like this between us doctors?

280
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:56,677
Yes, between doctors.

281
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,487
It must be nice that it's so simple for you.

282
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:01,177
For me,

283
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:06,847
when my wife suffered for several months because her Cesarean was done wrong at the hospital I work at,

284
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:09,797
I got over it all, because I'm a doctor.

285
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:11,247
Because I know what a mistake is.

286
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:15,897
I don't need to be convinced about your beliefs as a doctor,

287
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:19,567
but instead, you can just tell me what happened in the operating room that day.

288
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:22,787
I'll decide what happens after that.

289
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:26,327
Nothing special happened that day.

290
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:37,787
This area is much larger than I thought it was.

291
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:41,967
- Hold the light properly!
- Yes.

292
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:46,147
Just like that, the chief did the best he could.

293
00:19:46,147 --> 00:19:47,987
This is the truth.

294
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:51,357
The nurses that ran back and forth for more blood were not for us

295
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,567
but for another operating room.

296
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:58,047
There was no other surgery besides my grandmother's surgery that day, during that time.

297
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:00,397
How did you know that?

298
00:20:00,397 --> 00:20:03,897
So I was right. I took a guess.

299
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:09,057
Alright, at least you're encouraging

300
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:12,727
since we've at least entered the operating room.

301
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:16,267
Next time, let's talk more progressively.

302
00:20:25,277 --> 00:20:28,017
Hae, how are you feeling today?

303
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:33,837
Is my older brother going to die?

304
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:36,437
No, your brother is fine.

305
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:38,877
How is he?

306
00:20:38,877 --> 00:20:41,247
He keeps vomiting and he's tired.

307
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:42,807
Just a minute.

308
00:20:44,007 --> 00:20:48,447
Let me see, Hae. Could you look at me.

309
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:53,807
Can you hold my finger?

310
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:55,697
Squeeze tightly.

311
00:20:55,697 --> 00:20:57,417
Aigoo, you're doing so well.

312
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:00,947
Do you remember what you wore on your head before?

313
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:05,027
That's something only strong and amazing children wear,

314
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:08,317
so it could be a little difficult for you because you're too strong and too amazing.

315
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:11,067
- Do you think you can endure it?
- Yes.

316
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:16,337
You're so cool. Go to sleep now. Sleeping is good. Alright?

317
00:21:18,447 --> 00:21:23,877
Mix some vitamin drinks up for him. He can't even eat, he needs to at least have that to endure.

318
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:25,427
Yeah.

319
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:29,787
Dal, where is your dad?

320
00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:32,257
He went to earn money.

321
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:35,597
Will you two be okay here alone?

322
00:21:35,597 --> 00:21:39,257
We're always alone together so it's okay now.

323
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,957
Our dad will come later.

324
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:47,307
Let's go to sleep, come on.

325
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:50,737
I'll get you some new blankets.

326
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:06,567
Even though earning money is important, he just left the kids here alone, without a caregiver.

327
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:10,067
I just found out why I almost let out my anger at you,

328
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:13,377
why I refuse to go to you subconsciously.

329
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,577
You asked Dal where their dad went

330
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:20,327
and my heart dropped.

331
00:22:20,327 --> 00:22:25,447
- Why?
- The words I feared the most when I was younger was "Where did your mom go?"

332
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:27,457
How does this connect to that?

333
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:31,727
Who do you think the children want the most at this moment?

334
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:35,777
Their dad. They want him there much more than you do.

335
00:22:37,047 --> 00:22:40,737
Do you know why I like women with scars and a past?

336
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:43,437
Someone who knows how to heal their scars

337
00:22:43,437 --> 00:22:45,437
can be considerate of others.

338
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,707
Let's go.

339
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:03,917
You're here?

340
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:06,417
What are you doing? Are you busy?

341
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:09,577
Why?

342
00:23:09,577 --> 00:23:13,077
- Can I do something bad to you?
- Go ahead.

343
00:23:13,077 --> 00:23:15,337
That's my job.

344
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:18,437
I can't do it since you're coming out like this.

345
00:23:18,437 --> 00:23:20,677
Then can I do it?

346
00:23:20,677 --> 00:23:23,317
Go ahead, whatever it is.

347
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:08,147
You're really not going to go back to the hospital?

348
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:12,757
I'm not going. Both my seniors and juniors are having a hard time because of me.

349
00:24:12,757 --> 00:24:17,837
I mean, it's so hard to become a doctor so how could you just give that up now?

350
00:24:17,837 --> 00:24:19,417
Go back in.

351
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:26,937
I really wanted to become a doctor so I completely gave up on my social life.

352
00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:28,267
But now, what is this?

353
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:32,837
Ah, then go home. Don't do this here.

354
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:36,827
How can I go home? After I graduated college and told them I was going to medical school,

355
00:24:36,827 --> 00:24:39,177
they supported me with everything.

356
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,997
They've put in so much money up till now. If they find out that I ran away,

357
00:24:42,997 --> 00:24:44,717
my father will kill me.

358
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:47,267
- Is your father scary?
- Yes,

359
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:51,047
- he's scary.
- My dad is scary too!

360
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:56,037
Ah, but it's uncomfortable to sleep here all the time.

361
00:24:56,037 --> 00:25:01,147
I have mysophobia (fear of germs) so I don't want to go to a motel.

362
00:25:02,427 --> 00:25:06,457
More than I expected, you're doing all sorts of things...

363
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:22,447
- We've arrived.
- Thank you.

364
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,307
- Would you like to have a cup of tea before you leave?
- Sure.

365
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:32,537
I would have been upset if you didn't ask me. I wanted to see how you live, too.

366
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:35,177
I'm a bit of a softie,

367
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:39,337
so I'm only allowing you to stay for a few days since you have nowhere else to go.

368
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:42,187
I'll sleep in Hye Jeong's room for the next few days so—

369
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:45,637
Neither Soon Hee nor I have never brought a man home.

370
00:25:45,637 --> 00:25:47,907
- It's Hye Jeong!
- What do we do?

371
00:25:47,907 --> 00:25:50,497
Hide! Quickly, hide!

372
00:25:50,497 --> 00:25:53,447
Quick, quick, quick!

373
00:25:57,607 --> 00:26:00,767
I've never been to a house where only women lived either.

374
00:26:03,017 --> 00:26:05,537
I guess Soon Hee is home already. Whose shoes are those?

375
00:26:05,537 --> 00:26:07,937
It looks like a man's shoes.

376
00:26:12,127 --> 00:26:13,877
- Sit down.
- Should I sit down there?

377
00:26:13,877 --> 00:26:15,557
Yes.

378
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:19,257
- Oh, what do we do?
- I know, right?

379
00:26:19,257 --> 00:26:21,437
Ah, move aside!

380
00:26:21,437 --> 00:26:23,177
Soon Hee, are you home?

381
00:26:23,177 --> 00:26:27,237
Oh? Oh, yeah! I'll be out soon!

382
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:29,787
Stay here and don't you dare move.

383
00:26:31,177 --> 00:26:36,977
Hye Jeong! You were here? Hye Jeong!

384
00:26:36,977 --> 00:26:39,197
- Hye Jeong!
- Oh, hey.

385
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,857
Hey, why did you come home so early?

386
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:43,267
Ah, I had something to take to the shop.

387
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:44,937
What are those shoes?

388
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,947
Ah, t-that...

389
00:26:47,947 --> 00:26:50,097
I'm going to collect them as an accessory.

390
00:26:50,097 --> 00:26:51,547
What?

391
00:26:51,547 --> 00:26:54,977
These days, the trend is wearing men's shoes.

392
00:26:55,557 --> 00:26:57,227
Teach! When did you come?

393
00:26:57,227 --> 00:26:59,557
It's been quite a while since I came, you just didn't pay any attention to me.

394
00:26:59,557 --> 00:27:03,037
Ah, didn't I?

395
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:07,767
You didn't. Isn't there anything broken or anything that needs strength in this house?

396
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:09,727
No, Teacher!

397
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:11,107
There's nothing like that.

398
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:14,387
Hey, you asked me to change the light bulb in your room because it went out.

399
00:27:14,387 --> 00:27:17,677
- Really? I'll do it—
- No, Teacher!

400
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:23,427
Ah... I'll do it. I'm going to do everything from now on.

401
00:27:23,427 --> 00:27:24,747
I'm going to change light bulbs too...

402
00:27:24,747 --> 00:27:27,607
- You're acting strange today.
- That's because

403
00:27:27,607 --> 00:27:32,247
today is the day Teacher came to formally greet me.

404
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:33,677
Hey, you rascal!

405
00:27:33,677 --> 00:27:35,267
Why would I come to greet you?

406
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:38,437
Yeah, you're younger than him so why would he come to greet you?

407
00:27:39,277 --> 00:27:43,807
You! Hye Jeong, you're saying you like Doctor Ji Hong more than me now, aren't you?

408
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:48,657
How could you take his side in front of me?

409
00:27:49,437 --> 00:27:55,067
Don't look for me. I'm going to go inside my room! I'm not going to open the door for you!

410
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:58,027
Teacher, have fun before you leave.

411
00:27:58,027 --> 00:27:59,747
Alright.

412
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:07,007
Never! Never look for me.

413
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:10,967
Really, there's no use having a friend!

414
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,397
What's wrong with her today?

415
00:28:13,397 --> 00:28:16,107
She must want to hide something.

416
00:28:18,157 --> 00:28:20,607
- So what happened?
- Ah, seriously!

417
00:28:20,607 --> 00:28:23,537
Ugh, seriously! What do I do...

418
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:27,497
Why are you breathing in my ear?

419
00:28:34,624 --> 00:28:41,664
♬  The first time I saw you  ♬

420
00:28:41,664 --> 00:28:46,674
♬ you seemed as anxious as a child  ♬

421
00:28:47,484 --> 00:28:49,724
Give me this book as my prize for placing 1st in math.

422
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:53,184
♬ One day when you were standing next to me ♬

423
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:55,154
Why that one?

424
00:28:55,154 --> 00:28:56,824
-Just because.
♬ you had  ♬

425
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:59,614
You're so unique.
♬ changed to be  ♬

426
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:01,494
-Sign it for me.
♬so lovely  ♬

427
00:29:03,164 --> 00:29:06,144
I'll work my best to not let your encouragement go to waste.

428
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,694
♬  I never expected we would be in love  ♬

429
00:29:09,694 --> 00:29:13,144
- You still have this.
- Of course.

430
00:29:13,144 --> 00:29:16,574
I was going to throw it away but I didn't, because it's expensive.

431
00:29:17,044 --> 00:29:23,734
♬ You are everything in my life. You are the reason I live  ♬

432
00:29:25,324 --> 00:29:28,814
Now that I think about it, it's the first time I've been in your room.

433
00:29:33,674 --> 00:29:35,554
I guess I need to leave.

434
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:40,284
- Why?
- I don't this it's right for just us two to be in a room. It's a bit erotic.

435
00:29:40,284 --> 00:29:43,004
We have to be erotic. We do.

436
00:29:43,544 --> 00:29:45,654
The student has become the master.

437
00:29:55,854 --> 00:29:58,904
I can do much more than this.

438
00:29:58,904 --> 00:30:00,204
So don't act up.

439
00:30:03,284 --> 00:30:06,834
♫  You are my entire life  ♫

440
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:08,534
♫ You are the reason I live  ♫

441
00:30:08,534 --> 00:30:12,684
Walk me back to the car. And make sure to give me a back hug, I like those.

442
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:17,874
♫  It's an unexplainable miracle ♫

443
00:30:17,874 --> 00:30:24,814
♫  If love is needing my comfort ♫

444
00:30:24,814 --> 00:30:31,634
♫  Take another step closer ♫

445
00:30:31,634 --> 00:30:34,094
♫  Yes I believe my destiny ♫

446
00:30:34,094 --> 00:30:36,574
Should we go back to the bed again?

447
00:30:36,574 --> 00:30:37,564
Let's leave.

448
00:30:37,564 --> 00:30:39,134
Okay.

449
00:31:20,574 --> 00:31:23,034
Total Capital

450
00:31:23,844 --> 00:31:25,124
Yes, hello?

451
00:31:25,124 --> 00:31:29,254
I called you multiple times and left a text, but I still can't seem to get in touch with you.

452
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:33,374
Ah yes, I'm sorry. I'll repay you as soon as I can.

453
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:36,164
Don't just say that you're going to. Please pay it back.

454
00:31:36,164 --> 00:31:38,134
You aren't even capable of paying me back, so why did you borrow the money?

455
00:31:38,134 --> 00:31:41,594
If you don't pay it by tomorrow, your overdue loan will be affected.

456
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:05,654
Let's be strong. Let's be strong.

457
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:29,254
Dad.

458
00:32:31,024 --> 00:32:32,804
Dal!

459
00:32:36,364 --> 00:32:40,514
Hae. Dad's here, wake up.

460
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:53,804
You must be tired from earning money.

461
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:55,574
No.

462
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,534
Dad's not tired at all.

463
00:32:58,534 --> 00:33:01,284
I'm a super hero.

464
00:33:01,284 --> 00:33:06,374
A person who protects our Hae and Dal. Let's go to sleep.

465
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:12,004
Let's go to sleep.

466
00:33:43,344 --> 00:33:44,434
Why did you become a doctor?

467
00:33:44,434 --> 00:33:50,574
I became a neurosurgeon under the influence of my grandmother.

468
00:33:50,574 --> 00:33:54,194
When I caused trouble, she said this.

469
00:33:54,194 --> 00:33:58,134
"If you're born human, you at least need a secure job."

470
00:33:59,324 --> 00:34:00,584
Please give me the chart.

471
00:34:00,584 --> 00:34:04,534
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong has a sense of justice, and is really good at fighting too.

472
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:08,654
She's a total girl crush! Our Guk Il Medical Center is not just

473
00:34:08,654 --> 00:34:12,114
the best because of Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong, but it's because we have the best doctors working at the best hospital. The best!

474
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:15,254
We all have a certain past.

475
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:20,904
Even if you have a difficult past, it does not hinder the growth of your present self.

476
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:26,284
Neurosurgeon Yoo Hye Jeong is the beautiful reason why.

477
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:31,694
Doc! The hospital must love it a lot since it's PR.

478
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,084
I chose to think of it in a good way.

479
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:37,344
But, you're so photogenic! As expected, it's because you have such a small face.

480
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:39,904
Right? I'm really photogenic right?

481
00:34:39,904 --> 00:34:43,434
No, not you, but her.

482
00:34:46,354 --> 00:34:49,804
Doctor! Doctor!

483
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:51,794
Dal is weird.

484
00:34:51,794 --> 00:34:54,394
He says his head hurts and he's throwing up.

485
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:58,114
I was like that yesterday, maybe he's copying me!

486
00:34:58,114 --> 00:35:00,194
Let's go.

487
00:35:00,194 --> 00:35:04,684
It hurts.

488
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:09,244
It hurts.

489
00:35:19,124 --> 00:35:22,014
Dal. Does your head hurt a lot?

490
00:35:26,604 --> 00:35:30,994
Kang Soo. I think Dal has hydrocephalus. Hurry and prepare for a CT scan.

491
00:35:32,774 --> 00:35:36,574
Don't worry too much. Hae, you know your dad's number right?

492
00:35:36,574 --> 00:35:38,164
Yes.

493
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,194
Nam Dal

494
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:51,494
It seems like hydrocephalus (accumulation of fluid in the brain).

495
00:35:51,494 --> 00:35:55,704
Mm, you're right. Call the patient's guardian, get a consent form and set up a operating room.

496
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:57,564
You do the surgery, because it's simple.

497
00:35:57,564 --> 00:35:59,164
Yes.

498
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:05,984
Hae ♡

499
00:36:07,484 --> 00:36:09,044
Yeah, Hae.

500
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:11,824
I'm Yoo Hye Jeong, Dal's attending physician.

501
00:36:11,824 --> 00:36:14,514
Ah, yes Doctor. Hello.

502
00:36:14,514 --> 00:36:16,644
I think you'll have to come to the hospital right now.

503
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:20,724
In order to treat the patient, we need a surgery consent form from the guardian.

504
00:36:20,724 --> 00:36:22,674
Surgery?

505
00:36:33,654 --> 00:36:35,894
Excuse me, Nam Ba Ram!

506
00:36:38,844 --> 00:36:40,684
Surgery Consent Form

507
00:36:40,684 --> 00:36:43,554
You just need to read the surgery consent form and sign.

508
00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:47,594
So this is saying that you're going to insert a tube during this surgery, right?

509
00:36:47,594 --> 00:36:51,484
To put it simply, you can think of it as taking out the accumulation of fluid in the brain.

510
00:36:51,484 --> 00:36:53,364
Ah, yes.

511
00:36:59,974 --> 00:37:05,554
You don't have to worry too much. It's one of the common side effects after having surgery.

512
00:37:05,554 --> 00:37:07,484
I see.

513
00:37:08,804 --> 00:37:13,264
Nam Bo Ram

514
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,894
Patient Nam Dal went into surgery, right?

515
00:37:14,894 --> 00:37:17,164
It seemed like they were signing a surgery consent form.

516
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:19,334
Why is that so late?

517
00:37:20,974 --> 00:37:23,704
Hello Doctor. Where is Patient Nam Dal's guardian?

518
00:37:23,704 --> 00:37:25,984
- He will probably be in the consultation room.
- Okay.

519
00:37:28,634 --> 00:37:29,694
What's the issue?

520
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:32,114
It seems as though the "I Will Do It" Ahjussi is in a bad situation.

521
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:35,444
I think there's an issue because of unpaid medical bills.

522
00:37:38,394 --> 00:37:44,104
Doctor. Please take good care of our Dal.

523
00:37:44,104 --> 00:37:47,374
Don't worry. I'll see you later.

524
00:37:47,374 --> 00:37:49,594
I finally found you.

525
00:37:51,724 --> 00:37:53,524
I'm really sorry.

526
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:57,974
Do you think all you have to do is just not pick up my calls and avoid me?

527
00:37:57,974 --> 00:37:59,654
Ah, I'm really sorry.

528
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:04,004
- I will repay you as soon—
- As soon, as soon. When will that be?

529
00:38:04,004 --> 00:38:06,204
What am I supposed to do when the higher-ups keep asking me

530
00:38:06,204 --> 00:38:08,434
when you're going to pay the surgery and hospitalization costs?

531
00:38:08,434 --> 00:38:11,584
First of all, it would be better to discuss this after the child's surgery.

532
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:15,464
If there are additional treatment costs while there are still unpaid bills, I will have to file a report.

533
00:38:15,464 --> 00:38:20,244
I consulted the Department of Social Services. Can't they get medical aid?

534
00:38:21,054 --> 00:38:26,324
I'm not someone who can't lead a normal life, and I function in society,

535
00:38:26,324 --> 00:38:29,614
so they say that I'm not eligible for help through the welfare program.

536
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:34,444
Let's do the surgery first. Is there no other way?

537
00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:38,454
Then you can sign as the guarantor.

538
00:38:39,074 --> 00:38:40,354
I will do that.

539
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:44,524
- Ah, Doctor, there's no need to—
- Let's treat Dal first. I will see you later.

540
00:38:47,624 --> 00:38:50,634
Doctor. How long have you been here?

541
00:38:50,634 --> 00:38:53,304
Just a little while. Go, do the surgery first.

542
00:38:53,304 --> 00:38:54,604
Yes.

543
00:38:55,324 --> 00:38:56,994
Try going to the Social Services department.

544
00:38:56,994 --> 00:38:59,934
When you go there, there might be a program that you can apply to.

545
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:02,434
Yes. Thank you.

546
00:39:16,214 --> 00:39:17,754
Yes.

547
00:39:18,794 --> 00:39:21,534
Professor Hong Ji Hong is here.

548
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:22,904
How have you been, Director?

549
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:25,754
Aigoo, what brings you to come here?

550
00:39:25,754 --> 00:39:28,654
Nice to see you. Let's sit down.

551
00:39:32,184 --> 00:39:35,754
I'm excited. You said you had something to say to me?

552
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:41,234
I think it's time for us to check the overall foundation of our hospital's welfare system.

553
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:42,634
Welfare?

554
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:48,834
First, I'd like to change the system in which hospital bills have to be paid weekly.

555
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:51,864
You're requesting it so boldly.

556
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:56,504
You don't know Professor Hong, but telling the patients to pay their bills actually helps the patients.

557
00:39:56,504 --> 00:40:00,994
Later, when the hospital fees accumulate and they are suddenly forced to pay them in their entirety, that is even more cruel.

558
00:40:00,994 --> 00:40:04,054
If it's not possible to adjust the payment schedule,

559
00:40:04,054 --> 00:40:06,324
then how about extending support?

560
00:40:06,324 --> 00:40:10,314
You haven't brought in much money to the hospital, so why do you keep asking to give it away?

561
00:40:10,314 --> 00:40:11,964
I do bring in money.

562
00:40:11,964 --> 00:40:15,434
I'm in the middle of working on a project from MH Med-Tech that will give us 60 billion won.

563
00:40:15,434 --> 00:40:17,354
And it will be accomplished soon.

564
00:40:17,354 --> 00:40:19,724
Why are you telling me something so important just now?

565
00:40:19,724 --> 00:40:21,544
Because I think this is the perfect time.

566
00:40:22,264 --> 00:40:25,404
Anyway, about expanding welfare foundation system,

567
00:40:25,404 --> 00:40:29,334
if you ignore my opinion, I'll bring it up in the next board meeting.

568
00:40:29,334 --> 00:40:33,434
Put it on the agenda. I don't know who will approve of it, though.

569
00:40:33,434 --> 00:40:35,844
Director, I'm asking you earnestly,

570
00:40:35,844 --> 00:40:39,514
but more than half of the Board are my father's personal connections. I have the advantage.

571
00:40:39,514 --> 00:40:42,044
Why are you like this?

572
00:40:42,044 --> 00:40:45,064
Didn't we decide to become close?

573
00:40:45,064 --> 00:40:48,674
I'm doing this so we can become close. Director, let's become close.

574
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:52,334
I ask that you will accept my idea. Then.

575
00:41:15,544 --> 00:41:16,794
Yes, Director.

576
00:41:16,794 --> 00:41:19,214
By any chance, did Professor Hong Ji Hong come to see you again

577
00:41:19,214 --> 00:41:21,614
regarding the records of the patient 13 years ago?

578
00:41:21,614 --> 00:41:25,834
No. By the way, that patient's guardian...

579
00:41:25,834 --> 00:41:28,914
I looked into it and she's a doctor.

580
00:41:28,914 --> 00:41:33,344
Her guardian is a doctor? Which hospital does she work at?

581
00:41:33,344 --> 00:41:38,514
I'm sorry, there is no financial aid that fits your situation.

582
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:43,044
You must be burdened, I'm sorry to tell you this.

583
00:41:43,044 --> 00:41:46,694
It's fine. Thank you for looking into it.

584
00:41:54,474 --> 00:41:58,784
Aid for the Full Hospital Fee

585
00:41:58,784 --> 00:42:03,354
Um, what is this? It says that it's aid for the full hospital fees...

586
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:08,434
That's an orphan organization named "We are Parents".

587
00:42:08,434 --> 00:42:13,024
Looking at just their illnesses, your children are eligible for support,

588
00:42:13,024 --> 00:42:16,904
but because they only sponsor orphans, it doesn't apply to them.

589
00:42:46,874 --> 00:42:50,204
Ugh, seriously...

590
00:42:51,484 --> 00:42:53,714
How...

591
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:58,874
How is not having a father better? Huh?

592
00:43:03,284 --> 00:43:06,514
My pitiful children...

593
00:43:19,944 --> 00:43:21,794
Dad!

594
00:43:49,864 --> 00:43:52,824
Anesthesia. Let's start.

595
00:44:02,944 --> 00:44:06,154
- Is the angle okay?
- Yes, it's fine now.

596
00:44:26,174 --> 00:44:27,774
It's a relief.

597
00:44:27,774 --> 00:44:32,714
But Doctor, even if he's successfully treated, it must be worrisome because of the hospital fees.

598
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:37,464
It's really a pity, right? His older brother is sick and he's sick, too.

599
00:44:37,464 --> 00:44:41,094
We're in the middle of a surgery. Don't emotionally connect with the patient and concentrate.

600
00:44:41,094 --> 00:44:43,744
Yes.

601
00:44:46,314 --> 00:44:50,574
Surgery Room: Nam Dal / Kim Ji Soo
♬  aren't you lonely?  ♬

602
00:44:50,574 --> 00:44:52,154
Dad?

603
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:55,934
Dal is so good.

604
00:44:55,934 --> 00:44:58,674
He listens to me so well even when you're not around.

605
00:45:02,444 --> 00:45:05,744
Hae, can you take care of Dal when I'm not around?

606
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:10,994
Of course! I'm his older brother.

607
00:45:10,994 --> 00:45:15,354
Right... You're his older brother.

608
00:45:15,354 --> 00:45:21,674
An older brother has to take care of his younger sibling. Don't forget that.

609
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:38,224
Dal's surgery was successful. He'll be moved to a room as soon as he wakes up.

610
00:45:38,844 --> 00:45:40,374
Thank you, Doctor.

611
00:45:40,374 --> 00:45:42,534
Thank you.

612
00:45:43,344 --> 00:45:45,134
Yes, goodbye.

613
00:45:45,134 --> 00:45:49,134
Doctor... I have something to tell you.

614
00:45:49,994 --> 00:45:54,854
I'm really sorry, Doctor. I ended up burdening you.

615
00:45:54,854 --> 00:45:57,224
It's hard raising two children by yourself, isn't it?

616
00:45:57,224 --> 00:45:59,884
No, it's not hard at all.

617
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:05,124
The children are the ones suffering because they were born to a dad like me.

618
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:09,134
I'm sorry.

619
00:46:09,774 --> 00:46:12,054
Boss

620
00:46:12,054 --> 00:46:14,704
Doctor, I have to go to work.

621
00:46:17,164 --> 00:46:19,744
I'll be sure to pay you back for this kindness.

622
00:46:23,904 --> 00:46:27,684
Do you ever have thoughts about giving up?

623
00:46:29,094 --> 00:46:31,064
Give up what?

624
00:46:31,064 --> 00:46:34,744
Your children. Without your children,

625
00:46:34,744 --> 00:46:37,364
you can live a free life.

626
00:46:40,024 --> 00:46:43,804
I thought you were a good person

627
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,094
but it seems you're not.

628
00:47:07,764 --> 00:47:09,684
- You're home?
- Wow,

629
00:47:09,684 --> 00:47:13,944
you look so natural here. If someone else saw, they would think this is your house.

630
00:47:15,504 --> 00:47:16,614
What is that?

631
00:47:16,614 --> 00:47:18,744
What do you mean, "what"?

632
00:47:19,954 --> 00:47:24,984
It's ramen. Did you want me to acknowledge that you're a fine man?

633
00:47:26,004 --> 00:47:29,564
You're jumping to conclusions by yourself again. I bought it so I could eat it.

634
00:47:29,564 --> 00:47:31,794
Why would you buy cup ramen just because you want to eat it?

635
00:47:31,794 --> 00:47:33,774
Uncle!

636
00:47:33,774 --> 00:47:37,164
What? You thought In Joo was here alone?

637
00:47:37,164 --> 00:47:39,464
Were you feeling a bit tense because you thought I was here alone?

638
00:47:39,464 --> 00:47:41,484
Wait... These two, seriously...

639
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:45,664
Yeah, Yoon Do. I approve of you dating In Joo.

640
00:47:45,664 --> 00:47:48,604
Uncle, why are you doing this to me?

641
00:47:48,634 --> 00:47:51,634
- What if we get married?
- I approve of that.

642
00:47:51,684 --> 00:47:54,064
As expected, we match.

643
00:47:54,064 --> 00:47:56,994
We're on the same team. Divorcees have to help each other out.

644
00:47:56,994 --> 00:48:00,514
I mean, are you saying that that is more important than your own blood-related family member?

645
00:48:00,514 --> 00:48:05,474
I'm seriously upset, Uncle. I don't think I can live here anymore.

646
00:48:05,474 --> 00:48:07,624
- Have a good life .
- Huh?

647
00:48:10,744 --> 00:48:12,954
Were we too harsh?

648
00:48:12,954 --> 00:48:15,554
He'll return in an hour.

649
00:48:16,414 --> 00:48:18,034
What brings you here?

650
00:48:19,914 --> 00:48:21,674
- You have something like this at home?
- Yeah.

651
00:48:21,674 --> 00:48:25,224
- Can I try it?
- No, go home. I have a guest over.

652
00:48:25,984 --> 00:48:29,144
Who? It can't be Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong, right?

653
00:48:29,144 --> 00:48:31,094
It is me.

654
00:48:33,814 --> 00:48:35,874
We're dating.

655
00:48:38,534 --> 00:48:40,664
I have two choices right now:

656
00:48:40,664 --> 00:48:45,834
Returning to the beagles upstairs, or having a disgusting experience here.

657
00:48:45,834 --> 00:48:47,904
I'll leave.

658
00:48:47,904 --> 00:48:49,774
I was just about to leave.

659
00:48:49,774 --> 00:48:52,734
- I'll take you home.
- It's fine.

660
00:48:54,534 --> 00:48:58,404
I'll take her home. You stay here, you're strange.

661
00:49:10,684 --> 00:49:12,714
I have no money either...

662
00:49:20,074 --> 00:49:21,464
Did you eat?

663
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:23,264
No, I'm so hungry.

664
00:49:23,264 --> 00:49:25,674
That's not good.

665
00:49:28,814 --> 00:49:30,434
Are you on your way to see Hae?

666
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:32,034
Are you going to see Dal?

667
00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:35,114
Yes. How is Hae?

668
00:49:35,114 --> 00:49:37,914
We have to check up on him now.

669
00:49:44,154 --> 00:49:45,624
- Doctors, you're all here.
- Hello.

670
00:49:45,624 --> 00:49:47,414
Hello, Ahjussi!

671
00:49:47,414 --> 00:49:50,594
Yes, hello. It seems you aren't eating late-night snacks these days.

672
00:49:50,594 --> 00:49:52,194
I don't get to see you as much.

673
00:49:52,194 --> 00:49:54,774
A fat pig disappeared, so—

674
00:49:56,754 --> 00:49:58,404
I finally get to meet you today.

675
00:49:58,404 --> 00:50:04,184
Ah, yes. Doctor, thank you so much for taking care of my children.

676
00:50:04,924 --> 00:50:07,764
Then, I'll leave now.

677
00:50:09,704 --> 00:50:11,054
Nam Bo Ram!

678
00:50:13,814 --> 00:50:18,074
Why are you like this to me? I already told you last time!

679
00:50:18,074 --> 00:50:19,544
I'm really sorry.

680
00:50:19,544 --> 00:50:22,954
Please don't do this to me. Let's take care of the bills first.

681
00:50:22,954 --> 00:50:27,684
If you continue like this and get on the blacklist, you're going to have to change hospitals!

682
00:50:33,274 --> 00:50:35,484
Why are you doing this to our dad?

683
00:50:35,484 --> 00:50:40,064
Our dad is exhausted so why are you scolding him!

684
00:50:40,064 --> 00:50:43,714
Kids, he's not scolding me.

685
00:50:43,714 --> 00:50:45,204
I'm just talking to him.

686
00:50:45,204 --> 00:50:48,094
Don't be like that to our dad!

687
00:50:48,094 --> 00:50:50,964
Don't do that to my dad!

688
00:50:53,314 --> 00:50:55,914
How dare you be like this to an adult! Huh?

689
00:50:55,914 --> 00:50:58,614
Stop it. Kids.

690
00:51:04,824 --> 00:51:06,624
It's okay.

691
00:51:24,404 --> 00:51:26,354
Kim Do Jin/Gyo Yang Guk - Producer

692
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:32,634
Hello, Producer Kim. I'm Yoo Hye Jeong.

693
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:35,964
Oh, I know. Did you see the broadcast only just now and call?

694
00:51:35,964 --> 00:51:40,834
That's not it. I wanted to provide an item. It's a really good item.

695
00:51:40,834 --> 00:51:42,604
What is it?

696
00:51:43,544 --> 00:51:47,704
Please press two for a call back.

697
00:51:50,644 --> 00:51:56,604
Nam Hae and Nam Dal's father, there's a way to take care of the surgery fees. Please contact me.

698
00:53:02,174 --> 00:53:04,034
I love you.

699
00:53:08,364 --> 00:53:11,674
Dad will protect you forever.

700
00:53:16,874 --> 00:53:19,504
Even if we aren't together,

701
00:53:21,204 --> 00:53:23,764
we'll still be together forever.

702
00:54:27,894 --> 00:54:29,744
Dal's father.

703
00:54:43,974 --> 00:54:45,974
Why is he going up?

704
00:55:00,014 --> 00:55:01,774
Fully-Funded Medical Costs

705
00:55:39,784 --> 00:55:41,704
Dad is...

706
00:55:45,574 --> 00:55:47,724
not giving up.

707
00:55:50,884 --> 00:55:53,614
I'm doing this because I love you.

708
00:55:57,064 --> 00:55:59,704
Because I love you too much.

709
00:56:10,614 --> 00:56:12,594
Don't do it.

710
00:56:20,064 --> 00:56:22,714
Don't come closer. I have a reason.

711
00:56:26,714 --> 00:56:29,274
Are you doing it because of this?

712
00:56:37,104 --> 00:56:41,704
What good is it for the kids to get cured if they have no father?

713
00:56:42,534 --> 00:56:46,904
Do you know what it feels like to be walking on eggshells while receiving treatment when you're feeling sick?

714
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:49,614
The kids keep worrying about what people think.

715
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,754
While taking one pill,

716
00:56:52,434 --> 00:56:54,694
whenever they receive a shot.

717
00:56:59,484 --> 00:57:04,654
I don't know how much more the hospital fees are going to increase, and I am no longer confident.

718
00:57:06,014 --> 00:57:09,584
There are foundations that pay medical bills for orphans for free.

719
00:57:09,584 --> 00:57:11,604
And if I die,

720
00:57:12,714 --> 00:57:15,004
our kids would be so pitiful,

721
00:57:15,664 --> 00:57:17,984
so wouldn't people help more?

722
00:57:17,984 --> 00:57:20,964
If it's because of money, there's a way.

723
00:57:20,964 --> 00:57:23,954
Do you know a show called 'Focus People'?

724
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:28,694
They will cover Hae and Dal. Once it gets broadcast—

725
00:57:28,694 --> 00:57:31,484
I'm so sick and tired of it...

726
00:57:36,374 --> 00:57:38,694
I don't want to live anymore.

727
00:57:41,154 --> 00:57:43,694
I want to end everything.

728
00:57:49,984 --> 00:57:51,974
Is this living?

729
00:57:53,134 --> 00:57:56,534
The calls I receive whenever I open my eyes

730
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,634
are all debt collectors.

731
00:58:02,374 --> 00:58:04,734
My kids are so adorable...

732
00:58:05,744 --> 00:58:08,874
I want to do everything for them because they're so adorable...

733
00:58:09,634 --> 00:58:11,694
But I can't do it for them.

734
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:19,744
I'm so tired.

735
00:58:25,834 --> 00:58:28,694
The people who say their kids are killing them,

736
00:58:28,694 --> 00:58:30,654
they're all excuses.

737
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:37,314
I was looking for an excuse, but this is perfect.

738
00:58:42,454 --> 00:58:44,664
I don't want to miss this chance.

739
00:58:44,664 --> 00:58:46,714
I said don't do it!

740
00:58:52,354 --> 00:58:55,704
If the kids find out that their father died because of their hospital fees,

741
00:58:56,354 --> 00:58:58,624
how would the kids' lives be?

742
00:59:05,384 --> 00:59:09,924
At a single word said thoughtlessly by a stranger, we are healed of our scars,

743
00:59:09,924 --> 00:59:12,444
and the direction of our life changes.

744
00:59:12,444 --> 00:59:16,754
Scars are not only treated by the ones we love.

745
00:59:16,754 --> 00:59:20,664
Among the people we meet, there is that person.
