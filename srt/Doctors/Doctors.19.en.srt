1
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,850
You brought this for me to eat. Why are you eating it, Grandma?

2
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,500
You just be a doctor. That's you.

3
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,320
The greatest love that any person can show for another person is sacrifice.

4
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,390
But that sacrifice doesn't make a person great.

5
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,470
Episode 19

6
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,860
Now tell me. What did the director say that I did?

7
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,750
What did he say that made you, someone who's obsessed with surgeries—

8
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,880
I'm not obsessed. Isn't there a nicer way to put it?

9
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,240
There's not a more accurate way to put it than that.

10
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,470
Why did you give up on something that you love so much?

11
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,300
I won't get hurt. Just tell me the truth.

12
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,270
I'm going one step backward and two steps forward. That way Director Jin will relax.

13
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,890
What are you going to go two steps forward with?

14
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,970
I'm looking for Director Jin's weakness right now. As soon as I find it, I'm going to go on the offensive, so don't worry.

15
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,150
There's nothing I can do other than go to work.

16
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:00,090
It's a relief that you can at least do that. Think optimistically.

17
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,770
Did you know... that you always teach a lesson at the most crucial moment?

18
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,200
A past teacher, presently a doctor,

19
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,460
as well as a professor. Do you think my career is going anywhere?

20
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,910
If you find his weakness, you have to tell me.

21
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,200
Now go home.

22
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,660
I can't tell you. It's better for you not to know.

23
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,160
Whether it's good or bad, I'll decide. Tell me.

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,350
I don't know!

25
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,820
Are you really going to make me into a fool?

26
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,800
Whatever you think of me, before Hye Jeong came along,

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,880
you were my best friend.

28
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,720
Of course, I know you let me off the hook a lot.

29
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,730
The reason that Hye Jeong went to your hospital is because of your dad.

30
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,180
- Why?
- Have you seen Hye Jeong's grandmother before?

31
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,950
I have. But I can't really remember.

32
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,170
She passed away while receiving surgery for her cancer.

33
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,150
Your dad did the surgery, and there was medical malpractice.

34
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,660
What?

35
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,710
That means, Hye Jeong's grandmother passed away because my dad messed up her surgery?

36
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,300
That's what she believes?

37
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,260
She said she found proof a few days ago.

38
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,720
It doesn't make any sense!

39
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,390
Do you think she would hold onto something that doesn't make sense for thirteen years?

40
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,390
It's not like Hye Jeong is an idiot.

41
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:40,040
You know it, too. Her original dream was to start Grandma's Rice Soup.

42
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,210
She wanted to live with her grandmother for a long, long time!

43
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,090
It's a misunderstanding. There's no way my dad would've done something like that.

44
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,790
Seo Woo!

45
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,420
Welcome, Father-in-law.

46
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,380
Why is everyone out here? I just wanted to have a cup of tea.

47
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,250
Father, you came. Of course everyone should come out to greet you.

48
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,220
- What about Mother-in-law?
- She's sleeping.

49
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,200
It's honey citron tea.

50
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,980
- What about Seo Woo?
- She's not home yet.

51
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,870
I have something to talk about with Father.

52
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,170
Alright.

53
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,590
What do you have to tell me?

54
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,720
Are you sick anywhere?

55
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,010
What do you mean? It's just stress.

56
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,820
I heard you didn't get your annual health check up last year. Do it.

57
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,800
Alright.

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,840
What's troubling you? Tell me.

59
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,470
I want to invest more in Sangil Pharmaceuticals, but we don't have enough funding.

60
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,740
We've already invested so much in them already. What's the point of investing more? If you don't have any funds, why bother?

61
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,780
We have to become the strongest shareholder.

62
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,920
Other than the hospital, we need to have a reliable business that can support us.

63
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,630
The subsidiary company isn't enough?

64
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,310
We have to give that to Seo Woo.

65
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,330
It looks like the new medicine Sangil Pharmaceuticals is creating is going to be a huge hit.

66
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,060
Then of course, their stock will go up and we can profit manyfold if we purchase their stock.

67
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,390
Then I'll supply the funds. What else is a slush fund for?

68
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,160
I really can't live without you, Father.

69
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,210
Once the Geriatric Wellness Center is finalized, let's go on a cruise vacation with Mother and everyone.

70
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,190
No thanks. Your stepmother already goes on plenty of vacations.

71
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,110
Do you want to see your biological mother? There was no one else like your mother.

72
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,620
Why are you talking about Mom? You're making me miss her.

73
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,770
I have to let you live well and prosperously, so when I meet your dead mother I can lift my head.

74
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,570
Don't worry.

75
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,640
Oh, Doctor, why—

76
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,100
What are you doing here, Grandmother?

77
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,590
I'm the father of the child who's lying down on the bed.

78
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,960
Oh dear, what should I do? I'm so sorry, Doctor.

79
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,590
My granddaughter has done something terrible to your daughter.

80
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,500
I'm so sorry.

81
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,650
Are you hurt badly? I'm sorry.

82
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,650
Didn't you go home?

83
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,620
Why'd you come back?

84
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,230
- Yeong Gook.
- Yeah.

85
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,380
Do something terrible to me just once.

86
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,670
It's okay.

87
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,550
How's the patient's condition?

88
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,210
Her temperature is at thirty six degrees, it's still normal.

89
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,530
Thank goodness.

90
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,680
The department chief wants everyone to attend the mass conference.

91
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,000
Let me see the patient first.

92
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,170
You're really impressive.

93
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,300
Lee Hee Young, twenty nine years old, female.

94
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,790
She came into the emergency room from a TA (traffic accident), and her mental state was in a semi-coma GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) level four.

95
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:38,840
Looking at her brain CT, it looked like she had about 80cc ( mls ) of ICH (intracranial hemorrhage).

96
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,070
It was determined as a result of arteriovenous rupture.

97
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,450
At the time, it was decided that there was no chance of recovery.

98
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,410
As a twenty weeks pregnant woman, we did an emergency surgery to save the child.

99
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,450
How's the baby's condition?

100
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,610
As of now, the baby is growing well without any problem.

101
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,350
Make sure to check the patient's condition carefully. If anything seems strange, we have to deliver the baby immediately.

102
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,400
- Give a heads up to the OB GYN department too.
- Yes.

103
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,080
Alright, let's end the conference here for today.

104
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,950
I have something to tell everyone today.

105
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:15,670
For the past couple of months, there has been a lot going on in the neurosurgery department.

106
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,480
A colleague was sick, and a colleague received disciplinary action.

107
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,270
Because of the patient who could've been a societal issue. The attention on us wasn't very flattering.

108
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,110
From now on, we might have to endure a hard period for a while.

109
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:37,860
However, the ones who will endure this hard time will be us.

110
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,960
The neurosurgery department focuses on the brain. The brain powers the entire body.

111
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,000
With that said,

112
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,540
neurosurgery department controls everything!

113
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,150
Test results

114
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:08,290
I heard briefly from Doctor Jeong Yoon Do. You're Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong's father?

115
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:08,990
Ah, yes.

116
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,150
What are your symptoms?

117
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,050
I'm constantly tired.

118
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,660
My upper stomach is in pain. I went to the neighborhood hospital.

119
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,830
They did a blood test and told me to go to a bigger hospital.

120
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,600
Your liver numbers are high.

121
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,470
I'll check your eyes. Please open them widely.

122
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,800
Do you drink a lot of alcohol on a regular basis?

123
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,170
Yes, I have a little these days.

124
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,160
It doesn't seem like just a little. I think you have a liver infection.

125
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,040
- Let's do an ultrasound of your liver.
- Yes

126
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,300
But how do you know Doctor Jeon Yoon Do?

127
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,210
He's a regular at our restaurant.

128
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,200
He performed a surgery on my wife as well.

129
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,690
I think Doctor Jeong is taking care of you because of Doctor Yoo.

130
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,470
Ah, yes.

131
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,070
The detailed statement on the slush fund... Don't you have to submit it to the prosecutor's office?

132
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,050
Things will get wrapped up faster than I thought.

133
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,820
Doctor...

134
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,220
I'm sorry, but I can't write up that detailed statement.

135
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,880
Why?

136
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,200
Director Jin is holding Dr. Yoo Hye Jeong as collateral.

137
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,960
Dr. Yoo Hye Jeong...

138
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,270
You, you... You're a total lovebird!

139
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,400
Professor...

140
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:28,170
When I heard that the great Dr. Hong volunteered to go to the research center, I sensed that something big must be up.

141
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,110
I can't believe it's for love. Should I congratulate you?

142
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,410
Stop teasing me.

143
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,100
I like that you're dating. I hope everything goes well.

144
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:43,910
But we don't have much time left, Ji Hong.

145
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:48,640
Once they break ground for the construction of the Geriatric Center, the hospital losses will be enormous.

146
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,800
Whoever takes over after Director Jin steps down,

147
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,300
the person in that position must start out with a negative balance, a huge burden.

148
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,460
That's why I'm deliberating on it.

149
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,300
Look. You over there.

150
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,250
Let's talk for a second.

151
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,400
Did you come to this hospital because of my dad?

152
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,440
- You're right.
- Are you thinking that my dad comitted malpractice during your grandmother's surgery?

153
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,070
It's not a thought; it's a fact. I confirmed it.

154
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,630
How did you confirm it? It was 13 years ago.

155
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,300
There's no way that there's any record left.

156
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,770
There was a record.

157
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,610
There's a person who's been keeping it.

158
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,430
Why did they keep it? It's not their record.

159
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,410
There was a reason and it was completely reasonable.

160
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,880
Did you review that record properly? Who reviewed it?

161
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,310
By Doctor Jeong Ba Ran.

162
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,780
There are things that happen in the surgery room that we cannot control.

163
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,280
- You know that too.
- They made a settlement.

164
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,980
My dad and the hospital.

165
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,480
I came because I have something to ask you.

166
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,800
- What is it?
- Did Dr. Yoo Hye Jeong come to you asking you to review an anesthesia record, Uncle?

167
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,710
I did. I told her that it was the surgeon's mistake.

168
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,300
Does Professor Hong Ji Hong know about this?

169
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,180
He probably does because he was the one who introduced me to Doctor Yoo.

170
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,820
Then... Does Sunbae Yoon Do know too?

171
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,600
He does. He likes Doctor Yoo.

172
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,850
I've never seen someone fall for someone, alone, so creatively.

173
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,390
Thank you.

174
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,520
Becoming the hospital's director,

175
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,470
was it because of Hye Jeong?

176
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,790
- Yeah.
- To help Hye Jeong?

177
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,350
For Dr. Yoo, but Dr. Hong is my neighbor.

178
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,270
You surprise me again and again.

179
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,680
You aren't this kind of person. You don't get involved in others' affairs. You don't take initiative.

180
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,610
You don't like management or politics.

181
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:38,090
But if I don't do things like that, how else am I supposed to get close to Doctor Yoo?

182
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,930
Is only getting close to Hye Jeong important?

183
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:46,650
As for me, I've known you a long time. We have camaraderie.

184
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:51,120
You've relied on me through tough times, Sunbae. How can you be like this to me?

185
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,840
- I'm sorry.
- If you're sorry then prove it with appropriate actions.

186
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,500
What do you want?

187
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,110
Don't make things difficult for my dad.

188
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,620
Being on Hye Jeong's side gives my dad a hard time. Don't do that.

189
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,300
Can you not do it?

190
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,690
My dad isn't a bad person.

191
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,100
Hye Jeong's case is a misunderstanding. You understand too, Sunbae.

192
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,310
A doctor's job is to save people's lives. But a mistake

193
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:24,070
can't be helped. None of us are free from it.

194
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,320
Doctor Yoo is pretty.

195
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,240
And the professor too. How good looking.

196
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,740
Kang Soo, the printer is out of ink.

197
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,700
Hyung, you do it for me. My story is getting really interesting.

198
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,490
Hey, if you write everything exactly as it happened, you're plagiarizing. That's plagiarizing Dr. Yoo's life.

199
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,520
C'mon... Hyung Joong Dae, can't you live a life worthy of my plagiarizing?

200
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,930
- Wow... You really...
- What are you doing now?

201
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,210
Joong Dae, Ahn Joong Dae, did you take the CT of the patient Lee Choong Hyeon?

202
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,410
- I did.
- You did. Wow, you don't need me nagging anymore these days. You improved a lot.

203
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,040
Wow, without a first year resident, you improved a lot more.

204
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,910
I'm about to blow up trying to cover everything including the first year resident's workload.

205
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,040
Hey, what would happen if that body of yours blew up? Who could handle it?

206
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,050
Hey, that's your fortune. How would we have known that this would happen to that first year.

207
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,130
Joong Dae, I took the CT of patient Lee Choong Hyeon. Good enough?

208
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,940
It's hard to do alone! It was hard even when Kang Soo was around. Without anyone, could you imagine?

209
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,170
- Are you getting irritated?
- No, that's not it.

210
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,670
We can do it together. We can't select another first year.

211
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,760
There's too much to do for Joon Dae alone.

212
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,710
Hyungs, should I help?

213
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,100
Forget it! Just put A4 (8.5" x 11.5") paper in the printer.

214
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,320
Hey, put together a night shift schedule. I had to do that.

215
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,140
I didn't know that I'd become your slave after hitting your head a couple of times.

216
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,830
Why do I have to become your slave?

217
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,480
I told you that you'd get hit by a boomerang.

218
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,080
I learned this time that there really is a boomerang.

219
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,550
Joon Dae, Joon Dae, Ahn Joon Dae! This kid really...

220
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,660
- How can you be joking?
- If Joong Dae leaves

221
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,670
Chief you and I will have to do all of the work of the first-year residents.
- That's right, that's right.

222
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,840
I was going to say that I like Joon Dae Joon Dae Ahn Joon Dae.

223
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,840
I like you without others knowing.

224
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,240
You want A4 paper? Hyung, you want a schedule? Okay.

225
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,060
I like you without others knowing.

226
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,560
- Comrade one! Go!
- Comrade two!

227
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,450
- I like you.
- Okay.

228
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,580
I don't like you though. He's mistaken.

229
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,000
Yes, Doctor.

230
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,030
Your father's results came out.

231
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,470
What?

232
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:09,670
He got an examination from me. I called you to let you know first because I thought you'd be worried.

233
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,420
It seems like you didn't know.

234
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,920
The ultrasound shows that you have fatty liver disease. From that, you developed hepatitis.

235
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,940
Is it something serious?

236
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,640
No, you can receive outpatient care and take medication.

237
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,300
Ah... I see.

238
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:42,850
Your appointment is set and just come on that day on time. Please pay on the first floor.

239
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,860
Will the medicine be ready today?

240
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,970
You can pick up the medicine from the first floor today.

241
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,930
Thank you.

242
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,800
Did you call me?

243
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,770
We're in a relationship where I can call you whenever I want to, right?

244
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,120
You're right.

245
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,480
- I request counseling.
- What is it?

246
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,810
My father came by the hospital.

247
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,070
- To meet you?
- No, as a patient.

248
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,270
I got so scared thinking it's a serious illness.

249
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,330
It must be hard to ignore him when he's sick.

250
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:44,230
I think the hardest relationships in the world are ones with your family.

251
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,740
You hurt each other the most, yet have the strongest affection for one another.

252
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,540
I don't want to be friendly.

253
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,580
No one asks you to be friendly. You're placing that pressure on yourself.

254
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,640
Aren't you going to tell me to be friendly?

255
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,710
I won't. I'm not friendly myself, so I can't tell you to do so.

256
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,300
That's comforting in this situation.

257
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,600
How can you be this cool?

258
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,780
Oh, my... Cheesy...

259
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,350
I really like that you're my man.

260
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,110
Am I your man?

261
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,910
Yes. You're my man.

262
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:27,280
Long time no see. The beagles must not come by anymore, since you don't come by my place anymore.

263
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,440
Yes. I'll be going now.

264
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,930
- Oh my!
- Did I startle you?

265
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,380
I thought you were in the middle of a date. How did you come here?

266
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,470
Hey, do you want to have dinner together?

267
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,590
No, I don't want to. I don't like the way you look at me. As though you feel pity for me.

268
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,280
It's not like that, man.

269
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,260
- Come to my house later. I'll make some food.
- Don't bother.

270
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,640
Bring some alcohol if you have some.

271
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,820
I said don't bother! Why are you ignoring my opinion...?

272
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,710
Where did he go?

273
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:29,550
He'll be back shortly. The chief director came by so he stepped out for a moment.

274
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,480
Okay.

275
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:12,180
I'm going to kill you.

276
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,450
I wouldn't be able to kill you myself, so I'll wring you out dry.

277
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,750
My Seo Woo is here?

278
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,940
You're here.

279
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,820
What is it?

280
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,600
I heard from Hye Jeong.

281
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,940
I don't want to hear her name.

282
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,000
It's a medical accident! Who would want to have one?

283
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,550
She would know as a doctor but I don't know why she's like that. I'm so tired!

284
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,220
What did she do to you?

285
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,940
I don't want to talk about it. I have a headache.

286
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,130
Does it hurt?

287
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,430
I'm stressed out, since I have a lot on my plate.

288
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,790
Are you leaving?

289
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,830
I need to look into something.

290
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,830
I looked into it after speaking with you, Director.

291
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:16,580
Regarding my grandma... I found a way to make it a legal issue.

292
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,830
- You found it?
- There was none.

293
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,460
So, I found another way.

294
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,680
I will kill you.

295
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,320
Operating Room

296
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,780
- I'm my dad's daughter, so I can't help but see things in his position.
- You should do that.

297
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,000
I heard your threat to my dad.

298
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,670
You said you'd bug him and also that you'll squeeze the daylights out of him.

299
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,200
Your dad told you that?

300
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,060
- No. I found a tape recording.
- A tape recording?

301
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,730
Your and Dad's conversation was recorded.

302
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,160
So he recorded it.

303
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,920
It's despicable. How can you say that as a doctor yourself?

304
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,430
Were all the surgeries you performed successful?

305
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,440
There were patients who died after your surgery.

306
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,160
There can be mistakes during surgeries.

307
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:35,460
Do you know what your dad said after the surgery went wrong?

308
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,080
He said he did his best, so he feels justified.

309
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,310
He said he'd discuss it with my parents.

310
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,740
You were a minor. Of course, he has to talk to your parents.

311
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,910
Showing his condolence comes first.

312
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,070
If your dad had apologized properly,

313
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,810
if he had respected my grandmother's life,

314
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,700
it wouldn't have come to this.

315
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,880
Why didn't you tell me those things?

316
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Then I wouldn't have misunderstood you unnecessarily.

317
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,240
I was being considerate towards you.

318
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,910
Why?

319
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:15,640
Due to your kindness toward me, I did very well on that math exam.

320
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,550
And that became the trigger for me in knowing how to study.

321
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:22,640
You gave me a lot of things in life with that.

322
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,320
That's why I held it in.

323
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,970
I'm suspicious. Looks like something happened.

324
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:00,090
Something did. I got to go to the DBS Research Center as Center Chief.

325
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,600
Does it change anything?

326
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,580
Do you know the feeling? Hating something really badly, but really wanting to do it.

327
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,380
- Welcome.
- Yeah.

328
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,670
I made steaks, but I cooked it the way I want to.

329
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:25,050
I'll eat whatever you serve. Here, alcohol.

330
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,220
Vintage wine. It's expensive.

331
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,190
Here.

332
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,920
It's really awkward with two guys doing this.

333
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,680
I couldn't even say thank you all this time.

334
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,090
When my father passed away and also when you voted for us at the shareholder's meeting.

335
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,590
Do you like me that much?

336
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,940
Do you really think I gave you my vote because I like you?

337
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,480
Do you like Hye Jeong that much?

338
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,870
Yes.

339
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,670
Can't you like me more then her?

340
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,120
- Are you okay?
- I almost threw up.

341
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,400
Why are you like this to me?

342
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,130
What do you mean why? It's because I like you.

343
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,620
Gee there are so many ways you make me give up on her.

344
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,010
You can give her up if I act like this?

345
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,190
Yes, I can.

346
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,630
I'd give it a shot if you weren't such a strong opponent.

347
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,560
How about Seo Woo? Something can't be worked out?

348
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,350
Seon Woo is just a kid sister to me.

349
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,260
I feel like looking after her these days.

350
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,840
- So, I won't meddle in your business.
- What did you meddle in?

351
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,600
Looking for Director Jin's weaknesses... I can help you.

352
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,500
You don't have to. I found it.

353
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,490
- You did?
- Yeah.

354
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,070
Then, why aren't you using it?

355
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,810
Here.

356
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,580
Go ahead and speak. You can say anything.

357
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,420
Do you know that Professor Hong is going to the research center because of me?

358
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,310
I know. When are you going to marry Ji Hong?

359
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,510
Why don't you rescue our bachelor?

360
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,040
Chief...

361
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,320
I'm not joking.

362
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,670
I want to know what else he's not doing because of me.

363
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,680
Director Jin told me that

364
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm an obstacle to Professor Hong's life.

365
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,550
I respect you, Chief. I trust you.

366
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:45,090
You wouldn't make me Professor Hong's obstacle, would you?

367
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,640
Well, I can't get away with not telling you.

368
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,980
What Granny wants is for you to be happy,

369
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,350
not to give up your today to find out facts surrounding her death.

370
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,410
My baby...

371
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,740
Have you been well, Grandma?

372
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,180
I haven't been so well.

373
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,160
As you know, Grandma, I know to focus on one thing at a time.

374
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,860
I've been obsessing over your accident all my life,

375
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,270
but I'm not happy.

376
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,950
I'm not becoming happy.

377
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,900
But you know Teacher Hong, right? The one who stayed in our home.

378
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,330
When I'm with him,

379
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:01,230
I laugh and I begin to feel better.

380
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,000
You like it when I'm happy, right, Grandma?

381
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:20,230
Can I think of you only from time to time?

382
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:41,270
Sit. You said you wanted to go to work together so I made this so we can eat and then leave.

383
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,620
Did you come from your house?

384
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,290
I'm on my way back from visiting my grandma.

385
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:49,110
I should go too. Let's go together next time.

386
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,690
You've cheated twice. If you cheat again, you're out.

387
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,970
Did I cheat?

388
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,320
I met Chief Kim Tae Ho.

389
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,850
You froze.

390
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:07,590
Yeah because I think you're going to chastise me. I think you chastise me often these days.

391
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,310
Do what you'd like with the USB.

392
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:18,080
I know that my conversation with Director Jin was recorded. I also know that you're hesitant because of it.

393
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,770
I used to think if I decided and didn't act on it, I was being fake.

394
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,860
But now it's different.

395
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,580
How can I do everything?

396
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,860
You chastise Director Jin.

397
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,430
You have the power that I don't have.

398
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:42,530
If you miss out on this opportunity because of me, I'm going to hate myself forever.

399
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:46,190
He said he'd sue you for blackmail, using the voice transcript.

400
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:53,110
Then your past will resurface and I don't know how it would harm you.

401
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:57,360
I can resolve it head on. I lived like that all this time.

402
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,210
You can have that amount of faith in me.

403
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,310
It looks delicious.

404
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,730
Finally, our long awaited project

405
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,530
Guk Il Geriatric Wellness Center will begin its construction.

406
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:36,090
As you can see in the handouts you have in front of you, Moon Jeong Construction has been selected as the contractor.

407
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:40,410
For the construction fund, we'll spend around 120 billion won ($107 million USD).

408
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:06,410
We finally did it! I feel like I pulled a rotten tooth out.

409
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,210
Did you see Kim Tae Ho's face? As if he chewed on something bad.

410
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,510
Professor Hong should've been there!

411
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,460
I didn't see Yoon Do.

412
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,490
He's someone who usually doesn't have any interest in this type of thing, but he just came in this one time.

413
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,310
What is it?

414
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,130
Who are you?

415
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,520
We're from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office Special Investigation Team 1.

416
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,360
Why are the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office people here?

417
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,580
Chief Director Jin Seong Jong?

418
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,250
That's me.

419
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,300
Chief Director Jin Seong Jong,

420
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:51,120
The arrest warrant has been issued for embezzlement and breach of trust.
 Arrest Warrant

421
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,430
That's nonsense!

422
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:55,530
You have the right to a lawyer and the right to remain silent.

423
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,580
Anything you say may be used against you at court.

424
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,170
Who's the person above you?

425
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,260
Will you accompany us?

426
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,480
If we investigate, I think you'll be linked to this.

427
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:11,590
That's not true. He isn't.

428
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:18,420
Father! Father!

429
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,330
According to the Prosecutors Office, Guk Il Foundation's Chief Director Mr. Jin set up a contracting company

430
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,900
and has been managing Guk Il Hospital amenities since 2006. 
( Chief Director of Guk Il Hospital arrested for embezzlement)

431
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,630
He put away over 3 billion won ($2.7 million USD) from facility management and spent it on personal purchases of stocks.

432
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,810
Chief Director Jin is also charged with receiving around 2 billion won ($1.8 million USD)

433
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,260
of kickbacks from various vendors in exchange for ownership of facilities.

434
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,380
Want to drink some tea? Let's go.

435
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,200
Let's go.
 The Prosecutors Office placed Chief Director Jin under arrest for embezzlement and illegal acquisition of property,

436
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,260
while the other relevant figures have been placed under indictment without detention.

437
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,440
The prosecutors office, which has yet again caught corruption involving medical supplies,

438
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,040
is planning on expanding their investigation. 
 Chief Director of Guk Il Hospital arrested for embezzlement

439
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,620
SBC's Ha Gang Im reporting in.

440
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,960
Oh!

441
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:21,350
The hospital is a mess.

442
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,080
Director Jin won't stay still.

443
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:28,670
I'm aware. The past doesn't have more power than the present so I'll get through it.

444
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,300
Aish... I'm a little scared.

445
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,260
You're cute.

446
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,550
I'm hearing all sorts of things.

447
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,410
People say that I'm very calm and charismatic.

448
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,970
I think I'd be scared if it was your issue.

449
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,960
I'm not scared because it's my issue.

450
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,300
You're kind of cute.

451
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,760
You really don't like losing to me.

452
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,290
What are you saying? I've been losing to you this entire time.

453
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:55,190
You lost for me? That's not right! I won fair and square.

454
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,770
Anyway, you're so obsessive about winning and losing.

455
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:02,150
I'm not obsessing. Aren't you driving me into that corner too much?

456
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,590
What is it?

457
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,620
I want to kiss you.

458
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:15,470
Come here.
♬ I don't know anyone except you who are right for my heart ♬

459
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,800
♫  Your gestures and your glances  ♫

460
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,760
♫  tell me that you love me ♫

461
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,860
Are you feeling okay?

462
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,830
Are you uncomfortable anywhere?

463
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:38,750
No. Did you get a check up?

464
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,560
Do I have to?

465
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,840
I did it all.

466
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,140
No!

467
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,540
Because I'm old, I might be able to get out with a suspended sentence.

468
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,520
It's better for one person to go than two people, and

469
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,060
if it's going to be one out of the two of us, it's better that I go than you.

470
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,710
Father!

471
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,980
I won't be able to sleep with you in jail.

472
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:05,150
Then what about me? I won't be able to sleep with you here either!

473
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:11,090
I won't leave Hong Ji Hong alone. It was he who tipped off the prosecutor's office.

474
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,380
Where did it go?

475
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,780
The lawyer is here.

476
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,710
Does a restraining order make sense?

477
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,760
I think they believe there's a reasonable fear of tampering with evidence.

478
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,290
They've already requested detention during the court proceedings.

479
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,090
Chief Director Jin is not a victim, but is already the accused.

480
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,280
Can't you request bail?

481
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,830
We'll request bail. It will be quite high.

482
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:45,340
The money's not the issue. Get him out right away!

483
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:56,200
What are you going to say? You called me to comfort me.

484
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:01,850
Trying to comfort you won't work. You've never gone through something like this, right?

485
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,800
I've been through it twice.

486
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,450
Thank you.

487
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,590
Dad.

488
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,450
How is Yoo Hye Jeong doing?

489
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,180
Did you call me to ask me that?

490
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,770
Hong Ji Hong gave us a huge news issue to deal with. You think I'll just stand back and watch?

491
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:55,310
When he sees Yoo Hye Jeong be whispered about on the lips of others, and in the media, he'll realize something then.

492
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,770
How are you going to put Yoo Hye Jeong up and about in the media?

493
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,840
I hid a voice transcript, but it disappeared. I'm sure it'll turn up when I look for it.

494
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,830
I got rid of it.

495
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,790
What?

496
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:11,330
When I heard about the medical malpractice, I automatically took your side because you're my dad.

497
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:14,360
Because it felt like your mistakes would become my own, I avoided it.

498
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,780
I didn't do anything wrong! She's just overreacting!

499
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,670
Is it normal that she came to our hospital for an incident that ended with a settlement 13 years ago?

500
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,020
It's not normal.

501
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:26,430
If it was me and the same thing happened to you, I would've ripped and killed you on the spot.

502
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:29,780
Why'd you do it? If you made a mistake, you could've just apologized.

503
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,250
Why did you make a person's heart hurt?

504
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:35,320
Say I apologized. Do you know many people would come to take money because of that?

505
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,870
Just what kind of life have you led, Dad?

506
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:41,930
Have you only ever met people like that? Have you never met any good people?

507
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,230
Are all the people in the world those kinds of weird people?

508
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:47,170
Do you choose to treat people based on that standard?

509
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,790
I'm ashamed of you, Dad! I'm ashamed!

510
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,610
I'm ashamed of myself! I'm embarrassed!

511
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,750
Don't listen to what others are saying.

512
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,420
It'll all end soon. Your grandfather will come out as well.

513
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,790
Do you know what Hye Jeong's dream is?

514
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,660
It was to provide her grandma with a life of comfort.

515
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,500
To graduate from school and work at her grandmother's.

516
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,590
To live with her grandmother, just that one thing.

517
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,670
Dad, why couldn't you understand her heart?

518
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:21,080
Dad, at that time, if you had just apologized and said you tried your best. Because you couldn't say that much,

519
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:27,280
I know that what you lost is very precious. If you'd said that, she wouldn't have gone this far.

520
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,370
Did you place patient Song Jin Yeong in ICU?

521
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:51,870
For now, do a follow-up CT and let me know immediately if she gains consciousness.

522
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,540
Yes.

523
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,950
Hello!

524
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:59,480
Oh, what are you doing here, Professor? Hello.

525
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,080
Am I not allowed to come by?

526
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,170
Of course, you can! You came here to see Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong right.

527
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,870
Me? Who said so?

528
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,870
Everybody already knows!

529
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,220
What do they know?

530
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,760
About you two!

531
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,370
Professor, there's something I want to ask.

532
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,200
Is that so? Let's go talk and talk about it then, Doctor Yoo.

533
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,280
You don't think they're under the impression that we have no idea, do you?

534
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,290
That's not possible. If they think so, then they're both blind.

535
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,280
If you do this, people are going to find out.

536
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,120
We've already been caught. Can't you tell from people's expressions?

537
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,490
Anyway, if Chief knows, it's the same as everyone knowing.

538
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:41,830
Still, shouldn't we act like we don't know?

539
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:42,970
Why?

540
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,040
To make it fun.

541
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,440
Okay, let's do that.

542
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,460
But aren't you too laid back, Doctor? Will you continue to be at the research center?

543
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,160
That's up to the director's will.

544
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,210
You can say you want to come back.

545
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:59,820
Aren't you hungry? I'm a little hungry. I want some cold noodles before I go home. Should we get some now?

546
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,180
- Don't do stuff like this.
- What's "stuff like this"?

547
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,460
Changing the subject when you're in a bind. You can't make a move because of my voice transcript, right?

548
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,140
You're someone who really needs to go until the end, huh?

549
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,840
Yes.

550
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,400
You're right. I can't move because I'm being wary of you.

551
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,160
But, if the chief director gets dismissed, the hospital director will change too.

552
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm going to stay still, since they're mad.

553
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,140
Scaredy-cat.

554
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,270
One moment. Jin Seo Woo.

555
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,200
Yeah?

556
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,450
You're on duty today, right? I have something to tell you. Come see me for a bit.

557
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:40,880
I'm sorry I can't. I'm with someone right now.

558
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,240
It's because it's something important.

559
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,750
Your dad said to give this to me?

560
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,960
No. I stole it.

561
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:16,340
Your grandma, I've met her.

562
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:20,790
When I was hospitalized, she came by with juice.

563
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,830
Not concentrate. 100% juice.

564
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,420
There was never a time when I considered you a rival.

565
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:33,630
My 100% friendliness was because I didn't consider you a rival.

566
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,030
Whatever the reason, kindness is kindness.

567
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:41,460
I didn't want to acknowledge that you were a better kid than me.

568
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,980
I think that's when my tragic story started.

569
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,870
I provoked you.

570
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:56,900
I didn't know back then, because it was before I was in the category of "rival."

571
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:00,010
I'm sorry.

572
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:09,350
I had a chance when Soon Hee came looking for me.

573
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:13,930
I justified it and thought time would take care of it.

574
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:18,320
But the reality became worse than back then.

575
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:23,380
♫  Don't be in pain saying you are lonely  ♫

576
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,330
I thought that now is the opportunity.

577
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:32,540
♫  Oh, if I find that path  ♫

578

00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,010

00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:45,390
I'm sorry. I'll apologize in my dad's place.

00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,060
Did the talk go well?

589
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,650
Yes.

590
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,440
I think not hating her this whole time was a good thing.

591
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:26,780
Hye Jeong, let's get married.

592
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,930
What?

593
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,430
Why? You don't want to?

594
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:34,690
I mean... Aren't you being too harsh?

595
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:36,140
What?

596
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:40,520
It's not like marriage is a joke. How could you blurt it out like that?

597
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,790
I didn't just blurt it out, I said it because it was something I've been thinking about.

598
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:45,980
But this isn't right.

599
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,470
That's not being romantic!

600
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:51,140
I thought that you didn't like that kind of stuff.

601
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,280
Why would I hate it?

602
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,170
That's right. Why did I think you'd hate it?

603
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:56,590
I don't hate it.

604
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,390
What should I do? Should I do it again?

605
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,270
Yes.

606
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:02,960
Isn't there something for you to do for me?

607
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:10,980
That's right. It's not because I really want to hear those words because I know your heart either way,

608
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,380
but a person should live while expressing herself.

609
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,890
I'm not going to.

610
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:24,340
Today doesn't have the right atmosphere. The lights should be a little dimmer and...

611
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,560
Hey! You're kind of funny.

612
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,980
♫  You are the reason I live  ♫

613
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,970
♫  It's an unexplainable miracle  ♫

614
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:34,440
I'm happy.

615
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,560
You're coming in without warning again.

616
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:44,620
I'm keeping myself from the next action because we're at the hospital.

617
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:50,880
♫  Take another step closer  ♫

618
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:56,300
♫  Yes I believe my destiny  ♫

619
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,180
Hello.

620
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,780
Director, Professor Hong wants to meet with you.

621
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:20,280
I liked you, Professor Hong, but I didn't know that you would stab me in the back like this.

622
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,410
I'll reinstate you.

623
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:26,470
It seems like because Chief Director Jin is in prison, you think that the world is yours, but don't mistake yourself.

624
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,100
I have Dr. Yoo Hye Jeong's voice recording.

625
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,570
There's no reason for me to accept your will anymore.

626
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:35,250
But I will respect you because you are still the director.

627
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,870
My return should be after your leave, right director?

628
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:41,090
Then you might not be able to return forever.

629
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:44,420
Then things wouldn't have gone your way.

630
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,950
I hope at least that will go well.

631
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:00,600
Dr. Yoo Hye Jeong has been waiting for you.

632
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,020
I just came from meeting with Professor Hong.

633
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:14,760
Are you two a team fighting the battle separately?

634
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:17,890
I'm going to stop now.

635
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:21,240
I take back all the curses I spewed on you.

636
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,940
What are you doing right now?

637
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,820
It was a hard decision for me.

638
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:28,710
From now on, I'm going to live without having any ties to you.

639
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,670
Since I started, I thought I should see it to the end so I came to finish things up.

640
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,130
Did you want to hear me say thank you?

641
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:37,540
No. Please don't do it.

642
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,380
You just stay put.

643
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:43,360
I'm just finishing my homework right now.

644
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:47,730
I've learned a lot during my homework.

645
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,790
What was that?

646
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:13,040
Director, the chief director has been released on bail, so you should go.

647
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,330
I know. Let's go.

648
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:25,620
What brings you here? Are you looking for Hye Jeong?

649
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:29,730
- I'm here for you. Let's go out to eat.
- I don't want to.

650
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:33,210
You always don't eat whenever you're in a bad mood. Come on, get up.

651
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:37,360
If you're just paying me back for when I comforted you, you don't have to do this.

652
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:43,050
I wouldn't be doing this just to pay you back. I'm doing this because I want to.

653
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:46,800
Seo Woo— Hello.

654
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,710
Oh, you're here?

655
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:53,210
I came to eat with Seo Woo...

656
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:55,010
Alright, let's go.

657
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,390
Hey! You said you didn't want to when I asked.

658
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,980
I choose who I get to eat with.

659
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,420
Yeah, it's up to you. Go on and eat with Yeong Gook,

660
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,080
but you're a bit rude.

661
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,030
Compared to how rude you were to me, this is nothing.

662
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:14,080
Did I say anything about what I did to you? I'm just telling you about you.

663
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:19,290
I feel at ease. Take her out and treat her to something delicious.

664
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:22,530
Go eat something expensive, I'll pay you back.

665
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,610
Pretending as if he's cool.

666
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:33,150
He's not pretending to be cool; he is cool. If you like him, do so.

667
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,420
Don't block your feelings from going anywhere.

668
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,680
It's not like that.

669
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,400
I just feel bad. I keep remembering the times I acted like a fool.

670
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:44,880
A fool?

671
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,990
Mom

672
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:51,890
Seo Woo, it's been a while.

673
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:54,270
Yes, Grandfather. It was hard, wasn't it?

674
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:55,980
I'm fine now. Let's eat.

675
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,720
Father, have some of this.

676
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:06,190
Ah, what's wrong with you? That's why I told you to have a medical check-up.

677
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,310
It's just because of stress. Why are you forcing me to have an illness?

678
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:12,880
Wait, you still didn't receive your medical check-up?

679
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,000
I'll go, since you're back now...

680
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,940
Seo Woo, book an appointment for your father's check-up.

681
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:19,900
I understand.

682
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:24,800
- From now on, it'll be a big fight. Health is the most important.
- Yes.

683
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,500
- Seo Woo, let's eat.
- Yes.

684
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,700
- Father-in-law, please eat a lot.
- All right.

685
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,680
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong, is Professor Hong not going to return?

686
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,740
There's a procedure for it. The director has to give his approval.

687
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,600
- Ah, Father is coming today.
"Father"?

688
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:56,840
Your father has an appointment with my uncle today.

689
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,260
I went to the Rice Soup Restaurant a three days ago.

690
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:03,480
The rice soup was good. I heard that your grandma used to run that place.

691
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,060
Yes.

692
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,640
Doctor Jin.

693
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,670
Patient Kim Jin Gyeong. Did you change the nimodipine to oral medication and is she ambulating?

694
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:17,720
Yes, we started wheelchair ambulation yesterday.

695
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,300
I need to visit.

696
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,850
Yes.

697
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:27,550
There's no reason for you to be dispirited because of what's happening between your father and me.

698
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,500
The reason I chose you as a fellow for our department

699
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,880
is because you were the right person.

700
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,830
Thank you.

701
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:40,720
Take the call.

702
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:48,490
Yes?

703
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,760
This is Kim Tae Ho speaking.

704
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,570
Vice Director, this is Lee Gi Won from Wellness Center.

705
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,270
I'm calling due to Director Jin Myeong Hoon's medical check-up results.

706
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:05,500
What is it?

707
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,500
Yes.

708
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,950
Look at this.

709
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,470
There are tumors on vertebrae three and four.

710
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:39,350
It's either ependymoma or astrocytoma, right?

711
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:44,490
This is serious. If it's this bad, then the symptoms must have shown up. Who is this?

712
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,550
Director Jin Myeong Hoon. This will be a hard surgery.

713
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:53,470
Even if we do the surgery, I don't think the prognosis will be good.

714
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:56,220
I'm a surgeon who can accomplish most things if I set my mind to it,

715
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,830
but this is a hard surgery, even for me.

716
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:00,720
Of course.

717
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,530
Still, you're the only one who can do this surgery.

718
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,840
Yeah, Seo Woo?

719
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,970
Mom, Dad's results came out.

720
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,660
It's not something bad, right?

721
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,790
It's a tumor.

722
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,660
It's been a while.

723
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,190
How is your health?

724
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,130
It's fine.

725
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,800
Do you visit Doo Sik often?

726
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,540
I visit at least once a month.

727
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:03,850
I see. I need to visit him too.

728
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:06,410
He was my lifelong friend.

729
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:09,370
I regret not being with him at the end.

730
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:18,810
Can't you perform the surgery on my Myeong Hoon?

731
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:20,790
Well, I'm at the research center right now.

732
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:23,900
You can just come back. That's not hard.

733
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:27,580
Director Jin will refuse to undergo a surgery performed by me.

734
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,390
- Leave that to me.
- In a surgery,

735
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:33,750
it's a given that the doctor has to do well, but the patient has to do well too.

736
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,510
He sees me as his rival.

737
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:43,620
He won't be able to leave himself comfortably to me, and if that happens, the success rate drops.

738
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:47,420
On top of that, this surgery has a high-risk factor,

739
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:50,940
so the success rate for the surgery itself is low.

740
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:57,910
Still, I beg of you because the doctor has to do much better than the patient.

741
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,700
Surgical Management of Intramedullary Spinal Ependymomas

742
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:39,970
Patient Kim Soo Ryeon's carvenous angioma,

743
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:42,170
did you schedule the surgery?

744
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:45,090
Not yet. Why?

745
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:49,290
That's a tough surgery. I was wondering if Dr. Hong can do it.

746
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:52,220
The chief is good too.

747
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:56,440
Would Doctor Hong have lost his skills because he hasn't performed surgery recently?

748
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,910
He hasn't lost his skills.

749
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:02,060
He practically spends all of his time watching videos of surgeries.

750
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,940
He has quick hands and he's precise.

751
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:12,240
When you heard that your grandma had cancer, how did you feel?

752
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:18,160
I first heard that news in the visiting room of the holding cell I was locked up in.

753
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,490
I felt as if the heavens were falling.

754
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,660
My grandma was my refuge in my life.

755
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:28,050
I cried and cried again.

756
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:35,080
I hated myself for not being able to do anything.

757
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:39,850
If only I had done a little better, my grandma wouldn't have been sick.

758
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,620
What's wrong with you?

759
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:54,050
My dad was really good to me.

760
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:57,870
I have many memories with him when I was young.

761
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:01,510
Is something going on?

762
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:07,620
Of course, our relationship is strained these days because he has high expectations.

763
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:14,650
Until recently, I hated him, didn't listen to him,

764
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:17,050
and didn't even go home often.

765
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:27,630
Yeah, what is it?

766
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:31,550
There's a male patient in the ER. I think he feel asleep after taking sleeping pills.

767
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:35,750
What are you doing? Why are you reporting to me about a patient who took sleeping pills?

768
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,520
It's Director Jin Myeong Hoon.

769
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,570
His wife says a tumor was discovered from a recent physical.

770
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:53,460
I'll be down soon so call Doctor Hong Ji Hong.

771
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,070
Yes.

772
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:08,270
Are you okay, Honey?

773
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:12,150
Ah, why are you creating such a fuss?! Why did you bring someone who was just sleeping to the emergency room?!

774
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,780
Are you okay?

775
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:19,750
I'm fine. I'm so embarrassed because of your mom!

776
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:22,830
So, why didn't you get admitted to the hospital when I told you to?

777
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:25,830
If you had been hospitalized after you found out about your illness, this wouldn't have happened.

778
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,100
- I'll examine you.
- Ah,

779
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,500
forget it. Let's do it later.

780
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:38,200
Oh, Teacher!

781
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,250
Hello.

782
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:53,650
You have to live life until the end, you have to go until the end

783
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:57,280
to find the meaning of life given to you.

784
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,420
You have to go until the end.
