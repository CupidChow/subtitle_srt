00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:28,700
Episode 6

2
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:50,630
The value of precious things can only be appraised when they are lost.

3
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,850
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

4
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,190
Son, I love you.

5
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,790
I didn't know back then that the banality of the everyday was the most valuable thing we could enjoy.

6
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:39,760
Doctor, please have a look at my mom and dad. Mom, please...

7
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,210
Someone could be lost before your very eyes and you would be unable to do anything.

8
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,530
Patient Lee Se Jun, has been declared dead on September 11, 1986, at 01:15

9
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,110
Patient So Yeon Hee, has been declared dead on September 11, 1986 at 01:15.

10
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,070
I hate anything that disturbs my everyday experiences.

11
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,490
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

12
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,230
Look carefully.

13
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,330
Pain is felt not seen.

14
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,160
Dr. Jeong Yoon Do. What are you doing right now? What did you do while things got to this state?

15
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,100
Why are you picking on me? What did I do?

16
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,050
What...It's because you didn't do anything you're getting called out.

17
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,910
What do you want me to do when things got this way while I was trying to do something?

18
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,900
Do you think I was twiddling my thumbs?

19
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,590
Do you think it's something to be proud of that things got this way when you tried?

20
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,790
It is!

21
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,590
Dr. Jeong Yoon Do, move him to ICU.

22
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,490
What? You said ***? Hey! Who did you say *** to?

23
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:15,100
I was talking to myself. Can't I even talk to myself now? Am I such a pushover to you?

24
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,130
We have to attend to Boss!

25
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:30,510
Doc, call gastroenterology for me. Seeing that the bleeding is profuse, I think he was stabbed in the liver.

26
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,800
Hurry! Stat!

27
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,550
Yeah.

28
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,110
Geez ,what a punk like you!

29
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,570
It hurts. You're so immature.

30
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,860
I'm sorry for calling you when you should be resting.

31
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,970
Do you know? It's our third time meeting today.

32
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,790
Crazy kid. You're saying useless things again. Hurry inside and operate.

33
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,140
If we meet again for the fourth time, you're going out with me, okay?

34
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,740
Oh, there's no way that'll happen. Go. Go. Go.

35
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,630
Hey, you.

36
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,530
He seems fun.

37
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:11,220
That's fun? How can he still have the same old repertoire as what he had in school?

38
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,870
If it were me, I wouldn't be able to have the same routine because it's too tiring.

39
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,670
Why are you looking at me like that?

40
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,230
- Where are you going?
- To the fox boss in the ICU.

41
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,230
I'll go with you.

42
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:32,970
Because he tripped over Dr. Jeong Yoon Do's feet, the angle of the cut was off. That's why he survived.

43
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,460
Do you want to say that I was too harsh to Dr. Jeong Yoon Do?

44
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,060
It was the first time I saw you so mad, Doc.

45
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,950
I was surprised too with how strident I was.

46
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,030
I'd like it if you went home to rest.

47
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,780
Okay. I'll just see you off first.

48
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,190
Hye Jeong.

49
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,750
From this point, any action I take is done on a human-to-human level, humanity.

50
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,070
What are you going to do?

51
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,950
NSICU
Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit

52
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,490
Thank you.

53
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,400
For what?

54
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,940
You're a fool, aren't you Yoo Hye Jeong?

55
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,420
Go now.

56
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,030
History of Present Illness: Epidural Hemorrhaging

57
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,910
Upon admittance normal mental status, but turned to stupor.
Attending: Yoo Hye Jeong

58
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:09,340
Dr. Jeong Yoon Do said there wasn't too much additional bleeding. He said to administer mannitol and follow up with a CT scan.

59
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,490
Did you do the CT scan?

60
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,340
Ah yes. The results are probably out. One moment please.

61
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,700
Here.

62
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,170
Though his bleeding increased, it's not enough to warrant a surgery.

63
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,560
Send him back to the regular wards. Let's keep watch over his progress while using meds.

64
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,080
Yes.

65
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,170
I heard that Dr. Jeong Yoon Do saved you, doc. Is that true?

66
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,270
- Who said so?
- Dr. Jeong Yoon Do! It's not true, right?

67
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:43,220
As a witness from the ER, for you to have subdued the gangsters: 1 against 16—

68
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,810
Is your work going well?

69
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,270
I still haven't been able to follow up on the relevant documents.

70
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,360
Relevant research documents are critical to your paper.

71
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,580
What are you going to do if that's not working out for you?

72
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,630
At this rate, do you think you'd be able to write three?

73
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,900
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,890
It's because you poke your nose in useless things when you lack the time.

75
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,730
I'd find another paper if I were you.

76
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,870
That Birthmark Witch, I was wondering why she was so quiet lately.

77
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,630
Doc!

78
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,100
Doc! Stop right there.

79
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,190
Why did you come to see me earlier in the wards?

80
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,800
About that.... I don't need it anymore.

81
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,170
Thank you.

82
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,370
Are you making fun of me?

83
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,220
Why would I make fun of you, Doc?

84
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,100
No. As a man, I was so incompetent.

85
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:05,830
At the time, I should've kicked away the knife and I should've been the one to block it too.

86
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,030
It's embarrassing.

87
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,720
Doctor!

88
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,600
This is called an one-two upper backspin elbow.

89
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,660
And this—

90
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,340
is the high kick.

91
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,370
These are all kickboxing moves. Even though I'm a girl, I'm a pro.

92
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,320
Were you surprised?

93
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,430
Do you... Do you call this consolation?

94
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:53,800
"Even though I'm a girl, I'm a pro, so you don't have to be embarrassed that you got hit as a man."

95
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,020
Yes. Since you're smart, you seem to understand well.

96
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:04,000
One more thing. It is consolation for your act of kindness towards me.

97
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,600
Thank you. If it wasn't for you—

98
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,930
Stop! It's okay. It's embarrassing.

99
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,920
Then go. I have to stay here until Boss regains consciousness.

100
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,270
Well, I'm on call anyway too.

When you go to see Nam In Sook, should I go with you?

111
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,850
It would be nice if you would show up once in a while.

112
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,750
Both of those people are your connections.

113
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,560
What's with "your" and "my" connections? My connections are your connections.

What about Doo Sik's business? How is it going?

115
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,060
I'm checking to see what time would be the best to use it.

116
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,960
- Guk Il Medical Center needs to become a for-profit enterprise.
- The bill was proposed.

117
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,690
Many people opposed it but it was passed in the end.

118
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,960
I wonder when Guk Il Hospital will become Guk Il Medical Corporation.

119
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,680
- It's not too far away.
- I'll take time for it to go into effect.

120
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,170
I might not live to see it, but Seo Woo will become the most influential person.

121
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,980
Don't talk about being unable to see it!

122
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,390
When Doo Sik goes home, I'm going to give you everything I have and retire.

123
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,890
I like you the best.

124
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,990
Of course. No need to say things that are obvious.

125
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,500
Welcome. You've been down there since dawn with Father-in-law. Have you been practicing since then?

126
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,420
He calls you over all the time since you both now live in the same building.

127
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,660
You're ignoring me again.

128
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:49,110
I know that you've become this impressive person now, but at home you're just my husband.

129
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,400
Don't say anything, alright?

130
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,130
If you want a man like me as your husband, you need to have some dignity too.

131
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,010
Since when did you— Aiyoo. Aiyoo!

132
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,950
Hey! Hurry and get married. I'm going to get you married and divorce your dad.

133
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,170
If you want to get a divorce, get one now and don't use me as an excuse.

134
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,990
You're my only daughter, but the more time passes, the more I don't like you!

135
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,010
You're starting to gradually resemble your father!

136
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,550
Even if I look for some affection inside you, it's impossible to find!

137
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,690
Stop whining. Both Dad and I receive so much stress from work.

138
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,210
Then am I the only one who has to understand everything?

139
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,860
Yes. It would be nice if you did.

140
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,600
You and Dad don't match.

141
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,560
Either way, you're not going to divorce him. So just live as a lonely married woman.

142
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,150
Ah, what a daughter...

143
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,040
Are you sulking again? Come on, Mom.

144
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,650
Bring Yoon Do over. Let's talk about marriage.

145
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,760
Marriage? I still haven't been able to start dating him.

146
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,350
You're so smart, but how is it that you don't even know how to get one guy?

147
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,720
I don't like easy men. It's precious only if you work hard to get it.

148
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,110
A woman can only be happy when she gets married to someone who likes her.

149
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,360
Mom, are you happy? I heard that you pursued and married Dad because you liked him.

150
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,690
That's true. I pursued him and married him, but he thinks it was all because he was so great.

151
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,170
You shouldn't take in a black-haired beast.
(Black-haired beasts bite the hand that feeds them)

152
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,240
Am I a beast?

153
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,420
I don't want to have conversations with your mother because she's like this.

154
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,760
I was wrong; I spoke recklessly.

155
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,360
Keep talking about what you were talking about. Did you say you were going to set a date with Yoon Do?

156
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,120
- She hasn't even been able to get that far.
- Set the date.

157
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,190
- I'm not going to have a loveless marriage.
- You love each other.

158
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,530
How many times do I have to tell you? Sunbae doesn't love me.

159
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,950
We shouldn't leave it to her. Honey, you do it.

160
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,900
- Dad...
- Love, it's nothing.

161
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,880
It disappears once you live together so why risk everything for that?

162
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,040
Men are not that special either. Yoon Do? If you want him, do whatever you can to get him.

163
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,390
Once you get him, you'll get tired of him. That's love. Love is wanting to throw it away after you get it.

164
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,340
What a way to teach her.

165
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,660
Getting married, receiving love, having a child, there are so many things that can make a woman happy...

166
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,880
Leave that kind of happiness to people like your mother and look further into the future.

167
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,660
Don't forget what I told you before.

168
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,310
Hey, can't I just move into your house starting tomorrow?

169
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,860
I don't think it's right for two men over 30 to live together.

170
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,650
- Yoon Do!
- Yea—

171
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,790
Yeah, Uncle.

172
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,450
What is he? He's your nephew? Your real nephew?

173
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,530
Then would there be a fake nephew?

174
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,570
Ah, I guess he's sulking because I abandoned him and slept at your place instead.

175
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,080
He's a bit simple-minded.

176
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,350
He's not simple-minded. He's rude.

177
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,820
Hey, why are you saying it like that now?

178
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,680
- Yoon Do! You like your uncle that much?
- Ugh, seriously!

179
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,910
Ah, the smell. How much did you drink? The smell of alcohol is still there.

180
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,670
Aigoo, your whining is so cute.

181
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,010
- Why are you like that, really.
- Ji Hong!

182
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,600
Let's go in his car.

183
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,240
W-W-W-Why ride my car? What about your car?

184
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,740
Would I have brought it when I was drunk on alcohol?

185
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,390
I don't want to. I don't like that doctor.

186
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,960
Ji Hong, he said he doesn't like you.

187
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,680
Ah, seriously! If you hate him too, do you want to get a taxi?

188
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,730
Hey, why take a taxi when there's a fine car right in front of the house? It's a waste of money.

189
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,960
W-Why are you like this? Do you not have a car, Doctor?

190
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,220
When my car from America arrives, I need to go pick it up.

191
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,630
- But why are you speaking informally?
- You're his nephew.

192
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:42,290
I'm his friend. A friend's nephew is my nephew. Right, friend?

193
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,520
- Ah, of course, friend. Let's get on.
- Okay.

194
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,990
Uncle. Doctor.

195
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,560
What kind of old-fashioned sorting out of relationships is this?

196
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,160
Ah, seriously.

197
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,980
How much did you guys drink that he's like that?

198
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,700
Why is my uncle like that when you're perfectly fine?

199
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,420
Are you complaining right now?

200
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,010
I don't think that's right. I don't think you're my uncle because you're my uncle's friend.

201
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,260
- It isn't right.
- Right?

202
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,660
Then let's revert back to before we met my uncle.

203
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,410
I have to sleep. Drive well.

204
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,580
Also, I was a bit excessive yesterday.

205
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,630
Then what does that make me?

206
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,400
What do you mean, what does that make you? It turns things back to normal.

207
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,800
Doctor!

208
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,900
How is the patient?

209
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,750
Ah, the CT scan shows that it reduced a bit, but it's still really swollen, so

210
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,360
we're splitting 100cc of Mannitol over 6 doses.

211
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,260
- How are you controlling the symptoms?
- With AAP (Acetaminophen, Tylenol).

212
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,350
If the patient seems to be in a lot of pain, then administer NSAID or morphine using your own judgment.

213
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,610
And when swelling goes down, notify me.

214
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,500
I think you can reduce the Mannitol as well.

215
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,510
- Yes.
- Guardian?

216
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,930
I think they went out somewhere.

217
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,220
He's in a mental-stupor so make sure you tell them in a way that doesn't make them worry.

218
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,880
Yes, I understand.

219
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,670
Neurosurgery
Hong Ji Hong

220
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,080
Professor Hong Ji Hong will come after the meeting.

221
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,240
How do you know that?

222
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,720
I...somehow came to know.

223
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,900
You're waiting without contacting him?

224
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,560
- Yes.
- So you're just waiting.

225
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,000
Where did you buy the flowers?

226
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,060
From the flower shop in the basement.

227
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,480
Ah, there's a flower shop in the basement...

228
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,110
Uh... Aren't you curious about anything about me?

229
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,680
Should I be curious?

230
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,970
No, but it's how people are. If I keep asking you questions, out of politeness,

231
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,730
you should throw at least one question at me.

232
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,150
Why?

233
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,460
Right. Why is that?

234
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:27,650
Because we had to do decompression to reduce the pressure from the edema in his head, we opened his head.

235
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,510
He's a car-accident patient so the mid-line of his brain had already shifted.

236
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,140
Even if he regains consciousness, it might be hard for him to live like he used to.

237
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,820
What's an edema?

238
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,770
Uh, what's an edema... Swelling!

239
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,720
- So you're saying the head is swollen?
- Yes, that's right.

240
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,300
Anyway, you're saying that we have to continue monitoring him, right?

241
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,250
That's right.

242
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,940
I understand. Thank you, Doctor.

243
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,390
Yes.

244
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,240
Call all of the doctors in the Neurology Department to gather in the conference room.

245
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,560
Yes.

246
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,940
Is something going on? Why did the Chief suddenly call a meeting?

247
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,280
According to my WiFi (radar), he's extremely furious right now.

248
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,840
Is it because the gangster boss was injured?

249
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,230
It seems like bad situations always followsDoctor Yoo Hye Jeong.

250
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,410
I follow her around too, because I am a dutiful resident.

251
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,050
Right.

252
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,080
Is everyone here?

253
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,870
Yes.

254
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,180
Kang Kyeong Joon.

255
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,300
- Yes?
- Repeat exactly what you told Patient Lee Soo Jin's guardian.

256
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,260
Yes. The head has edema, and because we have to do decompression,

257
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,570
- we've opened his head first.
- Enough.

258
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,420
What's the problem here? Bi Yeong Gook.

259
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,630
I know the problem,

260
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,160
- but I can't answer.
- These guys.

261
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,730
You've finally decided to make the wrong call by protecting each other and turn one another into incapable people?

262
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,670
How many times have I told you to break down medical terminology to simple words when talking to patients?

263
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:55,650
As long as I, Kim Tae Ho, the Chief of the Neurosurgery Department of Guk Il Medical Center remain, that's the rule.

264
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,840
I taught you that but you're breaking that rule right in front of my eyes?

265
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,720
Don't talk in a manner that the patient can't understand.

266
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,390
I'm sorry.

267
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,960
You all are experts. In other words, you're doctors who have had training.

268
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,000
Don't just learn skills, but you have to learn mentally too.

269
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,930
Yes.

270
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,860
- When did you come?
- It's been a while.

271
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,110
If you had left a message, I would have come quickly.

272
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,310
Go in.

273
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,370
There's no place to sit because nothing is organized yet.

274
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,300
It's because I haven't started work officially.

275
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,630
Congratulations on getting a job at Guk Il Medical Center.

276
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,260
Thank you. You know how to do things like this too?

277
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,430
What meaning do these flowers have? Is it something like purity or pure love?

278
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,550
I don't know. I just bought them because they were pretty.

279
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:54,680
Just because. "Just because" is mine but it seems like you use it more often.

280
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:01,240
But, this is actually a bribe. You must hear my request.

281
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,900
What are these numbers?

282
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,790
It's my grandma's patient number, but I can't see her surgery records because I'm not a staff member yet.

283
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:15,140
You're a staff member so you can see them. Let me see the power you have as a staff member.

284
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,460
Why do you want to see this?

285
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,880
Please find it and print me a copy of the records.

286
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,600
And let me know the names of the residents who participated in the surgery.

287
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,590
This is the reason why you decided to forgo your Director position at Dae Jung Hospital?

288
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,870
I thought that if I became an employee, I would be able to see all of the records.

289
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,360
As expected, Chairman is different from others.

290
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,130
The information management system is top notch.

291
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,920
Forget about it, Hye Jeong.

292
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,720
How can I forget about it?

293
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,910
It's harsh, but you're a surgeon too. We can't all be free of medical accidents.

294
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,560
I thought I could understand the director once I became a doctor,

295
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,010
but I have more trouble understanding him after becoming a doctor.

296
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,250
"I did my best, but there is a limit."

297
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,580
"I gave you money, so don't say anything else."

298
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,000
Is this the right attitude to have when dealing with a person's death?

299
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,160
My grandma

300
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,720
trusted the doctor, without the slightest bit of doubt, up to her last moments before she entered the surgery room.

301
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,640
I need to know everything that happened in the operating room.

302
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,140
If you find out, what are you going to do?

303
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,270
Whatever I do, I'll decide after I find out.

304
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,390
You know that the punishment for medical malpractice is 10 years?

305
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,450
You said that you can't edit circumstances, but you can edit the heart.

306
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,070
How could you rip that paper?

307
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,860
I'm sorry about that. I did that because I felt bad for you.

308
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,330
Hm?

309
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,390
You're a doctor who gets respect from others now.

310
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,900
Can't you enjoy your life normally now?

311
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,730
I didn't have the luxury of living my life normally.

312
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,400
Forget about it.

313
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,280
If you don't help me, I'll find another staff member.

314
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,570
Or I'll hack the system.

315
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,950
Are you crying?

316
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,580
I don't have tact either, but you really don't have any tact.

317
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,680
This is when you act like you didn't see anything and go on your way.

318
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,930
Seems like you weren't crying. Why did you appear like you were?

319
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,910
The police said they wanted our statements, so you need to go to the patient's room,

320
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,720
with me.

321
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,620
Dr. Hong Ji Hong already accepted. I think he's quick to do everything.

322
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,840
Shall we go?

323
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,970
Access Denied

324
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,960
Access Denied

325
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,070
Seems like Hye Jeong caused another problem.

326
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,670
Dr. Hye Jeong didn't cause an accident, but was on the receiving end of one.

327
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:57,680
If it weren't for Dr. Hye Jeong, Boss could've died.

328
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,040
Why'd you come together?

329
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,140
We got questioned by the police because of Boss.

330
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,030
Sunbae must feel upset, about being entangled in a weird situation.

331
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:16,160
If you're with her, you always get in a bad situation.

332
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,070
She should leave the hospital, according to your wishes, Sunbae.

333
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,450
I don't wish that anymore.

334
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,270
Dr. Yoo is a good person. After getting to know her, it's alright.

335
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,540
What did you see and learn?

336
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,570
Well... If you ask about it in a detailed manner, then I have nothing to say.

337
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,070
What is this weird feeling? Did you fall for her in the meantime?

338
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:38,080
What is the nature of the competition between you and Dr. Yoo?

339
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,560
I told you about it, my trauma.

340
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,220
It happened because of her. She was a gangster while in high school.

341
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,890
She wasn't able to graduate; she got expelled.

342
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,780
What I said to you now and not before was out of consideration for her.

343
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:56,200
You didn't need to have that consideration. I heard it from Dr. Yoo.

344
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,410
I have a question though. At that time,

345
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,890
was it only you was hurt unilaterally by Doctor Yoo?

346
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,290
I'm going to bet my car on the fact that it wasn't.

347
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,820
From what I see, something definitely happened in Boss's ward.

348
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,740
She probably got a hold of his weakness.

349
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,980
The stories all vary, but if you gather all the data, Dr. Yoo Hye Jeong saved Dr. Jeong Yoon Do

350
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,510
from getting beaten to death.

351
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,820
What animal do you like?

352
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,570
Dogs. I like that they don't betray you.

353
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,930
Move her to the ward.

354
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,920
Yes, I understand.

355
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,890
Hello!

356
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,930
The young lady doctor is here.

357
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,300
Are you doing well?

358
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,310
Thank you for always looking after me.

359
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:51,390
I feel extremely responsible as someone who was at the scene.

360
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,170
You came to talk to this doctor, right, using me as an excuse?

361
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:59,250
Ah, I really can't fool you, Ajumma.

362
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,870
- Now, your car is mine.
- What?

363
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,370
What do you think about me?

364
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:08,110
What is the evidence that I wasn't unilaterally hurt?

365
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,090
Let's talk somewhere else.

366
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,440
Let's talk here. There's no reason to exclude her.

367
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,390
She already saw me behaving disgracefully.

368
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,330
That's true.

369
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,900
You don't know how you've wronged me?

370
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,630
I'm sorry. Satisfied?

371
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,760
I'll be satisfied if you take out the, "Satisfied?"

372
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,260
That's right. If you add, "Satisfied?" then it isn't an apology.

373
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,310
The two of you get along so well.

374
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,740
I'll take out the, "Satisfied?"

375
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,090
Satisfied?

376
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,020
Just because I like you doesn't mean that you're the party in power. I'm the one with the power!

377
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,850
I like Doc. I should have lived like you from the beginning.

378
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,240
Ajumma, you also seem to have quite a personality.

379
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,660
Can you listen to my request?

380
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,160
Tell my son to ask the b*tch to come.

381
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,220
If I'm the one to tell her, she won't listen.

382
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,690
Yes, Father.

383
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,870
Hey, what makes you so busy with both work and private matters?

384
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,110
That's what I mean.

385
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,660
Isn't he on vacation still?

386
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,260
Why are you ordering around my son?

387
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,400
No, I said don't come out, but Ji Hong insisted.

388
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,000
Hey, that's not it, Prof.

389
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,710
Fine, fine. Just rest for the remainder of this week.

390
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,410
That's perfect. Let's go fishing.

391
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,130
I really don't like fishing.

392
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,370
Hey, it's fun once you keep at it.

393
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:27,640
No Father, if it wasn't fun for ten years, then it's not fun.

394
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,590
I call it. In one year, you'll think it's fun.

395
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,800
Ahh! But I really don't like it.

396
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,560
Hello! Here is a flyer. We just opened a new cafe. Please visit.

397
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,970
Omo, hello! There's a recently opened cafe called Soon Hee Hawaii, across the street.

398
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,040
Please visit. Guk Il Medical Center employees get a 20% discount.

399
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,520
Cafe— Oww!

400
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,200
Ah please watch where you're going.

401
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,000
Ah, then what about you...?

402
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,330
I-I'm sorry.

403
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:04,240
Let's go upstairs quick, Mom. If we register early, won't we be seen faster?

404
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,500
If only you had gotten better grades, you could've become a doctor.

405
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,630
Mom, isn't it too late to say those words?

406
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,130
I'm already in my third year.

407
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,140
I'm just saying it because it's such a waste.

408
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,760
It's not like I have grades that I'm going to a university for education, instead of medical school.

409
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,260
What a joke.

410
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,460
Please wake up from that dream. There's a big gap between the grades.

411
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,580
Our daughter is so humble.

412
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,460
Why don't we go? And I said that it wasn't true.

413
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,830
Hye Jeong!

414
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,940
My friend, the doctor!

415
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,880
Hye Jeong! Hye Jeong!

416
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,080
Won't you be quiet.

417
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,670
Where is she? Where is that ahjumma?

418
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:49,470
There's this ahjumma who was bragging about her daughter attending a university to major in education.

419
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,260
My friend is a doctor! I just want to show that ahjumma.

420
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,700
Now, you run your business on your own.

421
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,210
Of course! Now that I saw your face, I gained energy. I will do well.

422
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:06,080
Here. Clothes. You haven't been able to come home because you're on call.

423
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,780
Thank you.

424
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,960
Okay! Fighting!

425
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,770
Hello!

426
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:23,540
I am CEO Cheon Soon Hee of Soon Hee Hawaii, a cafe that recently opened near this medical center.

427
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,730
It's a grand opening event.

428
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,580
We are offering a 20% discount specifically to Guk Il Medical Center employees.

429
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,940
Please come over just once.

430
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,150
Please leave.

431
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,160
Solicitors aren't allowed in the hospital.

432
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,890
Ah, seriously. What is security doing?

433
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:43,780
I guess you missed some of my introduction earlier. I'm not a solicitor,

434
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:48,320
I'm a CEO. I own a cafe called Soon Hee Hawaii—

435
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,910
I told you to leave. Since when were owners of cafes considered CEOs?

436
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,590
My friend is a doctor here.

437
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,560
Oh, I see.

438
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,900
I'm not someone you can treat however you want.

439
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,690
My older brother is a judge in the Seoul District Office,

440
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,840
my younger brother is CEO of a famous venture company whose name you just might recognize,

441
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,210
and my father has immersed himself in education his entire life!

442
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,770
And I'll never go there!

443
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,700
President! This person here isn't normal

444
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,540
Please come over here.

445
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,510
Really... I'm gonna...

446
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:26,080
No, when I'm this pretty,

447
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,410
how could he treat such a pretty woman so nonchalantly?

448
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:35,980
But how old are you? I don't consider women over 30 to be women.

449
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,920
Twenty... 6?

450
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,780
That's perfect. Twenty six? Then is your friend a resident here?

451
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,110
- Pardon?
- Which department?

452
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,960
Anyway, Doctor, please come visit us.

453
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,660
I have to go make my rounds at some other places too.

454
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,430
There will be a company dinner soon. We'll go over there.

455
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:59,460
Thank you.

456
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,050
As expected, handsome people have nice personalities.

457
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,340
His face is such a mess.

458
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,100
Hey, get her. Hey!

459
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,600
Hello.

460
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,900
Mrs. Lee Ga Jin?

461
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,740
Yes? Let's go, Mom.

462
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,050
What discomfort brought you here today?

463
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,010
Yes. As you can see—

464
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,540
What's wrong?

465
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,160
T-This... How did this happen?

466
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,690
Mom, what's wrong?

467
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:53,470
- You're embarrassing me.
- It's been a while.

468
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,410
Mom...

469
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,840
She's your older sister, Unni Hye Jeong.

470
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,530
First, we'll take an MRI. Please go outside. She'll escort you.

471
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,970
Yes. Please come this way.

472
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,630
Is that really Unni Hye Jeong? Then why did she act like she didn't know us?

473
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,770
Then and now, she's still rude.

474
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,800
Mr. Kim Gyeong Ho.

475
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,490
Yes?

476
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,390
Mom!

477
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,310
What's wrong?

478
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:33,420
Didn't you hear earlier? I'm her mom!

479
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,120
Wait, you—

480
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,190
Hey! Are you ignoring your own mother? You're Hye Jeong.

481
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,380
Since when were you my mom?

482
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,860
Look at you. With all these people here,

483
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,850
how can someone who's a doctor be like this to her own mother?

484
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:55,030
Just because of reputation and strangers watching, wrong doesn't become right, and you won't become my mom.

485
00:33:55,030 --> 00:34:00,320
If you're threatening me with the watchful gazes of others right now, wake up. Yes, I am Hye Jeong.

486
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,020
Yeah, it is you.

487
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:08,680
Then, I can't be treated by you. Change my doctor.

488
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,980
I worried so much.

489
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,770
You don't even age.

490
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,880
No. These days, I've aged so I'm upset.

491
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,850
Come closer.

492
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,760
What are you doing?!

493
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,100
Don't cry, it's okay.

494
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,740
I'm crying because her temper is like that.

495
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,850
Let's leave.

496
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,480
I feel so refreshed!

497
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:13,570
When he cheated, it felt so cheap and dirty that I just sent them on their way nicely.

498
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,530
Even when we divorced, I didn't get a single cent from him

499
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,810
and I lived a hectic life as I had to feed my children.

500
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:22,370
I worked from dawn to late at night

501
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:27,660
and I was getting more settled. What crime did I commit?

502
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,810
"Good things will come to those who are kind"? B*llshit!

503
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:37,650
I'm lying in a hospital like this, and I don't know what that b*tch ate, but her face is glowing.

504
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,530
You still need absolute rest.

505
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:45,260
If I hadn't given him a divorce back then, that b*tch would have lived in the shadows forever,

506
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,110
but now, she's living her life hearing people call her "Madame".

507
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,730
You can enjoy your life and date, too, after you fully recover and leave this place.

508
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,630
At this age, I can't even beat my illness. What do you mean date?

509
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,310
You're still pretty.

510
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,360
You find me pitiful, don't you? You're saying things you don't mean.

511
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,980
No, that's not true.

512
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,040
Don't ever lose him.

513
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,480
There's no such thing as "Good things will come to those who are kind".

514
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,620
The world is like that. It only remembers the takers. That b*tch is a madame

515
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:19,400
and I'm an ahjumma. That's how the world is.

516
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,360
I'll come back again. What do you like?

517
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,970
Hong Ji Hong

518
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,360
Why do you do this?

519
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,040
Even if we sit here all day, we can't get a single fish. There are no fish here, Father!

520
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,920
It's here!

521
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,500
It's a carp! Steamed carp!

522
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,670
You sure do like eating although you hate fishing.

523
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,270
Yoo Hye Jeong

524
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:08,910
Yeah, Hye Jeong.

525
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,230
I guess you're outside.

526
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,290
Yeah, it's been a while since I've gone fishing with my father. What is it?

527
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,590
It's nothing, Doctor.

528
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,970
Why, why?

529
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,840
It's nothing. Enjoy your time there.

530
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,820
Who is Hye Jeong?

531
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,860
A junior of mine at the hospital.

532
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,680
Even though she's your junior, I guess she's pretty.

533
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,830
How did you know?

534
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:33,420
Your voice changed. You don't use that voice when you answer my calls.

535
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,540
Nonsense.

536
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,130
Father, I have a favor to ask.

537
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,910
What is it?

538
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,270
Please search for this patient's records.

539
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,900
Kang Mal Soon
N0036823

540
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,340
Could you give me some of your time?

541
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:08,330
The offender is the right PICA. You will have to do a microvascular decompression surgery.

542
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:13,010
That's why I'm saying this, but could you do the surgery?

543
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,800
She's not even my patient, so why would I perform the surgery?

544
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,630
Can't you just do it without asking me the reason why?

545
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,040
I don't think I can.

546
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,330
It becomes complicated if we start to change patients just because we don't like them,

547
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:29,000
and the hospital's rules also don't allow it.

548
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,400
Rules are important to model doctors like you.

549
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,090
Thank you for giving me your time.

550
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,670
By any chance, is she family?

551
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,360
I wish she were.

552
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,650
- What are you doing here?
- Oh,

553
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,740
she asked me to look at a patient's MRI for her.

554
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,090
Is it some kind of rare case?

555
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,860
No.

556
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,120
If it's not a rare case, why would she drag you in here to show you an MRI?

557
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,270
Am I someone who can be dragged in here just because someone drags me in? Do you feel inferior to Doctor Yoo?

558
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,530
Do you have an inferiority complex about Dr. Yoo?

559
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,110
What do I lack?

560
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:17,030
Exactly. What do you lack that you should be so aware of Doctor Yoo?

561
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:20,260
Lately, you're showing me many sides to you I've never seen before.

562
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,060
This hospital is really nice!

563
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,430
Since it's a top-notch hospital even in Seoul, it sure is different.

564
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,830
Even the side dishes look so luxurious!

565
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:46,030
Are you embarrassed? You've been eating without looking at me for a while.

566
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,630
I met that woman.

567
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,460
Who?

568
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,660
My mother according to the family register and wife of the man who's biologically my father.

569
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,180
How?

570
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,270
She came because of a facial spasm.

571
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,870
Awesome! You got your revenge!

572
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:04,650
Hey, what was her expression like? No, there's no reason to even ask. I'm sure the look on her face was priceless.

573
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:08,650
She's poor, old, and sick. She was punished!

574
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,940
So what happened?

575
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,960
She didn't look poor and she came with her daughter.

576
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,720
Then is she your younger sister?

577
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,960
Since we share my dad's blood, are we half-siblings?

578
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,790
What's the problem? You said they didn't look poor. You can just treat her.

579
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,750
I can't treat that woman.

580
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,570
Then you can just transfer her to another doctor.

581
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,120
The other doctor won't do it.

582
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,470
They're strange people. Why won't he do it?

583
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:37,220
According to the hospital's rules, you can't change doctors based on the patient's preferences.

584
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,080
You're taking the doctor's side because you're a doctor too.

585
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,600
Aren't there any single men here?

586
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,290
Cheap bulgogi (Korean barbeque).

587
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,320
Ah, they still stick together.

588
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,160
Why are you like that?

589
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,840
Ah, why? Who did you see?

590
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,420
- Stop it.
- Who is it?

591
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,390
I don't want to eat here.

592
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,390
Hey.

593
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:04,950
Ah, seriously... What's wrong with your appetite? The cafeteria food is good.

594
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:08,580
The girl sitting opposite from Hye Jeong was originally my friend.

595
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,330
She threw me away after meeting Hye Jeong.

596
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,860
Why look for possession between friends?

597
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,670
That's also a type of suffering from lack of affection, you know.

598
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:19,170
That's why you're attaching yourself emotionally to that patient, Oh Young Mi.

599
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,350
What about that ahjumma?

600
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,550
As soon as she woke up, what's with "I want to see that b*tch".

601
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,570
It wasn't enough that she was betrayed; she was divorced too.

602
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,410
Why do the victims have to be criticized?

603
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:30,560
It's dangerous if you have too strong a rapport with a patient.

604
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,480
You worry too much.

605
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,840
Earlier, Sunbae Yoon Do came to the fellows room and talked with Hye Jeong.

606
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,040
What would they have to say in the fellows room?

607
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,820
Yoo Hye Jeong's mother came and the waiting room became a mess.

608
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,150
- Wouldn't it have something to do with that?
- Why?

609
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,990
What kind of mother is like that? If she comes to her daughter's workplace to scream and create a mess,

610
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,600
how can her daughter come to work with this embarrassment?

611
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:57,090
It's probably her stepmother. Even during school, she lived with her grandmother.

612
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,800
I'm hungry. Don't forget that you're the one who dragged me out here.

613
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,890
Doctor.

614
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:13,630
We want to do a party to welcome you and to celebrate me becoming a resident as well as Yeong Gook´s first surgery. We are thinking this Friday. Is that okay?

615
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:16,960
You seem to have a lot of stuff to do. It's okay.

616
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,680
Where is the company dinner?

617
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,980
There's a place that we go to a lot.

618
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,100
But, who are—

619
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:28,210
I recently opened a month ago and I'm out here to promote.

620
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,710
- Ah, Soon Hee Hawaii?
- You know about it?!

621
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,610
I went a while ago.

622
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:39,060
Goodness, no wonder! You looked so familiar! You're so cute!

623
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,880
If it's Hye Jeong's welcome party, I'll treat you all,

624
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,310
so you can treat our Hye Jeong well.

625
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,330
He has to suck up to me.

626
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:51,080
Oh, really? Then I can't treat you to everything.

627
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,880
For a group dinner, I'll give you a 50% discount.

628
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,950
- Call, call.
- Call, call, call, call!

629
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,280
Change. Should I leave?

630
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,060
No, I'll change later.

631
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,930
Your life is really exhausting too, with the long day starting with the gangster boss, then the stepmom.

632
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,190
Why did you call Sunbae Yoon Do in?

633
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:27,270
The phrase "call in" is cheap.

634
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,760
I'm talking to you out of courtesy right now.

635
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,870
Do I have to say thanks for talking to me out of courtesy?

636
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:35,750
We're using the same space.

637
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,390
I'm putting my hand out first because it might get too uncomfortable if we don't talk to each other.

638
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:43,110
I wanted to give one of my patients to Doctor Jeong.

639
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:45,360
I'm telling you, in case you misunderstand for no reason.

640
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,370
Do you think I've done everything to you so far out of useless misunderstandings?

641
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:52,050
You said that you were talking to me out of courtesy five minutes ago.

642
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,690
Organize the how the situation is and send it to me.

643
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,610
- Yes, I understand.
- Goodbye

644
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:09,680
If you look at Doctor Yoo, she looks like the daughter of a rich family who grew up without any troubles.

645
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,590
That's why I like her, because there's a twist.

646
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,420
Your preferences are strange.

647
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,030
- What do you like so much about that mole-witch?
- What's a mole-witch?

648
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,820
Here, here, she has a mole there. A witch with a mole.

649
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,610
- Aigoo, how childish. Your intelligence level is dropping—
- Ah!

650
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,220
Ah, please not my head.

651
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,770
Do you guys have nothing to do?

652
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,290
No, we were doing what we had to do.

653
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:32,930
Give me the chart for Dr.Yoo Hye Jeong's patient with the right-side facial spasm.

654
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,430
Doctor, you're going to take it on?

655
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:38,130
Then it's set. You're doing a good thing, Doctor.

656
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,380
Why are you telling me I'm doing a good thing?

657
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,050
Didn't you know that patient is Doctor Yoo's stepmother?

658
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,560
It seems like her family history is quite the spectacle.

659
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:51,040
The 7th and 8th nerves that run out from the middle of the brain

660
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,190
are near the cerebral artery.

661
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,830
It moves every time the heart beats.

662
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:00,860
That's when the 7th nerve is affected and half of the face shakes.

663
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,290
We went to a local hospital, and she took some medicine.

664
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:06,100
She also injected botox.

665
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,510
I searched on the internet and found that it could be a problem with her brain.

666
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,810
However the local hospital can't treat problems involving the brain.

667
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:16,480
If it's a common facial spasm, there are usually a lot of patients who come after suffering for about 4 to 5 years.

668
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,810
Because it's a surgery involving the brain, they are very scared too.

669
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,320
Then what do we have to do?

670
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,270
We could try the microvascular decompression surgery.

671
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,460
It goes into the lesion, separates the artery from the facial nerve so it won't be affected

672
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:37,000
We just need to put an artificial material called teflon between the nerve and the blood vessel.

673
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:40,040
It has a 96% success rate.

674
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,440
When will you do the surgery?

675
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,610
Can't you go to a different hospital?

676
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:47,780
I'll give you the MRI results and a written diagnosis.

677
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,330
I don't have any thoughts of switching hospitals.

678
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:55,170
I heard that I'm eligible for the discount for employee family members, right? I heard it is a 30 percent discount.

679
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:58,450
What have you done for our family?

680
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:02,140
It's not like you're paying, and there's nothing bad in it for you.

681
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,990
Do you know how hard it was while I was living with your dad?

682
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,200
That's why I contracted an illness like this.

683
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,430
Thirteen years ago, my dad and I ended our father-daughter relationship.

684
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,300
Kinship doesn't end with saying it ended.

685
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:20,050
If you had gone to your dad and said "I'm sorry", how nice would it have been?

686
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,800
I can't do your surgery.

687
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,640
Why? Because you're afraid you might kill me while operating?

688
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,140
Whether you do it or not, I will be at this hospital.

689
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,300
Do you know how comfortable it is to know someone who works in a hospital?

690
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:39,480
On top of that, you're a doctor. Why would I leave my well-to-do doctor daughter here and suffer at another hospital?

691
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,390
Humans indeed don't change.

692
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,630
You. Well do you think you changed?

693
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:50,770
You're just a glamorous husk. Even if you sit there, you're still from the same place as us.

694
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,780
Mom, stop it.

695
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,230
When are you doing the surgery? Do it soon.

696
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,340
I have nothing to say. Get out for now.

697
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,590
Unni.

698
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,140
This is our store.

699
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:24,640
We make a living. We won't burden you, Unni.

700
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,950
Granny's Soup and Rice

701
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:44,300
The call cannot be connected as dialed. After the tone, you will be connected to the voicemail and charged for the call.

702
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,930
This is Jeong Yoon Do.

703
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:49,150
I will do Patient Lee Ga Jin's surgery.

704
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,030
Who are you talking to?

705
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,410
Ah, you startled me. When did you come in?

706
00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:00,180
Just a while ago. I stayed still because you were on the phone.

707
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:05,480
I'm going to do Dr. Yoo Hye Jeong's mother's surgery, since she would be uncomfortable.

708
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,680
Since when were you so considerate about other's affairs, Sunbae?

709
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,240
Was I inconsiderate? Well, I'll be considerate from now.

710
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,660
Even if you don't do it, Professor Hong Ji Hong will do it.

711
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:20,070
Stay out of Hye Jeong's affairs. You said you wanted to kick her out and look at you now. So erratic.

712
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:24,140
A human's heart is a human's heart because it changes. Why are you upset over that?

713
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,770
- Why did you come?
- To go eat.

714
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,210
I can't. I have a prior appointment.

715
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,690
You're here!

716
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:46,470
You're happy that you see me? I bought sandwiches. Let's eat together.

717
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,470
There's no one other than you who comes to find me.

718
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,360
- Why?
- I threw a fit last time.

719
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,410
Only those who usually throw fits can throw a fit.

720
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:00,300
Since someone who's usually quiet throws a fit, no one gives me a break.

721
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,580
Eat.

722
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:13,460
It's tasty.

723
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,790
I have no appetite.

724
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,460
You're quite pretty.

725
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,760
I'm getting angry.

726
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,180
I'm going crazy from the anger!

727
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:33,930
Why did I live like such a fool? I should have gotten angry earlier. I should have—

728
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:36,210
I said you can't think like that.

729
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:38,680
Start now and live however you want.

730
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,260
It's frustrating. I need to take a walk outside.

731
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,710
Lie down. I think it'll be better if you rest—

732
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:46,830
I'm fine, nothing's wrong. The unlucky b*tches have long lifespans.

733
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:50,120
Because I met you last time, I was able to come to the hospital and I lived!

734
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,510
Now look. I can even jump.

735
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:55,960
- Ah, no I said you can't!
- One, two, three, four.

736
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,240
- Ahjumma! Lie down—
- Four—

737
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:02,830
I told you not to do that!

738
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:08,120
Ahjumma!

739
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:13,490
One, two, three, shock!

740
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,770
Two hundred joules.

741
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:21,480
One, two, three, shock!

742
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,660
Ahjumma! Ahjumma! Ahjumma! You can't!

743
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:28,210
- Time of death...
- No!

744
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:32,710

I liked the previous one better.

763
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:21,360
Just get that one. I'm the one buying it for you.

764
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,710
I'm the one who'll be wearing it.

765
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:26,240
I'm going to be seeing it.

766
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,800
It's purdy. It's pretty.

767
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,040
Hong Hong Hong

768
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,270
Yes, Doctor?

769
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:47,200
Where are you?

770
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,200
Doctor, I'll call you again later.

771
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,520
Free-lance Taxi Driver, Seoul

772
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,810
Guk Il Medical Center

773
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,660
Driver.

774
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:04,150
There's a cafe called Soon Hee Hawaii near Guk Il Medical Center. Please take me there.

775
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,500
Granny's Rice Stew

776
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,910
Ah, yes. Are you leaving now?

777
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,130
I ate well, Sir.

778
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:11,810
Thank you for coming such a long way here.

779
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:15,790
The food is good, you're good. You will definitely succeed soon. Good luck!

780
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,960
Yes, fighting!

781
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,270
- Yes.
- I'll leave now.

782
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,940
Yes, yes. Please be safe on your way back.

783
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,800
I'll call you later!

784
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,910
Yes, yes!

785
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:30,320
A woman has to look pretty, whenever and wherever.

786
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,880
How is it? Isn't your granny really pretty?

787
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,730
Yeah. Pretty.

788
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:41,250
Grandma, should I remove this?

789
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:45,920
Don't remove it. A mole between the eyes is one that's loved by adults.

790
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,770
Really? But my dad hates me...

791
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:53,380
What kind of parent hates their own child? He's just ignorant.

792
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:58,780
Still, I can't tell you to understand him.

793
00:53:58,780 --> 00:53:59,560
Why?

794
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:04,490
It's love of the older for the younger. The parent needs to love their child first.

795
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:10,430
My grandma knows so many things but why did you end up like this?

796
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,670
This b*tch. You were doing so well and then (you said the wrong thing)!

797
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:16,330
Grandma, the same goes for you. Everything's going well and then you curse.

798
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:19,290
Sorry.

799
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,430
There's no need to lose confidence because you were expelled.

800
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:27,060
You can just take the aptitude test (GED) and go to college. You're someone who was first in math.

801
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,000
Again again!

802
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,730
Oh really! I'm really living under my granddaughter's thumb so late in life!

803
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:53,300
Hello.

804
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,510
Why do you look so down? I'll make your mood better.

805
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,160
What is this?

806
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,110
The thing you wanted. Even I couldn't access this information with my security clearance.

807
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:14,460
I got it through a favor.

808
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,050
Thank you.

809
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:20,200
I have a copy as well. I'm going to ask my friend in general surgery.

810
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,660
If what you're looking for is the truth,

811
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:26,730
and if that truth can make you happy, then I'll help.

812
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:35,760
Why is there no answer? When are you going to show me your 10-won cheapness?

813
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,860
It's late, come on. I'll see you off.
♫ this moment ♫

814
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,940
♫ I cannot believe it ♫

815
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,770
It's raining. Did they say it would rain today?

816
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:49,750
Yes, they said it would rain tonight.
♫  One by one ♫

817
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,670
These days, the weather forecast is very accurate.

818
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,970
Let's go.

819
00:55:55,970 --> 00:56:03,730
♫  My whole world, that's you waves to me ♫

820
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:22,030
♫ Wherever you are, I cannot stop ♫

821
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:30,540
♫  These thoughts have stopped, I can't stop ♫

822
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:38,140
♫ More than anything else, it is so beautiful ♫

823
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:43,520
♫ those days past ♫

824
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:54,080
♫  In this moment, I can feel it ♫

825
00:56:54,080 --> 00:57:01,970
♫  Little by little we become closer ♫

826
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:09,830
♫  The beautiful dream I got to have ♫

827
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:12,250
Someone once said,

828
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:18,260
"Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass, it's

829
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,870
learning how to dance in that rain."

830
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,840
Doctor!

831
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:07,200
Excuse me.

832
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,260
Doctor!
♫ There she goes  ♫
(The La's - There She Goes)

833
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:13,180
♫ There she goes again ♫

834
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:15,560
♫ Racing through' my brain ♫

835
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:20,940
♫  And I just can't contain ♫

836
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,910
♫ This feelin' that remains ♫

837
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,700
♫ There she blows ♫

838
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,310
♫ There she blows again ♫

839
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:41,190
♫ There she blows ♫

840
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:58,460
From now on, I'm going to do a certain thing, as a man to a woman.

841
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:19,290
♫  You are my entire life, you are the reason I live ♫

842
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:25,550
♫  It's an unexplainable miracle ♫

843
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:30,540
♫  If love is needing my comfort ♫

844
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,550
Life is worth living.

845
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:40,440
I am now presented with an opportunity to enjoy something from the everyday.
♫  Take another step closer  ♫

846
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:47,740
♫  Because your fragrance is nice, because I'm just so happy  ♫
