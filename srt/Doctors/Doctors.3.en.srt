00:00:24,084 --> 00:00:26,494
Episode 3

2
00:00:29,074 --> 00:00:34,384
Loving and hating is controlled by the amygdala.

3
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:39,694
The amygdala also controls the fight and flight responses to protect our bodies.

4
00:00:39,694 --> 00:00:42,824
When you love someone, at the same time

5
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:45,784
a person is said to become more combative than normal.

6
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:50,294
Hello, I was planning on being on time...

7
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:54,994
Have a seat. I already ordered tea.

8
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:56,624
Yes.

9
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:59,054
Please give me a glass of seltzer.

10
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:03,884
You can't know a person from just their outer appearance.

11
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:07,204
How would I have known that you'd be the main character in such a dirty scandal?

12
00:01:07,204 --> 00:01:10,494
How could I have known?

13
00:01:10,494 --> 00:01:13,584
I believe it is basic courtesy to respect the other party when engaging in conversation.

14
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:16,344
I respect you, Seo Woo's mother.

15
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:22,904
The dirty scandal is an event that happened as a result of Seo Woo's misunderstanding.

16
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:26,044
I do not want anyone hurt because of this occurrence.

17
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,744
If I am the one to be hurt, I will bear it.

18
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:32,924
As a result, are you saying that you'll protect that girl named Hye Jeong?

19
00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:35,514
I will get her by pushing for her expulsion.

20
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:38,764
Of course, I will have you take responsibility as well!

21
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:47,434
In that case, I will sue Seo Woo and the school board of directors on charges of defamation.

22
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:48,804
Teacher.

23
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:52,424
If the situation becomes a larger case, and Seo Woo's name is spoken by others, it won't be good for her either.

24
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:56,124
Still, you and that girl named Hye Jeong,

25
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:59,524
cannot both remain at this school. I will not tolerate it.

26
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:13,934
Wait up. Wait up!
Namyangju Girls' High School

27
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,164
Letter of Resignation

28
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:22,154
Teacher Hong, I liked you, you know.

29
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:24,964
A teacher who is also a former doctor. That title sounds very illustrious.

30
00:02:24,964 --> 00:02:27,534
But, why would you let yourself give that up?

31
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:33,664
When I leave, I would like the short-term contracted English teacher to take on our class.

32
00:02:41,854 --> 00:02:45,324
Police

33
00:03:05,114 --> 00:03:06,614
What is it?

34
00:03:07,964 --> 00:03:14,434
Omo, what do we do? You need to go to the hospital.

35
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:18,494
It's ok. You can't tell the homeroom teach the reason we met.

36
00:03:18,494 --> 00:03:23,724
The homeroom teach also needs to know what you went through for him.

37
00:03:24,644 --> 00:03:27,034
- Soon Hee
- Yeah?

38
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:29,344
My friend, Soon Hee.

39
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:34,394
I want to become a good person.

40
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:37,084
I want to live as a good person.

41
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:41,954
I don't want the homeroom teacher to become entangled with me anymore. The same goes for you.

42
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,574
How about running away from me?

43
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:10,334
Give me your parents' number, not your grandma's.

44
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,334
There is none.

45
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,284
She's a student at our school, but she's such a nuisance.

46
00:04:14,284 --> 00:04:15,654
Arson is a crime.

47
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:18,794
T-Then...what's going to happen?

48
00:04:18,794 --> 00:04:21,284
What's going to happen? She has to go to prison.

49
00:04:21,284 --> 00:04:24,564
Since she's over 14, she'll be sentenced.

50
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,484
Even if she didn't do it on purpose?

51
00:04:26,484 --> 00:04:28,934
The fire started because the oil can fell over.

52
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:33,154
The oil barrel doesn't tip over by itself. Also, there's a person who lit it on fire.

53
00:04:33,154 --> 00:04:36,204
Can I take my child now?

54
00:04:36,204 --> 00:04:37,894
Yes. Take her please.

55
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:39,014
What about Hye Jeong?

56
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:43,044
She doesn't even have a guardian. She should be charged for arson.

57
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:44,804
No, I want to stay with her.

58
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:47,814
You're saying useless things. Go.

59
00:04:47,814 --> 00:04:49,244
Hye Jeong!

60
00:04:49,244 --> 00:04:52,394
Go home with your dad. I started this.

61
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:54,284
It's right for it to end with me.

62
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:58,234
No, I did it. Hye Jeong didn't do it.

63
00:04:58,234 --> 00:05:01,254
You know at her age, friends cover for each other.

64
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:03,284
She is still ignorant (naive).

65
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:06,954
No, no. Hye Jeong! Hye Jeong! Dad!

66
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:08,814
Hye Jeong! I'll come again.

67
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:12,464
Dad! Please let go of my wrist first.

68
00:05:12,464 --> 00:05:13,594
Dad!

69
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:17,554
You might think it's cool to assume full responsibility,

70
00:05:17,554 --> 00:05:20,874
but the reality is like a sewer.

71
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:39,344
Welcome to my world!

72
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:42,034
Ah, be quiet. Don't do that. The neighbours will get angry.

73
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:43,914
Dog, be quiet.

74
00:05:43,914 --> 00:05:47,924
An overworked second-year resident has come to you.

75
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,614
Stop.

76
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:54,684
Why is it so nice that you stopped working at the school?

77
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:57,544
Did you quit so that you can go to the US with President?

78
00:05:57,544 --> 00:05:59,644
- Did you eat yet?
- No.

79
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:10,914
- Are you going to cook for me?
- I'm just getting out what I already have.

80
00:06:10,914 --> 00:06:13,524
That's the same thing.

81
00:06:18,154 --> 00:06:20,844
Be mine. I'll be good to you.

82
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:26,094
Who is it? I'll kill them.

83
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,574
Hello?

84
00:06:27,574 --> 00:06:29,864
Teacher, This is Soon Hee.

85
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:31,204
Ah what is it at this time?

86
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:34,034
I'm sorry, but it's really urgent.

87
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:36,494
Hye Jeong is at the police station right now.

88
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:38,794
Seo Woo got hurt and is in the hospital.

89
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:40,464
What happened?

90
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:42,464
Namyangjuguk Hospital

91
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:51,754
Hello Doctor.

92
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:53,854
Hello ma'am.

93
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:10,264
What exactly happened?

94
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,594
What did Hye Jeong say?

95
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:14,594
I came to you first.

96
00:07:14,594 --> 00:07:16,684
She tried to kill me.

97
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:21,034
- Seo Woo.
- I liked you.

98
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:23,094
I respected you.

99
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:28,124
Because you were at the school, I only went to school because of you.

100
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:31,144
Why did you disappoint me?

101
00:07:31,144 --> 00:07:33,824
What did you like? And what disappointed you?

102
00:07:33,824 --> 00:07:35,774
Why can't it be me?

103
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:39,704
Why can it be Hye Jeong, but not me?

104
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:42,114
Why do you like her and dislike me?

105
00:07:42,114 --> 00:07:47,434
You, do you know that you're pretty and smart?

106
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:56,184
Rest well and recover quickly, both physically and mentally.

107
00:08:23,694 --> 00:08:26,554
Yoo Hye Jeong. Come out.

108
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:54,054
Give me your arm.

109
00:08:54,054 --> 00:08:54,994
I don't want to.

110
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:56,834
Again, you don't listen to me.

111
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:59,854
You've never listened well from the very beginning.

112
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,914
Why would Seo Woo be the only one hurt when you were in the same place?

113
00:09:34,244 --> 00:09:38,414
When kids from your background come to the police station,

114
00:09:38,414 --> 00:09:41,794
the treatment may be worse than whatever you did.

115
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:48,174
Since I ranked 1st in math, please give me a book as a reward.

116
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:50,734
Clinically Oriented Anatomy

117
00:09:50,734 --> 00:09:52,204
Why that?

118
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:54,284
Just because.

119
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:56,844
You're special.

120
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:04,024
Please sign it.

121
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:08,474
Lee Ji Hong

122
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:13,294
Lee Ji Hong. Hong Ji Hong.

123
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:15,894
That? I was an orphan until middle school.

124
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:20,914
♫  Didn't know I would become to love you. ♫
♫ I miss you. ♫

125
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:25,634
Why are you looking at me like that? Do I suddenly look pitiful?

126
00:10:25,634 --> 00:10:30,364
Ah, so this is what it feels like for people who look at me

127
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:31,614
when I say I don't have a mom.

128
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:37,964
♫  It's a miracle that I cannot explain  ♫

129
00:10:37,964 --> 00:10:39,674
Here.

130
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:44,764
♫  I need you to comfort me. ♫

131
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:47,264
I will always cheer you on. Hong Ji Hong.
♫  If it is love ♫

132
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:53,744
♫  Take a step closer  ♫

133
00:10:55,444 --> 00:11:00,914
♫  So I'll believe my destiny  ♫

134
00:11:04,784 --> 00:11:07,634
I'm looking at you because you're the only thing to look at.

135
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:12,204
Seo Woo is okay. I already went and saw her.

136
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,154
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:15,244 --> 00:11:20,074
After the school message board incident, I've been avoiding you.

138
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:25,304
Me too. You know that it's just too strange for both of us.

139
00:11:25,304 --> 00:11:30,094
I could have never imagined that something like that was even possible

140
00:11:30,094 --> 00:11:32,074
between you and me.

141
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:42,014
I heard you turned in your resignation letter. Just because of me...

142
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:45,484
When it involves a woman and a man, in our society, who do you think will be put through a more

143
00:11:45,484 --> 00:11:48,584
unfair situation when trouble arises?

144
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:54,144
But why am I more worried about you?

145
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:09,444
Teacher.

146
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:14,434
Thank you for these past times.

147
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:17,784
- Why are you like that all of a sudden?
-I feel like

148
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:21,164
today will be the last day meeting you.

149
00:12:21,164 --> 00:12:25,694
From now on, don't visit me anymore. It's better

150
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:27,804
if you and I don't see each other.

151
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:33,364
They said you can take this inside.

152
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,614
You don't need to look terrible like that. Apply these on your injuries.

153
00:13:12,664 --> 00:13:15,334
-I'll take you home.
-It's too late right now.

154
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:16,554
Go home.

155
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:19,404
No. I'm going to take you home.

156
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:23,164
In Joo, didn't you say your uncle is a lawyer?

157
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:29,184
Fine.

158
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:34,264
I will get you a lawyer and take care of everything, so leave it alone.

159
00:13:34,264 --> 00:13:35,654
There's no need.

160
00:13:35,654 --> 00:13:38,674
If there's a scandal, the weak one is the victim.

161
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:40,584
I know that too.

162
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:44,054
In the end, Hye Jeong will be the worse off victim.

163
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:47,734
Leave that grandma's house as well. It's suspicious.

164
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:51,984
The people who are suspicious are the weird ones. So you don't need to be suspicious.

165
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:53,564
I'm just jealous.

166
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:56,534
- In Joo.
- Stay away from Hye Jeong.

167
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:57,764
She is seductive.

168
00:13:57,764 --> 00:14:00,994
Aish. You're too much. She is a minor.

169
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:07,734
Right. She is underage. She has the right to be protected, so you should watch out for your actions.

170
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:11,264
I don't want to take you home. I changed my mind.

171
00:14:20,644 --> 00:14:22,744
Kim Ji Hoon
Lawyer Kim Ji Hoon's Law Firm

172
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:28,334
This is the lawyer's business card. He's In Joo's uncle. He will do well.

173
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:40,044
Okay. It's not like the situation will solve itself if I stay still.

174
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:50,324
-Hello?
-Is this you, Min Ho?

175
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,924
I think you have to come down here.

176
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:55,064
If it's about Hye Jeong, don't tell me.

177
00:14:55,064 --> 00:14:58,694
I will talk about your child with you. Whom else would I talk about her with?

178
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:01,994
She is in such deep trouble that she has to go to the prison.

179
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:05,954
I don't care that she has to go to prison.

180
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:10,234
-Then come down because I've got cancer.
-Don't put on a show.

181
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,174
I'm the crazy wench for expecting anything from him.

182
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:22,004
This isn't the time to be like this, Kang Mal Soon.

183
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,114
Gather your strength. Gather up.

184
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:29,794
Will it heal completely?

185
00:15:29,794 --> 00:15:36,114
Don't worry, Madam. With this level of injury, you don't need a skin graft.

186
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:47,134
Hello...

187
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:50,574
How are you here, Doctor?

188
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:55,084
Why are you here, Grandma? I'm the father of the girl who is on the bed.

189
00:15:57,134 --> 00:16:00,924
Aigoo, what do I do. I'm so sorry, Doctor.

190
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:06,934
My grandchild has commited a serious wrong against your daughter. I'm sorry.

191
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:11,444
Are you hurt badly? I'm sorry.

192
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:15,214
-It's okay.
-HOW IS THIS OKAY?!

193
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:19,494
Leave! Is it okay for anyone to enter the VIP room?

194
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:22,444
I'm sorry. Grandma, please leave.

195
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:26,344
I'm sorry. I have no words to say even if I had ten mouths.

196
00:16:26,344 --> 00:16:28,804
I'm sorry. Here.

197
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:30,104
Sunshine Juice

198
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:32,264
Take this and leave!

199
00:16:32,264 --> 00:16:36,554
It's 100% juice. Please try some.

200
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:40,964
Please leave.

201
00:16:40,964 --> 00:16:44,784
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

202
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:55,204
It's not a simple problem. Arson is a serious crime.

203
00:16:55,204 --> 00:16:59,614
And someone got hurt in the process, so it won't be easy to resolve.

204
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:22,864
Hey, eat this.

205
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:28,624
Does someone like me deserve to eat?

206
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:33,904
Why do you need to deserve to eat? As long as you're living you should eat.

207
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:38,864
Eat.

208
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:43,714
I don't want to. I have no appetite.

209
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:47,234
Then drink some soup. I cooked it with the bone part,

210
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,874
so it should give you strength.

211
00:17:49,874 --> 00:17:54,124
Don't come here. I feel guilty.

212
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:58,184
From now on, live the way you want to, and I will live in my way.

213
00:17:58,184 --> 00:18:01,444
Just because you have a mouth, do you think you can say something like that?!

214
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:05,844
How is it possible for me to live my own life and you live your own life?

215
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:08,504
You're the type of a wench that would throw me away if I cause you embarrassment​!

216
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,824
That's not what I meant!

217
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:14,144
I'm telling you to run away from me so you can live comfortably.

218
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:16,204
Since I only cause you headaches, I'm giving you a chance.

219
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:21,254
Even if you don't give me a chance, I can run away whenever I want to.

220
00:18:21,254 --> 00:18:26,604
I may have had a crappy life, but I've never run away from it.

221
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:31,684
If you don't want to eat, then give it to me. I will eat it.

222
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:40,674
It's good. I wonder who made this. It's amazing.

223
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:46,184
You made it for me, so why are you eating it?

224
00:18:55,894 --> 00:18:58,394
Are you hurt anywhere?

225
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,004
I am not.

226
00:19:19,714 --> 00:19:22,534
Why wouldn't you be hurt?

227
00:19:26,494 --> 00:19:28,914
Are you okay?

228
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:30,704
I'm sorry.

229
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:42,774
-I got first place in math!
-Really?

230
00:19:42,774 --> 00:19:47,344
I'm so happy. I'm so happy, but why are my tears flowing?

231
00:19:47,344 --> 00:19:49,774
You should be smiling when you're happy! Why are you crying?

232
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:53,734
-But why are you crying?
-Because I'm happy

233
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,154
Aigoo! My baby!

234
00:20:25,544 --> 00:20:27,234
Father.

235
00:20:27,234 --> 00:20:29,304
Oh you came?

236
00:20:29,304 --> 00:20:31,824
In Joo was waiting but got a call and left.

237
00:20:31,824 --> 00:20:33,214
She never leaves herself out of things.

238
00:20:33,214 --> 00:20:37,224
I like her! She's very bright.

239
00:20:37,224 --> 00:20:39,144
What about the school? Has everything been sorted out?

240
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:42,214
I just have to say goodbye to the students. Father, how's your health?

241
00:20:42,214 --> 00:20:44,564
Don't look at me like an old man.

242
00:20:44,564 --> 00:20:47,974
Not much changes just because of one surgery.

243
00:20:47,974 --> 00:20:52,934
By the way, before leaving for the U.S., apply for Johns Hopkins and the mayo Clinic,

244
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:57,704
and get all the documents in order. There are a lot of things you have to get done. You'll be very busy.

245
00:20:57,704 --> 00:20:58,414
Are you happy?

246
00:20:58,414 --> 00:21:00,764
Yes, I'm happy. What about you?

247
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:02,984
I'm happy, too.

248
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,874
What the heck? Why are you like that?

249
00:21:19,874 --> 00:21:22,264
It's embarrassing for me to look at your face.

250
00:21:23,104 --> 00:21:25,744
I was too childish last time.

251
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,774
Your words were a wake up call for me.

252
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:32,784
Can you watch Hye Jeong?

253
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:33,724
Do you trust me?

254
00:21:33,724 --> 00:21:36,114
I have to trust you. We're friends.

255
00:21:36,114 --> 00:21:38,074
You're really smart.

256
00:21:38,074 --> 00:21:41,644
You get what you want but draw a clear line.

257
00:21:41,644 --> 00:21:43,864
You are killing two birds with one stone.

258
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:01,744
You're coming now?

259
00:22:01,744 --> 00:22:04,774
Why are you outside? Did you meet the lawyer?

260
00:22:04,774 --> 00:22:08,824
Yes. Maybe because it was at your request, he was kind.

261
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:10,744
I think it'll work out well.

262
00:22:12,584 --> 00:22:17,914
In this situation, these words are a little much, but I'm leaving.

263
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:23,914
Because you got intertwined with my child, you've had a tough time.

264
00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:26,624
Thank you, Teacher Hong.

265
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:30,334
You can give me the deposit later. I'm the one who violated the contract.

266
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:32,124
So you can give it to me when the contract ends.

267
00:22:33,024 --> 00:22:36,694
If you go and find a place somewhere, you have to tell me where you are.

268
00:22:36,694 --> 00:22:38,994
Of course.

269
00:22:38,994 --> 00:22:40,744
Give me some food, I'm hungry.

270
00:22:40,744 --> 00:22:42,744
Oh, ok.

271
00:23:02,074 --> 00:23:05,794
I can't come for a few days.

272
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:08,224
I told you that you didn't have to come at all.

273
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:10,734
Don't say something you don't mean, you wench.

274
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:13,524
Are you that great?

275
00:23:13,524 --> 00:23:15,434
All these troubles that you are making,

276
00:23:15,434 --> 00:23:20,554
do you think I don't know that you're doing all these for attention?

277
00:23:20,554 --> 00:23:23,864
Why is someone so sharp running a restaurant instead of being President of Korea?

278
00:23:23,864 --> 00:23:26,744
You must be feeling better after eating.

279
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:31,524
Anyway, I can't come next week.

280
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:35,684
Are you not going to ask why I can't come?

281
00:23:35,684 --> 00:23:41,034
You're asking me to do all kinds of things instead of just telling me. Why can't you come?

282
00:23:41,034 --> 00:23:43,084
I'm having surgery.

283
00:23:44,874 --> 00:23:49,064
It's stomach cancer, but they said I'll be okay once I get the surgery done.

284
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:54,824
I didn't tell you all this time because I didn't want to worry you. I was going to tell you when I went in for surgery.

285
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:58,814
But instead of being bored in the cell with nothing to do,

286
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:02,454
I thought it would be better for you to have something to worry about, so I'm telling you.

287
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:07,154
I was going to have surgery once I knew when you'll be coming out,

288
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,454
but I wanted to show you

289
00:24:10,474 --> 00:24:15,164
how much your grandma loves her crappy life.

290
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:17,584
And how much I want to live.

291
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:24,284
The doctor says that it's a cancer that doesn't spread so everything should be fine after surgery, but

292
00:24:24,284 --> 00:24:28,084
you're putting a knife to your body. How can that be okay?

293
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:29,364
I could die!

294
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:30,114
Grandma!

295
00:24:30,114 --> 00:24:34,644
While you're sitting in that cell, if you do nothing but worry instead of thinking about how you can get out

296
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:37,024
and end up going to prison ,

297
00:24:37,024 --> 00:24:40,194
you might not even be able to see me dying.

298
00:24:40,194 --> 00:24:41,854
You won't die. Don't worry.

299
00:24:41,854 --> 00:24:46,264
I know too. So, you live too.

300
00:24:47,074 --> 00:24:51,364
I'll do anything to save you, but

301
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:54,724
you have to do something for yourself too.

302
00:24:58,654 --> 00:25:00,994
You didn't set the fire, right?

303
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:06,674
Don't take all of the blame and say something.

304
00:25:09,364 --> 00:25:15,194
Go now. When you're all better after getting the surgery, come back then.

305
00:25:39,634 --> 00:25:41,424
Grandma.

306
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:03,094
Grandma.

307
00:26:28,794 --> 00:26:30,464
Let's go.

308
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:53,334
The arson incident in the abandoned building, I'm the one who caused it!

309
00:26:53,334 --> 00:26:55,924
Looking at Jin Seo Woo's statement,

310
00:26:55,924 --> 00:26:59,634
"Cheon Soon Hee lured me to that place so I followed her, and Yoo Hye Jeong was already there."

311
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:03,134
"Because of the post I wrote on the school's message board, Yoo Hye Jeong resented me."

312
00:27:03,134 --> 00:27:06,864
"Yoo Hye Jeong threatened me and asked me to delete the post so we fought."

313
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:10,974
"I lost consciousness. There was a fire. Yoo Hye Jeong probably started the fire."

314
00:27:10,974 --> 00:27:14,044
Seo Woo doesn't really know how the fire started.

315
00:27:14,044 --> 00:27:16,384
They were too busy fighting to know what really happened.

316
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:22,814
If it turns out that you are the culprit, since a person got hurt, you'll have to serve at least 5 years at a detention center.

317
00:27:22,814 --> 00:27:24,934
Will you still admit that you did it?

318
00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:29,134
I will be taking her.

319
00:27:29,134 --> 00:27:33,314
You can't. I'm writing the investigation report again.

320
00:27:35,624 --> 00:27:39,634
Crazy girl. Even if you like your friend, do you really want to become an ex-convict?

321
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:42,624
Why do you like that kind of a kid when your parents and siblings are fine and living?

322
00:27:42,624 --> 00:27:43,814
Do you like her more than us?

323
00:27:43,814 --> 00:27:46,364
I like her more.

324
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,494
From the time when I was born until now,

325
00:27:48,494 --> 00:27:51,414
there hasn't been anyone who treated me with sincerity like Hye Jeong.

326
00:27:51,414 --> 00:27:53,674
What?

327
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:55,814
You and mom always say that.

328
00:27:55,814 --> 00:27:59,014
That you suffer because you had a child so late. That you shouldn't have had me!

329
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:01,504
Everyone in our family is embarrassed of me.

330
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:04,254
Even my brothers and my sisters in law...

331
00:28:04,254 --> 00:28:07,294
Hye Jeong likes me.

332
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:09,884
She isn't embarrassed of me.

333
00:28:09,884 --> 00:28:11,774
I'm not leaving her here.

334
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:15,144
Fine. Do as you wish.

335
00:28:15,144 --> 00:28:20,504
How did someone like you become a part of our family and cause such disgrace, huh?!

336
00:28:38,104 --> 00:28:41,564
Yoo Hye Jeong. Come out.

337
00:28:41,564 --> 00:28:43,014
Come out.

338
00:28:47,284 --> 00:28:48,874
You go in.

339
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,274
Why would you?

340
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:08,934
You know I did it.

341
00:29:08,934 --> 00:29:11,204
Don't be like this. You can't endure this.

342
00:29:11,204 --> 00:29:13,844
If you can, I can do it too.

343
00:29:13,844 --> 00:29:15,764
Free her. She can't be here.

344
00:29:15,764 --> 00:29:19,524
I told her to call Seo Woo, and she helped me. That's it.

345
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,424
Are you guys dating?

346
00:29:21,424 --> 00:29:23,854
You're just dying from love for each other.

347
00:29:23,854 --> 00:29:27,094
Solve your romance issues by yourselves.

348
00:29:29,354 --> 00:29:31,554
You idiot. Say it wasn't you now.

349
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:33,524
Even if you do this, it won't affect my life.

350
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:35,724
It only happened because I am such an unlucky b*tch.

351
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:41,134
I didn't leave you and run away, okay?

352
00:29:44,754 --> 00:29:47,474
Just remember that.

353
00:29:56,654 --> 00:30:00,664
Hye Jeong or whoever is getting expelled.

354
00:30:00,664 --> 00:30:03,134
What about the homeroom teacher?

355
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:08,184
Don't think about that school anymore. Let's transfer. You can't keep going to a low-level school like that.

356
00:30:08,184 --> 00:30:10,004
Go to school from your grandfather's house.

357
00:30:10,004 --> 00:30:12,234
Here. Eat this.

358
00:30:12,234 --> 00:30:14,514
It's stuffy. I'm going to go out for a bit.

359
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:16,324
Where are you going this late?

360
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:18,074
Don't worry about it.

361
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:24,794
You didn't have any intention of starting a fire,

362
00:30:24,794 --> 00:30:27,974
so if we can prove that the fire got started because of an oversight

363
00:30:27,974 --> 00:30:31,404
during an argument, it can be resolved with just a fine.

364
00:30:31,404 --> 00:30:36,834
That Seo Woo girl says she doesn't know how it got started. That's the problem.
♬ Don't stay without thinking in the pain of yesterday♬

365
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:43,094
♫Don't be in pain saying you are lonely.♫

366
00:30:44,654 --> 00:30:50,014
♫Is this path which I dreamed of the right one?♫

367
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:54,214
Wake up Seo Woo! Seo Woo! Seo Woo! Seo Woo!
♬ I looked back with anxiety. ♬

368
00:30:54,214 --> 00:30:56,494
Seo Woo, wake up!

369
00:30:56,494 --> 00:30:57,434
Get her on your back, quick!

370
00:30:57,434 --> 00:30:59,524
Okay

371
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:04,364
♫Oh, if I find that path♫

372
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:10,144
♫Will I be able to laugh? The days which were painful and full of desire♫

373
00:31:10,144 --> 00:31:13,964
♫may be different from yesterday♫

374
00:31:13,964 --> 00:31:17,234
Let's get out quickly
♫Don't think you are alone♫

375
00:31:17,234 --> 00:31:26,244
♫Tell me you're thankful, to cheer up and that I will be okay.♫

376
00:31:32,454 --> 00:31:34,514
Did you escape from the police station?

377
00:31:34,514 --> 00:31:37,954
You already know that I didn't set the fire on purpose.

378
00:31:37,954 --> 00:31:43,064
It was an accident. If you just tell the truth, no one will get hurt and this will end.

379
00:31:43,064 --> 00:31:46,384
The point is that you brought me there.

380
00:31:46,384 --> 00:31:50,874
That means you intended to hurt me.

381
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:53,274
It's the same thing as setting the fire.

382
00:31:54,424 --> 00:31:58,764
Soon Hee came to the police station saying that she's the one who set the fire.

383
00:31:58,764 --> 00:32:04,734
That girl... I can't believe her. Is she crazy?

384
00:32:04,734 --> 00:32:09,064
Why are you being like this? Everything was so good. You taught me how to study and...

385
00:32:09,064 --> 00:32:15,304
I get mad whenever I look at you. I don't know why I'm being like this either.

386
00:32:15,304 --> 00:32:19,394
I get mad! At myself...

387
00:32:21,124 --> 00:32:23,004
What should I do?

388
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:25,954
Should I beg for forgiveness even though it will probably be useless?

389
00:32:25,954 --> 00:32:29,314
How do you know whether or not it will be useless if you don't try?

390
00:32:40,384 --> 00:32:42,434
I get it now.

391
00:32:43,864 --> 00:32:45,864
It's useless.

392
00:32:56,434 --> 00:33:02,304
♫  You tried hard.  ♫

393
00:33:02,304 --> 00:33:10,594
♫That's right.♫

394
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:17,904
♫It seems like nothing is going my way♫

395
00:33:20,254 --> 00:33:25,864
♫But do I hate myself?♫

396
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:31,274
♫Aren't you perhaps lonely?♫

397
00:33:38,204 --> 00:33:44,224
♫I don't know if this will comfort you♫

398
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:50,364
♫  I know that this might not be able to comfort you  ♫

399
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:54,524
♫Everyone is like that♫

400
00:33:54,524 --> 00:33:57,764
I was worried that I wouldn't see you before the surgery.

401
00:33:57,764 --> 00:34:01,684
♫Everything will be okay♫

402
00:34:09,794 --> 00:34:13,874
♫  Everything is like that ♫

403
00:34:22,554 --> 00:34:24,404
- Oh my god!
- Aish..

404
00:34:24,404 --> 00:34:26,444
I was sleeping!

405
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:30,844
When did you come? How did you get out?

406
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:32,304
I'm sleepy.

407
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:36,904
Wait a second... I can't stay here like this.

408
00:34:48,614 --> 00:34:53,504
This is not right. You need to eat something warm!

409
00:34:55,514 --> 00:34:58,434
Hye Jeong get up and eat this.

410
00:34:58,434 --> 00:34:59,794
Later...

411
00:34:59,794 --> 00:35:03,694
You need to eat right now. Just chew.
(

412
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:08,914
(It's traditional for someone just out of prison to be given tofu. The white symbolizes purity. )

413
00:35:11,724 --> 00:35:13,874
You're going to the hospital today, right?

414
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:16,294
You have good memory.

415
00:35:31,184 --> 00:35:32,604
Yang Ju Police Station

416
00:35:32,604 --> 00:35:34,694
Thank you for your hard work.

417
00:35:34,694 --> 00:35:35,834
Of course.

418
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,284
Yes.

419
00:35:39,274 --> 00:35:44,744
Father! Thank you Father!

420
00:35:44,744 --> 00:35:49,254
I was locked up for a day but I was so scared that I almost died!

421
00:35:49,254 --> 00:35:52,874
Do you think I got you out because I'm happy with you? Stop embarrassing the family!

422
00:35:52,874 --> 00:35:55,614
But thank you for getting me out.

423
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:59,114
As soon as this is over, I'm going to send you to your aunt in Canada!

424
00:35:59,114 --> 00:36:00,654
I was expecting that.

425
00:36:00,654 --> 00:36:05,304
You must be so embarrassed to have a daughter like me.

426
00:36:06,634 --> 00:36:11,044
Father! Father! Father!

427
00:36:12,224 --> 00:36:13,714
There is no excuse.

428
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:18,544
I'm just sorry I couldn't finish the semester with you guys.

429
00:36:19,464 --> 00:36:26,964
Trust in your own judgements from what you've seen, and let's see each other again after time passes.

430
00:36:26,964 --> 00:36:28,524
Class president.

431
00:36:30,764 --> 00:36:31,744
Attention.

432
00:36:31,744 --> 00:36:37,944
I will remember you guys wherever I am.

433
00:36:40,984 --> 00:36:42,724
Thanks.

434
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:46,534
Bow.

435
00:37:02,284 --> 00:37:04,354
What are you doing?

436
00:37:05,094 --> 00:37:07,834
I guess you are worried about your granny.

437
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:12,284
What do you mean worried? After the kind of life you've lived, why would you die from this stupid cancer?

438
00:37:12,284 --> 00:37:14,704
Even the doctor told you not to worry.

439
00:37:14,704 --> 00:37:17,474
You've been expelled now. What are you going to do?

440
00:37:17,474 --> 00:37:20,274
I'll tell you about my plans after your surgery.

441
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:22,464
What kind of accident are you going to cause now?

442
00:37:22,464 --> 00:37:23,914
Can't you trust me?

443
00:37:23,914 --> 00:37:29,754
You have to make me trust you! I can't die even if I want to because of you!

444
00:37:29,754 --> 00:37:32,654
I should continue angering you so that you live long then!

445
00:37:32,654 --> 00:37:34,824
Bullsh*t!

446
00:37:34,824 --> 00:37:37,794
Bullsh*t!

447
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,734
My grandma...

448
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:58,734
I'll be right out, so don't cry your eyes out and cause a scene. Go get something to eat.

449
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,924
Stop meddling. Just do well and come back out.

450
00:38:00,924 --> 00:38:04,134
I'm sure my teacher (doctor, showing respect) will take care of everything very well.

451
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:08,664
He's handsome and smart. I'm going to put all my trust in him.

452
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:10,634
Since when was he "my teacher"?

453
00:38:10,634 --> 00:38:14,184
It's Seo Woo or whoever's father.

454
00:38:14,184 --> 00:38:18,444
You have to live the rest of your live paying your debts to her.

455
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,814
We're going in.

456
00:38:51,624 --> 00:38:54,084
Father

457
00:38:56,674 --> 00:39:00,934
Yes, I know about today at 5. I'm in the middle of a surgery but I'll finish it soon.

458
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:02,724
Yes, yes.

459
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:07,554
The area is bigger than I thought.

460
00:39:25,784 --> 00:39:28,264
Suction right now!

461
00:39:30,814 --> 00:39:32,264
BP is continuing to plummet.

462
00:39:32,264 --> 00:39:33,604
Squeeze the blood now!

463
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,264
Squeeze faster! Hurry!

464
00:39:35,264 --> 00:39:37,274
It's an arrest!

465
00:40:00,284 --> 00:40:03,564
I tried my best, but it didn't work out very well.

466
00:40:03,564 --> 00:40:05,954
What do you mean it didn't work out well?

467
00:40:05,954 --> 00:40:10,004
It's as I said. It didn't work out. You should prepare the funeral.

468
00:40:10,004 --> 00:40:12,514
No way...

469
00:40:12,514 --> 00:40:14,234
My grandma is Kang Mal Soon.

470
00:40:14,234 --> 00:40:18,774
Kang. Mal. Soon. Kang Mal Soon won't die.

471
00:40:18,774 --> 00:40:20,234
I'll speak with the adults.

472
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:22,774
Why do you have to speak with the adults instead of me?

473
00:40:23,994 --> 00:40:26,604
My grandmother and I are the closest.

474
00:40:26,604 --> 00:40:30,714
So why do you want to speak with someone else instead of the person who was closest to her?!

475
00:40:30,714 --> 00:40:33,304
Because adults can reason.

476
00:41:10,964 --> 00:41:13,614
The whole family is here.

477
00:41:13,614 --> 00:41:17,434
Today will be a turning point in our family's history.

478
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:19,904
Here, let's drink.

479
00:41:19,904 --> 00:41:22,434
Father, eat a lot.

480
00:41:28,144 --> 00:41:31,244
The smell is nice.

481
00:41:31,244 --> 00:41:32,374
Wow, as expected.

482
00:41:32,374 --> 00:41:34,374
Honey, have a lot.

483
00:41:50,974 --> 00:41:55,844
My baby Hye Jeong, I am writing this just in case,

484
00:41:55,844 --> 00:42:00,764
because I can suddenly go to the other world (heaven) or become a cripple during surgery.

485
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:07,174
Even beasts don't give up their children, so I don't know what's wrong with your parents.

486
00:42:07,174 --> 00:42:11,984
That's your luck, but you were lucky having a grandma like me.

487
00:42:11,984 --> 00:42:18,594
Although it shouldn't happen, if I die, take my bank book. I transferred it to your name.

488
00:42:18,594 --> 00:42:25,834
Study with that money. The thing that grandma is most envious of in this world is an educated woman.

489
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:29,344
My back is hurting now, so I can't write more.

490
00:42:29,344 --> 00:42:31,224
From, Grandma.

491
00:42:40,494 --> 00:42:46,274
You don't even know how to dream. If you're born as a human being, shouldn't you live a special life before you die?

492
00:42:46,274 --> 00:42:50,384
Before I die, shouldn't you show me something like that?

493
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:26,664
This is all because of you.

494
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:29,744
Why are you crying?

495
00:43:29,744 --> 00:43:33,914
Leaving you to mother wasn't right. Right, Honey?

496
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:39,234
You ended up killing your grandma.

497
00:43:39,234 --> 00:43:44,514
Now you're expelled from school too. What are you going to do?

498
00:43:44,514 --> 00:43:46,794
You received money from the hospital right?

499
00:43:46,794 --> 00:43:52,244
W-what money? Oh, yes, I received some for the funeral.

500
00:43:52,244 --> 00:43:54,834
Why do you care about that?

501
00:43:58,954 --> 00:44:01,784
I told you something went wrong.

502
00:44:01,784 --> 00:44:07,314
How can someone who went in smiling come out dead? They definitely did something wrong!

503
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:13,024
Stop causing a scene. Since when have you cared about your grandma that much?

504
00:44:13,024 --> 00:44:17,294
She's an elder. Surgery is hard for even a young person, but she's an elder.

505
00:44:17,294 --> 00:44:21,774
It's possible to pass from not being able to endure the surgery.

506
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:26,974
"It's possible to pass"?

507
00:44:26,974 --> 00:44:29,274
"It's possible to pass"?!

508
00:44:29,274 --> 00:44:33,094
How can you be like that? If your daughter had died, could you say the same thing?!

509
00:44:33,094 --> 00:44:37,624
Why are you bringing up our Yoo Na?! It's so unlucky!

510
00:44:40,694 --> 00:44:43,494
Dad, what's wrong with you?

511
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:45,974
Dad, don't you have anything to say?

512
00:44:49,904 --> 00:44:51,764
Let's go quietly.

513
00:44:53,414 --> 00:44:56,594
Quiet my ass.

514
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:14,924
You killed my grandmother, right? Did you kill her?

515
00:45:14,924 --> 00:45:16,784
You said that she would live if the cancerous parts were removed!

516
00:45:16,784 --> 00:45:19,814
Ah, seriously. Why is she like this? Go away.

517
00:45:19,814 --> 00:45:20,484
Go away!

518
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:24,234
You think this hospital is going to turn out well after doing that? I'm not going to stand still and do nothing!

519
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:25,924
Let her go.

520
00:45:27,654 --> 00:45:31,224
If you aren't going to stay still, what can you do?

521
00:45:31,224 --> 00:45:36,774
I have talked to your parents. They understood and moved on.

522
00:45:36,774 --> 00:45:43,444
Although it's unfortunate, I did my best so I have nothing more to say.

523
00:45:43,444 --> 00:45:47,804
Even if you did your best, if someone dies, you should know to be embarrassed.

524
00:45:47,804 --> 00:45:49,974
Does it become forgivable if you've done your best?

525
00:45:49,974 --> 00:45:56,574
If you prove that I didn't try my best, I will receive my punishment as you wish.

526
00:45:56,574 --> 00:46:01,574
However, I cannot forgive your disrespectful behavior.

527
00:46:01,574 --> 00:46:04,894
If you cause a scene again at the hospital, I won't stay still.

528
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:08,904
Teacher.

529
00:47:14,184 --> 00:47:19,814
Ji Hong cares about you a lot, as his student, of course.

530
00:47:19,814 --> 00:47:24,484
As I've always done, I'm his problem-solver, so I agreed to help you out.

531
00:47:24,484 --> 00:47:27,114
I can take care of my own things.

532
00:47:28,924 --> 00:47:34,104
It's an alternative school in Kangwon-do. There's a dormitory too.

533
00:47:35,154 --> 00:47:39,794
I'm going to take the GED. I don't want to be away from my grandma.

534
00:47:39,794 --> 00:47:42,504
You like Ji Hong, right?

535
00:47:42,504 --> 00:47:46,774
People are the most comfortable when they meet others who are at the same level.

536
00:47:46,774 --> 00:47:50,204
Where you live and where Ji Hong lives are too different.

537
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:56,544
Ji Hong and I live similarly, so if we're together, it's a win-win for both of us.

538
00:47:56,544 --> 00:47:59,664
To put it bluntly,

539
00:47:59,664 --> 00:48:01,984
you're a hindrance to Ji Hong.

540
00:48:17,214 --> 00:48:18,744
Yoo Hye Jeong.

541
00:48:25,724 --> 00:48:28,454
You brat, why didn't you contact me?

542
00:48:28,454 --> 00:48:31,344
I have to hear about Grandma from someone else?

543
00:48:31,344 --> 00:48:33,904
Why do I have to tell you about my grandma?

544
00:48:33,904 --> 00:48:36,174
You should have let me know.

545
00:48:43,104 --> 00:48:45,764
What are you going to do now?

546
00:48:45,764 --> 00:48:48,144
What does it matter how I'm going to live?

547
00:48:48,144 --> 00:48:52,214
Of course it matters. You're my student.

548
00:48:53,234 --> 00:48:56,524
Do you intervene in all of your students' lives like this?

549
00:49:05,504 --> 00:49:07,234
Sorry.

550
00:49:08,294 --> 00:49:11,164
I guess this isn't the right time to talk.

551
00:49:13,014 --> 00:49:14,954
Goodbye.

552
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:18,604
Can I really leave?

553
00:49:23,614 --> 00:49:25,384
Yes.

554
00:49:25,384 --> 00:49:28,324
I'd like it if I didn't see you again.

555
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:31,564
I can help you.

556
00:49:31,564 --> 00:49:33,044
No.

557
00:49:35,354 --> 00:49:40,554
Go to the place that you live. I'm going to the place that I live.

558
00:50:01,414 --> 00:50:04,874
♫  Don't say you're sorry, No way  ♫

559
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:08,474
♫  Don't leave me, No way  ♫

560
00:50:08,474 --> 00:50:11,904
♫  The breath you gave me once again  ♫

561
00:50:11,904 --> 00:50:16,124
♫  Lonely, lonely, hug me  ♫

562
00:50:16,124 --> 00:50:18,814
♫  Don't let me go, No way  ♫

563
00:50:18,814 --> 00:50:22,534
♫  Never never never never, No way  ♫

564
00:50:22,534 --> 00:50:31,814
♫  Since the day I chose you, you live within me  ♫

565
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:34,414
Do you want me to divert your mind?

566
00:50:34,414 --> 00:50:38,184
♫ You are everything in my life.  ♫

567
00:50:38,184 --> 00:50:41,584
♫ Now I've placed you. ♫

568
00:50:41,584 --> 00:50:47,704
♫  I can´t love anyone else but you.  ♫

569
00:50:47,704 --> 00:50:50,694
♫ Don't say you're sorry. No way. ♫

570
00:50:50,694 --> 00:50:53,374
♫  Never, never, never, never, no way. ♫

571
00:50:53,374 --> 00:50:58,524
Becoming crazy when you're in love is proof that your brain is active.

572
00:50:58,524 --> 00:51:02,914
Not becoming crazy when you love is abnormal.

573
00:51:02,914 --> 00:51:05,964
I protected myself from becoming crazy in love.

574
00:51:05,964 --> 00:51:09,724
That's why I paid a price.

575
00:51:18,994 --> 00:51:22,494
♫ Don't say you're sorry. No way.  ♫

576
00:51:22,494 --> 00:51:25,574
♫ Don't leave me. No way  ♫

00:51:25,574 --> 00:51:29,504
♫ The breath you gave me once again ♫

00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:33,714
♫  Lonely lonely. Hug me. ♫

579
00:51:33,714 --> 00:51:36,654
♫ Don't let me go. No way. ♫

582
00:51:45,244 --> 00:51:51,904
♫ You live within me. ♫
 13 years later

583
00:52:08,254 --> 00:52:10,014
Here, Doc.

584
00:52:10,014 --> 00:52:12,354
Hurry and get ready please.

585
00:52:12,354 --> 00:52:14,834
Yes.

586
00:52:14,834 --> 00:52:16,584
Who told you to stay here!

587
00:52:18,884 --> 00:52:20,454
Where is the doctor, here?!

588
00:52:20,454 --> 00:52:22,174
Oh my God!

589
00:52:23,904 --> 00:52:26,974
Doc, you´re not coming?! Get yourself over here!

590
00:52:26,974 --> 00:52:30,204
Our Hyungnim is here. How can you treat him like this?!

591
00:52:30,204 --> 00:52:31,094
You go.

592
00:52:31,094 --> 00:52:33,944
In the ER, you said that the Department of Neurosurgery is the most important.

593
00:52:33,944 --> 00:52:37,694
You said that all patients need to be filtered through your department.

594
00:52:37,694 --> 00:52:39,654
It's you? Come here.

595
00:52:39,654 --> 00:52:44,144
- Why are you here?
- We came because he's hurt.

596
00:52:44,144 --> 00:52:47,854
Don't be scared. We're humans too. Hurry and take a look.

597
00:52:47,854 --> 00:52:49,374
Why are you bleeding?

598
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:53,204
Hey! What the hell are you doing?
Aish

599
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:56,014
- I get a bit nervous.
- What's going on?

600
00:52:56,014 --> 00:53:00,284
Oh, Doctor! He's the doctor, and he's responsible. He's the boss.

601
00:53:00,284 --> 00:53:01,334
Yes, I am the person in charge.

602
00:53:01,334 --> 00:53:02,404
-You´re a doctor?
-Yes.

603
00:53:02,404 --> 00:53:03,934
Hurry and come look.

604
00:53:05,774 --> 00:53:08,474
Let's take a look.

605
00:53:11,754 --> 00:53:14,644
First, get an ABGA (arterial blood gas analysis), then administer Rutin.

606
00:53:14,644 --> 00:53:17,354
Then do a CT scan for the head, and do a MRI too.

607
00:53:17,354 --> 00:53:18,864
Yes.

608
00:53:20,324 --> 00:53:22,264
Do you think I'm a pushover?

609
00:53:22,264 --> 00:53:27,784
Do you think I don't know that you will do unnecessary exams to make money?

610
00:53:29,534 --> 00:53:32,664
Hey! Punk! You can't even do that right?

611
00:53:34,684 --> 00:53:39,124
Little bastard. Hyung-nim is talking, yet you don´t even answer. Who are you to be yelling? Huh?

612
00:53:39,124 --> 00:53:42,224
-Should I make your back fold back and forth like an accordion?
-No.

613
00:53:42,224 --> 00:53:44,624
You´re just displacing your anger against us to him, right?

614
00:53:44,624 --> 00:53:46,484
How...How...How can that be?

615
00:53:46,484 --> 00:53:47,554
Clench your teeth.

616
00:53:47,554 --> 00:53:48,924
-Pardon? What?
-What is he going to do?

617
00:53:48,924 --> 00:53:51,374
I told you to clench your molars.

618
00:53:53,324 --> 00:53:57,034
What are you? A medic?

619
00:53:57,034 --> 00:54:00,544
Can´t you tell from looking at me? I´m a doctor.

620
00:54:07,814 --> 00:54:12,184
This is a place where patients get treated. All of you non-patients, please get out.

621
00:54:12,184 --> 00:54:15,584
Who are you to tell our Hyung-nim to do this or that?

622
00:54:15,584 --> 00:54:20,824
I am the person who is going to treat him. I have the obligation to create the best possible environment for treatment.

623
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:23,204
I won´t get treated by a woman.

624
00:54:24,854 --> 00:54:29,574
Get a man here. Go stand outside.

625
00:54:29,574 --> 00:54:32,074
Yes, Hyung-nim. Hey

626
00:54:32,074 --> 00:54:33,024
Just go.

627
00:54:33,024 --> 00:54:36,934
Doctor, just go and stand there.

628
00:54:41,744 --> 00:54:42,934
Hey

629
00:55:07,934 --> 00:55:12,384
Sunbae, I liked you for long time.

630
00:55:12,384 --> 00:55:14,404
Aigoo no, no, no.

631
00:55:15,384 --> 00:55:19,514
Is there anything more fabulous? No matter what I need to make that animal be moved to tears.

632
00:55:19,514 --> 00:55:25,544
Oppa~, I've had my eye on you since we did our hospital rounds.

633
00:55:25,544 --> 00:55:30,194
Watched? That seems like a stalker.

634
00:55:31,224 --> 00:55:36,114
No. Let's keep it simple. It's no use trying to be elaborate. He won't get it anyway.

635
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:41,764
Jeong Yoon Do, you're mine.

636
00:55:47,124 --> 00:55:50,234
You should wait a bit. You're eating alone?

637
00:55:50,234 --> 00:55:54,674
Are you trying to act like a girl now? When you get a boyfriend, you can tell him to wait.

638
00:55:56,804 --> 00:56:01,724
I can't eat. Why are you buying me food here? There are so many other places with a good atmosphere.

639
00:56:01,724 --> 00:56:05,104
Places with a good atmosphere are just expensive and the food isn't that great.

640
00:56:05,104 --> 00:56:07,434
This rest stop café is really famous and has really good food.

641
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:10,004
You wear $200 socks yet you are frugal when it comes to food.

642
00:56:10,004 --> 00:56:13,824
I told you time and time again, the icing on the cake called me, is fashion.

643
00:56:13,824 --> 00:56:17,854
The socks complete the fashion. Hurry up and eat.

644
00:56:17,854 --> 00:56:19,424
I said I'm not going to eat.

645
00:56:19,424 --> 00:56:22,044
Then let's go back. I have to go to the hospital.

646
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:24,284
Ah, I said I have something to say.

647
00:56:25,884 --> 00:56:28,174
Then say it.

648
00:56:28,174 --> 00:56:32,334
If I act fake, it will most likely backfire. So I will just state the facts.

649
00:56:32,334 --> 00:56:33,884
Hey, Ahjumma.

650
00:56:39,674 --> 00:56:43,744
Who am I looking at right now? I'm looking at you.

651
00:56:44,594 --> 00:56:49,134
I'm not an ahjumma. Your eyesight is really bad.

652
00:56:49,134 --> 00:56:52,544
Sorry. I thought you guys were a married couple.

653
00:56:53,684 --> 00:56:57,924
Sunbae, I guess people think we look good together.

654
00:56:57,924 --> 00:57:04,474
It's not that you look good together. This guy is so cold towards you. Would he act this way if you were his girlfriend?

655
00:57:04,474 --> 00:57:07,914
Ah, this ahjumma. You really make people's feelings go back and forth.

656
00:57:07,914 --> 00:57:12,964
Agassi you're the one going back in forth. You're really strong.

657
00:57:12,964 --> 00:57:15,244
I can just pay you back.

658
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:20,024
If you did something wrong, you should apologize first. How could you give me money?

659
00:57:20,024 --> 00:57:22,724
Sorry, I am sorry.

660
00:57:22,724 --> 00:57:28,634
Ahjumma you did something wrong also. That was about to fall anyway. What would've happened if someone got hurt?

661
00:57:28,634 --> 00:57:32,294
Sunbae, are you leaving?

662
00:57:32,294 --> 00:57:37,634
You should help me like a man. Say something and throw money.

663
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:40,354
You clean up the mess you made.

664
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:43,584
Sunbae!

665
00:57:43,584 --> 00:57:44,994
Where are you going?!

666
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:49,174
Ah seriously. This ahjumma. How much is it? It's fine if I pay you back.

667
00:57:55,914 --> 00:57:57,274
We have to call the police.

668
00:57:57,274 --> 00:58:00,434
- Ahjumeoni. What are you doing? Call 119 (number for emergency services and fire department in Korea).
- What do we do?

669
00:58:00,434 --> 00:58:03,064
- What should I do?
- Ahjumeoni!

670
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,514
Major Trauma Center

671
00:58:14,674 --> 00:58:16,064
How's the surgery room? Are all the preparations done?

672
00:58:16,064 --> 00:58:17,404
Yes. It's Room 1.

673
00:58:17,404 --> 00:58:19,194
Why is it Room 1? What about Room 2?

674
00:58:19,194 --> 00:58:23,284
The new doctor is using room 2. Emergency surgery for epidural brain hemorrhage.

675
00:58:23,284 --> 00:58:26,784
Why is there a surgery that I don't know about going on? I'm on duty today.

676
00:58:26,784 --> 00:58:28,654
I'm responsible for all the surgeries that happen today.

677
00:58:28,654 --> 00:58:32,514
Exactly. I kept saying that you can't, you can't. But she just went in.

678
00:58:32,514 --> 00:58:36,234
Then you should have contacted me. What were you doing, you bastard?

679
00:58:36,234 --> 00:58:38,894
Now that I've been lenient with you, are you acting without any sense right away?

680
00:58:38,894 --> 00:58:39,884
I´m sorry.

681
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:43,574
It's ok. You just have to take responsibility for the things you're sorry for.
