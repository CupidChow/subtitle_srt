00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,633
Namyang Girls' High School

2
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:28,913
Episode 2
Wow, you were totally impressive.

3
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:31,533
It's not like our school is some kind of a garbage dump.

4
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:35,903
You know, if you cause a problem one more time, you will be expelled right away. Understood?

5
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:39,443
Living recklessly is self-abuse.

6
00:00:39,443 --> 00:00:44,323
It's torturing oneself even more ruthlessly than death itself.

7
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:49,133
As is true with all kinds of abuse, when you get used to it, you find it fun.

8
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:55,383
I hope that he won't be the homeroom teacher but he probably will be.

9
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:59,253
My life never gives me what I want.

10
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:01,253
Yoo Hye Jeong
Gangdonggu, Seoul

11
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:04,823
IQ 156

12
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,563
Not interested in others, always has a gloomy expression, might use her intelligence on bad things.

13
00:01:10,063 --> 00:01:17,373
Even at this very moment of wanting to live recklessly, deep inside my heart I ask, "How long are you going to live this way?"

14
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:24,333
I will show you how good I am at doing something I dislike.

15
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:36,543
Turn around.

16
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:41,093
You're the one who wants to be hit.

17
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:46,133
I don't want to do something I despise for someone I don't even like.

18
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:50,523
What's that look? Do you feel bad because I blatantly said that I dislike you?

19
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:57,203
No. I like that you're straightforward rather than saying that you're hitting me because you care for me.

20
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:59,563
What were you going to do if I had really hit you?

21
00:01:59,563 --> 00:02:03,263
It would've been good if you'd hit me. I resent you because you didn't.

22
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:07,813
Anyway, since the decision to not hit me was yours, I don't have to write a self-reflection letter, right?

23
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:12,603
Wow... You're good at calculating. You'd be good at sales. Didn't you say you were going out to the market with Granny at dawn?

24
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:14,583
Why do you keep calling my grandma Granny?

25
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:18,643
What's wrong with it? It's very friendly! It's not condescending; it's a dialect!

26
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:21,043
That word, granny, makes her seem really old!

27
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:26,593
My grandma is not that old yet and even if it's dialect, the nuance is condescending!

28
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:30,163
Hey! That's a commonly used term.

29
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:31,863
You're the weird one for feeling that way.

30
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:37,433
Whether or not it's commonly used, if it's offensive to the other person, shouldn't you stop using it?

31
00:02:38,393 --> 00:02:42,973
Are you Granny? She's the one who told me to call her granny. You're a third person.

32
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:45,263
She's my grandma, so I have a right!

33
00:02:45,263 --> 00:02:50,903
You didn't even come last New Years or act friendly with her! You came suddenly and now act all granddaughter-like!

34
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:53,193
That's what family is.

35
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:57,343
You don't even know that? You have a family, too.

36
00:02:58,663 --> 00:03:00,466
Family...

37
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,920
Hey!

38
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,280
You arriving first, is that what's important?

39
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,600
That's right! This is my territory, punk!

40
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,970
Why separate your territory versus mine?

41
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,870
Please save them.

42
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,270
People are self-centered. Their life is more important than someone else's death.

43
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,530
That's how I learned about people and lost my family.

44
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,660
Can I leave now?

45
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,220
Do as you want! With free will comes responsibility!

46
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,810
I won't safeguard you.

47
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,380
Science Room

48
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,190
Are you crazy?

49
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,310
Hey! Why'd you come here?
(Choi Mi Ra)

50
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,230
For real.

51
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,290
That girl...

52
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,930
- Hey hey hey...
- Do you want to get hit again? Let's leave her alone.

53
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,660
- She's on a different level than us.
- That's right

54
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,260
Hold it back!

55
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,910
My name is Yoo Ra! I told you before, right? Where in Seoul did you come from? Gangnam?

56
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,720
My cousin lives there too!

57
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,340
But strangely, I've only been there once.

58
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,060
Everyone here knows your name as "Cheon Soon Hee."

59
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,620
What? Oh...

60
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:44,070
My mom had me at 45 so she says that she's always sick.

61
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,840
Don't you have any pride?

62
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,550
I don't have good genes.

63
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:55,180
My parents' sperm and egg met when they were both old, so I got all the bad things from them.

64
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,420
I have pride too,

65
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:05,510
but I like you! When we first met, I felt something! I believe in destiny you know!

66
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,910
Are you a lesbian?

67
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,660
Les...You mean, a cafe server?

68
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,660
I don't like that kind of stuff!

69
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,380
A girl who likes a girl is a lesbian.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,410
I like girls! Ah...

71
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,390
So I was a lesbian...

72
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:33,030
But are there girls who don't like girls?

73
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,020
You're kind of cute.

74
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,050
She's said I'm cute! Hey!

75
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,530
I knew you would like me too!

76
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,700
Please turn around.

77
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,330
For how long have you not been feeling well?

78
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,260
It's been that way for all of my life.

79
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,360
Aigoo, how come you came to the hospital only now? Where are you not feeling well?

80
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:09,660
I can't digest very well and there are times when I have sharp pains. Sometimes I feel cold spells and I can't even eat.

81
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,510
Let's do an examination first.

82
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,910
Can you just give me some medication to reduce the pain?

83
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,820
If you just want medication, why come to the hospital?

84
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,750
Pharmacy medication isn't working anymore, so now I need a prescription.

85
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,770
Grandma, there may be multiple factors that are causing the pain.

86
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,650
It may be because there is a hole in your stomach or an infection.

87
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,810
How much is it for the examination?

88
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,390
Father

89
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,540
Yes, Father. What did Chairman Hong say?

90
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,140
What am I going to do if you didn't tell him yet? I will go there again.

91
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,770
You wanna go play today?

92
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,620
For real...

93
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,050
- Who is he?
- Wow...

94
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,960
The motorcycle is so cool!

95
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,070
Get on.

96
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,460
Don't be clingy.

97
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,330
Are they dating?

98
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,260
What do you meaning, dating? That oppa's mine.

99
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,700
Oppa! Give me a ride.

100
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,050
Don't be clingy.

101
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,760
Seo Woo, I'll go first today.

102
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,810
I can hang out today. Let's go to my house.

103
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,180
No no... It's okay. I'll contact you!

104
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,980
Hey!

105
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,800
Don't you have any friends?

106
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,730
Why wouldn't I? I have... you.

107
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,980
Aren't you going to buy a uniform?

108
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,220
Are there any places that sell used ones?

109
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,640
I don't know about used ones but I know a place where you can get them for free!

110
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,170
Let's go! I'll take you!

111
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,630
♫  Blackbird singing in the dead of night ♫
(Beatles - "Blackbird")

112
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,220
♫  Take these broken wings and learn to fly ♫

113
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,830
Oh hello!

114
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,220
Are you going somewhere?
♫  All your life ♫

115
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,410
Why are you telling me not to get dinner ready?

116
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,830
I'm going to Seoul.
♫  You're only ♫

117
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,090
To your father?
♫  waiting for this ♫

118
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,620
Yes.
♫  moment to arrive ♫

119
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,960
Turn off the music. It's loud.

120
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,620
Okay.

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,530
Do you have something to say?

122
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,320
Did you see our Hye Jeong today? Who's her homeroom teacher?

123
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,030
It's me.

124
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,450
What are you doing?

125
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:34,920
I've never knelt down on my knees my entire life. Though I don't have much, I've been sure to take care of my pride.

126
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,950
Please get up.

127
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:42,030
The two people that I, Kang Mal Soon, respect the most are teachers and doctors.

128
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,530
People are curious about what people did for a living.

129
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:50,340
They judge others for that and point fingers,

130
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,430
but teachers can't be that way, right?

131
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,480
She is a child who has more days to live out than she has lived so far.

132
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,560
I don't know how much you know about her, but please erase all of it.

133
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,430
Please take care of my granddaughter.

134
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,430
Hye Jeong is smart.

135
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:22,150
It's because she needs an internal motivator rather than praise, that I've done it on purpose. Don't worry too much.

136
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:26,350
When her mom was alive, the whole neighborhood was buzzing about how smart she was!

137
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,480
She wasn't even taught, but she went around reading all kinds of signs. She did that!

138
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,830
What the heck. Really! How could you like her automatically! You're so simple.

139
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,800
Don't tell the kid that you told me this!

140
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,370
Ouch, my legs are asleep.

141
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,660
She should be here by now.

142
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,900
It fits well!

143
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,880
Why did you buy a new one? It looks like it would still fit you.

144
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,410
Confirming affection? I lack affection.

145
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,850
Wow it's so pretty!

146
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,780
You have big boobs. I'm jealous!

147
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,920
Want to know a secret?

148
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,770
Yeah. Tell.

149
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,360
They're uneven.

150
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,130
What! I'll check for myself then!

151
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,990
Woah woah!

152
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,740
- Owww!
- Sorry sorry! I'll just take a peek.

153
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,570
You can't! What's wrong with you!

154
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,160
We're here!

155
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,370
Let's go together!

156
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,830
Let's go together!

157
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,020
Be careful, little kid.

158
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,540
Did you buy the uniform?

159
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,140
You don't even reply now?

160
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,750
Mom!

161
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,610
Mom, does it hurt?

162
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,550
Mom, does it hurt?

163
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,140
Noona, do something.

164
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,240
Ahjumma. Ahjumma!

165
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,710
Ajumma. Stop it. Patient, are you alright?

166
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,540
- Call 119.
- Yes.

167
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,010
This is 119 right? Someone collapsed here. She's pregnant.

168
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,520
The location here is near Geum-Gok bus station.

169
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,020
Teacher. Teacher, her water—

170
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,430
Her water broke! The kid is going to come out. What are they going to do?

171
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,760
Why are you still taking up space for a minor surgery? There's still a lot to do.

172
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,950
I'll resign from my chairman position and will visit the States.

173
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,460
What about America?

174
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,630
I want to study business and social work.

175
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,110
You're a surgeon down to the bone. What business and social work?

176
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,510
Both you and I, we need to change. Now.

177
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,560
There's an emergency patient.

178
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,300
- Call Doctor Kim Tae Ho.
- Okay. I got it.

179
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,130
It's okay. Your mom is going to be okay. Don't cry, it's okay.

180
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,640
Be quiet, guys. She's a pregnant woman in her mid 30s.

181
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,610
Looking at the pupil reflex... the right pupil is enlarged to 4-5mm.

182
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,520
She has left-side hemiplegia (paralysis of one side of the body).

183
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,080
I'm sure she has a cerebral hemorrhage or cerebral infarction (a form of stroke). More likely it's a cerebral hemorrhage.

184
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,020
It can be a ruptured aneurysm.

185
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,390
How can I check that?

186
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,960
You can't tell with a naked eye. Did you call 911?

187
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,510
Yes, we called. But it's been three minutes since her water broke.

188
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,440
We don't have a general hospital here with both neurosurgery and OBGYN departments together.

189
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,530
Find a room for her there, Father.

190
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,340
I understand.

191
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,970
Teacher! Teacher!

192
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,630
Hello? Hello?

193
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,590
What is happening?

194
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,690
She just vomited and is having a hard time breathing because of the remnants of vomitus.

195
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,000
I'll have to perform intubation without anesthesia.

196
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,740
If the ambulance is delayed, I'll have to perform a tracheotomy.

197
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,070
Don't do it. How can you perform tracheotomy without any medical instruments?

198
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,690
If something grows wrong, you really won't be able to be a doctor again.

199
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:27,260
If you don't perform tracheotomy correctly, you can cut the artery and she'll bleed to death or it might hurt her thyroid.

200
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,270
Hold onto to your mom's hand. Give her strength.

201
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,670
Why are you doing that right now?!

202
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:41,130
You hold onto her hand too. You don't love through the heart. You love through the brain.

203
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:48,190
Feeling of liking and disliking someone comes from central nucleus of the amygdala, found in the cerebrum. Your brain has feelings.

204
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,830
Were you really a doctor?

205
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,680
Do you have a knife?

206
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,440
Do you need it for tracheotomy?

207
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,820
Good thing you catch on fast.

208
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,140
I'll go find one.

209
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,770
- What if something goes wrong?
- Is there something that can be worse than this?

210
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,600
- There is.
- Even so, it has to be done.

211
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,980
She needs intubation. Give me the laryngoscope.

212
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,250
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes.

213
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,010
Give me the laryngoscope, please.

214
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,840
Please bear it for a bit.

215
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,570
Please give me the tube.

216
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,520
Remove the intubating stylet, please.

217
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,540
To Guk Il Medical Center in Seoul. Please hurry.

218
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,860
Get off.

219
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,440
No I can't. Hold on to your mom's hand.

220
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,550
Oh, Doctor.

221
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,130
You must've been desperate s***less coming all the way here. How are you here?

222
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,290
Connections.

223
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,900
How was it, seeing a patient dying in front of you without being able to do anything?

224
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,570
I'm relieved it was a hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage.

225
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:16,740
The real relief is that the patient met an amazing doctor like you.

226
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,020
Another real relief is that the patient didn't have an aneurysm.

227
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,340
If she had, she would've died already while you were contemplating intubation.

228
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:30,220
And if that had happened, you would have lived the rest of your life filled with guilt.

229
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,660
Because you are someone who feels responsible

230
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,730
for the deaths of all the patients you meet.

231
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,950
Teacher, you've become very rough over the years.

232
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:47,160
Does that hurt? Now watch the true dignity of a neurosurgeon.

233
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,920
That patient, I will save her. Why?

234
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,090
Because I am me. Me. Because I am Kim Tae Ho.

235
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,440
Operating room.

236
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,700
Defribillator.

237
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,700
Can you hand me the helical? (defibrillator with a spiral catheter)

238
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,120
Did you check whether the patient had a fever before going into the surgery?

239
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,230
The intern should've done it.

240
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,510
Should've done it? Should've done it? You bastard.

241
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,790
What did you do, you bastard?

242
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,230
You guys. If this gets out, you guys take responsibility. Got it?

243
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:20,860
Why do I have to listen to that because of you? You bastard, don't even sleep.

244
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,440
Don't even eat, you bastard.

245
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,580
The surgery was successful. Please do not worry too much.

246
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,340
Doctor, thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

247
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,410
How old are you?

248
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,150
Don't worry. She'll be moved to the recovery room soon.

249
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,820
Let's go.

250
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,560
♫  It was like this, right...  ♫

251
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:16,640
♫  According to my will, nothing  ♫

252
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:24,240
♫  worked out  ♫

253
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:30,110
♫  In each moment, my destiny. Only hate will ♫

254
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,060
Go in.
♫  Is that it? The world is. ? ♫

255
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:38,340
♫  Aren't you perhaps lonely? ♫

256
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:44,510
♫  Don't know if this will be comforting. ♫

257
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:50,500
♫  It might not be words that only comfort ♫

258
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,430
♫  But that's how it is for everyone♫

259
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,370
♫  It will be okay. ♫

260
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,790
You don't love through the heart. You love through the brain.

261
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,320
Thank you, student. Thank you so much.

262
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,900
No need to thank me. It was my teacher who did everything.

263
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,710
- What's your name?
- Pardon?

264
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,050
I want to name my daughter after you

265
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:29,160
so that she can grow up helping others, like you.

266
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,470
♫  Don't know if this will be comforting. ♫

267
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:47,530
♫  It might not be words that only comfort ♫

268
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:53,590
♫  But that's how it is for everyone (how it is) ♫

269
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,440
♫  It will be okay. ♫

270
00:22:21,566 --> 00:22:25,960
Wel...co...me.

271
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,330
Hot Potato 2S, Newly released album from Buzz

272
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:36,190
Sorry. The CD was 10,000 ₩

273
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,460
I want to live differently, but I don't think I can without paying for this.

274
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,360
I can't take this.

275
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,410
Is it because it's not enough?

276
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,410
Take it to Namyang Girls' High School teacher Hong Ji Hong.

277
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:56,030
He came back that day with the CD and money, saying that he found it on the streets.

278
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,410
We take boarders

279
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,680
- Oh my.
- What?

280
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,730
- I have something to say.
- Say it.

281
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,930
- Can't I say it inside?
- No, because it's too messy.

282
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,550
Oh, it's totally messy.

283
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,670
- What are you doing?
- I was going to clean up.

284
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,730
Leave it the way it is! Don't touch it!

285
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,740
This seems chaotic but there's an order to it.

286
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,730
I really don't like it when others touch my stuff.

287
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,730
Good.

288
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,500
What's up, coming all the way to my room. Do you want to be friends?

289
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,340
Yes! I think you're kind of cool.

290
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,020
Wow, you come in suddenly, without a warning.

291
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,190
Doctors are more well paid and respected than teachers.

292
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:09,590
But you threw away being a doctor and chose instead to be a teacher. Why did you do that?

293
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,620
"Why did you do that?" Why do you think I did that?

294
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,790
I can't figure it out no matter how much I think about it.

295
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:20,540
Even now, your floor is covered with medical texts and I think you have some unresolved feelings about being a doctor.

296
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,380
Ah! Were you kicked out?

297
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,910
- I left.
- Why?

298
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,410
I never gave up on being a doctor. I think being a teacher is an extension of being a doctor.

299
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,770
Okay. I don't understand, but I'll take it.

300
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:39,010
That quote that the brain has emotions, where did you hear that ?

301
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,630
I thought of it myself.

302
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,750
Wow, that's so cool.

303
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,460
You said something about the limbic system or whatever, too. You seem so knowledgeable.

304
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,130
You've just totally fallen for me. You might even write my biography.

305
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:58,300
I'm 18. I can't live like this forever. I'm getting sick of it.

306
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,550
Before, even if I had wanted to live differently, I never had a reason to.

307
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,660
But now I have a reason.

308
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,950
What's that reason?

309
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,810
I want to make it so that my grandma can live in luxury.

310
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:14,500
Ah... luxury. That word's a bit outdated for someone so young to say.

311
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,590
Please take me seriously. My life depends on it.

312
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,860
What's the reason you're telling me these things?

313
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:26,740
I want to live differently but I don't know how.

314
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,940
Sorry to ruin it for you, but you can't live differently.

315
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,000
People say, "Failure is the mother of success." That's a complete lie.

316
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,360
If you keep on failing, you can never succeed.

317
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:46,140
Only those who succeed are successful. The only thing you learn from failure is self-abasement and feeling intimidated.

318
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,470
I can succeed if I put my mind to it!

319
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,720
Try it then. Try it first, and then we'll talk about it.

320
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,040
How can I succeed right now?

321
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,430
How can a student show her success? Don't you know?

322
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,380
Studying! How do you do that?

323
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:13,270
I'm a teacher. I'm your homeroom teacher at that. I can't teach you how to study. You may take your leave now.

324
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:23,370
Thank you. I went to the CD store earlier.

325
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,660
- Ji Hong!
- Yeah.

326
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,030
- Who is she?
- The homeowner's granddaughter.

327
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,050
Oh, you called at a good time!

328
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,870
What? Did something happen?
"Happy"

329
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,800
Who's the best at studying in our class?

330
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,800
♫Twinkling brightly under the dark night sky ♫
(BoA - "Atlantis Princess")

331
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,060
We're here, Seo Woo! Come quickly!
♫ ...where I was born? ♫

00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,760

- I do.

335
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,730
Hye Jeong, this is Seo Woo.
♫ I wanted to believe it to be true ♫

336
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,620
- Why did you call me?
- This is your favorite, a fish burger.
♫ The many questions I had ♫

337
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,110
Tell me, instead of beating around the bush.
♫ and all the unresolved stories ♫

338
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:28,040
Hye Jeong wants to study but she barely knows any basics. So she needs someone to teach her.
♫ I turn around and one day, only I forget this secret ♫

339
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,620
Don't you have a mouth? Why are you making Soon Hee ask a favor for you?
♫ Why are you like this really. Now I ♫

340
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,490
Can you teach me how to study?

341
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,480
I'm busy studying myself. Go to an academy. It's simple.
♫ some kind of lost memory. ♫

342
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,290
There's a midterm next week... I need to do well on it to show the homeroom teach.
♫  In my heart that small hope and ♫

343
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,750

♫  to not forget, I must whisper upon that sky ♫

344
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:52,920
Are you at least going to teach me? I don't really want to tell something personal to someone who isn't going to help.
♫ Why is it that I've grown up now? ♫

345
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,080
You're very stubborn for someone who's asking for a favor.
♫ a forgotten memory ♫

346
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,100
Your hair looks good today.

347
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:06,250
♫ Now with my small hope and to not lose my dream, I want to whisper upon that sky. ♫

348
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,880
I see you often. We must be fated.

349
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:19,040
Oh, a new face! Nice atmosphere.

350
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Oh! You're Jin Seo Woo, right?

351
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:27,130
Namyang Girls' High School's beauty (ulzzang, ul means face + zzang is the best). She's great at her studies and her father's a doctor.

352
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,330
She's in a totally different dimension than people like us.

353
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:33,580
I don't think she's that amazing. Right?

354
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,070
Please move it.

355
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,020
See? I told you. She's on a different level. "Please move it!"

356
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,870
She said to move it. Don't you know Korean?

357
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,530
These girls, seriously...

358
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,440
Hey, you come here.

359
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:04,650
Never mind. She's mine so don't touch her.

360
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,810
Mine, my ass.

361
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:10,930
Why am I yours? I'm mine. No one can have me.

362
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,820
They're my people. Don't touch them. Let's go.

363
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,080
That rude girl...

364
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,840
Hey! Does she have something on you? Why can't you do anything?

365
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,030
Aren't they following us?

366
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,200
- They're coming!
- Run!

367
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,690
Aigoo run!

368
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,260
Hey!

369
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,820
Aigoo, aigoo. Run faster!

370
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:49,220
♫ One year later, even if nothing changed. In this moment ♫

Where are they?

377
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,270
Over there, over there.
♫ I will I will follow you. ♫

378
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,100
♫  Though it's a bit awkward ♫

379
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,010
They aren't coming. I said they aren't coming!

380
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,130
Ah I really...

381
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,040
Why do you run so fast!

382
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,460
How do you run so fast for a student who only studies!

383
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,290
Ah seriously.

384
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,770
I'll help you study.

385
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,640
Really!?

386
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,300
After I just confirm something with the homeroom teacher.

387
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,110
Ah! Really!

388
00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:02,650
♫  You're my daydream, I will follow you ♫

389
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,910
♫  All I got is you ♫

390
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,340
Is that a medical textbook?

391
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,370
Medical journal. I was bored. What's up?

392
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,520
I'll help teach Hye Jeong.

393
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,550
Even though I know it won't do much, I'll do it for your sake, teacher.

394
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,730
For my sake?

395
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:28,840
I know it's all for my sake that you don't send other kids on errands and only send me.

396
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,000
Because all I do is study and breathe.

397
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,150
If you think I won't understand your explanation, you say "just".

398
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,610
You figure out your students' home environment and teach them accordingly.

399
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,810
Hey! What are you doing right now?

400
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,020
I like you. As a man.

401
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:55,220
I won't ask to date now. Just wait, please. Two years.

402
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,190
Don't marry Unni In Joo.

403
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,960
I'm going to get into medical school, and I can marry you as soon as I graduate.

404
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,170
I won't let you become an old bachelor.

405
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,800
Jin Seo Woo. You're too much.

406
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:09,340
I confessed! You were the one who said someone who confesses was better than someone who doesn't.

407
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,350
Hey, cancel that. I was wrong, now that I see how the person hearing would feel.

408
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,120
Ah, Teacher.

409
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:19,450
Also, whether you teach Hye Jeong or not is your choice. Are you making a deal with this?

410
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,000
You said you like someone who's warm.

411
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,130
I wanted you to know that I'm the type of person you like, too.

412
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:31,060
Don't be someone who love someone else, but love yourself.

413
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:36,030
Brat, what's with confessing without a single chocolate? That's invalid!

414
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:49,760
Grandma. You should've come to the hospital before. How can you come now?

415
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,280
Is it really bad?

416
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,440
The good news is that you've grown old.

417
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,130
Why is growing old good news?

418
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:01,170
If you're old, then cancer will develop slowly. It matches your growth rate.

419
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,980
Hankyung Bank

420
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,580
Life should fall apart at one point like this...

421
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,870
I'll just drive away the misfortune and live the next ten years without troubles.

422
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,750
The surgery money is in my bank account...

423
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,530
Oh you startled me.

424
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:32,030
Grandma, stop that habit of talking to yourself.

425
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,930
What do you always mutter to yourself?

426
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,820
Where are you going?

427
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,470
To study.

428
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:42,080
Hey! Don't lie.

429
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,030
It's true!

430
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:48,950
Really? If you'd really do that, then your granny doesn't have any other wishes.

431
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,930
Grandma, what do you want me to become?

432
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,720
If I tell you to be something, will you really become it?

433
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,170
- I could become that.
- Then become a doctor.

434
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:00,330
You can wear the white gown, be called "Doctor" and people will look up to you.

435
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,170
You make a lot of money. That's good.

436
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:06,890
You have a big dream. Do you think anyone can become a doctor? Say something realistic.

437
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:10,090
Never mind b****. You can't even have a great dream.

438
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,620
If you were born a human then you should live a special life for once.

439
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:17,900
Shouldn't you show me something like that before I die?

440
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,050
These days, there are a lot of people telling me to show them something.

441
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:26,370
What do you want me to show you? Me becoming a doctor? Okay then, I will!

442
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:30,730
Forget it. It would be nice if you could even run errands at the hospital.

443
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,640
I'll be back.

444
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,020
Practice Problems
Substitute the next.

445
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:46,730
** (x + 2y)**2 - 5 (x + 2y)

446
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,060
What's substitution?

447
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,830
Switch it. This is basic. In factorization, substitution is elementary.

448
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,860
How do you change it?

449
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:58,360
Ah, this is frustrating. You don't even know this?

450
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,520
Exactly how much did you not study?

451
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,120
If you teach me, I can do it well. Just the beginning.

452
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,490
Kids. Eat some snacks.

453
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:15,440
Oh! Thank you, ma'am!

454
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,690
Eat a lot, so you spend a lot of energy studyin—

455
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,740
Wow! You have a mom who makes all of these! You must be so happy, Seo Woo!

456
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,670
My mom orders all food.

457
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,230
Seo Woo, eat up.

458
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:38,150
Seo Woo. Come talk to me.

459
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,290
Ah, seriously.

460
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:43,340
Why? You said you were bring in them snacks. What's wrong?

461
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:47,110
There's no use in giving them snacks. Just useless.

462
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,600
They're all here. Let's talk later.

463
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,810
Why later? Are you taking their side because they are friends?

464
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,220
What's up with Soon Hee?

465
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,330
Why is the principal's daughter drawing in her workbooks and not solving the problems in them?

466
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,790
She's nice.

467
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,310
If she's nice, then that's half great.

468
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,960
It's all good if she doesn't betray those around her and doesn't bother you.

469
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,530
You have such low expectations regarding people.

470
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,250
You should say to meet someone who benefits her.

471
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,600
We are a successful family. If we can stay like this without having anything taken from us, then we are successful enough.

472
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,940
Seo Woo, Dad trusts you. Take care of your health while you study, ok?

473
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,890
In front of the kid, you're the nice person again.

474
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,720
Other than Soon Hee, who's the other kid?

475
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,070
Stop it! Don't you know what manners are? You can say that stuff when they are gone.

476
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,920
What am I afraid of that I can't speak in my own house?

477
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,790
Your competitors are all in Gangnam.

478
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,700
If you continue in this state and end up at a lousy college, who's the one who'll be affected?

479
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,300
It's me!

480
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,740
In the end you're taking care of me as I study for yourself, not me!

481
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,140
- The house is nice, but I guess the soundproofing isn't that great.
- Hey! How is this for me? It's all for you!

482
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,620
Seems so, we should go.
You really!

483
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,270
We should go.

484
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,360
We'll go.

Do you think I'd give it to you if I only had one? It's a copy.

525
00:40:25,754 --> 00:40:30,354
Ah, today is the day that test results come out, I'm dead!

526
00:40:30,354 --> 00:40:31,734
- Boo!
- Oh my gosh!

527
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:34,154
- I wasn't surprised.
- Yah! Aish.

528
00:40:34,874 --> 00:40:39,004
Ah, as expected, Seo Woo must be happy because she did well on her test.

529

You're probably going to be first again!

530
00:40:40,534 --> 00:40:42,954
Ah, this time the test was really difficult, right?

531
00:40:42,954 --> 00:40:48,024
Just because your score didn't come out well, you can't give up on studying okay? Studying is done with your butt (time spent sitting) not with your head.

532
00:40:48,024 --> 00:40:50,874
I will keep that in mind, Teacher!

533
00:40:50,874 --> 00:40:51,804
Let's go!

534
00:40:51,804 --> 00:40:53,854
Let's go guys!

Let's go!

536
00:40:57,994 --> 00:41:01,954
I was really surprised after seeing this past test's results.

537
00:41:01,954 --> 00:41:03,754
- Yoo Hye Jeong.
- Yes?

538
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:10,534
Did you do anything wrong? You did something hugely wrong, so think about what it could be.

539
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,264
I heard that the recent math test was really difficult.

540
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:15,224
Yes. It was hard.

541
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:18,014
Someone in our class placed first in math.

542
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:26,194
Yoo Hye Jeong. Did you still not figure out what you did wrong?

543
00:41:26,194 --> 00:41:27,434
No.

544
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:30,014
You did so well. That's what you did wrong.

545
00:41:30,014 --> 00:41:31,694
You're first place.

546
00:41:31,694 --> 00:41:34,634
What? Oh my gosh!

547
00:41:34,634 --> 00:41:37,074
Awesome! Hey!

548
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:48,004
Even when I heard it, I couldn't believe it; at first. Many people were suspicious

549
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:51,834
but I wasn't, because I've seen how you've been studying lately.

550
00:41:51,834 --> 00:41:53,814
Congratulations.

551
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,734
As expected, you need to be gifted with the ability to study well, too.

552
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:16,484
I heard that a girl in your class named Hye Jeong placed first in math.

553
00:42:16,484 --> 00:42:17,164
Yeah.

554
00:42:17,164 --> 00:42:20,144
Wasn't that the kid you tutored in math?

555
00:42:20,144 --> 00:42:21,084
That's right.

556
00:42:21,084 --> 00:42:24,994
You raised a lion. They say her IQ is 156!

557
00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:30,544
What did you score on this math test? You're the one who studies through the night while taking meds.

558
00:42:45,544 --> 00:42:46,634
Thank you.

559
00:42:46,634 --> 00:42:50,934
What are you thanking me for? It's the consequence of your own efforts.

560
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:55,584
Now that you've succeeded, are you here to ask me how to live differently?

561
00:42:55,584 --> 00:42:58,104
No, I've already lived differently.

562

563

00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:05,764
I'm preparing lesson plans for the second year's class.

565
00:43:05,764 --> 00:43:07,284
Us?

566
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:10,824
Yes. What's your blood type?

567
00:43:10,824 --> 00:43:12,214
I'm probably type O.

568
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:17,694
What do you mean "probably"? It's either you are or you aren't. Sit down.

569
00:43:19,894 --> 00:43:22,064
Sanitize the tip of your finger,

570
00:43:22,064 --> 00:43:26,834
draw a drop of your blood, and put it in these two places.

571
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:30,254
I'll teach you what your exact blood type is.

572
00:43:30,254 --> 00:43:31,904

Antibody A Antibody B

575
00:43:51,234 --> 00:43:53,484
You're type A.

576
00:43:53,484 --> 00:43:56,764
If it shows coagulation to the type A antibody, it's type A.

577
00:43:56,764 --> 00:44:01,104
Look here. Over here, it clumps together, but not here, right?

578
00:44:01,104 --> 00:44:06,674
Wow, you're right. Finding your blood type is simple.

579

Want to see your red blood cells?

♬You are my destiny ♬

612
00:46:37,584 --> 00:46:40,294
Hye Jeong

613
00:46:47,124 --> 00:46:49,374
Hello?

614
00:46:58,164 --> 00:47:00,714
Thank you, Teacher.

615
00:47:02,164 --> 00:47:03,454
This.

616
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:05,124
You don't have to give this to me.

617
00:47:05,124 --> 00:47:09,024
Now I don't need it anymore either. Like you said, I memorized everything.

618
00:47:09,024 --> 00:47:14,384
Thanks. I won't forget to repay you for the warmhearted kindness you showed me.

619
00:47:15,394 --> 00:47:18,484
Do you like our homeroom teach?

620
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:26,304
Why aren't you answering me? Let me rephrase the question. Does he like you?

621
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:30,954
I don't think you should put us in that category.

622
00:47:30,954 --> 00:47:35,654
Category? You know words like that, too?

623
00:47:35,654 --> 00:47:38,024
You lied to me, right?

624
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:38,904
About what?

625
00:47:38,904 --> 00:47:42,634
When you said you weren't good at studying, you fooled me, right?

626
00:47:42,634 --> 00:47:45,134
If not, there's no way that you could suddenly do so well.

627
00:47:45,134 --> 00:47:50,694
I've never lied to you. I've never studied before.

628
00:47:50,694 --> 00:47:53,794
In the end, you're saying that you're just smart.

629
00:47:55,724 --> 00:47:58,164
I don't know why you're so mad.

630
00:47:58,164 --> 00:48:02,594
Right. I don't know why I'm so mad, either.

631
00:48:21,454 --> 00:48:25,464
Hey. Do you know how to ride a bike?

632
00:48:29,504 --> 00:48:37,634
♫  I can't believe this moment ♫

633
00:48:37,634 --> 00:48:41,364
♫  One by one ♫

634
00:48:41,364 --> 00:48:43,544
Ready, set, go!

635
00:48:43,544 --> 00:48:48,604
It's dangerous!
♫  in front of my eyes ♫

636
00:48:48,604 --> 00:48:52,924
♫  The world you know ♫

637
00:48:52,924 --> 00:48:54,164
Do you want to win?

638
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,274
Yes!

639
00:48:55,274 --> 00:48:57,094
Then win!

640
00:48:58,654 --> 00:49:03,684
♫ Ah ♫

641
00:49:03,684 --> 00:49:07,664
♫  Wherever I am, ♫

642
00:49:07,664 --> 00:49:11,464
♫  I can't stop ♫

643
00:49:11,464 --> 00:49:14,994
♫  My thoughts ♫

644
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:20,044
Yoo Hye Jeong wins!
♫  can't be stopped, my heart won't be closed. ♫

645
00:49:20,044 --> 00:49:23,334
♫  Above all else ♫

646
00:49:23,334 --> 00:49:27,704
♫  I must not know ♫

647
00:49:27,704 --> 00:49:31,264
♫  Only you make me ♫

648
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:34,734
♫  forget ♫

649
00:49:34,734 --> 00:49:36,424
♫  everything ♫

650
00:49:36,424 --> 00:49:38,744
It's a sun-shower (rain that falls while the sun is shining).

651
00:49:40,674 --> 00:49:42,334
It looks like a scene from a movie.

652
00:49:49,664 --> 00:49:51,394
This.

653
00:49:53,234 --> 00:49:54,644
How did you...
(The Las)

654
00:49:54,644 --> 00:49:59,484
I've become close with the owner of the album store. He got it for me.

655
00:49:59,484 --> 00:50:02,804
I bought it with the money Grandma gave me for getting first place.

656
00:50:02,804 --> 00:50:06,564
Thank you. Ah, this girl's got a great sense.

657
00:50:08,414 --> 00:50:12,074
I... was really envious of you that day.

658
00:50:12,074 --> 00:50:14,204
If you're envious, you should do it too.

659
00:50:14,204 --> 00:50:20,574
To be a doctor, your grades have to be among the best in the nation. I was just lucky this time.

660
00:50:20,574 --> 00:50:26,924
That's true. Not everything works out just because you work hard. You were lucky.

661
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:38,044
When my mom was passing away, I was by her side.

662
00:50:38,044 --> 00:50:41,564
If I had been a doctor at that time, how nice would that have been?

663
00:50:42,674 --> 00:50:46,194
Then she could've lived, like that pregnant lady.

664
00:50:46,194 --> 00:50:50,194
Or if you had been by her side at that time, it would've been really nice.

665
00:50:53,524 --> 00:50:57,624
Even if the doctor's right by their side, people who die will die.

666
00:50:57,624 --> 00:51:02,874
With that logic, everyone would survive after coming back from the hospital.

667
00:51:02,874 --> 00:51:04,344
That's true.

668
00:51:13,294 --> 00:51:15,464
Oh, the rain stopped. Let's go. You'll be late for school.

669
00:51:15,464 --> 00:51:17,064
Yes.

670
00:51:28,634 --> 00:51:31,234
The two came to school together again.

671
00:51:31,234 --> 00:51:34,964
Their chemistry is no joke. Your homeroom teach and her,

672
00:51:34,964 --> 00:51:36,194
aren't they dating?

673
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:42,554
No, how can you imagine something like that? We're still in our teens. It's our most innocent time.

674
00:51:42,554 --> 00:51:45,454
Why are you denying something that you can see?

675
00:51:45,454 --> 00:51:50,164
We're in our teens. Biologically, we're the most perfect at this time.

676
00:51:54,434 --> 00:51:55,244
What are you doing?

677
00:51:55,244 --> 00:51:57,534
I'm going to post it on the message board.

678
00:51:58,944 --> 00:52:00,904
Confiscating for now.

679
00:52:02,944 --> 00:52:04,314
Hey!

680
00:52:05,774 --> 00:52:07,174
What brings you by all the way here?

681
00:52:07,174 --> 00:52:09,034
It's been decided.

682
00:52:09,034 --> 00:52:11,404
Am I going to the main hospital? Starting when?

683
00:52:11,404 --> 00:52:14,424
- Starting next month.
- That fast?

684
00:52:14,424 --> 00:52:20,424
Before you come, meet the people beforehand and make a favorable impression. Since I arranged everything for you, now it's all up to you.

685
00:52:20,424 --> 00:52:22,994
- Father!
- Hey, hey. What are you doing? It's unsightly!

686
00:52:22,994 --> 00:52:26,784
I will definitely succeed so that I won't be an embarrassment as your son!

687
00:52:26,784 --> 00:52:31,364
Let's have a fancy dinner tonight with your wife and Seo Woo, too.

688
00:52:31,364 --> 00:52:32,984
Yes.

689
00:52:35,954 --> 00:52:37,494
Punk...

690
00:52:53,964 --> 00:52:56,794
There's no end-of-day meeting for the class. You can send the kids home.

691
00:52:56,794 --> 00:53:02,824
Teacher, I heard a weird rumor. I came to confirm it.

692
00:53:02,824 --> 00:53:04,804
Ok, what is it?

693
00:53:05,674 --> 00:53:10,734
That you and Hye Jeong's relationship isn't ordinary.

694
00:53:12,884 --> 00:53:15,734
- Isn't it the rumor you started?
- Pardon?

695
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,864
What did you want to confirm by coming here with such a ridiculous statement?

696
00:53:18,864 --> 00:53:23,104
If you're feeling jealous towards her, then say so. I will understand.

697
00:53:23,104 --> 00:53:27,604
Why would I be jealous of someone like that? I have everything she doesn't have.

698
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:32,564
Right. As a punk who has everything, it's not just this one thing,

699
00:53:32,564 --> 00:53:37,974
but you even want the only thread that she has. Your greed is too extreme.

700
00:53:37,974 --> 00:53:39,834
- Who's side are you on?
- Aigoo.

701
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:42,574
Don't make me into a childish teacher who picks sides with his students.

702
00:53:42,574 --> 00:53:47,014
Send the kids home quickly and go home and study. Get into the college you're aiming for and fulfill your parents' expectations.

703
00:53:47,014 --> 00:53:52,254
Do you think my goal is to fulfill my parents' wishes? I'm not a machine!

704
00:53:52,254 --> 00:53:56,354
I have emotions, and those feelings are very hurt right now.

705
00:53:56,354 --> 00:53:58,724
I feel very bad and I'm in much pain.

706
00:53:58,724 --> 00:54:03,274
I'm hurting too. Everyone lives while hurting.

707
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:05,514
Do you know that?

708
00:54:05,514 --> 00:54:10,824
That you're always cold towards me, but when you look at her, you always smile?

709
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:27,644
Subj: Class 2-4 Teacher Hong Ji Hong and Yoo Hye Jeong.

710
00:54:27,644 --> 00:54:30,734
Sometimes there are realities that are hard to believe. It cannot be imagined....A teacher and student

711
00:54:32,724 --> 00:54:35,724
It's really something that's hard to imagine. The Hong Ji Hong that I trusted the most and followed...

712
00:54:40,904 --> 00:54:44,164
How can that really happen...

713
00:54:51,244 --> 00:54:56,944
In this world, there are unbelievable truths. It's really something that's hard to even imagine.

714
00:54:56,944 --> 00:55:04,634
A teacher and student. That the Teacher Hong Ji Hong whom I trusted the most and followed is the main character, I really can't believe it.

715
00:55:15,754 --> 00:55:18,224
Are you happy after doing that?

716
00:55:19,564 --> 00:55:22,264
Do my words not even seem like words to you?

717
00:55:23,664 --> 00:55:25,624
I asked, are you happy?

718
00:55:26,534 --> 00:55:31,154
Do whatever you want. It's the end for you and the homeroom teach now anyway.

719
00:55:33,324 --> 00:55:34,664
Exactly why are you doing this?

720
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,864
You're disgusting, so get lost.

721
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,554
Let's talk.

722
00:55:41,174 --> 00:55:45,124
Don't grab on to me. If you bother me anymore, I'll explode!

723
00:55:45,124 --> 00:55:49,214
What do you want me to do? What do I have to do? What do I have to do for you to take this back?

724
00:55:49,214 --> 00:55:52,224
I don't care what happens to me since I've always been at the bottom.

725
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:55,804
But Teacher Hong is different. You liked Teacher Hong too!

726
00:55:55,804 --> 00:56:03,234
You're not at the bottom yet. Since you have something to protect. Teacher Hong Ji Hong.

727
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:16,444
Hye Jeong!

728
00:56:20,084 --> 00:56:22,724
They said they might fire the homeroom teach.

729
00:56:22,724 --> 00:56:28,994
There's a school steering committee meeting tomorrow. And they say Seo Woo's mom is the chairwoman.

730
00:56:45,594 --> 00:56:47,834
Let's go!

731
00:56:47,834 --> 00:56:49,184
Wait a moment.

732
00:56:49,184 --> 00:56:52,054
Ah, it's okay. It's our hideout.

733
00:56:58,484 --> 00:57:01,914
Ah, it's here. It was right here!

734
00:57:01,914 --> 00:57:04,754
Got it.

735
00:57:06,974 --> 00:57:10,044
What did you need to say that we came all the way here to talk?

736
00:57:10,044 --> 00:57:14,014
It's a little creepy, but there's a thrill to it.

737
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:18,384
This isn't a dangerous place. I came with Mi Ra here last time.

738
00:57:18,384 --> 00:57:21,274
Mi Ra's mere existence is dangerous, don't you think?

739
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:32,204
You didn't say we were meeting Hye Jeong.

740
00:57:32,204 --> 00:57:36,514
Seo Woo, let's just talk first. If you talk, the misunderstanding will be cleared up.

741
00:57:36,514 --> 00:57:41,394
What kind of conversation can we have in this mess of a place? Unless you're threatening me.

742
00:57:41,394 --> 00:57:47,394
Hye Jeong, hurry and talk. I'm so cold.

743
00:57:53,634 --> 00:57:58,654
I'll do what you tell me to do, so say that you misunderstood on the community board.

744
00:57:58,654 --> 00:58:03,664
If I say it's not true now, how would that make me look? I can't stop it.

745
00:58:03,664 --> 00:58:10,974
Seo Woo, why are you like this? If you keep coming off like this, I also don't know what I'll do.

746
00:58:10,974 --> 00:58:15,354
Thank you for giving me information I can use to post again.

747
00:58:15,354 --> 00:58:17,764
I'm going to post what happened today as a follow-up.

748
00:58:17,764 --> 00:58:23,594
That you're a pathetic human being who's not only good at seducing men but uses her friends for her own agenda.

749
00:58:23,594 --> 00:58:28,394
Hey! You don't treat your friends properly either.

750
00:58:28,394 --> 00:58:31,314
Up until now you've never treated me as an equal.

751
00:58:31,314 --> 00:58:34,004
How can you be like this to me?

752
00:58:34,004 --> 00:58:37,194
If I didn't trust you as a friend, I wouldn't have followed you here.

753
00:58:37,194 --> 00:58:41,244
I'm like an accessory to you.

754
00:58:43,004 --> 00:58:48,934
It's all because of you. Before she met you, she wasn't like this.

755
00:58:48,934 --> 00:58:50,594
- Seo Woo.
- Let go.

756
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:52,204
Let go of me!

757
00:58:52,204 --> 00:58:54,544
Hye Jeong!

758
00:59:03,884 --> 00:59:05,434
Hey!

759
00:59:05,434 --> 00:59:07,694
Do you think I'm staying still because I don't know how to hit you?

760
00:59:07,694 --> 00:59:12,174
What are you going to do if not staying still? Are you going to beat me up?

761
00:59:12,184 --> 00:59:17,524
Do it. That's right, that's more like you. Do it the way you usually do it.

762
00:59:17,524 --> 00:59:20,174
Do it the way you usually do it! I said, do it the way you usually do it!

763
00:59:20,174 --> 00:59:24,504
- Seo Woo! What are you doing?
- Let go!

764
00:59:25,704 --> 00:59:27,694
Seo Woo!

765
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,254
It's a fire!

766
00:59:33,384 --> 00:59:38,444
Seo Woo! What do I do? What do I do?

767
00:59:40,534 --> 00:59:45,034
♫  I'm standing here out of it because of my hurt from the past  ♫

768
00:59:45,034 --> 00:59:48,914
Hye Jeong, we have to get out quickly!
♫ Though I say I'm lonely ♫

769
00:59:48,914 --> 00:59:53,574
Seo Woo! Get up! Seo Woo, we have to get out! Hurry and get up!

770
00:59:53,574 --> 00:59:55,584
Seo Woo!
♫ If what I've dreamed ♫

771
00:59:55,584 --> 00:59:59,314
Hye Jeong! Seo Woo, get up!
♫  if this way is correct. ♫

772
00:59:59,314 --> 01:00:02,674
♫  The nervous wreck I am,  ♫

773
01:00:02,674 --> 01:00:05,884
♫  looked back at myself  ♫
Seo Woo!

774
01:00:05,884 --> 01:00:07,064
Seo Woo!

775
01:00:08,124 --> 01:00:14,654
I took living differently lightly because of that one sweet moment of success I had experienced.

776
01:00:14,654 --> 01:00:19,324
It advertised the fact that the environment that was surrounding me was the same.

777
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:26,304
♫  You can be different from yesterday, don't think you're alone  ♫

778
01:00:26,304 --> 01:00:32,164
♫  The painful past memories aren't important now  ♫
