00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:59,083
If you are destined to meet someone, you will at some point.

6
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:02,933
The person I am destined to meet is here.

7
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:04,223
He's gravely injured.

8
00:01:04,223 --> 00:01:05,973
That way we can do the MRI, so prepare it right away!

9
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:07,773
Got it.

10
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:12,383
Here, doc.

11
00:01:12,383 --> 00:01:14,543
- Hurry and get ready please.
- Oh my god!

12
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:17,973
Who told you to stay here!

13
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,573
Where's the doctor?!

14
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:27,493
Doc, you're not coming?! Get yourself over here!

15
00:01:27,493 --> 00:01:30,693
Here, death is not a surprising thing at all.

16
00:01:30,693 --> 00:01:36,493
Though death should be a surprising thing everywhere,
(Yoo Hye Jeong)

17
00:01:36,493 --> 00:01:40,543
the person I am destined to meet is not surprised by death.

18
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:42,913
Where is the doctor, here?!

19
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:47,353
Hey! Punk! You can't even do that right?

20
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:53,703
Little bastard. Hyung-nim is talking, yet you don't even answer. Who are you to be yelling? Huh?

21
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:56,753
- Should I make your back to fold back and forth like an accordion?
- No.

22
00:01:56,813 --> 00:01:59,493
You're just displacing your anger from us to him, right?

23
00:01:59,493 --> 00:02:01,003
How... How... How can that be.

24
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:01,833
Clench your teeth.

25
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,573
- Pardon? What?
 - What is he going to do?

26
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:05,733
I told you to clench your molars.

27
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:11,683
What are you? A medic?

28
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:15,333
Can't you tell from looking at me? I'm a doctor.

29
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:26,673
This is a place where patients get treated. All of you non-patients, please get out.

30
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:30,103
Who are you to tell our Hyung-nim to do this or that?

31
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:32,163
I am the person who is going to treat him.

32
00:02:32,163 --> 00:02:35,393
I have an obligation to create the best possible environment for treatment.

33
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:38,333
I won't get treated by a woman.

34
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:40,673
Get a man here.

35
00:02:40,673 --> 00:02:42,953
Do you see me as a woman?

36
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:46,613
I see you, sir, as a patient, just like everyone else over there.

37
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:51,163
Leave. Don't obstruct us while we diagnose and treat the other patients. This person, this one, that one and that one.

38
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:53,633
This woman, the more I try to put up with her...

39
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:56,533
Hey, go stand outside.

40
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,953
Yes, Hyung-nim. Hey

41
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:00,093
Just go.

42
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:03,813
Doctor, just go and stand there.

43
00:03:08,943 --> 00:03:11,373
We don't go easy just because you're a woman.

44
00:03:11,373 --> 00:03:14,803
Would it be less embarrassing, that you got beaten up by a woman?

45
00:03:35,153 --> 00:03:37,933
- Get out of the way!
- Whoa!

46
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:51,153
I'm sorry. I will treat all the places where you got injured.

47
00:03:53,903 --> 00:03:56,483
Hyung-nim! Aigoo! Hyung-nim! Hyung-nim!

48
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:58,543
Are you alright? Hyungnim!

49
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:02,963
Hurry and get out. Are you going to leave him to die?

50
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:08,103
Fine. Do as you please, doc.

51
00:04:08,103 --> 00:04:14,053
However, if anything goes wrong for our Hyung-nim, you'll die, too.

52
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:17,463
Let's get started, then.

53
00:04:20,463 --> 00:04:26,933

♫  What do you really want  ♫
(Shin Hae Chul - "What Do You Really Want")

56
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:46,563
♫  What do you really want  ♫

57
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:51,313
- Take those out.
♫  What do you really want  ♫
- Aren't you going to hurry and take them out?

58
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:54,823
You punk, really.
♫  What do you really want  ♫

59
00:04:58,353 --> 00:05:03,783
What kind of student are you? Didn't I tell you to sit on your knees?

60
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:07,873
What are you looking at? This is my last present for you.

61
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:10,813
What I really wanted to do was to expel you from school, and that would be right,

62
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:15,283
but I thinking of your father who begs night and day for trash like you,

63
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:19,583
I am stopping here. Get out.

64
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:35,463
Stop right there. You're walking out without saying goodbye?

65
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:41,383
Live healthy until you smear your own poop on the walls (until you're senile).

66
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,703
You punk, really.

67
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:46,533
I am not a student here anymore.

68
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:53,453
I guarantee you, you'll be eating prison food in a year. Got it?

69
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:57,283
You should still be careful out at night,

70
00:05:57,283 --> 00:06:02,523
because no matter how healthy you are, some people die in accidents in one blow.

71
00:06:02,523 --> 00:06:04,743
You're a devil.

72
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:20,253
Hey Yoo Hye—

73
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:25,293
You're not going to get in?

74
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:26,273
You go first.

75
00:06:26,273 --> 00:06:27,053
Get in.

76
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,033
I told you to go first.

77
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:30,473
Until when are you going to continue living like this?

78
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:35,363
Until when do you think I can continue to have your back?

79
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:38,423
Others would think that you're quite a wonderful dad.

80
00:06:38,423 --> 00:06:42,003
Coming to school pleading and begging in front of teachers,

81
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:45,533
you're comforting yourself thinking you're being a good dad aren't you?

82
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:12,973
How are you going to live from now on?

83
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:14,913
I'm going to go all out.

84
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:18,293
You brat, I'm talking to you nicely and...

85
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:36,313
What are you looking at? Who are you looking at with that kind of gaze?

86
00:07:36,313 --> 00:07:39,503
Do you know how hard you're making things for everyone?

87
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:42,263
Do you know? You really!

88
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:48,223
Why not just kill me, like how you killed Mom?

89
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,783
If you kill me, everything is clean. You'll feel relieved!

90
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:55,383
Why don't you even cry?

91
00:07:55,383 --> 00:07:57,723
Because my heart is already dead.

92
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:18,313
Grandma's Rice Stew

93
00:08:21,213 --> 00:08:23,453
We are at Grandma's house.

94
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:34,493
What do you expect me to do in this hillbilly town?

95
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,793
Now this is the end for you and I.

96
00:08:36,793 --> 00:08:42,213
The day that woman came to our house was already the end for us.

97
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:45,273
How can you address your stepmom as "that woman"?!

98
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:48,843
Because you act like that, your stepmom is scared of you.

99
00:08:58,053 --> 00:09:00,053
Don't come to me ever again.

100
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:08,733
You're going to live all relieved after giving me this money? I won't let you do that!

101
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:11,003
Really!

102
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,513
I held back a lot.

103
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:22,963
I was wondering when you would... when you would abandon me.

104
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:27,233
It seems like today is the day.

105
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:33,823
Mom...

106
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:02,993
What are you doing? Why didn't you come in if you're here?

107
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,113
I was going to go in.

108
00:10:06,113 --> 00:10:08,073
What about your dad?

109
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:11,413
He left.

110
00:10:12,803 --> 00:10:15,313
Such a great thing to do when you're raising a kid.

111
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:20,833
You came all the way here, but how can you just go without saying hello to your mom or eating?

112
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:25,643
What will the kid learn from your actions then? You, ignorant son of a bi*ch.

113
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:27,193
Give it to me.

114
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,773
Let go. I can do it.

115
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:32,433
I'm stronger than you are. Go inside.

116
00:10:37,993 --> 00:10:40,313
You're starting school tomorrow, right?

117
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:41,713
Don't talk about school.

118
00:10:41,713 --> 00:10:44,303
A student should be talking about school. Why not talk about school?

119
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:47,543
I'll get straight to the point. If you make trouble like you did in Seoul—

120
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:52,763
You're going to kick me out? I know, even if don't say it. I'm used to being abandoned, so don't threaten me like that.

121
00:10:52,763 --> 00:10:55,353
Where did this girl learn to bluff like that?

122
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:58,833
I never in my whole life have seen nor heard anyone saying that they are used to being abandoned.

123
00:11:01,123 --> 00:11:02,933
Can I eat more food?

124
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:07,273
No! Why are you asking that? Just say you need me to get you more.

125
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,023
I won't kick you out.

126
00:11:12,023 --> 00:11:15,983
No matter what bad thing you do, I won't chase you out. So just don't say you're going to leave.

127
00:11:17,763 --> 00:11:21,513
I would've been touched if I was just three years younger.

128
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:24,673
Why is this young girl so complicated?

129
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:29,653
- Talk like that only in front of me. Don't talk like that out in public.
- Why?

130
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:35,093
You'll seem like you didn't grow up with the proper safeguards. Then people will look down on you.

131
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:40,343
I've already got all the right conditions for people to look down on me. I like starting out by being stepped on.

132
00:11:40,343 --> 00:11:44,133
What good is that? You should hide what you should hide.

133
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:48,583
If I get caught hiding something, then they really take me for granted. If I have nothing to be ashamed of, then no one can trample over me.

134
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:53,953
That's true. I'm the type to reveal things from the get-go, and not one to hide them.

135
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:57,583
This is my first time seeing an adult saying my words are right.

136
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:03,973
Who have you been with all this time? You have to meet the right people.

137
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:08,093
I hope you meet a good teacher.

138
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:14,173
Where is there a good teacher? I haven't seen one in my ten years of student life. Nor can there be one either.

139
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,103
Good morning.

140
00:12:21,103 --> 00:12:24,423
Ah, hello teacher! Good morning!

141
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:26,003
Hello.

142
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:30,793
Hello

143
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,353
- Yeah.
- Hello

144
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:34,443
Follow me, Jin Seo Woo.

145
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:38,883
You'll get minus one point!

146
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,703
I'm going, I said!

147
00:12:40,703 --> 00:12:45,053
Aren't you going to run to catch up, Jin Seo Woo?

148
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:48,033
- Hurry up! Run!
- Come on!

149
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,123
Hurry up and run.

150
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,493
Here. Put this in the science room.

151
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:03,743
Why do you ask only me to do these favors?

152
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:07,663
- Just—
- Just. You know well!

153
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:12,103
That, "just, just, just." So annoying!

154
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:15,893
Hey, it must be heavy! Give me your bag.

155
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:20,853
- Hey, that too. Give me that.
- It's fine. Really.

156
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:26,173
Ah, really. I'm not someone who deserves to be treated in this manner, you know?

157
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:28,633
Hong "Just" is the only one who treats me this way.

158
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:31,593
Isn't it because he doesn't know that your father's a hospital chairman?

159
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:35,193
Why wouldn't he? My mom frequents the principal's office so much.

160
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:37,993
That's true. My father says that, too.

161
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:42,183
By the way, he said it's not good when the other kids' parents come visit.

162
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:45,283
But he says it's good if your mom comes often.

163
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,583
He says that she always buys something when she comes. She has good manners, so he likes it very much.

164
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:54,043
Why don't you have have a good sense about things. Do you think that talk will comfort me in this situation?

165
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:55,493
Sorry.

166
00:13:55,493 --> 00:13:57,503
- Go to the classroom.
- I'll go with you.

167
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:03,883
Go first. What would Hong Just think when he sees you carrying my bag to the science room? Think while living.

168
00:14:05,263 --> 00:14:09,223
Ah... Let's... I can go with you...

169
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,633
You come over here!

170
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:18,633
Hey. Hey!

171
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:19,403
Stop it!

172
00:14:19,403 --> 00:14:20,783
What's wrong with you!

173
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:22,183
I said for you to leave.

174
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:24,883
Have a seat, you over there.

175
00:14:24,883 --> 00:14:27,023
Sit down!

176
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:34,263
Now. Is the classroom a gym? What's with your uniforms?

177
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:37,243
I told you that your outer appearance determines your inner appearance. I told you, right?

178
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:41,163
It doesn't matter how other people look at me. With a mindset like this

179
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:44,443
it's the same thing as giving up on having social skills.

180
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,853
- Attention.
- We'll bypass that today.

181
00:14:57,743 --> 00:15:00,183
- You put on makeup.
- I didn't.

182
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:05,803
Your makeup is all cracked. If you're going to use foundation, then you can at least use the right shade.

183
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:09,793
- I said I didn't.
- She says she didn't.

184
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:13,553
One moment.

185
00:15:15,953 --> 00:15:23,053
You didn't do it. If you can't hide it perfectly, then don't lie. Aigoo. Throw this away.

186
00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:28,663
Now, it'll be your midterms not long from now.

187
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:31,623
Ah...

188
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:34,483
Being good at studying is also a talent.

189
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:37,993
Don't make your own life harder by torturing yourself setting ridiculously high goals if you can't study.

190
00:15:37,993 --> 00:15:42,553
Since you guys are in the second form (2nd year of high school), start thinking about what you will do with your lives now.

191
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:46,273
Don't waste time slamming your heads into the books in frustration. Do you understand?

192
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:49,283
- Yes.
- Open your books.

193
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,153
Aren't you going to school?

194
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:16,043
A transfer student can go later. Isn't that right, lettuce?

195
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:19,703
If you sleep more, school will be over by the time you arrive.

196
00:16:22,323 --> 00:16:26,203
- Give me money.
- You're spewing nonsense.

197
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:28,483
Are you going somewhere? Why are you changing clothes?

198
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:32,883
I should go to school with you. What do you think of this? Does it look respectful?

199
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:36,553
It sucks. I can go alone.

200
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:41,083
Ah, really. I said I can go alone.

201
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,923
Can you go in your plain clothes without wearing your uniform?

202
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:46,373
It's not like I'm going to take classes. I can wear my regular clothes. Have I transferred schools only once or twice?

203
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,723
Is having transferred multiple time something to brag about, you b****?

204
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:54,543
Don't curse. If you don't see me as precious, Grandma, then who would?

205
00:16:54,543 --> 00:16:56,463
I understand.

206
00:16:57,543 --> 00:17:00,343
Are you really not giving me money? I need to buy my uniform.

207
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:05,873
Then you really have to go. Buy it right after you finish registering.

208
00:17:05,873 --> 00:17:07,663
You can't spend it on anything else.

209
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:10,393
Don't worry about useless things.

210
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:18,543
Coming... Get out of the way.

211
00:17:18,543 --> 00:17:24,163
- Goodbye!
- Okay.
- Goodbye!

212
00:17:27,023 --> 00:17:30,793
- Seo Woo!
- O-Oh, hello!

213
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:35,863
- You go first.
- Can't I go to your house to hang out?

214
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:38,693
No, my tutor is coming.

215
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:44,723
- Go first.
- Uh... Okay. Call me!

216
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:47,963
Ah! Our Cheon Soon Hee! Schmoon Hee! Look at your pretty hair.

217
00:17:47,963 --> 00:17:50,633
- Where did you get it?
- It's so pretty.

218
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:54,983
Me too me too! Lets go buy spicy rice cakes!

219
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:02,563
It seems like your homeroom teacher goes home first.

220
00:18:02,563 --> 00:18:06,273
He came out before you. I didn't act like I recognized him.

221
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:10,363
Why would you pretend to know him? There are no practical benefits for me.

222
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:13,643
That's why I didn't.

223
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:17,103
What would he do when he lives alone and gets off work early?

224
00:18:17,103 --> 00:18:21,913
He does a lot of things. For example, he likes music so he goes to music stores to buy albums.

225
00:18:21,913 --> 00:18:26,193
How do you know that? Do you like him?

226
00:18:26,193 --> 00:18:28,393
No. Just.

227
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:32,543
Is he not making you guys study so he can have hobbies?

228
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:36,773
Only your class doesn't have evening study right? Why is that?

229
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:41,413
- Just.
- Stop saying just. It makes you look deficient.

230
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:47,033
Do you even know how hard I worked to get you into that class because he went to Seoul National University College of Medicine?

231
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:48,953
Was his educational background made up?

232
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:52,223
- It's not like that.
- I know that too.

233
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:54,963
I found out his graduating class year and looked into it.

234
00:18:54,963 --> 00:19:00,833
The world is quite unfair. Why are people like him coming out of Seoul National University College of Medicine? For no reason.

235
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,593
If that opportunity was given to your dad, he could have flown.

236
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,433
Don't tell Dad that.

237
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:09,873
That's his complex, so why would I?

238
00:19:09,873 --> 00:19:13,363
You need to relieve your dad's regret.

239
00:19:13,363 --> 00:19:16,633
You need to go to Seoul National University no matter what.

240
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,383
Is Seoul National University a dog's name?

241
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:23,023
Why are you so crabby?

242
00:19:23,023 --> 00:19:25,503
Mom!

243
00:19:29,593 --> 00:19:31,443
If you're going to be like this, don't come to pick me up!

244
00:19:31,443 --> 00:19:35,513
The car in front is at fault! It stopped suddenly!

245
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:46,053
♫ I'm ♫
(Pink - "Get the Party Started")

246
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:48,753
- Excuse me?
- Yes?
♫ Coming out so you better get this party started ♫

247
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:53,963
Do you have The La's "There She Goes" album?
♫ I'm coming out so ♫

248
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:58,373
We don't have The La's, but we do have Sixpence.
♫ you better get this party started. Get this party started ♫

249
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:01,143
Ah, but I really want to listen to that.
♫ on a Saturday night ♫

250
00:20:01,143 --> 00:20:05,673
We don't have that in stock right now, customer. It's hard to get that right now.
♫ Everybody's waiting for me to arrive. Sending out the ♫

251
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:08,073
It's hardly printed any more.
♫ message to all of my friends ♫

252
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:13,293
- Student! I need to speak with you.
- I'm not a student.

253
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:15,423
- Let me see your bag.
- Why my bag?

254
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,713
If you're curious then you'll know when you give it to me.

255
00:20:22,293 --> 00:20:25,283
Such BS now that I'm on my unlucky streak.

256
00:20:26,353 --> 00:20:29,093
What are you doing? Where are you touching?

257
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:31,303
You, come here and do a body search of her for me.

258
00:20:31,303 --> 00:20:32,493
Okay.

259
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:36,613
I swear today I will catch someone in the act. You all think that I'm some kind of doormat.

260
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:39,733
There are so many stores. Why do you always come to my store to steal?

261
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:42,513
- Chief.
- Yes.

262
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:46,733
I don't know if it's impolite for me to butt in here.

263
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:50,713
But she said herself that she didn't steal.

264
00:20:50,713 --> 00:20:54,493
This won't do. Ahjussi, let's go to the police station.

265
00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:58,293
I was going to tolerate it, you know. I said let's go to the police station!

266
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:02,483
For accusing an innocent person of theft, a bad person like you should do some jail time.

267
00:21:02,483 --> 00:21:04,443
Come on we're going!

268
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:09,183
Why don't you stop here? If she did steal something, would she be this confident?

269
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:12,603
Teach, it's because you don't know the kids these days.

270
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:15,793
I live with the kids every day, so how would I not know?

271
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:18,723
I said I am not a student. Why are you being like this?

272
00:21:18,723 --> 00:21:21,463
Are even your ears defective now?

273
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:24,723
I don't need apologies, because you're just a sack of bad luck.

274
00:21:26,373 --> 00:21:29,633
This thief girl... Eat well and live well.

275
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:34,313
Wow, such a rude, crazy girl. There were definitely 7 CDs on that shelf.

276
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:55,623
Are you happy?

277
00:21:58,513 --> 00:21:59,693
Are you talking to me?

278
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,713
Do you feel like you've got the whole world?

279
00:22:01,713 --> 00:22:05,143
Stealing, lying, and embarrassing someone who believed you.

280
00:22:05,143 --> 00:22:08,343
If you have something to say, say it clearly. Don't beat around and around around the bush in circles.

281
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:10,983
The reason I didn't expose you earlier is because you're a student.

282
00:22:10,983 --> 00:22:12,273
I told you I'm not a student.

283
00:22:12,273 --> 00:22:14,953
Your pretending to be an adult is awkward. Your lies are awkward too.

284
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:17,243
It shows on your face that you're lying.

285
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:20,343
Because you're clumsy, I'm giving you a chance. If you were an adult, I wouldn't have let it slide.

286
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:23,993
If you're going to let it slide, why not let it slide completely. Why are you like this now?

287
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:28,273
- Just because.
- Just because?

288
00:22:28,273 --> 00:22:31,013
Just because? Ahjussi are you in love with me? Did you fall in love at first sight?

289
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:33,143
Do you have Lolita complex?

290
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:39,683
"Just because" is something that is said between lovers, when they do something illogical.

291
00:22:39,683 --> 00:22:40,723
You're quite smart.

292
00:22:40,723 --> 00:22:44,453
If you want to use this as an excuse to do anything to me, get lost.

293
00:22:44,453 --> 00:22:46,683
Do not cast your pearls before swine. (Bible, Matthew 7:6)

294
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:49,293
That's my word of advice. The phrase "just because"

295
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:54,883
is an expression to show off my sterling qualities to someone who cannot even understand a bit. Is that good?

296
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:56,923
- Fine.
- Wow.

297
00:22:56,923 --> 00:23:01,863
I hate going to the police station or the court, but I have to go today because of you.

298
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:04,563
Do you have evidence that I stole something?

299
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:29,423
Aw, this is embarrassing. This is a dirty feeling.

300
00:23:29,423 --> 00:23:33,403
You're full of charms. Let's date!

301
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:35,483
Pardon?

302
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:39,833
You're not a high school student, so there's no reason not to. Let's date.

303
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,293
Don't come any closer.

304
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:45,853
This is the first time a woman has treated me so aggressively. Wow, I feel so attracted.

305
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:49,143
Let's not stand here like this and go somewhere for a cup of te—

306
00:23:49,143 --> 00:23:51,013
Oh my god, this ajusshi's crazy!

307
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,883
How can I love without going crazy?

308
00:23:54,913 --> 00:23:57,743
You want to wear handcuffs? I'm a high school stu—

309
00:23:57,743 --> 00:24:02,263
So you are a high school student. Next, you said you didn't steal.

310
00:24:02,263 --> 00:24:06,713
- It's here. Do you acknowledge this?
- Acknowledged.

311
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:09,593
In the midst of all this, I like where it's going. Very simple.

312
00:24:09,593 --> 00:24:14,513
Now, what are you going to do? Go to the police station or go back inside and apologize?

313
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:22,153
Ahjussi,

314
00:24:23,453 --> 00:24:25,843
have this and piss off.

315
00:24:36,663 --> 00:24:38,233
I'm dumbstruck.

316
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:47,513
Isn't bloodline such a fascinating thing?

317
00:24:47,513 --> 00:24:51,773
Even with a man that you've lived with for tens of years, you feel unfamiliar if you split and meet again.

318
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:54,583
It's different with children.

319
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:58,503
Even after ten years living apart from each other, my child still feels like my own flesh.

320
00:24:58,503 --> 00:25:01,793
She feels like a part of me. That's why it hurts so.

321
00:25:05,283 --> 00:25:09,053
I need to go to the hospital, but I never seem to be able to.

322
00:25:09,053 --> 00:25:11,683
Teacher Hong should be here now.

323
00:25:17,343 --> 00:25:19,553
Ahjussi, I would like to ask for directions.

324
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:22,463
You should not ask me and go.

325
00:25:22,463 --> 00:25:26,473
- I feel embarrassed for you. Do you call that humor?
- Is today your day off?

326
00:25:26,473 --> 00:25:28,443
You left your phone and came out, right?

327
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:31,103
I like you going around without your phone,

328
00:25:31,103 --> 00:25:34,193
because I can do surprises like this.

329
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:36,223
- What are you doing?
- To get off on this side.

330
00:25:36,223 --> 00:25:37,223
Why?

331
00:25:37,223 --> 00:25:39,763
It's far! The way to meet you, I mean.

332
00:25:39,763 --> 00:25:41,753
Goosebumps! (He has goosebumps because it's so cheesy.)

333
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:45,653
Since you're a second-year resident you've got a lot of spare time. It must be great.

334
00:25:45,653 --> 00:25:49,003
Do you think I'd feel better than you who ran away without even completing your intern year?

335
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:51,243
Why are you looking at me like this? It's scary.

336
00:25:51,243 --> 00:25:53,613
I haven't decided whether to take it as a joke or a truth.

337
00:25:53,613 --> 00:25:55,803
I'll switch the topic for you.

338
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:57,653
The hospital chairman's surgery is today.

339
00:25:57,653 --> 00:26:01,743
Who are you selling drugs to? I just called Dad this morning, and he didn't say anything.

340
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:04,373
That's because you don't like going to hospitals.

341
00:26:05,713 --> 00:26:06,813
What's the name of the illness?

342
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:10,483
Vestibular schwannoma. (Benign tumor on acoustic nerve.) They'll perform radiosurgery. It's simple.

343
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:14,453
- Don't apply "simple" to the patient's guardian.
- What're you doing?

344
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:16,083
I need to go in your car quickly.

345
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:19,983
- We can go after eating, dropping our things at Granny's and telling her you're going to Seoul.
- Hey

346
00:26:19,983 --> 00:26:21,423
We don't have the time.

347
00:26:21,423 --> 00:26:22,803
There is time.

348
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:26,763
Grandma is going to misunderstand. You keep going in and out. She'll think we have some sort of relationship.

349
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:30,773
There is. I told you already, let's get married.

350
00:26:30,773 --> 00:26:32,523
Marriage is after dating.

351
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:35,023
It's the same as if we dated.

352
00:26:35,023 --> 00:26:38,303
Six years of medical school. Eight months of internship. What more do I need to know?

353
00:26:38,303 --> 00:26:42,463
It's annoying. Let's just get married right away. Okay? Okay.

354
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:45,323
Why are you asking a question and answering it yourself?

355
00:26:45,323 --> 00:26:47,773
Because you don't accommodate me.

356
00:26:48,713 --> 00:26:52,403
- No, I have to bike there. Come quickly.
- What?

357
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:56,593
♫  Just one ten minute, the time needed for you to be mine  ♫
(Lee Hyori - Ten Minutes)

358
00:26:56,593 --> 00:27:01,713
♫  The men crying because they’ve been deceived by my innocent tricks  ♫

359
00:27:01,713 --> 00:27:06,693
Caller - Princess 8
♫ Baby you’re being shaken by a different charm ♫

360
00:27:07,523 --> 00:27:10,693
Lee Hyori wore this! Do you think it'll look good on me?

361
00:27:10,693 --> 00:27:14,393
Hey hey! Stop it! Is that all? It sucks.

362
00:27:14,393 --> 00:27:16,723
Wait for me!
♫  Where I'm by myself ♫

363
00:27:16,723 --> 00:27:23,333
♫ Among the people dancing, there was you and your girl. ♫

364
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:28,603
She's still not picking up?

365
00:27:28,603 --> 00:27:31,663
No matter how she runs, it's the palm of my hand.

366
00:27:31,663 --> 00:27:34,523
I told her we're here and to come to the biggest shopping mall.

367
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:37,343
She's not even picking up your call. Would she come because you asked?

368
00:27:37,343 --> 00:27:39,183
What are we going to do?

369
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:42,273
Well, there are only a few places you can play here.

370
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:43,733
Let's go.

371
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:51,053
- What. There's nothing.
- What is this?

372
00:27:51,793 --> 00:27:55,003
Hey! Hey! Go easy, it'll break.

373
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:59,133
Guys, how do I look?

374
00:28:01,603 --> 00:28:02,823
You're doing a lot.

375
00:28:02,823 --> 00:28:06,313
That's what I'm saying. Hey you come here.

376
00:28:10,463 --> 00:28:13,193
Hey, what are you guys?

377
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:19,073
Where did you hide it? Does it make sense that the youngest of a rich family goes around without her wallet?

378
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:22,573
Didn't you say we're going to the night club together?

379
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:27,633
Hey! Are we crazy, going to a night club with the principal's daughter?

380
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:29,223
Just hurry and give us the money.

381
00:28:29,223 --> 00:28:32,033
- I don't have it.
- What do you mean you don't?

382
00:28:33,163 --> 00:28:36,073
Gosh!

383
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:38,383
That's the wallet my mom holds most precious!

384
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,943
Oh, aigoo... Aigoo, you're so cute.

385
00:28:40,943 --> 00:28:43,113
If you come out you're dead!

386
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,023
Get out.

387
00:28:51,003 --> 00:28:54,013
Where do you think you are to yell, hey?

388
00:28:54,013 --> 00:28:56,463
You want to get beaten up until your stomach explodes?

389
00:28:59,663 --> 00:29:01,633
You're seriously is asking for it.

390
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:07,673
Who are you? Which school do you go to?

391
00:29:07,673 --> 00:29:10,833
Do I look like a student in your eyes?

392
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:13,923
Like being old is something to brag about.

393
00:29:19,363 --> 00:29:21,463
This seriously.

394
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:23,143
Hey you—

395
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:26,043
Hey you! seriously.

396
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:32,923
Get lost.

397
00:29:32,923 --> 00:29:34,513
Let's go.

398
00:29:34,513 --> 00:29:36,173
I'm not in good condition today,

399
00:29:36,173 --> 00:29:38,153
so I'm just leaving, but hey!

400
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:40,563
Next time we'll fight you right.

401
00:29:40,563 --> 00:29:43,933
Why would I ever see you again?

402
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:53,323
What should I do? Unni!

403
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:57,373
Thank you.

404
00:29:58,513 --> 00:30:00,913
Well, um—
♫ Today when I saw you ♫
(D'Sound - "Do I Need a Reason")

405
00:30:00,913 --> 00:30:02,043
♫ I knew it was just like  ♫

406
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:04,103
The wallet...
♫ the first time ♫

407
00:30:05,623 --> 00:30:08,563
Normally you should pay 10% to the person who found the wallet.

408
00:30:08,563 --> 00:30:12,403
Since I returned to you what was stolen, you should give at least half of these, no?
♫ When you met my eyes I came close ♫

409
00:30:13,253 --> 00:30:17,093
Hey Unni. Just take it all.
♫  the first time ♫

410
00:30:17,093 --> 00:30:22,803
I can call you Unni, right? My name is Yoo Ra. What's your name, Unni?
♫ To hold back my fear / and feel you so near I've never been ♫

411
00:30:22,803 --> 00:30:26,883
- Are you an outcast? I can tell just by the way you're acting.
- Pardon?
♫ I've never been this far before ♫

412
00:30:26,883 --> 00:30:32,813
You want to give me money and cling to me, right? I hate it the most when someone tries to do that.
♫ To hold back my fear and feel you so near ♫

413
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:37,673
Unni, take it all. You rescued me.
♫I'm scared of falling into deep this time ♫

414
00:30:37,673 --> 00:30:42,313
If it was like in the movies. The man would come and tightly rescue the woman, then
♫ Do I need a reason to tell you why I'm singing you this song ♫

415
00:30:42,313 --> 00:30:45,343
they fall in love!!!
♫ Do I need a reason to show you that ♫

416
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:49,583
You're so dumb and so hungry for affection.
♫ I know where I belong whenever I am weary I lean on ♫

417
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:54,743
Unni. Oh, Oh. Unni, wait a moment! Unni, Unni! Unni!
♫ this feeling that I have I am so much stronger now ♫

418
00:30:54,743 --> 00:30:56,463
Unni, then at least take my money.

419
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:58,723
Don't follow me!
♫ thankful, yes I am ♫

420
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,433
Unni!

421
00:31:10,893 --> 00:31:12,443
Let's go in together after parking.

422
00:31:12,443 --> 00:31:14,883
That's why I said we should've left quickly. They must already be in surgery.

423
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:17,763
I didn't know there'd be so much traffic.

424
00:31:39,293 --> 00:31:41,953
Congratulations on your first day as an intern.

425
00:31:41,953 --> 00:31:44,113
Thank you and I congratulate you, too.

426
00:31:44,113 --> 00:31:46,543
For having fulfilled your dream of having the same profession as your son.

427
00:31:46,543 --> 00:31:48,633
Do you know this?

428
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:52,963
That I loved you from the first day I met you.

429
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:05,663
Gosh, I knew it would be like this.

430
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:14,033
Guk Il Medical Center

431
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:17,333
We're going in one more time, Hospital Chairman

432
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,623
Is this the last one?

433
00:32:19,623 --> 00:32:22,053
Yes, Hospital Chairman.

434
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:28,613
It's perfect, right?

435
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,933
Bring that film to my room later.

436
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:33,703
Review it later.

437
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:36,563
I'm not dead yet.

438
00:32:42,613 --> 00:32:43,953
Oh, you came.

439
00:32:43,953 --> 00:32:45,493
Did the surgery go well?

440
00:32:45,493 --> 00:32:49,193
We should continue to keep on eye on the area, but it looks good for now.

441
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:51,203
So, is Seo Woo doing well?

442
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:54,733
She's someone who gets her work done smartly and sharply. So there's nothing to worry about.

443
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:56,333
Would've been nice if she had been a boy.

444
00:32:56,333 --> 00:33:00,743
She'll be worth ten sons, so wait and see. How much longer must I stay in the countryside?

445
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:03,533
Just wait a little longer.

446
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:09,103
When Chairman Hong's condition is stabilized, I'll discuss with him your living arrangements and the agenda regarding hospital management.

447
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:11,203
You're partners on the same level. Why are you so watchful of Chairman Hong?

448
00:33:11,203 --> 00:33:13,373
We put in a different amount of startup funds when we first started.

449
00:33:13,373 --> 00:33:16,053
Besides, he developed the hospital this much as a renowned neurosurgeon.

450
00:33:16,053 --> 00:33:17,483
I should give credit where credit is due.

451
00:33:17,483 --> 00:33:20,193
What about me? You should give me some credit, too.

452
00:33:20,193 --> 00:33:24,163
I grew the surgical department at the Guk Il Medical Center in Namyangju, 150%.

453
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:26,863
They seem to think it's because you performed many procedures that are not covered by insurance.

454
00:33:26,863 --> 00:33:29,603
Chairman Hong lacks a business mind.

455
00:33:29,603 --> 00:33:32,373
Also, you graduated from a university in the outer-provinces (not in Seoul).

456
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:36,643
If only you had graduated from Seoul National University, it would be easier for me to support you.

457
00:33:36,643 --> 00:33:40,343
In this hospital, the departments rule. There's no particularly powerful figure to follow.

458
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:42,963
Since it's not a university hospital, no single university can dominate.

459
00:33:42,963 --> 00:33:45,073
But still... Seoul National University is different.

460
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:48,323
But I have business capabilities.

461
00:33:48,323 --> 00:33:51,453
You should be capable as a doctor. How can you be evaluated as a businessman? Are we in the US?

462
00:33:51,453 --> 00:33:54,393
Then, must I rot there for the rest of my life?

463
00:33:55,683 --> 00:34:02,463
Hey, what do you mean rot there? This hospital will be ours in the end anyway.

464
00:34:02,463 --> 00:34:04,883
Chairman Hong doesn't have any kids.

465
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:06,003
He has an adopted son.

466
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:10,803
There are no blood ties. The relationship can end any day. Just wait and see.

467
00:34:20,463 --> 00:34:22,253
Yes.

468
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:27,523
I call a foul.

469
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,533
In Joo must've told you. I didn't tell you because I didn't want to worry you.

470
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:34,733
Of course, I'd worry. I'm your son. Look at this.

471
00:34:36,203 --> 00:34:41,153
Hong Doo Sik. Guardian and son, Hong Ji Hong.

472
00:34:41,153 --> 00:34:44,563
Stop it... I'm getting goosebumps.

473
00:34:44,563 --> 00:34:48,673
Aish really! Doesn't this hospital have problems?

474
00:34:48,673 --> 00:34:51,213
How can they perform surgery without guardian consent?

475
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:53,263
Tae Ho signed it.

476
00:34:53,263 --> 00:34:57,003
Geez, that Dr. Kim Tae Ho. I should put him away for official document forgery.

477
00:34:57,003 --> 00:35:00,073
Oh come on, I am to blame.

478
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:02,513
You have family. Why did you go into surgery alone?

479
00:35:02,513 --> 00:35:06,623
I got it. I won't do it again.

480
00:35:06,623 --> 00:35:10,673
I'll let you off this time, since I have a great personality and am generous. This is the only time, Father.

481
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:13,293
Okay, I understand.

482
00:35:16,213 --> 00:35:20,673
Beautiful ladies and gentlemen, I welcome you to our club!

483
00:35:20,673 --> 00:35:23,513
Let's all have a great night!

484
00:35:23,513 --> 00:35:26,573
Let's get going! Are you all ready?

485
00:35:27,373 --> 00:35:31,693
Are you all ready? Let's go! C'mon! 
(Koyote - "Naive")

486
00:35:31,693 --> 00:35:33,453
C'mon!

487
00:35:33,453 --> 00:35:35,613
C'mon!

Yo, yo, yo!

Go baby, go baby, go!

490
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:44,713
Ha!

491
00:35:44,713 --> 00:35:45,733
Where's Oppa Soo Cheol?

492
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:51,103
I think he has a new girlfriend. How about me?

493
00:35:51,103 --> 00:35:55,843
Don't make me laugh. Where is she? The b**** who's got her hands on someone else's man?

494
00:35:57,283 --> 00:35:58,213
Give up on me.

495
00:35:58,213 --> 00:36:00,733
I said I don't play with high schoolers.
♬ You're the only one I loved.♬

496
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:05,433
Who are you trying to fool? I know that you're a high schooler, too.
♬ The fact was that I was lacking, to me like a fool  ♬

497
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:08,013
I have quite an instinct.
♬To me, to me it can be done. ♬

498
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:12,633
♬ Even if we die, we will be together forever. ♬

499
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:15,803
So, I'm coming in.
♬  We will die together ♬

500
00:36:17,963 --> 00:36:19,023
♬ As the tears flow. ♬

501
00:36:19,023 --> 00:36:23,643
How dare you bluff? Do I look like some kind of lowly thing to you?
♬I'll make a vow. ♬

502
00:36:23,663 --> 00:36:27,623
♬  I don't need anything. Find your happiness when you leave me.♬

♬  and done what I can ♬

505
00:36:31,613 --> 00:36:34,573
Except for my girl. ♬ Reconsider if you are this to me ♬

506
00:36:34,573 --> 00:36:41,343
Not bad. Should I let you hit me once? Then would you be my girl?
♬ It won't do. I can't live without you.  ♬

507
00:36:41,343 --> 00:36:45,213
♬ Please help me.♬

508

♬  Should I convince you again? ♬

♬ I didn't have to do that but my last shred of pride was broken. ♬

511
00:36:58,323 --> 00:36:59,503
♬  Seeing you ♬

512
00:36:59,503 --> 00:37:00,323
What's wrong with you?!

513
00:37:00,323 --> 00:37:03,003
You're getting in my way! Move!
♬It is leaving you in ______ ♬

514
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:06,113
How dare you ask me to move!
♬ You heard the words you were being left ♬

515
00:37:08,473 --> 00:37:09,993
Did you just hit one of my underlings?
♬  The words that you are sorry ♬

516
00:37:09,993 --> 00:37:11,543
Yeah, I did.
♬I didn't believe♬

517
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:16,073
You barged into our territory without notifying us!
♬ we would be together while you fooled me ♬

518
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:20,493
It's Hye Jeong!
♬ with your one-sided talk ♬

Stop right there.

I'll see you guys later.

That's Hye Jeong?
 ♬ Your lie ♬

What? You know her, too?
♬ that you loved me ♬

523
00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:34,813
Yoo Hye Jeong is still going strong. It's only been a day since you transferred. You sure make yourself known.
♬  Up to now ♬

524
00:37:34,813 --> 00:37:39,683
Come back to Seoul. You should go through your termination ritual before you leave.
♬ Up to the end I who was fooled believed you but ♬

525

♬  Even my last hope ♬

♬  You who are once again drunk♬

528

I let you skip your initiation ritual—
♬ found you, with your arms around her ♬

529
00:37:53,553 --> 00:37:57,833
I see that you're still talking big before the fight. That's how you always get beat up.
♬ The tears falling do ♬

530
00:37:57,833 --> 00:38:03,753

Can you beat me?

Come on then. Everyone, come on then.
♬ I thought I'd forgotten you. ♬

Ah! Why didn't you change out of your scrubs?

562
00:40:27,153 --> 00:40:31,123
I have another surgery in 40 minutes. I came out for a moment, just to see you.

563
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:36,913
Thank you for my father. I am indebted to you, Professor.

564
00:40:36,913 --> 00:40:40,713
That's not needed. Just don't give your father a hard time.

565
00:40:40,713 --> 00:40:42,073
Why? Did father say something?

566
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:48,013
He's not the type to say things. He's probably waiting for you to make your own decision. When are you going to come back?

567
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:49,743
I like being a teacher.

568
00:40:49,743 --> 00:40:54,983
Don't you have any desire for power? Shouldn't you take responsibility for this hospital?

569
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:57,173
Well my father is here anyway.

570
00:40:58,063 --> 00:41:01,563
When you get older, your body can start controlling your mind.

571
00:41:01,563 --> 00:41:04,883
With Vice Chairman Jin at the center, the power structure of the hospital is shifting.

572
00:41:04,883 --> 00:41:07,643
Even his son from the regional branch is dropping by constantly. What do you think that means?

573
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:10,793
It's better for the hospital that the power structure is shifting.

574
00:41:10,793 --> 00:41:15,953
A person who takes power needs to have a wide range of experience to have a mature attitude towards having power, profes—

575
00:41:15,953 --> 00:41:19,993
This guy, he's totally into being a teacher!

576
00:41:19,993 --> 00:41:22,453
Even if a person is bad, as long as they have a wide range of experiences, then it's okay?

577
00:41:22,453 --> 00:41:25,263
Can you really say a person is either good or evil?

578
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:27,373
Then life would be easy.

579
00:41:27,373 --> 00:41:29,833
Why are you thinking so complicated?

580
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:32,823
It's not complicated. I'm just telling you the reality.

581
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,213
What reality is it that you are talking about?

582
00:41:35,213 --> 00:41:37,493
To eat and live well.

583
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:41,043
Excuse me for a second.

584
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:45,433

586
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:52,753
Don't try to act cute.

591
00:42:17,573 --> 00:42:19,363

00:42:27,153 --> 00:42:30,723
You've worked hard. Please have these drinks.

595
00:42:30,723 --> 00:42:33,623
I'm the homeroom teacher for those two.

596
00:42:33,623 --> 00:42:37,973
A parent came for one student, and only they are left.

597
00:43:10,603 --> 00:43:12,483
Have you eaten?

598
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:19,453
It's hot!

599
00:43:19,453 --> 00:43:24,023
You're eating so well. How can you eat right now?

600
00:43:24,023 --> 00:43:26,853
We're forcing ourselves to eat because you told us to, Teach.

601
00:43:26,853 --> 00:43:30,913
What I hate the most is violence. Why would you do such things?

602
00:43:30,913 --> 00:43:33,333
Next time, don't get caught after a fight.

603
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:34,893
This guy is really strange.

604
00:43:34,893 --> 00:43:38,103
Really, you should tell us not to fight, not to avoid getting caught, right?

605
00:43:38,103 --> 00:43:41,463
If I tell you not to fight, would you listen to me?

606
00:43:41,463 --> 00:43:44,233
If you don't get caught, then it's just a personal problem. Otherwise, it becomes a problem for society.

607
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:50,113
If you become a problem for society, you guys don't have adults to protect you. Do I have to explain all that?

608
00:43:50,113 --> 00:43:53,463
I won't tell you to study, just show up to school.

609
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:56,733
- Ahjumma.
- Yes

610
00:43:58,333 --> 00:43:59,633
Here, 10,000 won.

611
00:43:59,633 --> 00:44:02,443
Thank you.

612
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:09,733
Hey, you wanted to know about this, right? Eat and go.

613
00:44:15,373 --> 00:44:16,233
Kim Soo Hee
016-635-5389

614
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:18,943
Who's "Kim Soo Hee"?

615
00:44:18,943 --> 00:44:20,673
My mom.

616
00:44:35,983 --> 00:44:37,623
Granny!

617
00:44:37,623 --> 00:44:40,373
- You're coming home now?
- Yes.

618
00:44:40,373 --> 00:44:41,863
Why are you out?

619
00:44:41,863 --> 00:44:43,863
Because my granddaughter isn't home yet.

620
00:44:43,863 --> 00:44:47,233
I told you that my granddaughter will be living with me, right?

621
00:44:47,233 --> 00:44:48,513
Ah, yes.

622
00:45:01,773 --> 00:45:03,773
Hye Jeong

623
00:45:03,773 --> 00:45:05,623
Go. It's my grandma.

624
00:45:05,623 --> 00:45:07,073
Hello, Grandma.

625
00:45:07,073 --> 00:45:09,523
Who is that helmet head?

626
00:45:17,493 --> 00:45:18,983
What are you wearing?

627
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,903
Why are you out here?

628
00:45:23,413 --> 00:45:26,483
I came out... because you were so late coming home.

629
00:45:26,483 --> 00:45:31,653
Say hello. He's a teacher, who lives behind us. He teaches at your school.

630
00:45:34,603 --> 00:45:36,273
Hello.

631
00:45:36,273 --> 00:45:38,823
What happened to that tough attitude from earlier?

632
00:45:40,153 --> 00:45:42,133
Did you two meet at school?

633
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:44,903
No, we met at the music store.

634
00:45:44,903 --> 00:45:47,573
This kid was stealing!

635
00:45:47,573 --> 00:45:53,253
No way! Teacher Hong, you must have seen wrong. My kid isn't like that.

636
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:55,073
Did you really?

637
00:45:55,073 --> 00:45:57,743
No, I'm seeing him for the first time.

638
00:45:57,743 --> 00:46:00,973
Hey! Look at you lying without even batting an eye.

639
00:46:00,973 --> 00:46:03,753
Of course, a kid who steals, won't they also lie?

640
00:46:03,753 --> 00:46:06,353
You're being too harsh, Teacher Hong!

641
00:46:06,353 --> 00:46:09,313
My kid said she didn't do it. She said she is seeing you for the first time, Teacher Hong.

642
00:46:09,313 --> 00:46:10,663
She will never do anything like that.

643
00:46:10,663 --> 00:46:13,993
Everyone thinks their kids don't do such things.

644
00:46:13,993 --> 00:46:16,083
Please see the reality clearly, okay?

645
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:19,633
If you continue to deny it, you'll only ruin your kid in the end.

646
00:46:19,633 --> 00:46:23,713
Just because you're a teacher, you think it's right to talk to your elders this way?

647
00:46:23,713 --> 00:46:27,943
Who are the kids learning from? The kids these days all look similar.

648
00:46:27,943 --> 00:46:32,813
You should believe her when she said no. How can you get married if you are that suspicious?

649
00:46:32,813 --> 00:46:34,713
Why are you talking about me getting married anyway?

650
00:46:34,713 --> 00:46:38,813
Because I feel like it! You go inside. You shouldn't listen to this dirty talk.

651
00:46:46,693 --> 00:46:48,713
I guess I am wrong.

652
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:55,943
Don't pay any mind to such talk and don't get upset either. Have you eaten?

653
00:46:55,943 --> 00:46:58,193
Do you know what time it is? Like carrots of course (carrots sounds like of course). I ate.

654
00:46:58,193 --> 00:47:01,883
Is eating out the same as eating a home-cooked meal? Sit down. I'll get your food ready.

655
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:05,103
That's okay. I had no luck today.

656
00:47:05,103 --> 00:47:07,943
Out of all the houses, why does the teacher have to live in Grandma's house?

657
00:47:07,943 --> 00:47:12,833
Hey! Do you know how hard I'm trying to hold myself back?

658
00:47:14,323 --> 00:47:16,533
What happened to the clothes you were wearing when you left?

659
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:17,673
They are in here.

660
00:47:17,673 --> 00:47:19,443
Did you buy your school uniform?

661
00:47:19,443 --> 00:47:23,793
No, I didn't buy it. I'm not going to school, so why do I need it?

662
00:47:23,793 --> 00:47:25,433
What did you do, if you didn't go to school?

663
00:47:25,433 --> 00:47:26,563
This and that.

664
00:47:26,563 --> 00:47:30,613
Then what will you do in the future if you won't be going to school?

665
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:34,943
I'll do what you used to do, selling liquor and my body.

666
00:47:38,183 --> 00:47:41,273
Do you have any idea what selling liquor and your body is like?

667
00:47:41,273 --> 00:47:45,743
You have a long, bright future ahead. Why are talking crap like that?

668
00:47:45,743 --> 00:47:48,903
Do you think I asked you to live with me, so I can see you living like that?

669
00:47:48,903 --> 00:47:52,043
Are you living with me because you want to? You just received me because I was abandoned!

670
00:47:52,043 --> 00:47:58,393
That's not true! I said I wanted you to live with me and told them to send you here!

671
00:47:58,393 --> 00:48:03,293
I told them I'd do a better job feeding and clothing you than they would!

672
00:48:03,293 --> 00:48:06,933
Even after losing her mother, because she was a mother,

673
00:48:06,933 --> 00:48:10,193
she foolishly followed a man, quitting university, severing her contacts with her parents

674
00:48:10,193 --> 00:48:15,313
and then had her husband stolen by another woman, and finally lost her sanity. Your poor utterly foolish mother–

675
00:48:15,313 --> 00:48:17,283
Don't talk carelessly about my mom.

676
00:48:17,283 --> 00:48:20,543
You also shouldn't just say whatever comes to your mouth.

677
00:48:20,543 --> 00:48:22,773
Because you weren't raised as precious,

678
00:48:22,773 --> 00:48:28,313
I thought it would make a difference if I started now.

679
00:48:28,313 --> 00:48:33,273
I'm over sixty now. Do you know how hard it is to change your personality after sixty?

680
00:48:33,273 --> 00:48:35,533
I'm doing it right now because of you!

681
00:48:35,533 --> 00:48:37,403
Why are you trying to change your personality because of me?

682
00:48:37,403 --> 00:48:39,243
- Are you asking because you don't know?
- I am asking because I don't know.

683
00:48:39,243 --> 00:48:42,243
If you don't know that, you're not human.

684
00:48:42,243 --> 00:48:44,693
If you don't go to school, I have more money and that's great.

685
00:48:44,693 --> 00:48:49,503
Its not even my life. You keep saying that you want to drag your life through the gutters who am I to stop you!

686
00:48:49,503 --> 00:48:51,823
Then it's good for both of us!

687
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:10,143
Don't live your life like that. Even thugs don't snitch on each other.

688
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:14,083
Hey, you saw me correctly. Yeah, I'm a thug.

689
00:49:14,973 --> 00:49:21,063
I can say I've gone through enough varied teachers throughout my lifetime, but you're a new breed of a teacher.

690
00:49:21,063 --> 00:49:23,803
Alright, I'll take it as a compliment.

691
00:49:25,103 --> 00:49:27,203
Why? Are you going to hit me?

692
00:49:28,023 --> 00:49:30,213
Am I a gangster to beat someone who's done nothing?

693
00:49:30,213 --> 00:49:32,943
Then why did you hit me this afternoon, when I wasn't doing anything?

694
00:49:34,613 --> 00:49:36,913
I hold grudges for a long time.

695
00:49:36,913 --> 00:49:42,313
I wouldn't have tattled on you if you hadn't hit me before.

696
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,653
Anyway, I really hate violence.

697
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:50,513
If you can only be careful of that, then we won't have problems living in this house together.

698
00:50:01,513 --> 00:50:03,183
We've got a problem.

699
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:40,053
It wasn't right to hit her.

700
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:50,683
I'm sorry I hit you. It's because your grandma wasn't properly educated.

701
00:50:50,683 --> 00:50:56,703
I wasn't taught well, so if I'm mad, all I know how to do is to hit and curse.

702
00:51:06,223 --> 00:51:11,233
I was scared so I couldn't ask, in case you said you really did steal it.

703
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:13,323
While you grew like this,

704
00:51:13,323 --> 00:51:15,793
I couldn't do anything, as your grandmother.

705
00:51:17,593 --> 00:51:20,613
You have to go to school,

706
00:51:20,613 --> 00:51:24,963
so that you don't become someone who hits like me when you're mad,

707
00:51:24,963 --> 00:51:29,513
but rather become a good person. A commendable person.

708
00:51:51,033 --> 00:51:53,413
I'm sorry.

709
00:51:53,413 --> 00:51:55,603
I'm sorry Grandma.

710
00:52:32,703 --> 00:52:34,653
Madame Curie

711
00:52:35,863 --> 00:52:38,243
Good memories.

712
00:52:38,243 --> 00:52:41,793
I also have good memories.

713
00:52:41,793 --> 00:52:45,213
After meeting Grandma, those memories have resurfaced.

714
00:52:47,483 --> 00:52:49,803
I knew then.

715
00:52:49,803 --> 00:52:54,343
When good memories and a good person come to me at the same time,

716
00:52:54,343 --> 00:52:57,813
I have thoughts of becoming a better person.

717
00:52:57,823 --> 00:53:04,153
♫  One by one, they start to bloom  ♫

718
00:53:04,153 --> 00:53:04,863
♫  It starts to appear  ♫

719
00:53:04,863 --> 00:53:09,143
♫  In front of my eyes  ♫

720
00:53:09,143 --> 00:53:14,973
♫  an amazing world that you are, is waving at me  ♫

721
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:41,913
Aish!

722
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:44,583
Why are you like this?

723
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:46,763
You should work if you won't go to school.

724
00:53:46,763 --> 00:53:48,823
Come out. Lets go to the market.

725
00:53:51,653 --> 00:53:53,293
Hello.

726
00:53:58,573 --> 00:53:59,753
Are you going to the market?

727
00:53:59,753 --> 00:54:01,263
Yes.

728
00:54:01,263 --> 00:54:02,773
She's not going to go to school.

729
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:04,193
I'm going to teach her business.

730
00:54:04,193 --> 00:54:08,313
You thought well. Granny, I knew you were the best!

731
00:54:10,143 --> 00:54:12,013
I made you breakfast, so eat before you leave.

732
00:54:12,013 --> 00:54:12,643
Okay!

733
00:54:12,643 --> 00:54:14,223
We take boarders

734
00:54:25,903 --> 00:54:26,783
What should I give you?

735
00:54:26,783 --> 00:54:28,973
Give me two of those ten tongue fish tied up there.

736
00:54:28,973 --> 00:54:30,463
You are going to make a seasoned tongue fish dish?

737
00:54:30,463 --> 00:54:33,003
I should visit you later to eat lunch.

738
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,693
Don't say empty words and really come by to eat.

739
00:54:35,693 --> 00:54:36,513
Here.

740
00:54:36,513 --> 00:54:40,923
Give it to her. She's my granddaughter. She will start doing business with me.

741
00:54:40,923 --> 00:54:43,843
Aiyoo, granny you'll be less overworked now.

742
00:54:46,813 --> 00:54:48,873
One, two, three.

743
00:54:54,593 --> 00:54:57,643
Hurry up! We have to open for business!

744
00:55:02,073 --> 00:55:03,653
Grandma!

745
00:55:04,823 --> 00:55:08,023
If I go to school, will you be happy?

746
00:55:08,023 --> 00:55:08,943
Yes.

747
00:55:08,943 --> 00:55:11,913
The thing that I hate the most is causing others harm.

748
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:15,313
No matter if you're my grandma, let's calculate what we need to calculate.

749
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:19,063
- What are you talking about?
- You said you'll continue to put in effort to change your personality for me,

750
00:55:19,063 --> 00:55:22,403
so I will do what you'd like for just that amount.

751
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:25,463
Crazy b****. I mean, aigoo pretty

752
00:55:25,463 --> 00:55:29,213
No no. Aigoo, my pretty child.

753
00:55:29,213 --> 00:55:31,233
Aigoo my precious child.

754
00:55:32,233 --> 00:55:36,383
I want to go to school. Carry all of this, okay Grandma?

755
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:51,183
Good morning, sir

756
00:55:51,813 --> 00:55:53,673
Look Teacher Hong!

757
00:55:53,673 --> 00:55:54,853
Oh, hello

758
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:58,663
I was going to tell you this yesterday, but you left early so I couldn't.

759
00:55:58,663 --> 00:56:00,403
This is a transfer student.

760
00:56:03,773 --> 00:56:05,973
Teacher, I can't accept this student.

761
00:56:05,973 --> 00:56:07,713
- What if you can't accept her?
- Send her to another class.

762
00:56:07,713 --> 00:56:10,783
They all said that they can't, so she has been assigned to your class.

763
00:56:10,783 --> 00:56:13,513
I can't do it either.

764
00:56:13,513 --> 00:56:17,463
Hey, give me that and stay outside, so I can speak with this teacher.

765
00:56:22,133 --> 00:56:24,893
Staff Room

766
00:56:24,893 --> 00:56:27,473
Since there are a few students that I have to pay close attention to

767
00:56:27,473 --> 00:56:29,473
it would be really difficult for me to accommodate her too.

768
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:33,983
So, what I'm saying is that you should focus on all of them since you already have to do so.

769
00:56:33,983 --> 00:56:37,263
Choi Mi Ra, in your class, and the kids who hang around her,

770
00:56:37,263 --> 00:56:39,683
have been caught after going to a night club, right?

771
00:56:42,543 --> 00:56:44,413
Are you going to bring this to a meeting?

772
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:48,283
I am someone who doesn't want to create a big problem.

773
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:52,573
Let's have you discipline them and wrap it up, okay?

774
00:56:52,573 --> 00:56:54,253
Thank you, Teacher.

775
00:56:54,253 --> 00:56:55,873
But,

776
00:56:55,873 --> 00:56:59,043
I really can't have her assigned to me.

777
00:56:59,043 --> 00:57:01,363
Oh, seriously...

778
00:57:11,903 --> 00:57:14,773
Let's go inside. It's homeroom time.

779
00:57:28,683 --> 00:57:30,073
Everyone...

780
00:57:30,793 --> 00:57:33,273
Hey, hey...

781
00:57:34,683 --> 00:57:37,473
Attention! Salute!

782
00:57:37,473 --> 00:57:39,303
Hello!

783
00:57:39,303 --> 00:57:41,103
Yes, hello.

784
00:57:41,103 --> 00:57:44,473
I am about to introduce a new friend to you.

785
00:57:44,473 --> 00:57:48,993
She transferred to our school from Seoul. Next time, you do it yourself.

786
00:57:50,173 --> 00:57:52,203
I am Yoo Hye Jeong.

787
00:58:00,923 --> 00:58:02,573
And that is the end.

788
00:58:03,533 --> 00:58:05,033
It's very brief.

789
00:58:05,913 --> 00:58:08,413
That end seat is empty, so sit there for now.

790
00:58:08,413 --> 00:58:11,443
And next month, let's change it when we switch the seating arrangement.

791
00:58:30,593 --> 00:58:32,283
And also,

792
00:58:32,283 --> 00:58:36,883
you guys, the three of you... There was a shameful event yesterday, right?

793
00:58:36,883 --> 00:58:39,443
All of you, get up. Go to the science room.

794
00:58:43,233 --> 00:58:45,603
This is unfair. Why are we the only ones going?

795
00:58:45,603 --> 00:58:47,793
What? Then, who else should go?

796
00:58:47,793 --> 00:58:49,443
Her.

797
00:58:50,523 --> 00:58:52,383
She started it first.

798
00:58:52,383 --> 00:58:54,093
Yoo Hye Jeong started it first.

799
00:58:54,093 --> 00:58:56,203
This is unfair!

800
00:59:02,003 --> 00:59:04,693
You, go outside together with them.

801
00:59:13,093 --> 00:59:17,173
Now, midterms are one week away.

802
00:59:17,173 --> 00:59:20,563
Gosh...

803
00:59:23,203 --> 00:59:27,153
Hey, how did you not get caught?

804
00:59:33,593 --> 00:59:35,213
Sit down.

805
00:59:36,633 --> 00:59:40,903
For a week, you will not go inside the classroom and you will write a letter of apology here.

806
00:59:40,903 --> 00:59:42,263
You understand?

807
00:59:42,263 --> 00:59:43,933
Yes!

808
00:59:45,703 --> 00:59:48,343
Why isn't there a reply from you?

809
00:59:48,343 --> 00:59:51,423
I just want to get hit instead.

810
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:55,053
Instead of continuously writing a letter of apology, I want to get it done in one shot.

811
00:59:55,813 --> 00:59:57,393
Just...

812
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:03,293
She's really asking for it. Do I have to push or be pushed?

813
01:00:03,293 --> 01:00:06,023
I have no reason to write a letter of apology.

814
01:00:06,023 --> 01:00:08,903
What happened yesterday was before I became a student here.

815
01:00:08,903 --> 01:00:12,463
But why do I have to get punished at this school? On top of that, I didn't get caught.

816
01:00:12,463 --> 01:00:16,403
Fine, I will do what you want. First of all, you guys go outside.

817
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:32,533
You... are doing this on purpose because you know I don't like violence, right?

818
01:00:32,533 --> 01:00:33,733
There is that reason too.

819
01:00:33,733 --> 01:00:37,143
Wow, look at this girl... Stand up and turn around.

820
01:00:42,713 --> 01:00:45,833
For something I don't like to do,

821
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:49,253
I'll show you how well I can do it.

822
01:00:50,923 --> 01:00:56,143
Whether it was good or ill-fated relationship, when I first met you,

823
01:00:56,143 --> 01:01:00,613
No one knows what kind of face you'll be greeted with.
