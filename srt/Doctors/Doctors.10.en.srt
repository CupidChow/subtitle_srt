00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:27,723
Episode 10

2
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:31,483
A genuine meeting can change a person.

3
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:38,503
The person I am with right now could alter my life.

4
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:45,393
That is the reason why while someone is hope for someone, she may be despair for another.

5
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:50,903
Do I trust you? I do as a doctor.

6
00:00:50,903 --> 00:00:53,433
Should I bow to show my thanks?

7
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:56,793
But I don't trust you as a patient's guardian.

8
00:00:56,793 --> 00:01:02,623
If something goes wrong during the surgery... I am going to kill you.

9
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:07,643
My fortune says that I'll live long, until I splatter poop on the walls. ( Korean idiom for senile dementia)

10
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:10,193
Kind of.

11
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:12,643
I really hated you, doctor.

12
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:17,123
I'm someone who's scared of gangsters and though you're not a gangster, I don't think you're quite easy either.

13
00:01:17,123 --> 00:01:20,133
But I think I like you today.

14
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:22,973
- Is that a compliment?
- It's a compliment.

15
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:26,573
We're rivals with one woman between us.

16
00:01:26,573 --> 00:01:30,453
Are you saying that you're going to eat at the cafeteria with Hye Jeong?

17
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:32,023
We'll eat together soon.

18
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:35,003
You have to eat together, to say that we're rivals.

19
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,323
He's rubbing salt on the wound.

20
00:02:15,393 --> 00:02:18,443
You still come in suddenly.

21
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:21,693
Your hand is really big.

22
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:23,303
Is it?

23
00:02:25,873 --> 00:02:31,663
♫ The first time I saw you ♫

24
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:37,633
I could absorb your head.
♫ You seemed as anxious as a child ♫

25
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:39,093
Why?

26
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,063
Just because.

27
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:46,193
♫ Did you know I never expected we would be in love ♫

28
00:02:46,193 --> 00:02:49,273
♫ I miss you ♫

29
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:52,813
Let's walk.
♫ I love you ♫

30
00:02:54,163 --> 00:03:00,013
♫ You are my entire life, you are the reason I live ♫

31
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:07,093
You really did well today.
♫ A miracle that I can't explain ♫

32
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:15,703
♫ If love is needing my comfort ♫

33
00:03:15,703 --> 00:03:20,953
♫ Take another step closer ♫

34
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:26,083
What's all this?

35
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,323
Give them to Dr.Hong.

36
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:32,193
I prepared this with a heart of a mother-in-law.

37
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:34,473
Health food that's good for the body. Ginseng chicken soup!

38
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:35,593
You're really...

39
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:39,203
Really amazing?

40
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:42,023
But this isn't free.

41
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:42,893
Bi Yeong Gook?

42
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:45,333
Correct!

43
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,673
What do you want me to do about it?

44
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:52,103
You don't need to do anything, just send him to the restaurant. Then I'll take care of everything!

45
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:56,543
- Ahh, this is good!
- Isn't it?

46
00:03:56,543 --> 00:04:00,343
You're really making me do all kinds of things.

47
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:02,873
My pretty baby!

48
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:06,643
How could you know my heart so well?

49
00:04:06,643 --> 00:04:10,103
Teach Hong, isn't only your teacher.

50
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:15,493
He was my homeroom teacher. Once a teacher, always a teacher!

51
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:18,463
Let's get married.

52
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:21,043
I thought that was for real.

53
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:25,523
- It's obviously a lie.
- Don't eat.
- I'll eat well. I'll eat well.

54
00:04:33,043 --> 00:04:35,213
Yoo Hye Jeong

55
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:37,203
Hey, Hye Jeong.

56
00:04:38,823 --> 00:04:43,493
Really? I'll tell you that pass code, so go in first.

57
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:51,403
Hm?

58
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:53,343
Hello.

59
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:57,153
When are you eating with me?

60
00:04:57,153 --> 00:04:59,863
- Pardon?
- You can't even remember?

61
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:05,403
We said we'd eat together at the cafeteria that time. How long has it been since that time that we still haven't eaten?

62
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:08,123
Do you want to get lunch later?

63
00:05:08,123 --> 00:05:09,833
Great!

64
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,093
Why are you laughing?

65
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:16,093
You are just funny.

66
00:05:26,513 --> 00:05:28,693
Don't overreact, heart.

67
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:44,583
What are you doing?

68
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:51,633
Leave it there! It looks messy but everything has an order!

69
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,643
Did you wait long?

70
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:06,033
No. Did you have breakfast yet?

71
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,023
Not yet. What is this?

72
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:09,553
Soon Hee said to bring it to you.

73
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:12,003
Soon Hee did? But you didn't want to?

74
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:14,183
I wanted to bring it to you.

75
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:17,393
We didn't make this though. We bought it and warmed it.

76
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:19,223
You had this kind of side too?

77
00:06:19,223 --> 00:06:24,763
Yes, I have this kind of side to me too. I guess you didn't know since you only saw me from time to time.

78
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:29,283
Eat the soup first, then the meat.

79
00:06:29,283 --> 00:06:31,353
Okay.

80
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:36,643
Ouch! It's hot.

81
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:42,553
I'm going in as an assistant for Chairman's surgery.

82
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:47,933
I know. Did you find Grandma's anesthesia records?

83
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:51,213
How can he care for me during all this?

84
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:58,383
You're not answering again.

85
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:01,933
- They said they destroy medical files that are over 10 years old.
- So?

86
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:06,003
The resident who wrote on my grandmother's surgical records, is still at the branch hospital, as a department chief.

87
00:07:06,003 --> 00:07:08,673
I'm to be told by him about it.

88
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:15,033
How are you so certain that there was medical malpractice for Granny?

89
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:20,313
It was a cancer that hadn't spread. The rate of being cured was high as long as the surgery was successful.

90
00:07:20,313 --> 00:07:22,313
On top of that, it was a table death.

91
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:26,993
I found out later, but table death rarely occurs for gastric cancer.

92
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:28,753
And your parents?

93
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:33,103
I think they came to a settlement; they covered it up quickly.

94
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:41,273
Can't we do that task together?

95
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,533
Take care of yourself too.
You can't.

96
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:48,213
You're stern.

97
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:51,433
- How many hours do you sleep in a day?
- I sleep a lot.

98
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:55,803
You should give me an exact estimate, not some roundabout answer.

99
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:59,713
I sleep for 5 hours for sure. There are days that I run around all day too.

100
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,243
Are you able to think about multiple things at a time?

101
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:09,153
Yeah, I'm definitely not the type to focus all of my energy onto one thing, like you.

102
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:15,193
I see. Then are you happy?

103
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:18,893
I am happy.

104
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:20,903
How are you sure of your happiness?

105
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:26,853
I'm alive. I have someone I like and we're eating together. That's happiness to me.

106
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:34,323
You're a really good man and seem like a strong person.

107
00:08:34,323 --> 00:08:37,463
What's up with you? You've got something. What is it?

108
00:08:39,983 --> 00:08:41,873
Doctor Jeong Yoon Do

109
00:08:41,873 --> 00:08:45,463
It's Doctor Jeong Yoon Do. I have to get ready for the Chariman's surgery.

110
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:47,763
Eat all of this.

111
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:51,263
Yes, Doctor.

112
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:11,233
- Chairman Hong Doo Sik was the one who accessed the records of Patient Kang Mal Soon.
- Are you sure?

113
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:15,443
Since the person accessed it using Chairman Hong's code, whoever accessed it

114
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:18,333
- has a connection to him.
- Ch

115
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:22,573
And, the vice-president didn't go to his home.

116
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:23,453
Then where did he go?

117
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:27,713
The car is still at the hospital, but I don't know where the Chairman is.

118
00:09:27,713 --> 00:09:31,613
What is he up to now? Look for him.

119
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,223
Yes.

120
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:42,223
How far will Hong Doo Sik follow me?

121
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:44,583
Neurosurgeon Hong Ji Hong

122
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:50,123
Surgical Record
Patient: Kang Mal Soon
Stomach Cancer
Assistant: Kim Chi Hyeon

123
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:03,743
This is Dr. Hong Ji Hong on staff in the neurosurgery department at the branch hospital.

124
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:07,453
Would I be able to speak with Department Chief, Kim Chi Hyeon, please?

125
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:14,803
Neurosurgical ICU

126
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:15,983
Do you have something you have to check?

127
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,653
It's nothing.

128
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,163
What is she planning? Is this a chance for me?

129
00:10:24,163 --> 00:10:28,223
Whatever. I have to be on the lookout to catch something so that I can have one up on her,

130
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,343
because you never know.

131
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,013
Are there any VIP patients that were admitted to our department?

132
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:36,543
VIP patients won't even show up on our searches.

133
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:40,253
Stop wasting time searching and just order yourself some fried chicken.

134
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:44,593
This rascal, wasting time? You're acting arrogant just because Yoo Hye Jeong has your back.

135
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:49,663
Huh? I didn't even hit you yet! How dare you fake your reactions?

136
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:52,273
That rascal, what should I do with him?

137
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,733
How do you feel?

138
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,693
What's there to feel? I'm just about to receive surgery.

139
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:12,323
You don't have to pretend to be brave in front of me.

140
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:16,533
I'm getting even braver since I'm in front of you.

141
00:11:22,553 --> 00:11:23,713
What?

142
00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:27,353
I'm looking at you because there's no where else to look.

143
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:32,463
You don't know how safe I feel because you're here.

144
00:11:33,513 --> 00:11:36,673
I guess this is why they say you need children.

145
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:41,953
They're going to come to do exams on you. I'm going to go do my rounds.

146
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:44,323
Alright, I'll see you again later.

147
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:45,693
Yes.

148
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:51,493
Why were you running?

149
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:53,233
To come here quickly.

150
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:57,343
I'm fine—

151
00:12:00,523 --> 00:12:03,973
That's why you should have stayed still. This happened because you tried to avoid me.

152
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,533
It's embarrassing.

153
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:07,613
Colleagues can do this, what's there to be embarrassed about?

154
00:12:07,613 --> 00:12:10,333
I find you coming in at me like that uncomfortable.

155
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,133
It makes me feel as if we're close.

156
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:14,033
Are we not allowed to become close?

157
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,513
Yes.

158
00:12:16,623 --> 00:12:18,123
Doctor!

159
00:12:18,123 --> 00:12:20,103
Now you see me?

160
00:12:21,103 --> 00:12:23,283
You came here?

161
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,943
Yes.

162
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:28,003
When are you eating lunch? Let's eat together.

163
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:30,763
Y-You can't do that!

164
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:33,273
She agreed to eat lunch with me first, right?

165
00:12:33,273 --> 00:12:36,163
Ah... Yes...

166
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:38,533
Do you want to eat dinner together later?

167
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:41,963
You should have dinner with me.

168
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:47,483
I just mean, shouldn't you treat me to a meal after I finish the Chairman's surgery successfully?

169
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:52,053
Alright, let's eat dinner.

170
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,823
I guess you two are close.

171
00:13:05,463 --> 00:13:08,613
No, let's just do the tests.

172
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:18,183
Doctor, hello.

173
00:13:18,183 --> 00:13:20,853
Oh, you're here. Have you been well?

174
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:23,983
Yes. After you're released, let's go fishing.

175
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:26,103
You like to fish?

176
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:31,883
I really like you. Our Ji Hong hates fishing.

177
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:37,643
Still, he endures through it well when he's with you. Let's go fishing together often.

178
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:41,693
Yes, Doctor. This is Doctor Jeong Yoon Do.

179
00:13:43,163 --> 00:13:44,663
I heard that you're in charge of my surgery.

180
00:13:44,663 --> 00:13:45,743
Yes, Doctor.

181
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:48,473
Doctor, I'm going to draw some blood.

182
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:12,153
Doo Sik is admitted in one of the VIP hospital rooms.

183
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:14,013
As expected, you're fast.

184
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:16,843
I wondered why the Chairman's car was at the hospital. It was because he was hospitalized. Why?

185
00:14:16,843 --> 00:14:19,343
- It seems that his illness came back.
- Are you going to go visit?

186
00:14:19,343 --> 00:14:22,973
No. I think he's trying to get a secret surgery because of us.

187
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:26,423
I think he guessed that if others knew he was sick, the other doctors, including us, would be shaken.

188
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:28,913
I guess Kim Tae Ho overextended himself. For me that's great.

189
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:33,203
We should have him face a disciplinary hearing with that as an excuse. The position of Vice-Director is too much for him.

190
00:14:36,423 --> 00:14:39,003
I don't think we should have the surgery in secret.

191
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:43,063
The burden is too large. You're going to have to stand on the front lines soon anyway.

192
00:14:43,063 --> 00:14:45,333
Yeah, I agree.

193
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:49,863
Until now, I lived well using the chairman as my shield.

194
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:55,143
Now, we should let him do the fishing he loves so much.

195
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:57,843
Thank you, Doctor.

196
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:03,843
- I'm going to visit the ICU.
- Yes.

197
00:15:03,843 --> 00:15:05,503
- Doc.
- Yeah.

198
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:10,893
Patient Lee Gye Won underwent midnight NPO (nil per os, fluids and food withheld) last night and her vitals are stable.

199
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:13,603
Ah, the Anesthesiology Department said they would prepare Room #2.

200
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:15,173
- You stopped administering Warfarin (a blood thinner), right?
- Yes.

201
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:17,233
It's been a week since we've stopped it.

202
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:20,343
Alright. The surgery is scheduled in the afternoon so make sure everything is set.

203
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:23,603
Yes. Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong is the assistant, right?

204
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:27,913
Yes. Tell Doctor Jin Seo Woo to come in.

205
00:15:27,913 --> 00:15:29,983
Yes.

206
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:32,053
Yoo Hye Jeong

207
00:15:33,363 --> 00:15:36,293
- Doctor, where are you right now?
- The hospital's station.

208
00:15:36,293 --> 00:15:41,023
The chairman's lab results came out. Can you look at it? Should I deliver it to you?

209
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,563
No, we decided not to have the surgery in secret.

210
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:47,553
- I can use the computer, right?
- Yes, Doctor. I'm finished using it.

211
00:15:50,723 --> 00:15:52,563
His blood glucose level is 300. (This is abnormally high)

212
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:56,113
At this rate, I think it'll be best to push the surgery back for a few days.

213
00:15:58,363 --> 00:16:02,473
Consult the Neurosurgery Department. Prescribe Insulin and monitor his condition for the next few days.

214
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:05,223
Yes, I'll tell Doctor Jeong Yoon Do.

215
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:07,033
Alright.

216
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:14,193
This is burdensome. Why are you staring at me? Don't you have something to do?

217
00:16:14,193 --> 00:16:17,053
Something to do... I'm sorry. I uh...

218
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:22,553
What are you sorry for? I'm going on my rounds.

219
00:16:22,553 --> 00:16:25,853
- Yes! I can follow, right?
- Come on.

220
00:16:35,183 --> 00:16:37,643
Doctor Hong wants you to come into the surgery.

221
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:40,853
You know Patient Lee Gye Won, right? The cavernous hemangioma (cerebral cavernous malformation) excision.

222
00:16:40,853 --> 00:16:44,583
Are you sure you're not mistaken? He told me not to enter any surgeries for a while.

223
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,563
It's definitely been past "a while" now.

224
00:16:47,563 --> 00:16:49,453
What about Hye Jeong?

225
00:16:49,453 --> 00:16:51,873
She's going into Doctor Jeong Yoon Do's surgery,

226
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:54,753
Chairman Hong's surgery.

227
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:56,063
The chairman is getting surgery?

228
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:00,223
Yeah, there's an uproar because of that now.

229
00:17:00,223 --> 00:17:01,933
He gave such an important surgery to Hye Jeong—

230
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:06,263
He didn't give it to her because it was an important surgery. He gave it to her because it suited her.

231
00:17:09,523 --> 00:17:11,903
Didn't I just seem mean?

232
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:13,163
Yeah.

233
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:14,953
I succeeded.

234
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:18,513
I just can't rest for a minute.

235
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:22,843
-Let's just split it in half.
- Why do I have to pay?

236
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:24,533
You rode the car too.

237
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:28,683
You were the one who drove the car. I thought that you had a driver's license.

238
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:31,903
Doctor Yoo knows everything now. For now, she's not saying anything,

239
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:36,293
but we need to set up some sort of plan.

240
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:39,213
What are you talking about that you're not even acknowledging me?

241
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:42,203
I mean... I just wanted to be Cinderella for once,

242
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:45,283
but that was shattered, and now my paycheck for the next two months is about to be gone.

243
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:48,553
Anyway, I can't pay!

244
00:17:48,553 --> 00:17:50,373
What is she talking about?

245
00:17:51,513 --> 00:17:56,553
The car that Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong received from Boss, we crashed it.

246
00:17:56,553 --> 00:18:01,323
She really accepted that car? Then she accepted a bribe, it's against our hospital's policies.

247
00:18:01,323 --> 00:18:03,443
I don't know much about that,

248
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:08,873
but Nurse Hyeon and I are about to spend our next few paychecks paying off monthly installments for the car repairs.

249
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:11,723
Isn't there another way?

250
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,793
I'll fix it for you.

251
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:21,483
Yes, I'm Jin Seo Woo of the Neurosurgery Department.

252
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:23,943
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong of the Neurosurgery Department

253
00:18:23,943 --> 00:18:27,603
has accepted a foreign made sports car as a present from a patient.

254
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:29,203
Yes.

255
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,073
Yes, I understand.

256
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:38,813
- Seo Woo.
- Dad.

257
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:42,313
You'll be the one going to the academic conference that'll be held on Jeju Island, right?

258
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:46,543
I like that about Kim Tae Ho. He takes care of you without thinking of his relationship with me.

259
00:18:48,123 --> 00:18:50,553
Speak of the devil.

260
00:18:56,853 --> 00:19:00,313
I had no idea that Chairman Hong was hospitalized.

261
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:03,423
I should have told you earlier, but I was afraid you would be worried.

262
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:07,733
Of course I should be worried! The Chairman is such an important person in our hospital.

263
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:10,053
Isn't there anything you need?

264
00:19:11,003 --> 00:19:15,903
Ah, I know I'm fake too, but you're on a different level.

265
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:19,643
None. Thank you for your concern.

266
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:21,183
Then, please take good care of him.

267
00:19:21,183 --> 00:19:22,493
Yes.

268
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,933
No wonder it was strange.

269
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:38,123
He used a useless strategy. It doesn't even matter, the ball is in our court now.

270
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:54,013
Still, we've known each other for 50 years.

271
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:57,033
I bought some of the cookies you like.

272
00:19:57,853 --> 00:19:59,263
Eat them after the surgery.

273
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:00,513
Are you okay after that punch?

274
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:04,453
Of course I'm fine. That won't kill me, at least not yet.

275
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,173
Do you know how much I'm holding it in right now?

276
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:11,073
Did you think that I wouldn't know you made a slush fund?

277
00:20:11,073 --> 00:20:12,463
So what are you going to do?

278
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:17,793
I hoped that Myeong Hoon would step down on his own.

279
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:21,773
There's no chance.

280
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:25,883
Fine, do whatever you want, but

281
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:29,443
give me the records of my slush funds. We're friends.

282
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:34,983
No matter what anyone says, there's a history we've written together. You're sick, so rest.

283
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:41,833
Aren't you tired of living a life of just working?

284
00:20:43,013 --> 00:20:46,803
Give it to Ji Hong; I'll support him.

285
00:21:06,163 --> 00:21:08,243
Not even saying hi?

286
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:14,803
- Did you reflect?
- Yes.

287
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:17,403
I'll make sure this doesn't happen again.

288
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:22,643
Seo Woo, I was your homeroom teacher. Don't forget.

289
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:24,973
How can I forget?

290
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:27,613
I'm sincerely hoping you do well.

291
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,413
Finally eating cafeteria food.

292
00:21:49,973 --> 00:21:51,843
Sit here.

293
00:21:57,303 --> 00:22:00,223
Eating together is really difficult.

294
00:22:02,343 --> 00:22:04,613
Are you usually quiet?

295
00:22:04,613 --> 00:22:05,943
No.

296
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:08,943
Is it that you have nothing to say when you see me...

297
00:22:08,943 --> 00:22:11,663
- It's not like that.
- You're smiling again.

298
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,853
I told you, if we get along, I'm really funny.

299
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:24,113
Was the meaning of thinking of you as a woman not delivered properly?

300
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:26,813
It was delivered. I'm not that much of an idiot.

301
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:29,413
Then why are you setting up a wall between us?

302
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:33,443
- Is it because of Doctor Hong Ji Hong?
- Doctor, we're here to eat.

303
00:22:33,443 --> 00:22:36,383
Talking while eating seems too much.

304
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:40,123
What's too much? Whether eating or loving...

305
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:45,443
I mean, anyway, while eating you can talk about whatever.

306
00:22:45,443 --> 00:22:47,373
That's what I mean.

307
00:22:50,263 --> 00:22:52,803
Doctor, thank you.

308
00:22:52,803 --> 00:22:55,913
Why suddenly "thank you?"

309
00:22:55,913 --> 00:23:01,543
The start doesn't sound good. Most of the time, people use that to start the conversation before saying the bad news.

310
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:07,653
I don't trust love between a man and a woman.

311
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,663
Should I not?

312
00:23:11,453 --> 00:23:14,853
Do it. Let's go till the end.

313
00:23:16,123 --> 00:23:20,063
But if I have to love, that one person

314
00:23:20,063 --> 00:23:22,613
will be Hong Ji Hong.

315
00:23:28,703 --> 00:23:30,643
Sorry.

316
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:33,803
It's not something to be sorry about. But,

317
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:38,493
since you are sorry, thank you.

318
00:23:38,493 --> 00:23:42,953
Because that means you have good feelings towards me.

319
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:51,463
How can you stand up like that? Making me scared to end our conversation..

320
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:57,663
Eat.

321
00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:13,573
Even if I look, I'm funny.

322
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:17,653
- Let's get up.
- Okay.

323
00:24:42,223 --> 00:24:46,533
Yes, it's the neurosurgery department. Pardon? Yes.

324
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:51,873
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong? Yes, I understand.

325
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:56,713
- Who is it?
- The audit team is looking for Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong.

326
00:24:56,713 --> 00:25:01,093
Seeing that the Board of Audit and Inspection is looking for her, she must have accepted bribes! I knew it.

327
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:03,603
She pretended to be clean all by herself.

328
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:06,933
Doctor Choi! It wouldn't be about the car, right?

329
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:10,203
- No way.
- Ah, if it is, what do we do? I feel sorry...

330
00:25:10,203 --> 00:25:14,353
- What are you doing?
- I need to call Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong.

331
00:25:14,353 --> 00:25:18,993
Hey. Hey!

332
00:25:18,993 --> 00:25:21,933
Go hurry run and tell Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong to go to the inspection team.

333
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:24,993
- I can just call her...
- If you call her, that's no effort.

334
00:25:24,993 --> 00:25:29,183
Hurry run. Run run, hurry run!

335
00:25:32,623 --> 00:25:34,903
What do we do about him?

336
00:25:34,903 --> 00:25:37,013
Doctor!

337
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,613
Doctor.

338
00:25:42,613 --> 00:25:44,363
You could've called, why'd you run?

339
00:25:44,363 --> 00:25:47,223
The audit team told you to come.

340
00:25:47,223 --> 00:25:51,583
- Do you know where the audit office is?
- Probably on the upper floor.

341
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:07,253
- You remember signing the agreement containing conditions when you entered our hospital, don't you?
- Yes.

342
00:26:07,253 --> 00:26:12,373
- Then I'm sure you also remember the clause about not accepting bribes of any form from any patient.
- Yes.

343
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:15,963
Is it true that you accepted a foreign-made car from Patient Gong Byeong Do?

344
00:26:15,963 --> 00:26:22,133
No, that person left it and went away. I didn't know how to deal with it; I needed some time.

345
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:23,843
It's this car, right?

346
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:25,943
Yes it is.

347
00:26:25,943 --> 00:26:29,143
You lied. You already drove around in the car.

348
00:26:29,143 --> 00:26:34,153
I didn't drive it. In the midst of dealing with it, an accident occured.

349
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:36,483
Do you want to see my car?

350
00:26:38,603 --> 00:26:40,533
Oh, it's a nice car.

351
00:26:41,463 --> 00:26:45,703
I'm not in a position to covet the present Patient Gong Byung Do gave me.

352
00:26:45,703 --> 00:26:48,763
Can't you look upon it nicely, being fellow employees?

353
00:26:48,763 --> 00:26:52,463
I want to as well. I'll discuss it with the other members.

354
00:26:57,113 --> 00:27:00,413
Neurosurgery Department Hong Ji Hong

355
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:22,963
Don't do cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Although the surgery will go well, if by any chance...

356
00:27:22,963 --> 00:27:27,283
I'm old, so, not waking up isn't bad.

357
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:30,223
I don't want to forcibly prolong my life.

358
00:27:52,693 --> 00:27:57,383
Thoracic Surgery, General Surgery, Neurosurgery, Plastic Surgery

359
00:28:03,443 --> 00:28:04,953
What did Chairman Hong say?

360
00:28:04,953 --> 00:28:07,523
He chased us right up under our noses.

361
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:12,573
- This is the slush fund file.
- He found your slush fund?!

362
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:16,923
He was tracking my movements all this time. For now, I got this from him.

363
00:28:16,923 --> 00:28:17,903
Did he give it up easily?

364
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:21,473
We made a deal. I put you on the line.

365
00:28:21,473 --> 00:28:23,943
No, I definitely can't give up this position.

366
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:27,813
I've bought some time until he recovers from his surgery so we just have to erase this before then.

367
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:31,643
With his personality, placing the evidence in one location is key.

368
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:35,723
Neurosurgery punks are really obsessive and tenacious, you know.

369
00:28:35,723 --> 00:28:39,283
I hope something goes wrong with the surgery. If that happens, everything will be solved without us even lifting a finger.

370
00:28:39,283 --> 00:28:42,053
It's a difficult surgery so even if Jeong Yoon Do is performing it, it'll be hard.

371
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,933
This kid, really! No matter how ambitious you are, how could you say something like that.

372
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,583
- I'm saying that because I'm ambitious.
- Oh ho!

373
00:29:15,613 --> 00:29:17,193
Oh you came?

374
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:20,393
Did you eat?

375
00:29:20,393 --> 00:29:22,843
Of course I did.

376
00:29:25,073 --> 00:29:27,903
Exactly how are you managing your health these days.

377
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:30,203
Am I getting scolded again?

378
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:33,583
Your BST  (Blood Sugar Test)  went all the way up into the 300s.

379
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:37,493
It could suddenly go up that high for a short while, so don't worry.

380
00:29:37,493 --> 00:29:40,423
Did you bring the DNR  ( Do Not Resuscitate ) agreement?

381
00:29:40,423 --> 00:29:41,983
I brought it.

382
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:45,073
Give me my glasses and a pen.

383
00:29:57,183 --> 00:29:58,963
Where do I sign it?

384
00:30:00,543 --> 00:30:02,873
Here.

385
00:30:08,043 --> 00:30:09,653
Now,

386
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,633
it's your turn.

387
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,773
Do you have to go this far?

388
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:28,073
I'm just saying we should prepare for the worst-case scenario. Don't think too hard about it.

389
00:30:28,963 --> 00:30:31,303
I'm not dying.

390
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:39,823
I decided to resign from the position of Chairman.

391
00:30:39,823 --> 00:30:40,813
You did well.

392
00:30:40,813 --> 00:30:43,463
I'll be unemployed, yet you're saying I did well?

393
00:30:43,463 --> 00:30:45,893
I'll make a living from now on.

394
00:30:45,893 --> 00:30:48,283
When you recover, go play around.

395
00:30:48,283 --> 00:30:52,083
My expenses are high.

396
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,543
How much will you give me every month?

397
00:30:55,543 --> 00:30:57,113
Let's live according to how much we can afford.

398
00:30:57,113 --> 00:31:00,303
See? You're backing down immediately.

399
00:31:04,643 --> 00:31:07,293
Go to sleep, Father.

400
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:15,283
- Give me your reading glasses.
- Okay.

401
00:31:29,533 --> 00:31:32,083
Guk Il Medical Center

402
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:35,323
Guk Il Medical Center

403
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:48,723
During the tumor removal, you have to frequently stimulate the facial nerve to ensure that the nerve isn't cut.

404
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:51,243
- That's right.
- I know.

405
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,133
Use the CUSA (cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator) to first excise the main part of the tumor.

406
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:57,923
Also be careful not to damage the trigeminal nerve and the other cranial nerves.

407
00:31:57,923 --> 00:31:59,523
Yes.

408
00:32:01,743 --> 00:32:03,533
Why are you laughing?

409
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:06,863
Because it suits you so well.

410
00:32:06,863 --> 00:32:08,753
Yeah, we're kind of like that.

411
00:32:09,993 --> 00:32:17,553
Surgeons need to have a heart that can endure all pressure, a level-headed brain, and delicate hands.

412
00:32:18,543 --> 00:32:20,353
I'm cool, right?

413
00:32:20,353 --> 00:32:24,523
It's all written in your book.

414
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:30,183
Anyway, Doctor Jeong is going to do my surgery. Do well.

415
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:33,883
If you don't do well, he could wake up from the anesthesia and do it himself.

416
00:32:35,023 --> 00:32:36,113
Ah, Doctor.

417
00:32:36,113 --> 00:32:39,243
Stop it. He's going to cry.

418
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,573
Hello.

419
00:32:41,573 --> 00:32:43,503
Doc, how are you feeling?

420
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,833
Well, I'm just so-so.

421
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:49,813
You were just laughing, isn't that good?

422
00:32:49,813 --> 00:32:52,053
Even if I'm laughing, I'm just so-so.

423
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:57,643
Oh, you shouldn't be just so-so. Shall I entertain you then, Doc?

424
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:01,093
Sure, then sing something.

425
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:02,733
Pardon?

426
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,280
Go up now.

427
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,750
You aren't going to watch the surgery?

428
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,430
No.

429
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,750
Then where will you be?

430
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,300
Somewhere with the guardians of other patients.

431
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,370
Now, let's start.

432
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,860
Scalpel.

433
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,450
Suction.

434
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,550
To the left.

435
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,850
Deeper.

436
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,750
I found it. Suction.

437
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,200
Now use the CUSA (cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator) to excise the main part of the tumor.

438
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,280
What are you doing?

439
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,490
If you're going to participate like this, you do it personally.

440
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,490
Doctor Jeong.

441
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,930
I can't perform surgery in an atmosphere like this.

442
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,590
I'm sorry.

443
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,420
Now, let's start again.

444
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,620
Operating room
Hong Doo Sik

445
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,660
Operating Room

446
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,970
Did it work?

447
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,520
No it didn't.

448
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,810
Did it work?

449
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,320
Yes, it worked.

450
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,170
- You see this, right?
- Yes.

451
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,500
Suction.

452
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,140
The surgery is going well, right?

453
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,000
If you do the suction well, it is a success.

454
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,230
It must have been hard to wait, right?

455
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,930
Time was moving really slowly.

456
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,650
I know what that feels like too.

457
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,860
Starting now, I will be revealing the results of the surgery.

458
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,140
It's written all over your face.

459
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,120
Ji Hong. The surgery was a success.

460
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,440
Yes.

461
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,950
You worked hard.

462
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,060
Yes, well.

463
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,840
We're about to eat together. You told me to buy you a meal if the surgery was successful.

464
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,510
There's no need for that.

465
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,230
No. I promised.

466
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,290
While we're at it, treat me to a meal too.

467
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,320
Doctor, get out of it.

468
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,210
Ah, I thought I was going to die. It's hard to wait.

469
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,690
Ah, why?

470
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:05,360
Patient Kim Jin Han says her headaches are still bad and she's vomiting.

471
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,160
Should we increase her prescription of painkillers?

472
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,090
- There wasn't anything abnormal in her CT scan, right?
- Right.

473
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,920
Then let's wait a bit more. If she still says it hurts, give her some morphine.

474
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,830
Morphine? Yes, I understand.

475
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,330
Where are you?

476
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,060
Me?

477
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,260
- Oh, welcome.
- Hey, give me some cup noodles.

478
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,940
Ah, yes.

479
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,150
Did you put down the order for Patient Kim Jin Han?

480
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,300
Yes.

481
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,210
Here.

482
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,430
Is there no kimchi?

483
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,120
Here it is.

484
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:50,210
Your sense is lacking. Kimchi is essential when you eat instant noodles.

485
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,890
I'm sorry.

486
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,490
Or were you going to eat it alone?

487
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,010
No, I'm on a kimchi diet these days.

488
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:02,190
In an experiment involving white lab rats, the kimchi ingredients were shown to be effective for losing weight.

489
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,810
But why are you eating instant noodles?

490
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,430
You're a 2nd year resident but you're gaining weight. I guess you're comfortable here.

491
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,490
Should I make you lose weight?

492
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,250
Eat, eat up.

493
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:21,900
Delicious, delicious! As expected, ramen goes well with kimchi.

494
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:27,670
Doctor, if you have something to say, just say it. Stop joking around now.

495
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,420
I came here to promote.

496
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,520
What?

497
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,890
It's a cafe called Soon Hee Hawaii owned by my friend. Please go often.

498
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:52,050
I'm a bit shameless, aren't I? I know I am, but she's a really close friend, so please let me off the hook.

499
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,780
You can eat this one.

500
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,720
What was that? She's cute.

501
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,080
She's unexpectedly charming.

502
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,680
From now on, I'm going to just live at Soon Hee Hawaii.

503
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,500
Yeah, live there and die there.

504
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,050
Deal.

505
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,830
The chairman is now conscious and his vitals are normal. Rest assured.

506
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,470
Yes.

507
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,990
Let's be close. All of your answers are just one-word

508
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,710
or you just ignore me.

509
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,820
I didn't ignore you.

510
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,870
Anyway, you're saying you don't like me.

511
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:32,150
I'm healing that wound by saying whatever comes to my mind, like this.

512
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,060
Sunbae, are you alright?

513
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,490
I'm not sure what you're asking about, but yeah, I'm alright.

514
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:07,400
You struck a dagger in someone else's heart and you're alright.

515
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,650
Don't you even feel bad?

516
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:15,380
Yoo Hye Jeong, the level of the man who likes you is this low.

517
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,090
You said you would accept anything aside from the slaps.

518
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,690
Yeah.

519
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,840
I'll leave first.

520
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,830
I'll come with you.

521
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,180
How can you follow me out?

522
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:42,150
I have to live too. How can I be in the same area as her?

523
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,280
I really don't want to do this with Seo Woo.

524
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,800
Am I doing this because I want to?

525
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,070
Then don't.

526
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,350
Seo Woo is pretty. Why reject her?

527
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,870
Then, why do you reject me?

528
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,860
I know you're in a complicated position because of Seo Woo, but don't try to survive just by yourself.

529
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,820
Now, I'm finished with my life of showing off to others.

530
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:15,260
If I want to, I can seduce a man and I can become a femme fatale.

531
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,620
You can never become like that.

532
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,310
Why?

533
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:23,190
People who'll really live like that don't announce it to others. They just do it.

534
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,600
It's because you still don't know me. I've already done it.

535
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:43,140
He was just talking. He fell asleep so quickly.

536
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,800
He's like a baby.

537
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,450
Doctor Yoo, please take care of him.

538
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:51,840
Yes.

539
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,360
Doctor Yoo, please take care of him.

540
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,250
Hey, but are you really going to just treat Doctor Jeong Yoon Do to a meal without me?

541
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,500
Ah, seriously! Why are you like this?

542
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,040
It's so nice to see you relaxed.

543
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,250
Yes, this is Kim Tae Ho.

544
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:24,460
Yes, Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong is a fellow in her department.

545
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:29,680
Pardon? Oh, that's not possible.

546
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,130
Yes, I'll check with her.

547
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,540
Yes, that date is fine with me. Yes.

548
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,820
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong was reported to the Disciplinary Committee.

549
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,320
I don't know what this is about.

550
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,610
She can just return the car. Is this really something to open up a Disciplinary Board meeting?

551
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:59,600
I wanted to end it nicely too, but the informant was quite strong-willed.

552
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:04,380
Who was it? Is she stronger than me?

553
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,520
Doctor Jin Seo Woo, the daughter of the Director.

554
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,380
Yes, come in.

555
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,110
Welcome.

556
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,840
Sit down.

557
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,680
I think it's been a very long time since it was just the two of us.

558
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,340
So, are you adjusting well?

559
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,320
I'm doing my best.

560
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,180
The Board of Audit and Inspection called today

561
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:44,090
about scheduling a date for your disciplinary hearing, Dr. Yoo. I'm also a member on the disciplinary action committee.

562
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:48,380
I heard that you received a foreign-made car from Patient Hong Hong Byeong Jo. Is that true?

563
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,100
Yes, it's true.

564
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,480
I planned to return it, but I couldn't find a way to.

565
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,930
I don't think that you received that car as a bribe,

566
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:06,840
but the thoughts of the Disciplinary Committee won't all be like me.

567
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,120
There's a saying, "A pear falls as soon as a crow flies." (An irrelevant matter is timed coincidentally with another.)

568
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:15,850
It's best to not create situations where you can be misunderstood. On top of that, this is just a rolling stone.

569
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,300
I was careless.

570
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:22,940
At the very least, it'll be a suspension or a reduced salary.

571
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:27,100
In the worst case scenario, you could be removed from the hospital.

572
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,820
Want to have a cup of tea?

573
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,790
You must have felt good after the Chairman's surgery finished successfully today. I deflated your mood, didn't I?

574
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,620
Nope, not at all.

575
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:09,530
You should go rest at home. Today must have been wearisome for you.

576
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,020
It wasn't weary for me. It would have been wearisome for you.

577
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,170
You want to rest at home, don't you?

578
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,690
Yes.

579
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:18,980
Then go rest. I looked into the Disciplinary Board Meeting

580
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:22,980
and I can attend too as a Representative of the Doctors. So don't worry too much.

581
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,940
I'm not worried, because remaining at this hospital isn't my goal.

582
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,780
Yeah, think of it lightly like that.

583
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,900
Doctor, are you okay with whatever I do?

584
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,700
Yeah, everything's okay.

585
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:39,350
That's a fantasy. Even in a parent-child relationship, not everything is okay.

586
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:42,910
Hey you. Why are you acting so prickly towards me?

587
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,510
Just because.

588
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:09,310
Doctor! Doctor Choi! Doctor Choi, Doctor Choi, Doctor Choi!

589
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:11,290
What, what, what, what, what?

590
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,470
Doctor Yoo is about to be disciplined because of us!

591
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,180
Is that why you were called in by the Board of Audit and Inspection?

592
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,290
- Yes!
- Aish!

593
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:22,430
That's good. If you did wrong, you should be punished. That's how the world runs.

594
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:25,700
If you keep that up, you'll be struck by thunder, Chief.

595
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:33,550
Is this a birdhouse to you? Is the nursing station here for you to chatter away?

596
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,320
I knew he was quiet for too long.

597
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,200
What are you? What are you whispering about?

598
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,020
It's nothing.

599
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,280
How is Patient Kim Hee Cheol's mental state?

600
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,230
He's drowsy.

601
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:48,740
So why didn't you notify me until now? You've all lost your minds from slacking off around here, haven't you?

602
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,860
Kang Gyeong Joon, follow me.

603
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,590
Doctor, we

604
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:02,120
weren't gossiping just because we wanted to. Something happened, so we had no choice.

605
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:07,410
What is it? If you make something out to be an incident when it's not, then for an entire week you'll be punished.

606
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:11,170
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong has been reported to the Disciplinary Committee.

607
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,950
Tell me the details. Why stop in the middle?

608
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,890
Ah, yes. T-T-That's—

609
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:21,150
Don't stutter!

610
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:26,590
Boss came to the hospital because he was injured. Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong performed the surgery on him

611
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:30,620
and that surgery was successful. Because he was so thankful...

612
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,960
- Do you know that?
- I know.

613
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,250
Do you even know when you're saying "you know"?

614
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,450
You're talking about the Disciplinary Committee, aren't you?

615
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:49,810
Well... it's nice that you understood me at once.

616
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,100
I got rejected by Yoo Hye Jeong.

617
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,650
You knew this would happen, right?

618
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:00,500
Yes. Do you know how long it's been that I've known her?

619
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,490
However, it's still not official and we just have a thing.

620
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:06,970
I see. She has high standards.

621
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,300
You're amazing, seeing that you still have a thing with her.

622
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:13,150
That's right. I think it's amazing as well.

623
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:17,380
Well, I'm going to continue to like her. I can't court her because it's dirty, but

624
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,630
if there's a gap between you two, I'm going to use that chance to go in.

625
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:23,190
Okay then.

626
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,640
Aren't you going to comfort me for being rejected?

627
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,920
Buy me dinner. You said you would treat me to a meal.

628
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,950
Not today. I have an appointment to go to.

629
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:35,440
He always goes first.

630
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,520
Hello, Hyung!

631
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,200
I'm Hong Ji Hong. I'm sorry for making you come all the way here.

632
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,250
No, that's totally fine. I am Kim Chi Hyeon from General Surgery.

633
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,250
Let's have a seat.

634
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,610
It's an honor.

635
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:59,190
You're the chairman's son as well as a surgeon at the Neurosurgery Department.

636
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:02,150
You're someone with high prestige, but you're meeting me.

637
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,200
What would you like to eat?

638
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:08,230
Doctor X

639
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,440
Are you uploading this again?

640
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,780
The response for this is amazing!

641
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,720
If this becomes a movie, I can occasionally earn some money.

642
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,010
So what are you going to do with that money?

643
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:24,700
I should give some to Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong as well. I'm sorry about this Disciplinary Committee Meeting as well.

644
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:28,350
- Aren't those just empty words?
- Well because I don't have any money, at the moment.

645
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:34,000
Gangster Female Doctor

646
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,520
I didn't know then

647
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,600
that such danger would come to a female doctor.

648
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,160
I'm going on a hiatus.

649
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,890
The gangster female doctor is so fun!

650
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,870
Why are you going on a hiatus?

651
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:48,850
Wow, there are actually people waiting for this.

652
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:50,260
That's what I'm saying.

653
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,410
I understand. So let's go for now.

654
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,830
Doctor Yoo just promoted a shop.

655
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,680
Doctor Yoo is promoting these days?

656
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,220
Aiyoo, isn't anyone here?

657
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,260
- Hello!
- Oh! Hello!

658
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,680
Hello, cute doctor!

659
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,560
- I'm here too.
- I know.

660
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,920
Isn't our Doctor Bi Yeong Gook here?

661
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,370
No, he isn't. Please give us some ramen.

662
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:21,620
You must really like ramen.

663
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,070
You can just make it yourself in the staff rooms at the hospital.

664
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:27,030
- You're a resident, you need to save money.
- Yes.

665
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,820
By any chance, do you have anything that can pass as a meal?

666
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,540
I do. Come here.

667
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,120
Here.

668
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,450
- I'll get you a menu.
- Okay. Thank you.

669
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:43,040
- I will help...
- Oh! You scared me!

670
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,070
Just stay here!

671
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:48,520
What is it?

672
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,310
Please move your face.

673
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:58,260
Don't do that. Don't do it.

674
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:02,450
I'm so curious about what you will say to me.

675
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:09,370
You participated in this patient's surgery, right?

676
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:11,180
Stomach Laporatomy

677
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,030
Please tell me in detail what happened during this surgery.

678
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:21,480
I can't remember well, because this was very long ago.

679
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,050
Since a table death occurred when the diagnosis was gastric cancer, didn't you think it was odd?

680
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,330
This is something that is memorable.

681
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:33,680
Do you have any relationship to the female who came to me claiming to be her guardian?

682
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,100
I'm not sure what you are saying. I was close with this person who passed away.

683
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,600
Oh! I see.

684
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,300
I suddenly feel exhausted.

685
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,860
Namyangju Guk Il Medical Center

686
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,960
Hello.

687
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,790
Ah, seriously! You ruined my morning.

688
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,440
You can just tell me what happened if you don't want to see me anymore.

689
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,400
Aish, seriously!

690
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,860
Should I give you anything to drink?

691
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,830
No thank you. I came because you didn't give me a call.

692
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:27,940
There was massive hemorrhage during the surgery, wasn't there?

693
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,060
Why do you think that?

694
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:37,390
I saw someone bringing in quite a few blood bags to the surgery room.

695
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:39,680
There are multiple surgery rooms. You can't just assume everything based on that.

696
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,100
Did you mess with the organ or did you cut a blood vessel?

697
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,080
I really can't talk with you.

698
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:48,680
Do you know why I'm even talking to you right now?

699
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:52,040
What relationship do you have with Professor Hong Ji Hong?

700
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,250
I don't think he has any part in this situation.

701
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:58,210
Ah, so you do know him. Professor Hong said he didn't know you.

702
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:04,520
Sounding like you had some kind of lofty righteous goal he brought up seeking the truth.

703
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,380
In the meantime you threatened me using Professor Hong.

704
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,580
I feel disgusted right now, understand?

705
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,230
Leave.

706
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,680
I will come find you again. I will continue doing so.

707
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,700
Good morning!

708
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,740
Why did you do that? I clearly told you that

709
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:02,420
I would do my task on my own. I told you to stay out of it.

710
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,890
Kang Mal Soon's guardian came to find me again.

711
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:12,010
I told you to go hard on her.

712
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:14,470
Professor Hong Ji Hong came to find me last night.

713
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:19,540
I mean, if this is something involving Professor Hong, I can't just ignore it and overlook it.

714
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,490
What?

715
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:23,330
To be frank, what happens to me if I get marked by Chairman Hong?

716
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:26,090
Chairman Hong has decided to resign so you just have to listen to me.

717
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,310
That woman is going to come back!

718
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:31,970
I think that dealing with someone who wants to bring this to court will be easier.

719
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:33,480
This ...

720
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,810
Surgical Records

721
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:47,440
What's with Hong Ji Hong now?

722
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:55,940
Are you mad right now because you know I met Chief Kim Chi Hyeon?

723
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,340
Yes.

724
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,960
Rather than doing it by yourself, if we do it together,

725
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,860
we can finish this up faster. You work together with Soon Hee, this is the same thing.

726
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,830
Then why didn't you tell me?

727
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:13,350
You sent only me from the fishing dock early. I didn't ask any questions then.

728
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:16,200
It's because you were in a bind because of the internal audit.

729
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:20,860
You didn't even tell me that the chairman was ill. I heard it from someone else.

730
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,340
What am I to you?

731
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,950
That's... I didn't tell you because I thought you would be worried—

732
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:29,950
The same goes for me. Why do you have to have a hard time because of me?

733
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,170
I'm not having a hard time.

734
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:33,650
Then, I'm not having a hard time either!

735
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:37,590
Why don't you ever share your worries with me?

736
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:40,820
Because I've never shared my worries with anyone.

737
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:48,950
I've always decided on everything by myself. It has become a habit now.

738
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:51,900
It has nothing to do with you.

739
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:57,960
Yes, it does... if we want to have a relationship between a man and a woman.

740
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:04,510
You always persuade me saying that we should do everything together,

741
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:07,390
but why do you always try to do things habitually?

742
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:11,020
Is that love?

743
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:16,580
That's just a nuisance. I don't do love that becomes a nuisance.

744
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:29,660
In the past, he gave me ambition that made me want to become a good person.

745
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:35,330
A good person is different from a good man and a good woman.

746
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:41,880
♫  Don't tell me you're sorry, no way. Don't leave me, no way  ♫

747
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,820
♫  The breath you gave me once again ♫
