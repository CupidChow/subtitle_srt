1
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,600
Do you think I don't know that you were with that woman yesterday?

2
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,780
Episode 7
You're starting again! Why can't you trust a person! Sh*t!

3
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,710
- Where are you going? You can't leave!
- Let go of me!

4
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,160
If you leave, I'm going to kill myself!

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,530
Yeah, do whatever you want! Die or not, do whatever you want!

6
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,970
To me, love between a man and woman means a bitter fight to the death.

7
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,860
- So cold!
- Oh no!

8
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,730
I don't know how to love a man... as a woman.

9
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,460
Then are we going out?

10
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,670
I don't know how to accept love.

11
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:39,490
Right now, I'm going to do a certain thing, as a man to a woman.

12
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,160
It's a kiss. I need to avoid it.

13
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,690
Turn your head away! Hurry!

14
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,130
Unlike my mom, I'm not going to die over love for a man.

15
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,400
Hye Jeong!

16
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,120
At first, I also ran away, just like you.

17
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,870
I'm not going to ask you for the second time.

18
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,960
Why not?

19
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,970
Don't move. I'm going to go to you.

20
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,990
The person who knows what love is moves first. Don't move.

21
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,950
As a person who doesn't know, don't move until you know.

22
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,480
Thank you for giving your heartfelt consideration to my patient.

23
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,430
It's so unfair.

24
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,720
She worked for a lifetime, so honestly and with much effort. So what is this?

25
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,930
It's unexpected, having you become emotional over this.

26
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,780
What's unexpected?

27
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,420
You lived a life that was largely set apart from unfairness.

28
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,790
No, I hold in a lot.

29
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,240
Though once I explode after suppressing it, no one can stop me.

30
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,640
It doesn't look like you're holding back anything.

31
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,360
I love you.

32
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,960
I told you before I liked you didn't I? That was a lie.

33
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,130
You're right that you explode after holding it in.

34
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,230
Even when we were at Ajumma's restaurant, I wanted to say so.

35
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,370
It was something that I didn't ever want to hear. I'm a bad person.

36
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,120
Someone who says they're bad, with their own lips, is really bad.

37
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,980
You know my feelings. I know that you're pretending not to know.

38
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,130
I don't want to torture you endlessly by giving you hope.

39
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,880
It's fine if I'm tormented as long as there's some occasional hope you throw at me.

40
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,580
You're so persistent. That's why I wanted to prevent you from ever saying it.

41
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,540
Then promise me, that you won't like another woman for the next six months.

42
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,270
Since you rejected me, you could hold your sympathy for me, for at least that long.

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,460
I've already started.

44
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,960
What? Who? When?

45
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,990
You had no time to meet anyone. Is it by chance Hye Jeong?

46
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,870
I'm getting goosebumps. A woman's sixth sense is really something.

47
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,290
Why is it her of all people?

48
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,880
How do I know why it happens to be her?

49
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,890
Does liking someone go as you wish?

50
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,290
I want to just throw this.

51
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,000
It's probably Yeong Guk.

52
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,430
I called him over to look after you.

53
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,590
Where are you going?

54
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:22,210
Something went wrong with my patient. I'm not in a position to comfort someone, right?

55
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,110
Does he have to be so arrogant?

56
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,430
What's wrong?

57
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,410
Why do bad things always come all at once?

58
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,400
Would you like to have a drink?

59
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,430
It's the test that was done on Patient Oh Yeong Mi, after she collapsed right?

60
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,260
Yes, after she underwent intubation (tracheal intubation).

61
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,440
What's the point of examining the angiography (x-ray imaging of blood vessel flow via radiocontrast dyes)?

62
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,650
We should at least know what went wrong!

63
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,790
After she got examined, in a blink of an eye, she became like that.

64
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,870
There's a blood clot next to the label marker. It's a pulmonary embolism.

65
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,170
Pulmonary embolism - blood clot in a pulmonary artery (artery from heart to lungs)

66
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,190
Did she display any symptoms after being moved to the ward?

67
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,710
There weren't any. We even ran a CT on her, but we didn't see anything in particular.

68
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,700
- Her guardian is here, right?
- Yes.

69
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,220
Thank you. Enjoy your drinks!

70
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,800
Is this the only place there is to drink?

71
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,610
It's a "hot place" that's up-and-coming with our hospital crew.

72
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,930
Hey! Seo Woo!

73
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,630
Hey!

74
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,950
Omo, omo, look at her. Look at how she treats a friend she hasn't seen in awhile.

75
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,590
Did you say you were 26?

76
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,810
I guess you went to school at the age of 3?

77
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,650
I'll give you snacks to complement your alcohol, on the house.

78
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,290
Call!

79
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,190
What's the other bad thing besides Patient Oh Yeong Mi? Did Jeong Yoon Do tick you off again?

80
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:13,230
I'll tell you after my feelings are more settled. I can't tell you now because my pride will get hurt.

81
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,130
Wow, why are you drinking so much?

82
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,030
Oh? Our CEO?

83
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,110
- You're still role-playing Hye Jeong's handmaid I see.
- Oouch. Your words...

84
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,510
Something happened that made her feel bad, so she's not in the best state.

85
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,760
I also know her very well. I'm filtering what she's saying so don't worry about it.

86
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,600
Good.

87
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,520
Hey! Pour me one.

88
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,410
You think I'm your subordinate or something?

89
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,570
Straight?

90
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,490
Oohh. It's strong.

91
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,300
Looks like you're very very bad at holding your liquor.

92
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,830
He's really weak at everything.

93
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,160
You, when did you start living with Hye Jeong?

94
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,680
After we graduated from high school, we started living together.

95
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,750
My father tried to send me to Canada, you know.

96
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,530
What did Hye Jeong do in the meantime?

97
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,710
Well, she studied and took the GED,

98
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,560
since coming to Seoul with the money her grandmother left her.

99
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:18,880
From what I hear, after her grandmother died, she left with some gangster kid.

100
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,930
Didn't they live together?

101
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,270
No! She lived with me!

102
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,410
I mean before she lived with you. There's time that's unaccounted for.

103
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,360
What are you saying? With me ...

104
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,970
Goodbye.

105
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,800
- Isn't that him?
- Yeah it is.

106
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,630
But he doesn't recognize me.

107
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,450
- Hey!
- What are you doing? Hey! Hey! Don't go! Stop right there!

108
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,390
Hey! Hey! Don't!

109
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,970
Don't you know me? I'm Hye Jeong's friend.

110
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,800
I know.

111
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,250
- Hey, he says he knows me. Should I give you Hye Jeong's contact?
- Don't bother.

112
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,570
Well, even if I don't I guess you'll see her if you continue to deliver to this business.

113
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,700
You, do you know that Hye Jeong became a doctor?

114
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,430
It looks like you're really drunk right now. You've picked the wrong person to pick a fight with.

115
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,500
Do I look like a fool to you just because this is how I'm living?

116
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,900
How could there be someone like that! Hey you!

117
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,750
What does she mean, "how could there be someone like that", when there's a person like her! Really!

118
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,430
...should be good to me!

119
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,730
Oh! You're leaving early tomorrow seeing that you're washing your hair.

120
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,860
Yeah. Why'd you come home so late?

121
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,400
Seo Woo came and was such a nuisance.

122
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,590
She must've had something bad happen to her because she was really downing the alcohol.

123
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,430
I'll do it for you.

124
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,640
It's okay. I'll do it.

125
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,000
I won't let you! It's great isn't it; you don't need to get soap on your hands.

126
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,530
You need to completely dry your hair! If you sleep with your hair wet, then you'll suffer from hair loss.

127
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,730
I did completely dry it.

128
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,850
I will be responsible for your beauty. Come here!

129
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,480
Let's see...

130
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,130
Aging is measured by the hair.

131
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,770
Sometimes you play dolls on me.

132
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,730
It's not playing dolls!

133
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,680
It's a dress rehearsal. When you get married,

134
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,930
you have to do it for your husband.

135
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,810
You're so lucky, even getting a confession...

136
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,300
How far did you guys go?

137
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,540
- What!
- What?

138
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,650
- You... Did you guys kiss?
- No.

139
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,390
You did...

140
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,800
We did... I mean, we just touched our lips together...

141
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,700
Hey!! How could you describe in detail... making me jealous.

142
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,550
I'm really jealous...

143
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,510
But really. Teacher Hong's really funny.

144
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,010
If you think about his age, he should be in a rush.

145
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,120
He should be in a huge rush and just go for the last car out (grab on to that last chance)!

146
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,930
Hey...

147
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,520
Anyway, what a relief.

148
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,250
- I suspected that I'd live to an old age and die by myself.
- Why?

149
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,920
I feel bad leaving you behind and getting married. Do you think that's how people should live?

150
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,500
What's wrong with how I live?

151
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,590
I thought you could play around once medical school was over,

152
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,900
and an even harder residency.

153
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,270
I thought you could enjoy yourself a bit after that, but what came next was even worse.

154
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:18,480
What's that! I don't know how long its been since you wore nice clothes on vacation.

155
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,160
You've had a lot of dissatisfaction from me right?

156
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,390
Not really dissatisfaction. I was just worried.

157
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,000
Did you meet your dad?

158
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,660
No, I just...saw him from afar.

159
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,720
You. Just get married.

160
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,250
Why bring up marrying, out of the blue?

161
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,660
Anyway, you have to marry Teacher Hong. You liked him too.

162
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,310
You were someone who was going to throw everything away for him.

163
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,290
As you know, when I have a goal in mind, I keep going for that goal.

164
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:54,680
That's what I'm saying. So just love. Only walk down a rose-petaled path alright Dr. Yoo Hye Jeong?

165
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,130
In life, there's something called priorities, Miss Cheon Soon Hee.

166
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,760
Exactly, what's more important than lov—

167
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,690
You really don't listen! Ah, really...

168
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,520
Come here.

169
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,280
Surgical Records

170
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,630
Supine position and G/A upper midline incision

Surgical Records
Kang Mal Soon

174
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,050
Fine, I won't ask you for a ride today.

175
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,620
What is he? Is he playing hard to get?

176
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,410
Doctor!

177
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,800
Can I turn on some music? It's kind of awkward.

178
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,660
Whatever you'd like.

179
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,920
♫ Pretty young thing, doing that dance ♫ (Jeff Bernat - "Groovin'")

180
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,630
♫  Please just take my hand ♫

181
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,870
♫  I just happen to pass by you ♫

182
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:09,460
If I read this, us not talking won't be awkward.
♫ With a couple of my friends right by your table ♫

183
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,000
This isn't right. Someone's studying and someone's driving.

184
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,270
Lhis doesn't seem right. Let's listen to the news instead.

185
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:22,250
In a bid to make more money, some large hospitals are now investing in stocks.

186
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,320
Reporter Lee Dae Hyun.

187
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,550
Instead of focusing on the welfare of their community...

188
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,220
It's going to get noisy.

189
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,320
Just go ahead and study. I think it'll be better than listening to the news.

190
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,130
I hate politics. They're making up issues because they have nothing better to do.

191
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:43,170
They shouldn't disrupt our lives through issues that they make up because they have nothing better to do.

192
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,510
You're political.

193
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,370
I'm realistic.

194
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,750
Chairman, is it true that you purchased shares of a medical center to make profit?

195
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,950
A hospital is not a business. You are mistaken.

196
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,200
Aren't the shares in your name?

197
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,000
Wait in the hall. We will give you a printout.

198
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,230
- Did you give the order?
- Just one question!

199
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,780
Chief Director Jin!

200
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,400
Doctor.

201
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,690
Yes. It's busy since there's a commotion so early in the morning.

202
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,910
Father said not to worry, but is he really okay?

203
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,870
Would he be? It's war from now on.

204
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,700
Did you eat?

205
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,980
Anyway, you have to be at the frontlines of the battlefield now.

206
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,520
I'm a doctor. Healing patients is what I'm best at.

207
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,500
You do the politics and I'll just support you from behind. That's the unspoken promise between us!

208
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,520
But still, how could you become so serious over it?

209
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,040
I'm trying to make you do something you're good at. You know the 2012 London Olympics

210
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,010
gold medal archer Lee Soo Jung, right?

211
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,850
Of course I know. I was her fan. Does she still do archery?

212
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,060
They took disciplinary action because she went to compete after drinking.

213
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,170
Two years suspension from being a member of a national team.

214
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,130
Oh, she won't be able to participate in the Olympics.

215
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,090
Isn't this alcohol addiction since her hands are shaking?

216
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:12,790
I'll have to look into it more. It seems like action tremor (tremor upon voluntary movement),

217
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,420
but the causes of a shaking hand are varied

218
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,330
so a diagnosis is not easy.

219
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:23,180
Take care of athlete Lee Soo Jung. It seems like she's been to several hospitals.

220
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,560
She's quietly looking for a doctor to cure her.

221
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,510
I'm fine with taking over her treatment, but

222
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,760
what does this have to do with Father?

223
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,930
After I lost touch with Jin Myeong Hoon, I learned something.

224
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,850
- That Jin Myeong Hoon is a great doctor.
- Doctor!

225
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,180
So I went from wanting to fight him to wanting to win against him.

226
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,860
Jin Myeong Hoon has experience but what you need besides that is to know how to be realistic.

227
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,620
If I keep going against the hospital and its director, the hospital will have to close its doors.

228
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,980
Then who would listen to me?

229
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,840
You've changed a lot. I guess you've been through a lot.

230
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,720
But I like the change in you. I like the will for power.

231
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,940
I'm glad that you're back. I have someone to talk to now.

232
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,390
Anyway, my plan is to have you heal Lee Soo Jeong successfully and make your name known.

233
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:15,570
Then your name will give us strength and it'll be beneficial.

234
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,390
Director Jin Myeong Hoon

235
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,320
Let's go.

236
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,680
Why aren't you answering your phone?

237
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,610
It's another meeting. They call me every time. I hate it, but they call me. Isn't that strange?

238
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,070
I don't think I'll be able to help Lee Soo Jeong.

239
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,430
Tell me that's not going to happen, Ji Hong!

240
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,210
I'll pay.

241
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,570
Anyway, from now on, you're in charge of that doctor. Depending on how powerful you become,

242
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,100
How powerful you become in the future will determine my future.

243
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,380
Ah, you're getting old. You keep repeating what you said.

244
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,970
That's as important it is!

245
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,330
This is beyond your card limit.

246
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:01,260
That can't be... Hey look!

247
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,210
Because the Neurosurgery´s revenue dropped last month,

248
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,700
look at how they lowered my limit! Look at this!

249
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,840
I'll pay.

250
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,630
Guk Il Medical Center

251
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,450
Patient Hwang Ji Yeong, 90 days after her surgery has fallen into a stupor and responds only to pain,

252
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,290
while the x-rays look normal.

253
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,790
Doctor, I only just now got to send you a reply. Thank you.

254
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,350
What the heck? That's all?

255
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,330
What is it?

256
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,750
Recently her condition declined from clouded consciousness to stupor so—

257
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,690
Dr. Yoo Hye Jeong.

258
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,160
Hello.

259
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,370
Aren't you being too much? A text message and that's it?

260
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:40,100
You left a voice message, so I replied with a message. Is something wrong?

261
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,670
Nothing is wrong, but it doesn't have sincerity.

262
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,290
After entrusting your patient to someone else, how could you be so insincere?

263
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,280
Dr. Yoo!

264
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,550
They don't look like they're going to fight any time soon.

265
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,440
You obviously don´t know him well enough. He makes a big scene out of nothing.

266
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,870
Like this?

267
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,510
You scared me, you crazy idiot.

268
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,360
Stop hitting the head...

269
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,910
Where are you going?

270
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,320
Dr. Hong Ji Hong's research lab. How about you?

271
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,300
Me? What I mean is... same here.

272
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,550
Why did you change your mind so suddenly?

273
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:21,150
You said you wouldn't take on the hemifacial-spasm (HFS) patient, though I am thankful that you did.

274
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,040
It's family. It would've been simple if you'd said so. Why'd you make such a simple question into a hard one?

275
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,090
Because it's not simple to me.

276
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,800
I have also had a stepmom too. Not one, but two.

277
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,110
Of course, I have absolutely no interest in that person.

278
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,900
Why would you let someone bother you who's only a mom on paper?

279
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,300
You didn't get mistreated though, right?

280
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,850
- You're coming in quickly again. - Pardon?

281
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,840
No... You should come in when I'm ready to receive,

282
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,340
but I'm caught off guard because you keep coming in so suddenly.

283
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,430
What are you saying?

284
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,340
There's something like that.

285
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,430
I've decided to treat Patient Lee Ga Jin today.

286
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,610
I'll try to pick a surgery date as soon as possible too.

287
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,440
Okay.

288
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,540
Is "okay" all that you have to say?

289
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,870
Well, if someone displays kindness, you should reciprocate that gesture.

290
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,790
What kind of response is "okay"?

291
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,460
I don't have any pity for that woman's life and

292
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,450
I don't wish for her to get better either.

293
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:32,280
I couldn't handle it and asked for you to take over. This is the worst behavior for a doctor.

294
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:37,990
Something that comforts me is that she's still the same horrible person as before.

295
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,090
But it doesn't change the fact that my behavior is the worst.

296
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:47,250
That's why it wasn't so simple. Are you satisfied with my answer in response to your favor now?

297
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,740
Well... sort of.

298
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,680
I'm going now!

299
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,350
What are you doing? Who's protecting whom? This is something I'm supposed to do.

300
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,470
Yoon Do!

301
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,170
That kid...

302
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,340
Hello.

303
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,600
You look prettier every time I see you—

304
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,950
Stop talking bullsh*t again. Go in.

305
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,590
You come in, too.

306
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,670
Wh-What about me?

307
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,350
- What about me what?
- Shouldn't I go in?

308
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,550
Why would you come in? We have things to discuss.

309
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,770
We?

310
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,410
Yeah. We.

311
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,520
Are they a gang or something? What does he mean, "we"?

312
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,280
Neurosurgery's Kim Joon Kyung Joon

313
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,910
Yeah?

314
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,860
It's time for my appointment, right? I'm coming!

315
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,970
Ah I'm busy.

316
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,960
Surgery Records

317
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,610
There's nothing special about these surgery records.

318
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,290
What do you mean there's nothing special?

319
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,640
Do you mean there's no problem or that you can't tell from these records?

320
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,890
The latter. There's a super short and concise surgery chart and result record.

321
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,010
"A laparotomy was performed. In the middle of the surgery, cardiac arrest. Death." The end.

322
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:42,100
So you're saying that we can't know what happened or what went wrong inside the surgery room from these records.

323
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,960
But seeing how they even have scans of the hand-written records, doesn't that mean there aren't really any problems?

324
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,000
If they want to make it so that there aren't any problems, they can make it that way.

325
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,160
They can hide it starting from the hospitalization charts.

326
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,930
So if we want to know exactly what happened in that surgery room—

327
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:59,680
Anesthesia records. If we look at the anesthesia records, won't that be it?

328
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,780
Bingo. You didn't have the anesthesiologist's records?

329
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,210
That's what we don't have. These are all of the patient's records.

330
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,060
Then that's the end of it.

331
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:11,750
The anesthesia records could be stored in the Medical Records Department.

332
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,180
Would it be here when the surgery was performed elsewhere?

333
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,070
I understand.

334
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,790
Understand what?

335
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,780
It must be at the original location because the surgery was performed there.

336
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,740
I could probably tell the Medical Records Department at the original location.

337
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,430
You!

338
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,860
I will do it for you—go to the Medical Records department.

339
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,950
Doctor, stop here. I understand that you want to help but

340
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:45,210
this is my task. Something that someone else can't do for me. It's a journal-writing assignment.

341
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,770
Isn't it time for you to look at your outpatients?

342
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,890
How do you know my schedule? Did you look into it?

343
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,680
I'm a fellow working under you. Of course, I would know it.

344
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,640
My heart fluttered for no reason.

345
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,440
My heart fluttered for no reason!

346
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:17,630
Excuse me? When can I get the surgery done?

347
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:22,260
It usually takes six months in order for you schedule a surgery with me, but since it's Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong's request,

348
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,600
I'll do it for you soon.

349
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,490
Doctor, I can be treated, right?

350
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,270
Wait outside.

351
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,080
Please step outside. I will tell you about the process.

352
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,080
Please sit.

353
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,130
Did you come alone?

354
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,000
Yes... My parents are more worried than I am.

355
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,980
I don't want to give them useless hope.

356
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,320
When did the tremors start?

357
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,330
Ever since last year.

358
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,740
At first, my hand would amazingly stop shaking when I drank,

359
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,190
so I've even gone to competitions after having a drink.

360
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,210
Of course it ended badly.

361
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,780
Do you still drink?

362
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,740
I'm not that weak of a person, Doctor.

363
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,370
I'm not from a rich family and I've lived working very hard.

364
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,930
I got to this point with my own effort, but the result is...

365
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,620
Can you fix it?

366
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,680
I can do anything if my one hand will stop shaking.

367
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,870
Let's do some tests first.

368
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,810
Since there are so many causes for tremors,

369
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,220
it's hard to find it easily.

370
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,010
Never mind.

371
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,160
Even the doctors who told me that they could fix it for sure

372
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,490
weren't able to fix it.

373
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,780
I don't want to entrust someone who doesn't have conviction with this.

374
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,840
You're impatient, and quick to make judgments.

375
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,490
You must have not been like this in the past, right?

376
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,540
Even back when you got the gold medal at the Olympics.

377
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,600
You can trust me because of the fact that I don't have conviction.

378
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,200
Usually people who do well continuously doubt and retrace their steps.

379
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,500
That's how you avoid making mistakes.

380
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,380
You have to first be tested before the surgery.

381
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,040
You have to have blood and urine tests within a month of the surgery

382
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,780
If you go over a month, you just have to get another exam and get the surgery.

383
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,510
I have to wait over a month for the surgery?

384
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,400
Yoo Hye Jeong is my daughter!

385
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,250
Ma'am, you're really impatient. I'll tell you in a general sense.

386
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:52,270
If you're Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong's mother, then you're totally a VIP, so you can receive it in 2 days.

387
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,070
This is Doctor Jeong Yoon Do's special regard.

388
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,950
Is Hye Jeong that great?

389
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,340
She's really amazing!

390
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,430
Who cares if she's amazing? She needs to become a human being.

391
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:04,410
Look how she doesn't even show up when her mother comes to visit.

392
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,840
But I'm going to hold back since I'm her mother.

393
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,330
If I open my mouth about how she was when she was little,

394
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,600
do you think she'll be able to live in society normally?

395
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,120
- Mom...
- When do we receive the tests?

396
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,150
I'll arrange it so that you can receive them while you're here.

397
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,670
But do family members only get a discount for the surgery or

398
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,750
is there a discount for the consultation too?

399
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,080
It's available for the consultation too.

400
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,550
But why aren't you doing it for us?

401
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,640
After Doctor Yoo submits the proof of family relation document to the Human Resources Department,

402
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,950
she just has to let us know the treatment dates.

403
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,330
Aigoo, it's mountains over mountains.

404
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:39,980
There's nothing free in this world. How can we stand to see her showing off her influence?

405
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,340
Doctor!

406
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,930
Ah yes.

407
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,440
Could you tell me my sister's phone number?

408
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,280
My dad wants to see her.

409
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,270
What do you think it is?

410
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,340
She isn't 30 years old, so it isn't a degenerative disease (slow deterioration).

411
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,130
Is it a resting tremor or an action tremor?

412
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,350
Action tremor.

413
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,710
Is it intentional or essential tremor?

414
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,180
In the beginning, it was an intention tremor that only occurred during archery.

415
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,840
But now, it keeps shaking except when she's sleeping.

416
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,240
What are the causes for intention and essential tremor?

417
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,100
Intention tremors typically occur when there's something occurring with the hands.

418
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,280
For essential tremor, it's hard to pinpoint the cause.

419
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,590
What about treatment?

420
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:29,010
Pharmaceutical treatment is widely used, like Propranolol or Primidone.

421
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,000
Answer it like a neurosurgeon.

422
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,240
DBS? (Deep Brain Stimulation: implanting electrodes within certain areas of the brain)

423
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,270
That's right.

424
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:39,700
- Are you talking about performing an awake surgery in which the patient is conscious?
- Yeah!

425
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,850
- And I'm going in to assist?
- Of course.

426
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:47,340
Ahh! I love it! I've never done an awake surgery before.

427
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,420
I've imagined the day I would perform this surgery while watching videos.

428
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:55,810
That day has finally come. Thank you, Teacher!

429
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,270
You like things like this, huh?

430
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,170
Yes!

431
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,310
Ah, Doctor...

432
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,830
Yes!

433
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,950
What are you so happy about?

434
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,430
Have you tried DBS before? Awake surgery?

435
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,880
There's no way I would have done that yet.

436
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,910
Don't chances like that come to fellows in large hospitals like this one?

437
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,660
Are you showing off that you're from the countryside?

438
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,200
That's not something a fellow could do.

439
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,480
By any chance, you're not saying that you're going to do it, right?

440
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,060
Doctor Hong is doing it and I agreed to assist him.

441
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,130
Yes!

442
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,690
Come in.

443
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,470
Did you eat?

444
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,800
I want to go in. For Athlete Lee Soo Jung's surgery.

445
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,760
You said that you were going to work under Doctor Jeong Yoon Do last time.

446
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,800
I changed my mind.

447
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,890
The results don't change just because you change your mind.

448
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:14,580
It's unfair. You're giving a better chance to the woman you like.

449
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,270
- Hey!
- If you find that unfair, allow me to go in, too.

450
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,120
That's not something I can decide by myself.

451
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,730
Then call a meeting.

452
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:28,830
The reason I called for this meeting is because Doctor Jin Seo Woo

453
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,790
objects to the staff assignment.

454
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,090
I want to learn under Doctor Hong Ji Hong.

455
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,080
Alright, then. I'll do it with Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong.

456
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,730
Is everything over just because you two agree on it?

457
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,930
Honestly, Doctor Jin Seo Woo and I have always worked together so it's about time we change it up.

458
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,600
- Time to change what?
- You were the one who said you wanted to change.

459
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,020
Still, must you say it like that?

460
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,950
Stop, it. Is this some high school club meeting?

461
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,600
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong, what are your thoughts?

462
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,080
I already considered your offer and accepted it,

463
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,710
I don't want to change.

464
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,430
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong,

465
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,670
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong, as a fellow, you excel at cerebral artery surgery.

466
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,100
That inspires me.

467
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,870
That inspires me. Let's do it together. It'll help you to learn from me.

468
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,970
In conclusion, Jin Seo Woo and Yoo Hye Jeong want Hong Ji Hong,

469
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,410
Hong Ji Hong wants Yoo Hye Jeong and Yoo Hye Jeong also wants Hong Ji Hong.

470
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:20,090
Then without any other choice, Hong Ji Hong and Yoo Hye Jeong who want each other, will become one team.

471
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:24,370
Then at least allow me to participate in this surgery.

472
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,920
Doctor Jeong Yoon Do, what do you think?

473
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,810
Well, she wants to do that so let her do it.

474
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:37,270
Instead, let's rotate the fellows around when they're needed instead of having them as secured staff.

475
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,120
Rotate what? You talk so crudely.

476
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,850
Why do you always retort whenever I say something?

477
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:46,110
I will sum it up again. I will take Doctor Jeong Yoon Do's suggestion

478
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,460
and make it so that we train the fellows as needed for each situation. Are you in agreement?

479
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,520
Do you still not get it?

480
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,430
Get what?

481
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:03,100
- Get what?
- Can't you see that those two like each other?

482
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,700
That's liking each other?

483
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,950
I'm sure they're close to each other because he's her teacher.

484
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,450
You said they've known each other since they were young.

485
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,910
- You should go through it too.
- Go through what?

486
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:15,030
The pain of watching the woman you like liking another man.

487
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:19,840
You know that too. Even though I suck at maintaining a relationship, I'm awesome at starting one.

488
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,170
I haven't even started. Since there's competition, my competitiveness is shooting higher.

489
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,640
Yeah, my competitiveness is shooting higher too.

490
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,700
I don't know about any other woman, but I can never let you go to Hye Jeong.

491
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,900
I lost once, I can't lose twice.

492
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,220
Hey, why are you like this to me?

493
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,390
I've continued to bear it and just watched. Is this my reward for that?

494
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:42,280
I'll do whatever I have to do to have you. Be prepared.

495
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:47,100
What's wrong with her? She's scary...

496
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,180
Ah, we're not open yet...

497
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,520
Are you disappointed I showed up looking like this?

498
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,480
Did you pretend not to know me from the beginning?

499
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,840
No. I didn't recognize you because you became so pretty.

500
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,300
You've all become successful.

501
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,580
I heard that Hye Jeong succeeded the most. Did she really become a doctor?

502
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,780
Yeah, she was always smart.

503
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,800
Even while she wandered (lost her way), she seems to have always studied.

504
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,620
She used to use a lot of difficult words, too.

505
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,350
I came to say goodbye. I'm not delivering beer anymore.

506
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,210
Why?

507
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:30,640
I got fired this morning. After hearing about you all and becoming embarrassed of myself,

508
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,300
I drank like crazy and caused a ruckus.

509
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,070
You got drunk and lashed out? Aigoo, that's really bad for you.

510
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:40,660
Wow, you're rich. How much do you need to set up something like this?

511
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,910
I told Hye Jeong about you.

512
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,940
What did she say?

513
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,880
Do you still like Hye Jeong? You followed her everywhere before.

514
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,910
Hey, d-did she say that? Did she say that I always followed her everywhere?

515
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,410
Anyway, don't linger around her.

516
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,310
She already has her hands full these days.

517
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:02,750
Why?! Is she ashamed of me or something?! I should just flip this table over!

518
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,280
Chairman. You endured well during this time.

519
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,670
I was happy after hearing that would be out today.

520
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,610
That's why I made some time.

521
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,620
Old friends are the best kind of friends there are.

522
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,780
Have you been well?

523
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,010
Chairman, you look better.

524
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,780
Goodness, maybe my liver has gotten worse these days but I feel so tired.

525
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,150
Drink less.

526
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:48,200
When we first started this, we were worried about whether we would be able to accomplish it.

527
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,250
In the end, people are bound to gather where the money is.

528
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,320
This is how times change, Chairman.

529
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,900
As expected, you change with time so well.

530
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,150
These days, politicians are just like celebrities.

531
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,440
If you fall in popularity, you're done for.

532
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,950
Don't exaggerate. Should I talk about the level of caution you must exercise in a hospital?

533
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,840
On top of that, we even have to pretend to be nice.

534
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,050
If the hospital funds are given,

535
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:18,570
what will our Chief Director Jin whine about this time?

536
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:22,770
If that happens, our whining ends and our happiness starts!

537
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,880
But, while we're putting in our effort, it's the media that's a problem.

538
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,040
Don't worry. It'll work.

539
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,880
In the end, they will pass the changes in the medical law.

540
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,870
They said that Jejudo Hospital couldn't do it, but it did.

541
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:48,570
As expected, all of you are the best. I feel so assured.

542
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:53,410
But I was wondering. What happened with Chairman Hong?

543
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,940
You don't have to worry about him, I'll take care of him.

544
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,570
Now, let's run to the end tonight.

545
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,960
Yes, let's!

546
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,670
Um, where is the neurosurgery department here?

547
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,220
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

548
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,550
The surgery ended well and after looking you over, you don't seem to have any problems. You can be discharged tomorrow.

549
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,900
Thank you. When can I shower?

550
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,070
It's best to wait around a day after being discharged.

551
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,820
I can't wait to wash.

552
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,580
- I guess it hasn't come yet.
- What hasn't come yet?

553
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:44,630
I thought that you would tell me I'm cleared to leave tomorrow so I prepared a present for the doctors.

554
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,690
- By any chance, is it rice cake?
- Yes, it is.

555
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,050
They're eating it at the station right now.

556
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:54,460
You should go down and eat too. It's made from our rice so it's really delicious.

557
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,540
Yes, I'll be sure to eat it.

558
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:02,240
Wow, I've never seen this in my life. She really made a cake with rice.

559
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,050
This is really good.

560
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:07,210
Leave some for your colleagues so they can also be like, "I ate it too!"

561
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,240
What about the staff and other workers?

562
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,710
Alright, Hyung. I'll take care of Chief Kyeong Joon.

563
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,730
You have a really good character. You'd still do that after being hit so much?

564
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,570
That dog doesn't even know he's hated, so it's pitiful.

565
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,770
Go.

566
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,500
Are the professors still there?

567
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,440
Yes, they're there. Doctor Hong is out doing rounds

568
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,540
and Doctor Jeong Yoon Do is in the ICU.

569
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:36,080
By any chance, is there a Yoo Hye Jeong here?

570
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,440
What brings you here?

571
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,740
I don't think I need to tell you why I'm here. Is she here or not?

572
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,970
She isn't in.

573
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:53,410
If you leave your contact information, I'll make sure she calls you when she comes in later.

574
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,140
So that means she'll come sooner or later. I'll wait.

575
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,070
What is he? Shouldn't we call Doctor Yoo and tell her not to come here?

576
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,030
Hurry up and call her.

577
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,270
It's too late.

578
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,880
Doctor, have some.

579
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,210
- Hey.
- Yes?

580
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,440
This is so good. Do you even know who gave you this?

581
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,100
What are you doing?

582
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,990
You see, Doctor...

583
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,040
I feel suffocated. Move.

584
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,620
Yes...

585
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,990
Do you know him?

586
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,080
Yeah, he's my friend.

587
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,180
What is this? What happened? Why did you only come and find me now?

588
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,420
Aren't you embarrassed by me?

589
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,810
Why would I be embarrassed by you? We're friends. I heard about you from Soon Hee.

590
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,340
I'm a bit busy though, I barely have any days off.

591
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,040
Of course you're busy, you're a doctor in such a large hospital like this.

592
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,740
Hey, you got more handsome.

593
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,110
Really?

594
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,070
Goodness, look at your beard here. You look like Wolverine.

595
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:16,160
I don't think Wolverine is right.

596
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,840
Why is that punk here?

597
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,250
Is he someone you know?

598
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,160
How would I know that?

599
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,470
Why are you taking it out on me?

600
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,930
Don't you think you're thinking too much of our closeness?

601
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,630
Am I not allowed to do that?

602
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,690
You're allowed.

603
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,210
How have you been?

604
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:49,600
Not well, but after hearing about you, I came back to my senses.

605
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,950
I thought, "Hye Jeong did it."

606
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,570
I did it.

607
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,940
Thank you for treating me well when I was going through a hard time.

608
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,930
I haven't been able to do anything for you...

609
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:02,600
Starting now, let's see each other often. I'll buy you drinks.

610
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,870
Thank you.

611
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:11,580
I thought you would pretend not to know me because you're successful.

612
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,700
What's wrong with you, Mr. Kim Soo Cheol? Where did your great and mighty act go?

613
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:25,770
I came especially to say goodbye. Now that I think about it, I'm saying goodbye when I just met you again.

614
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,160
Are you going somewhere?

615
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,770
I'm going to see to my son.

616
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,020
Son?! Hey, are you married?

617
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:37,420
I'm divorced. Hey, should I show you my son? He's so handsome because he resembles me.

618
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,090
Show me.

619
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,170
Who raises your son?

620
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:47,560
His mother. I have to send them money.

621
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,920
Oh, he's so cute.

622
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,110
Right? He's cute, right? He takes after me...

623
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,710
Starting from now, I'm going to give it my all in life.

624
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:04,850
Seeing you, I think I can succeed if I try. Is it too late?

625
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:09,440
Nothing's too late. You're still awesome, the best.

626
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,650
I wanted to hear those words from you.

627
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,080
I think I can do well now.

628
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:18,630
Ah, do you still ride your motorbike?

629
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,480
Vroom, vroom, sometimes.

630
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,270
You were really cool when you rode your bike. I want to see it.

631
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,140
Just a moment.

632
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,310
Hello?

633
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,960
It's Dad.

634
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,880
- Pardon?
- I said it's Dad.

635
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,470
What's wrong?

636
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:49,380
Where are you right now? Let's meet.

637
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,370
Alright.

638
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:57,640
I'm sorry but I think I have to leave now.

639
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,050
You have to see me before you leave. You have to, alright?

640
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,740
Yeah, let's leave now.

641
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,780
This is where your grandma is.

642
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,210
Why did you move her?

643
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:33,970
The ten-year contract ended, and I wanted to move her to a better place.

644
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,970
I see you've been well.

645
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:56,350
I own a restaurant now, Grandma's Rice Soup.

646
00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:01,510
I didn't know before, but I take after my mother in cooking skill.

647
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:05,760
The restaurant made a name for itself. It's nice.

648
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,830
You should come sometime.

649
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:13,700
Yeah, you should come with your coworkers sometime. I'll treat you all well.

650
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,590
I'll leave now.

651
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:22,340
Wait, you didn't drink all of your tea yet.

652
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,140
I'm now an adult who doesn't need my parents' guidance.

653
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:29,750
Hye Jeong, you can't live like that.

654
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,740
How can you live your life to the fullest if you have so much resentment against me?

655
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:36,420
Don't worry, I don't have any resentment towards you.

656
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:43,350
Like I said, the time during my childhood when I needed you is now over. I'm used to living alone.

657
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,220
Let's live separately, like we've done until now.

658
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:50,720
Whose hand will you hold when you walk down the aisle? You need me.

659
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:56,180
I'm not going to get married because I might need you.

660
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,730
Hello.

661
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:43,790
Oh Cho Hwan, you're here. I'll start in five minutes.

662
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:49,420
Come in. Sit down.

663
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:59,210
Now, from now on, I'll give you a diagnosis on your illness.

664
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:05,310
You just have to decide whether you'll follow my treatment plan or not.

665
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,550
Surgery Status

666
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:11,250
Operating Room; Lee Ga Jin
Go Ah Shin

667
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,910
Recovery Room: Choi Jeong Hoon
Jin Seo Joo

668
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:40,070
Start counting down from 10 slowly.

669
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:45,340
Ten, nine, eight...

670
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:51,370
Seven...

671
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:53,060
Please start intubation.

672
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,620
♫

673
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,460
Put cotton here.

674
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,870
Dissector.

675
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,860
Is a lateral spread response displayed? (An abnormal response of the muscles in response to stimulation).

676
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,460
Yes it is displayed.

677
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,730
Cottonoid.

678
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:54,440
Do you still see a lateral spread response?

679
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,390
No.

680
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,550
Has it disappeared?

681
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,960
Yes.

682
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,080
Good.

683
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,620
Your hand trembles because of essential tremor.

684
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,620
Your hand shakes without a specific reason.

685
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:12,490
How can you diagnose it if you don't know the cause?

686
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:17,000
Hand trembling from an unknown cause, that's my diagnosis.

687
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,560
What's important is the treatment method.

688
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:25,050
DBS. It's deep brain stimulation. Please look here

689
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:26,830
We will stimulate the deep brain

690
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:31,100
and to confirm that the tremors are gone, we'll be doing an awake surgery.

691
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,620
It's a surgery that's done while you're awake.

692
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:39,420
I've seen this in a movie before. Doesn't it hurt?

693
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,650
Not at all. You don't feel pain in your brain.

694
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:46,130
You will be under anesthesia just until we open your cranial dura mater.

695
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:51,230
What if the tremors don't stop after stimulating the brain?

696
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,170
Could that happen?

697
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,180
Yes, that's possible.

698
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,960
The side effects are that when you're anesthetized,

699
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,230
you may suffer paralysis,coma, hemorrage inside the brain, and convulsions.

700
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,700
It could also lead to temporary or permanent nerve damage.

701
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,340
Then, what is the success rate?

702
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,770
Around 90%.

703
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:13,560
Really?

704
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,190
Yes.

705
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,850
- Thank you!
- Not at all.

706
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:21,430
You can thank me after you win a gold medal in the Asian Games or the Tokyo Olympics.

707
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,220
Does that mean I can start archery again?

708
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,910
Of course.

709
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,480
By any chance, could I upload a video of my surgery?

710
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,540
Why?

711
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,730
I want to regain some of my honor.

712
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:39,880
My hand wasn't shaking because I was an alcoholic,

713
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,600
and even with this illness I still tried to become the best archer.

714
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,160
Even if the surgery fails,

715
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,480
I want to show that I did my best in whatever situation I was in.

716
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,690
I'll cheer for you. I'll do whatever you want.

717
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,450
Come in.

718
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,420
Doctor.

719
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:21,290
You may not be curious, but I'm going to tell you anyway. The surgery was a success.

720
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,650
Yes, thank you.

721
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,710
- Are you really thankful?
- Of course.

722
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,130
Then let's eat together.

723
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,260
Okay. Then let's meet at the cafeteria later.

724
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:32,420
Not the cafeteria. Isn't that too cheap?

725
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:36,130
How can a thank you meal be fulfilled with some cafeteria food?

726
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:39,930
Honestly, I'm not that thankful to the point I want to buy you a meal.

727
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:44,100
Then I'll buy the meal. You can buy the tea, right?

728
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,200
I'm not thankful enough to the point to buy tea, either.

729
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,000
Then I'll buy both the meal and the tea, alright?

730
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,350
I'm sorry. I don't think we're close enough to eat a meal and drink tea together in a personal setting.

731
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:59,520
No— Now close do we have to become to eat together?

732
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,730
You usually get closer by eating together.

733
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:05,310
Do you not want to become close with me?

734
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,060
Why are both of you quiet when I come in?

735
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,220
You came in when I finished talking.

736
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:20,360
Then it's her turn to answer. Why aren't you answering?

737
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,090
It's not that, let's do it later.

738
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:23,450
Do what later?

739
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,300
Why are you digging so much?

740
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,770
Did you get rejected after asking her out to eat?

741
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,730
That is such an old-fashioned pick up line.

742
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,480
Hey! Are you going to keep acting like this?

743
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,660
Hey, you and I may be close but we're at work now and I'm your superior.

744
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,440
Mind your manners.

745
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:46,090
What in the world?

746
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,150
Come to the laboratory to talk about Patient Lee Soo Jeong's surgery.

747
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,960
He texted you first.

748
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:06,800
That...she's laughing? I'm holding in my feelings.

749
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,520
Hey, sorry I'm late. I ran into the director out front. Sit down, sit down, sit down.

750
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,860
Ah, these boxes.

751
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,620
Has the date been set for Patient Lee Soo Jeong's surgery?

752
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,890
Yeah, for tomorrow.

753
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:22,130
That fast?

754
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:26,020
I'm prepared. I practiced in my head.

755
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:34,730
Honey is literally dripping from their eyes. I'm right here...

756
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:38,190
Come out early tomorrow morning and prepare. Two assistants is more than enough, right?

757
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:39,620
Yes.

758
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,770
Ah, they're loving each other.

759
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:52,310
Then, I'll leave first.

760
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,100
Yeah, alright.

761
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,130
Are you not going to leave?

762
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:01,590
I'll leave later.

763
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:05,580
Hey, that's good. Help me move these boxes, they're so heavy.

764
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,280
Seo Woo, come here. Quickly.

765
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,230
Come on.

766
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:11,300
You worked so hard. Thank you so much.

767
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,630
It's nothing. The surgery was a success so don't worry.

768
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:18,030
Yes, we heard from Doctor Jeong Yoon Do.

769
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:22,520
He said that he placed a cotton ball between the blood vessels that were pressing on the nerves.

770
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:28,640
Maybe it's because you're Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong's father, but you understand quickly and speak so well.

771
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,090
Ah, there's Doctor Yoo.

772
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,760
Thanks to you, the surgery was a success.

773
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,290
Yes.

774
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,850
- Did you dress the patients?
- Yes.

775
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:43,850
- Let's go.
- Yes.

776
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,810
Do we have anything to eat?

777
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:02,350
- We have leftover rice cake from yesterday. Shall I bring it?
- Yeah.

778
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:05,100
Yes sir! I've received your command, I'll be right back.

779
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,810
You're acting up.

780
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:18,050
- Can I sit down?
- Sit.

781
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:28,100
Dad said to give this to you as a family member.

782
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:33,330
Unni, do you hate me too?

783
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:36,790
No, I don't have any sort of feelings towards you.

784
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:42,230
I'm so happy that I have an older sister. I was really lonely by myself.

785
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:46,610
This might seem cold, but I like how I am now.

786
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:49,560
I hope that I won't get mixed up with your family anymore.

787
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:56,660
I'll take care of this. Please stop your parents.

788

Yoo Hye Jeong
Yoo Yoo Na

790
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,840
Soo Cheol

791
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,170
Yeah, Soo Cheol.

792
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,350
I'm leaving Seoul tomorrow.

793
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:30,070
It's been a while, but I really want to show you my amazing back view before I leave. Is that okay with you?

794
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,390
That sounds nice.

795
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:34,270
Okay, deal!

796
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:46,650
I guess it's the end of our carpool. Why? Are you upset?

797
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:50,400
No. If your car didn't come by today, I was planning on finding a lover,

798
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,560
making her sleep over, and riding together.

799
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,770
This... Why isn't this door opening?

800
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,120
He's cute, that rascal...

801
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,850
Lover?

802
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,930
That's nice.

803
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,410
Oh, you look like your past self.

804
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:42,750
- I'm going to sell it after riding it today.
- Good thinking.

805
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,520
Where should I buy you food?

806
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:47,150
- You're going to buy?
- Of course.

807
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:51,230
My younger sister became a doctor. I have to at least buy you a meal.

808
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:54,600
Then let's go to our hospital's cafeteria. It's really cheap and delicious.

809
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:58,890
Hey, cheap and delicious is exactly my style!

810
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,150
Let's go.

811
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:18,430
♫ I want you, as if I've been bewitched  ♫
Yoo Hye Jeong

812
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:31,160
♫  You are breathtakingly beautiful  ♫

813
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:39,000
♫  I don't know anything but you  ♫

814
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,930
♫  It is heart-wrenching  ♫

815

Incoming Call: Hong Hong Hong

816
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,930
Yes, Doctor.

817
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,750
Your voice is bright.

818
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:52,050
- I'm going to work with a friend right now.
- With Soon Hee?

819
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:55,540
No. With Soo Cheol, a friend I made when I went all out.

820
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,990
Hey! Don't hang around him.

821
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:00,730
You can't tell me not go hang around my friend.

822
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:13,550
♫  Tell me that you love me  ♫

823
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:19,030
Ah, seriously... You're a bit... Yeah...

824
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:21,240
Do you like him that much?

825
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,830
What is it? What's wrong?

826
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,600
Hye Jeong!

827
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,930
It was always like this.

828
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:18,960
Love brings fear and fear... consumes me.
