00:00:24,593 --> 00:00:26,943
Episode 11

2
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:30,363
You always say to do everything together.

3
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:34,473
Why do you act by habit?

4
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:39,503
Is that love? That's a nuisance.

5
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:41,903
I don't do love that becomes a nuisance.

6
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:55,403
Sincere love lets you meet a sincere person.

7
00:00:55,403 --> 00:01:01,533
It touched a part of me that I didn't know. I didn't know that I was this kind of man.

8
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:23,303
Hello? Hello?

9
00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:26,363
Hello? If you don't speak, I'm going to hang up.

10
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:33,783
It's the hospital's number...

11
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:35,973
02-2722-5355

12
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:39,563
If you called, please speak.

13
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:41,623
Hello?

14
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:43,363
Hye Jeong.

15
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:50,453
It's the director, right?

16
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,683
You know me?

17
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:03,823
Of course I know you. Guk Il Medical Center's director. You're Director Jin Myeong Hoon.

18
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:07,553
I didn't know you would call me personally.

19
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:31,103
Surgical Records

20
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:34,613
Exactly what relationship does this woman have with Hong Ji Hong?

21
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,693
Request for a disciplinary action resolution?

22
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:47,443
Yes, the audit team requested it.

23
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:52,163
Yoo Hye Jeong, fellow in neurosurgery, accepting a bribe for her services? What did she receive?

24
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:54,583
She received a foreign car from a patient.

25
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:58,463
I thought she did something terrible. Why would you report this?

26
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:02,383
I thought it was something that could be passed, but the informant kept...

27
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,323
Who's the informer?

28
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:06,893
It's Doctor Jin Seo Woo.

29
00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:17,753
Please wait a bit.

30
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:18,993
Why isn't she picking up the phone?

31
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:21,983
Hey! How can they leave a patient alone? Isn't the doctor coming?

32
00:03:21,983 --> 00:03:24,683
She said she'll come, but she's not answering her phone!

33
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:27,763
- I didn't pick up the phone and came immediately.
- Sorry.

34
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:30,753
- Where's the patient?
- Over there, Doctor.

35
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:35,333
I'm here. You're fine now. What happened?

36
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,233
A car came towards me suddenly.

37
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,593
Where does it hurt the most?

38
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:41,913
My stomach hurts the most.

39
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:43,883
I'm going to take a look.

40
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:57,053
I suspect liver contusion so do a CT scan.

41
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:58,863
Yes, I understand.

42
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,483
Doctor, please save me.

43
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:02,223
Guardian, keep calm, okay?

44
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:05,683
- What's going to happen to this girl?!
- Please calm down!

45
00:04:05,683 --> 00:04:09,063
What do you mean calm down? I'm going to die if this girl doesn't live!

46
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:10,613
I said to calm down. It's okay.

47
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:14,643
Hurry! Get out of the way!

48
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,253
Wow, there are so many patients today.

49
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:33,123
The guardian can't go in.

50
00:04:33,123 --> 00:04:36,953
I have to be by her side.

51
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:39,063
I have to be by her side.

52
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:41,993
Please don't be like this. What happened to the patient?

53
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:45,323
She rolled down the stairs while moving the furniture into the new house.

54
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:49,093
So she lost consciousness starting from then?

55
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:52,043
Honey, I'll be next to your side,

56
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:56,153
so don't worry!

57
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:58,853
Honey!

58
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:01,493
Please calm down.

59
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:04,263
I'll look at her just once.

60
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:08,323
Doc, what do I do? She seems like she's seriously hurt.

61
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:11,283
Just once... Just once.

62
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,393
You came?

63
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:35,933
You must've woken up because of me. I brought your favorite dumpling.

64
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:39,493
You ate this a lot during the summer when I was in high school.

65
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:45,063
Do your work. Don't pay attention to me.

66
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:49,193
I'm concerned, so how do I not pay attention to you. Do you want some?

67
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:56,023
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,393
For what?

69
00:05:57,393 --> 00:06:02,013
I'm just a father in name. You grew up by yourself.

70
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:06,223
I relied on you more than you relied on me.

71
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:09,863
When I first saw you,

72
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:12,743
you said you had the eighth grade disease. (A term people refer to as puberty.)

73
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:15,353
Father was pretty immature, only to me.

74
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:18,103
To others, you were more mature.

75
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:22,423
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,393
Ah, why are you like this, Father?

77
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:30,863
I think this is the first time in my life resting like this on a bed.

78
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:39,113
It would be nice if I could see you get married before I die.

79
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:41,943
You'll even be able to see a grandson.

80
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:46,213
It would really be nice if I saw that.

81
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:48,753
Ah, seriously. Why are you like this, Father?

82
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:54,383
I don't know. It's my condition.

83
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:56,883
Ah, seriously.

84
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:02,113
I can't really do this because it's cheesy, but I guess I'll have to do this today.

85
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:15,393
Because you were my father,

86
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:19,003
I really liked it. I like it now too.

87
00:07:20,353 --> 00:07:22,663
I liked it too.

88
00:07:41,673 --> 00:07:43,863
In Joo.

89
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:47,953
- How's your first day?
- How do you think it is?

90
00:07:47,953 --> 00:07:50,903
Sorry, I asked something too obvious.

91
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:54,573
I heard the Chairman underwent surgery​. Why didn't you tell me?

92
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:57,873
You said you'll kill me if I got involved with that before you start working here.

93
00:07:57,873 --> 00:08:00,923
Let's have a drink together with Ji Hong later.

94
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:05,213
That would be nice. I'm going to go see the Chairman first.

95
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:07,563
My heart hurts too much.

96
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:13,243
Ji Hong came and left.

97
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:19,943
Your BP is normal. How is the pain in the area on which we operated?

98
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:21,113
It's okay.

99
00:08:21,113 --> 00:08:23,623
On a scale from 1 to 10, what is it?

100
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:27,953
As if I'd doubt you being a neurosurgeon. You're very persistent.

101
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:33,713
This is fun. That's what I said to my patients.

102
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,323
About 3?

103
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:37,203
So you're okay.

104
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:42,423
Chairman, I'm In Joo.

105
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:46,863
Oh, In Joo. So you came to work.

106
00:08:49,393 --> 00:08:54,363
Yes. You're a bad person. So what if you're the best surgeon?

107
00:08:54,363 --> 00:08:57,053
Your health is a mess.

108
00:08:57,053 --> 00:09:01,863
Ah, stop it. I've been scolded enough by Ji Hong.

109
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:04,243
Greet each other. This is Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong.

110
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:07,023
She's a fellow in the neurosurgery department.

111
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:08,273
Hello.

112
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:12,583
You grew a lot. You grew up well.

113
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,133
We've met before, Teacher.

114
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:17,863
Neurosurgery Choi Kang Soo

115
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:20,813
Pick up and go.

116
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:25,893
To a doctor, patients are number one.

117
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:27,853
I understand.

118
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:36,313
I should have met you earlier, but I was so busy living life.

119
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:41,973
Of course you have to be busy. A young body is busy.

120
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:44,413
There's excessive bleeding from liver damage.

121
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:45,823
Yes.

122
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,223
We have a 31-year-old female in the emergency center after falling down the stairs.

123
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:56,133
Her CT scan shows a skull fracture in the area of the parietal lobe and it looks like an epidural hemorrhage that's three times the thickness of the bone.

124
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:58,753
We also suspect SSS (Superior Sagittal Sinus) bleeding.

125
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:01,483
She has normal pupillary reflex but almost no motor skills.

126
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:05,293
Because of excessive bleeding due to liver damage, general surgery is coming down right away.

127
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:08,633
- Stairs? Was it at the house?
- I'm not sure.

128
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:11,023
What stairs?

129
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,723
Ah, damn it...

130
00:10:14,723 --> 00:10:16,733
He's Jo Soo Jin's husband.

131
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:18,553
Hello.

132
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:23,903
Doctor, it's all my fault.

133
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:26,583
I shouldn't have let her go to work.

134
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,993
- Did she roll down the stairs at work?
- Yes.

135
00:10:29,993 --> 00:10:34,923
The CT scan is over and we'll tell you the results soon. Please wait a little longer.

136
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:36,543
Okay.

137
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:45,203
Ma'am. Ma'am?

138
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,673
Should I call Professor Hong Ji Hong?

139
00:10:56,673 --> 00:10:58,883
Yes. Get the operating room ready too.

140
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:00,563
Okay.

141
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:07,413
We'll have to do an emergency surgery. Don't you have to do an emergency surgery too, because of the bleeding?

142
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:10,663
We have to decide who goes first, so call your professor in charge.

143
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:12,573
Okay, I got it.

144
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:23,483
Vitals?

145
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:27,873
The BP is 90/60. The pulse is 95. He's an emergency room inpatient.

146
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:33,273
Although the abdominal CT scan shows grade 3 liver injury, an active hemorrhage was detected.

147
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:34,933
She will have to undergo an emergency surgery.

148
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:37,123
Okay, I'll be down.

149
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:53,633
The patient's (medical) history?

150
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:56,063
There's nothing special.

151
00:11:57,613 --> 00:11:59,973
Get an operating room and call the anesthesiology department.

152
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:02,503
I already did.

153
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:05,283
- Okay.
- The general surgery department is coming.

154
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:07,753
We have to listen to what the doctor-in-charge has to say.

155
00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:12,803
Since the liver bleeding is severe, you will need to discuss which surgery the patient needs first.

156
00:12:12,803 --> 00:12:15,853
I think that'll work. I understand.

157
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:22,663
You can't even notify me properly? Why are you having such a difficult time?

158
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:24,953
How can you  just  tell me that the patient injured her head?

159
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,893
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,653
In Joo!

161
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:32,503
I heard you were coming. When did you start?

162
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:36,393
Starting from today. Later, let's have a drink together with Ba Ran.

163
00:12:36,393 --> 00:12:38,373
We meet again.

164
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:42,543
Please finish talking. I'll prepare for the surgery.

165
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:50,773
For some reason, I don't think she feels good right now. Are you two dating?

166
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:54,193
Wait, don't answer. I don't want to know right now.

167
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:56,123
You're still the same, seeing how you ask questions and answer them by yourself.

168
00:12:56,123 --> 00:13:00,133
Where would I go? What do you want to do?

169
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:02,733
We'll go first. The bleeding area is critical.

170
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:03,943
Where's the bleeding area?

171
00:13:03,943 --> 00:13:05,413
Superior sagittal sinus.

172
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:07,713
We're in a hurry too, so finish up in two hours.

173
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:10,683
Two hours. Okay.

174
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:13,173
After the neurosurgery unit finishes, set up the surgery again and call me.

175
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:15,643
Okay.

176
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:19,943
Doctor, this is patient Jo Soo Ji's guardian.

177
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:22,183
Hello. Come over here please.

178
00:13:22,183 --> 00:13:24,423
This white part here—that's all bleeding.

179
00:13:24,423 --> 00:13:31,673
This is occluding the brain. If we don't perform the surgery quickly, it can result in permanent brain damage.

180
00:13:31,673 --> 00:13:35,033
If you do the surgery, can you get all the blood out?

181
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:38,453
Yes, my assistant will tell you the rest in detail.

182
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:39,573
Come with me.

183
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:43,933
I will provide the surgery consent form and I will explain the details of the surgery.

184
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,433
What are you doing here?

185
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:10,773
Honey... Honey!

186
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:22,233
You know something? You can't leave me.

187
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:27,403
Even if you die... You're mine even if you die.

188
00:14:32,963 --> 00:14:37,773
Don't ever say that you are breaking up with me.

189
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:41,233
Are you listening?

190
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:44,653
Huh?

191
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:46,983
You can't come in here.

192
00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:52,803
I wanted to see her for the last time before the surgery.

193
00:14:52,803 --> 00:14:58,213
You don't have to worry because Doctor Hong Ji Hong is really skilled.

194
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:00,483
Please take good care of her.

195
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:30,333
I'm going to watch with the others later. Do you want to come? You know In Joo.

196
00:15:31,353 --> 00:15:34,553
- Is "The Giving Tree" your concept?
- Hm?

197
00:15:34,553 --> 00:15:38,133
Or is "Daddy Long Legs" your concept?

198
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:41,943
You're supposed to be mad at me right now. That's normal.

199
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:45,153
There's nothing more infuriating then someone not knowing how you feel.

200
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,833
I'm not normal.

201
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:52,783
But I'm a little mad right now.

202
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:24,833
Let's don the gown.

203
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:37,793
Alright.

204
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:41,503
Give me the drill.

205
00:16:58,613 --> 00:17:00,103
About Ji Hong's assistant ...

206
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:03,233
Yeah, Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong. Do you know her?

207
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:06,493
- Are they dating?
- Really?

208
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:13,013
- Keep providing irrigation and suction.
- Yes.

209
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:19,213
- Please switch this out. And please provide me with more gauze.

210
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:20,433
Yes.

211
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:22,033
Okay.

212
00:17:25,853 --> 00:17:28,843
Have you seen a case like this at your hospital?

213
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:33,823
No. You have to open this patient's head wide.

214
00:17:35,173 --> 00:17:38,173
The hemorrhaging can suddenly appear.

215
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:40,733
I see that it's important to get a good view.

216
00:17:42,473 --> 00:17:44,093
Elevate.

217
00:17:51,323 --> 00:17:54,003
- Irrigation.
- Yes.

218
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:56,693
Bipolar.

219
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:08,293
BP is falling. Squeeze the blood. Anesthesiologist.

220
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:18,753
Vice President's office

221
00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:24,373
I'm scared. This is too scary for timid person like me. What if we get fired?

222
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:27,263
No way. We won't get fired.

223
00:18:27,263 --> 00:18:32,693
Anyway, I am a temporary employee. But regular employees like you could be slightly nervous.

224
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:35,213
Are you making fun of me?

225
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:37,063
What are you doing here?

226
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:38,193
Chief!

227
00:18:38,193 --> 00:18:41,073
- Why?
- We have something to say.

228
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:45,923
Go on, what is it?

229
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:52,053
About the car that was presented to Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong... She couldn't return it because of us.

230
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:54,493
Doctor Yoo was going to return it right away.

231
00:18:54,493 --> 00:18:57,853
I used the word "entire" on that foreign car and she...

232
00:18:57,853 --> 00:19:00,913
I got it. You can go.

233
00:19:01,763 --> 00:19:04,583
So nothing is going to happen?

234
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:10,433
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

235
00:19:15,283 --> 00:19:18,513
Discplinary Action Request Form

236
00:19:21,523 --> 00:19:23,733
Give me new gauze.

237
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,913
Blood pressure is continuing to drop.

238
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:32,213
It's okay. Please change the suction tip to a thicker one.

239
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,833
And please prepare the hemostatic pad.

240
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:45,193
Where is the hemostatic pad?

241
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:50,683
Gauze.

242
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,793
Irrigation.

243
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:14,183
I got a hold of it, right?

244
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:22,073
Ji Hong is still the same.

245
00:20:22,073 --> 00:20:25,453
So do you still hold affection toward him?

246
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,733
Affection, my butt. Am I in my twenties right now?

247
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:37,293
- Finish up.
- Yes.

248
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:41,563
Call Professor Jo In Joo and tell her that we're finished with the surgery.

249
00:20:41,563 --> 00:20:44,413
There's no need to call. I'm on my way down now.

250
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,843
Jin Myeong Hoon

251
00:21:17,113 --> 00:21:19,423
Why are your clothes like that?

252
00:21:19,423 --> 00:21:21,793
Regardless, I have to take this off once I resign from the position of director.

253
00:21:21,793 --> 00:21:27,733
Don't you trust me? One step back and two steps forward. Look further ahead.

254
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:30,603
I didn't tell you this, but among the surgeries I've done up to now,

255
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:34,603
I collected the files of the patients for whom there might have been a ruling of medical malpractice.

256
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:36,903
One of the accidents was read by Chairman Hong.

257
00:21:36,903 --> 00:21:39,183
Why would you collect something like that? You should have gotten rid of them!

258
00:21:39,183 --> 00:21:41,623
I changed the records, so it won't be a problem.

259
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:44,113
If I had the energy to change them, I would have just thrown them away.

260
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:48,953
They're my records! I treasure every single moment of my life.

261
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:51,253
There has to be a mistake to show virtue.

262
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:55,673
What ridiculous nonsense. Did you come all the way up here because you were talented?

263
00:21:55,673 --> 00:21:59,703
You're here at a place like this today because I supported you wholeheartedly from the bottom!

264
00:21:59,703 --> 00:22:04,383
You're acting like a crazy fool! Why aren't you replying?

265
00:22:04,383 --> 00:22:08,533
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go visit Doo Sik.

266
00:22:19,443 --> 00:22:21,663
It hasn't been two hours, right? I kept my promise.

267
00:22:21,663 --> 00:22:25,833
You still haven't finished it. You should have finished everything in two hours.

268
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:29,283
We'll finish it. My fellow is quite talented.

269
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:32,773
Where should we go then? There are five minutes remaining.

270
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:53,123
You saw that, right?

271
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:54,763
Good for you.

272
00:23:08,443 --> 00:23:11,463
- The surgery went well
- Thank you so much.

273
00:23:11,463 --> 00:23:14,613
However, the damage was severe to begin with,

274
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:17,753
so we're not sure whether she can fully regain her consciousness.

275
00:23:17,753 --> 00:23:20,593
So it's possible she won't recover fully?

276
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:24,153
We'll only know the details after she regains consciousness.

277
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:27,393
Can I meet my wife right now?

278
00:23:27,393 --> 00:23:31,513
She's in the recovery room right now. As soon as she wakes up from the anesthesia, she'll be moved to the ICU.

279
00:23:31,513 --> 00:23:36,293
Then, I can meet her there. Thank you so much.

280
00:23:56,773 --> 00:23:59,813
Disciplinary Action Committee Report

281
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:08,853
Chief Kim Tae Ho

282
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:10,343
Did Patient Hong Min Ah's fever go down?

283
00:24:10,343 --> 00:24:14,263
Yes, it went down after I gave her a fever reducer, but her temperature is still 39˚.

284
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:18,033
- All culture (blood, urine and sputum bacterial culture test) and septic lab (a blood test to check for septicemia) results are out, right?
- Yes, the results will be out before noon.

285
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:19,083
Yeah?

286
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:23,123
Is there anything we can do to lessen Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong's disciplinary action punishment?

287
00:24:23,123 --> 00:24:26,143
I'm planning to meet the diirector later. Have you met the director before?

288
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:28,873
We just exchanged greetings.

289
00:24:28,873 --> 00:24:32,373
Oh, I think you'll run into him often so become familiar with him. That'll be good.

290
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:33,933
Yes.

291
00:24:45,273 --> 00:24:47,133
Are you okay?

292
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:51,273
Your color looks good.

293
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,503
I was worried but I'm relieved after seeing you.

294
00:24:58,503 --> 00:25:01,133
Are you upset with me?

295
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:06,133
Yes. Acknowledge everything I've done for this hospital.

296
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:07,143
Myeong Hoon!

297
00:25:07,143 --> 00:25:10,633
If I hadn't acknowledged you, would I have left you in that position?

298
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:15,033
We all know you're doing well. We're just telling you to take a break.

299
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:18,803
Welcome.

300
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:20,503
Hello.

301
00:25:22,973 --> 00:25:26,333
I'm not worried about Doo Sik because of you.

302
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:30,763
Since he never married, I was very anxious for him in a corner of my heart.

303
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:33,063
It's a relief that Doo Sik and you became family.

304
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:34,973
Thank you for worrying about us.

305
00:25:34,973 --> 00:25:39,673
You should come visit my office sometime too. I'm the director who's supposed to resign, but until I resign, let's be on good terms.

306
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:41,563
Our families are tied anyway.

307
00:25:41,563 --> 00:25:43,513
Yes, I'll go see you often.

308
00:25:43,513 --> 00:25:48,223
Then, we'll leave now. Doo Shik, recover well.

309
00:25:48,223 --> 00:25:50,573
Yeah, alright. Go.

310
00:26:02,703 --> 00:26:06,113
Is Guk Il Hospital now the world of Hong Ji Hong and Kim Tae Ho?

311
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:09,153
Don't you even have any pride? What are you doing to Doo Sik?

312
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:13,463
Then what else can I do?! I have to at least pretend to submit if I want to survive.

313
00:26:13,463 --> 00:26:17,623
How many times do I have to tell you to trust me? We'll find the evidence soon!

314
00:26:21,853 --> 00:26:23,993
Why do you keep coming here?

315
00:26:23,993 --> 00:26:30,023
Just because, but I don't think the director has any intention to resign yet.

316
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:32,903
They're not planning this all by themselves, are they?

317
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:38,803
In the end, people are bound to gather where the money is.

318
00:26:38,803 --> 00:26:42,723
Chairman Jung Il Sung, Assemblyman Nam In Soo.

319
00:26:42,723 --> 00:26:47,983
Seong Jeong. Myeong Hoon. The project to make Guk Il Medical Center a company owned by stock holders.

320
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:51,153
The ambitions of those four people match perfectly.

321
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:52,523
Why Jungsoo Fire Insurance?

322
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:56,293
To prepare for the privatization of health care, they are expanding their private health insurance.

323
00:26:56,293 --> 00:26:59,473
Father, you should pass the investigation of the stocks to me.

324
00:26:59,473 --> 00:27:02,523
No, stay out of it.

325
00:27:02,523 --> 00:27:06,913
Since I started this, I'm going to end it.

326
00:27:06,913 --> 00:27:11,373
You should just do what a doctor does. That's you.

327
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:19,403
Dad

328
00:27:21,613 --> 00:27:22,473
Yes, dad?

329
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:26,513
I heard that you reported a fellow in your division to the Board of Audit and Inspection for receiving a present.

330
00:27:27,323 --> 00:27:27,893
Yes.

331
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:31,493
Let me ask you your opinion before they open the disciplinary committee.

332
00:27:43,893 --> 00:27:48,343
I reported you to the Board of Audit and Inspection.

333
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:55,803
You criticized me telling me that my specialty is ruining people by using an unseen majority power.

334
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,303
I won't do that anymore.

335
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:00,623
Do you want to tell me it's unfair?

336
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:05,303
You're not the only one who receives presents from patients, so are you upset that you're the only one who got called out?

337
00:28:05,303 --> 00:28:09,713
No. Regardless of the situation, it was my mistake.

338
00:28:09,713 --> 00:28:11,523
I don't like you.

339
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:20,783
Yeah, dislike me in front of my face. Hate me in front of my face, that's better.

340
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,473
At the very least, you don't deceive me about it, so it's nice.

341
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:27,043
Everything I want, you gain it so easily right next to me.

342
00:28:27,043 --> 00:28:32,253
If I hadn't met you, I would be living as a much better person right now.

343
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:38,053
I gained things easily? No matter how easily I gain things, I can't gain them easier than you.

344
00:28:38,053 --> 00:28:39,473
What?

345
00:28:40,573 --> 00:28:47,023
I didn't tell you to hate me. That's an emotion you feel on your own.

346
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:52,763
The same goes for liking other people. I didn't tell you to do it,

347
00:28:54,893 --> 00:28:57,393
so why are you taking it out on me?

348
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:03,413
After listening to you, you're right. You didn't tell me to do anything.

349
00:29:04,213 --> 00:29:09,883
You didn't tell me to like him... Why am I like this?

350
00:29:31,423 --> 00:29:35,283
What I'm curious about is why you made the report. Is it because of ambition?

351
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:37,063
Or do you not like that fellow?

352
00:29:37,063 --> 00:29:40,173
The hospital rules state that you shouldn't receive presents from patients.

353
00:29:40,173 --> 00:29:42,683
So it's because of ambition?

354
00:29:42,683 --> 00:29:46,253
What I hate the most is people who value those useless things!

355
00:29:46,253 --> 00:29:50,843
Why is that useless? For an organization to be sustained—

356
00:29:55,353 --> 00:29:58,833
I told you to quietly gain power right now, but this is what you go around doing?

357
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:03,963
I told you to act close to everyone. What if people find out that you're the one who reported it? Do you think they'll like you?

358
00:30:03,963 --> 00:30:08,393
I like that fellow who received the present. I should treat her, bring her over sometime.

359
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:13,653
Why aren't you saying anything? You have to become close to people like that fellow!

360
00:30:13,653 --> 00:30:16,593
Learn! Learn from her!

361
00:30:41,683 --> 00:30:43,823
Alright, we'll see.

362
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:58,853
The amount of bleeding has increased, so within 12 hours take a CT again,

363
00:30:58,853 --> 00:31:02,883
and while you're checking on the artificial respirator, check the ABGA (Arterial Blood Gas Analysis) every day.

364
00:31:02,883 --> 00:31:05,393
And confirm the draining (the amount of blood discharged) while dressing.

365
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:07,073
Yes.

366
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,923
But, why isn't she waking up yet?

367
00:31:09,923 --> 00:31:14,163
It can be because the anesthetic hasn't worn off yet. It hasn't been long, so we'll be waiting for a little bit more.

368
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,863
Yes.

369
00:31:18,203 --> 00:31:20,413
- You were here?
- Yeah.

370
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:22,353
Hi.

371
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:26,023
Are you the guardian?

372
00:31:26,023 --> 00:31:28,083
Ah, yes. I am her husband.

373
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:32,203
Although her liver damage wasn't severe, the hemorrhage in her hepatic artery was.

374
00:31:32,203 --> 00:31:34,743
But we treated her well, so don't worry too much.

375
00:31:34,743 --> 00:31:36,833
Thank you.

376
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:37,953
Her consciousness?

377
00:31:37,953 --> 00:31:40,353
It's not coming back yet.

378
00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:43,803
Do a followup on the CT, and there can be delayed bleeding so watch the patient carefully.

379
00:31:43,803 --> 00:31:45,133
- Yes.
- Hey.

380
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:47,693
Just because you came into our department, don't slack off and come often to see her.

381
00:31:47,693 --> 00:31:48,913
Yes, sir.

382
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:50,393
Alright.

383
00:31:51,403 --> 00:31:55,373
Don't nag at our kids. I'm going to do it.

384
00:32:01,263 --> 00:32:03,323
Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit

385
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:05,873
- Aren't you done with work?
- Yeah, I'm done.

386
00:32:05,873 --> 00:32:09,993
- Do you want to come too later?
- No, I have work to do later.

387
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:18,013
Did you guys fight? No wait, you aren't the type to fight with someone.

388
00:32:18,013 --> 00:32:20,183
I don't want to, but it seems like we got into a fight.

389
00:32:20,183 --> 00:32:25,463
That's a good thing. It means that you love each other. I used to do that to you a lot in the past.

390
00:32:25,463 --> 00:32:31,893
It seemed like you unconsciously rejected someone who came deeply inside your life.

391
00:32:31,893 --> 00:32:38,633
When a woman and man love, if one cannot go into the other's life deeply, she becomes lonely.

392
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:40,113
Hey, you sound like a philosopher.

393
00:32:40,113 --> 00:32:44,763
To be married, and then divorced. It's a good environment to be a philosopher.

394
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:46,433
I'll see you later.

395
00:32:47,283 --> 00:32:48,873
Oh, right!

396
00:32:51,043 --> 00:32:55,583
I did something wrong to Hye Jeong in the past.

397
00:32:55,583 --> 00:33:00,643
I was too young to take care of her at that time. I'm sorry.

398
00:33:00,643 --> 00:33:02,673
What are you talking about?

399
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,853
Chief Kim Tae Ho

400
00:33:20,093 --> 00:33:22,013
Yes, Chief.

401
00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:27,503
I met the director before I came here, because of your disciplinary incident.

402
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:32,913
I'm sorry, because of my careless actions, that I gave you a hard time.

403
00:33:32,913 --> 00:33:38,003
I accept disciplinary action. You don't have to worry.

404
00:33:38,003 --> 00:33:42,553
You can never know what the world has planned for you.

405
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:46,053
Our Hospital Director decided to let it go this time.

406
00:33:46,053 --> 00:33:52,313
Moreover, he seems to like you a lot.

407
00:33:54,153 --> 00:33:58,223
So let's forget the disciplinary matter, and work hard.

408
00:33:58,223 --> 00:34:00,013
Thank you.

409
00:34:00,013 --> 00:34:03,703
Visit Professor Hong Ji Hong. He worried a lot.

410
00:34:03,703 --> 00:34:07,943
When he interferes in other's matters, he worries about what he can do by himself.

411
00:34:07,943 --> 00:34:11,213
But this time, he asked me for a favor.

412
00:34:27,383 --> 00:34:28,943
Yes?

413
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:50,953
I'm here after seeing the Chief. He said that you asked him for a favor because of me.

414
00:34:50,953 --> 00:34:55,553
I heard from In Joo, that she did something wrong to you in the past. Why didn't you tell me?

415
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:57,823
Don't change the topic.

416
00:34:57,823 --> 00:35:02,783
For the problem with Unni In Joo, she and I will solve it. There's nothing to tell you.

417
00:35:02,783 --> 00:35:06,953
Hye Jeong, when you're like this, I'm flustered, and confused.

418
00:35:06,953 --> 00:35:10,133
Please treat me formally.

419
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:14,513
Meet me formally with the man inside you.

420
00:35:16,763 --> 00:35:20,333
Do you know why I said I would do my task by myself?

421
00:35:23,043 --> 00:35:26,503
Because I don't like you being in danger because of me.

422
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:32,343
I'm desperately fighting against you coming into the darkest parts of my life.

423
00:35:37,873 --> 00:35:43,753
You have given everything to me, and I know that you are a man who would find things that don't exist, as well.

424
00:35:45,053 --> 00:35:50,093
If I accept everything from you, I won't be able to live without you

425
00:35:50,093 --> 00:35:54,413
because you would be in control of my life.

426
00:35:54,413 --> 00:36:01,873
You give everything to me, but you don't let me step once into your life.

427
00:36:03,263 --> 00:36:06,523
I also want to give everything to the man I love.

428
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:11,333
I want to go deep into his life, and be in control of his life.

429
00:36:12,093 --> 00:36:16,343
But you do everything by yourself.

430
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:19,603
You don't need anyone but yourself.

431
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:30,693
But if you don't love me anymore, what happens then?

432
00:36:30,693 --> 00:36:32,493
That won't happen.

433
00:36:32,493 --> 00:36:35,803
There isn't anything that won't happen.

434
00:36:37,743 --> 00:36:40,693
Do you know what I am most afraid of?

435
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,573
Being abandoned.

436
00:36:57,713 --> 00:37:00,343
What can I do?

437
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,603
Change.

438
00:37:33,973 --> 00:37:36,873
I don't believe in love between a man and a woman.

439
00:37:36,873 --> 00:37:42,423
But if I have to love, that one person will be Hong Ji Hong.

Yes, Doctor.

457
00:39:26,903 --> 00:39:29,923
- Doctor Yoo.
- Yes.

458
00:39:29,923 --> 00:39:34,193
You know I'm a loser, right? That I change my mind quickly.

459
00:39:34,193 --> 00:39:36,403
I know.

460
00:39:36,403 --> 00:39:40,153
When you said that if you have to love a man, that one man,

461
00:39:40,153 --> 00:39:46,613
would be Hong Ji Hong, that means that you don't love anyone at the moment.

462
00:39:46,613 --> 00:39:49,693
What do you mean?

463
00:39:49,693 --> 00:39:55,483
Regardless of you, I'm just going to go my way... The shallow route.

464
00:39:59,183 --> 00:40:00,983
Good night.

465
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:41,297
♫ Loving you, do you still remember ♫

466
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:48,297

00:40:55,417 --> 00:41:02,247
♫ So dazed me I was breathless  ♫

469
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:09,687
♫ You are everything in my life. Now I've placed you ♫

470
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:12,937
- What can I do from now?
♫  I can´t love anyone else but you  ♫

471
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:15,007
Change.

472
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:22,037
♫  Don't say you're sorry, No way. Don't leave me, No way  ♫

473
00:41:22,037 --> 00:41:25,547
♫  The breath you gave me once again  ♫

474
00:41:25,547 --> 00:41:29,727
♫  Lonely, lonely, hug me  ♫

475
00:41:29,727 --> 00:41:35,033
♫  Don't let me go, No way. Never never never never No way  ♫

476
00:41:35,033 --> 00:41:37,307
♫  you live within me  ♫

477
00:41:38,727 --> 00:41:44,437
♫  You are the only one ♫

478
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:47,017
♫  You're my ♫

479
00:41:47,017 --> 00:41:52,817
♫ You're my love ♫

480
00:41:56,797 --> 00:41:58,797
Uh yes.

481
00:42:00,507 --> 00:42:02,017
Let's go.

482
00:42:14,437 --> 00:42:18,007
- When are you eating lunch later?
- I don't know.

483
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:34,107
Hello.

484
00:42:34,107 --> 00:42:39,067
She's woken up. Do you hear me?

485
00:42:40,217 --> 00:42:43,017
If you hear me, please blink.

486
00:42:48,117 --> 00:42:52,527
Yes, try to follow my fingers with your eyes.

487
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:06,527
You can hear our words and can move your eyes. Try and say ah.

488
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,847
Try and move your fingers.

489
00:43:32,347 --> 00:43:35,177
Do you feel me holding onto your hands right now?

490
00:43:38,417 --> 00:43:41,117
Okay, you've worked hard.

491
00:43:41,117 --> 00:43:42,997
Let's get an MRI immediately.

492
00:43:42,997 --> 00:43:44,137
Okay.

493
00:43:44,137 --> 00:43:46,957
Imaging Lab

494
00:43:54,037 --> 00:43:58,027
- What do you see?
- I see a damage to the pons on the brain stem.

495
00:43:58,827 --> 00:44:00,417
What do you think it is?

496
00:44:04,287 --> 00:44:06,357
Locked-in syndrome.

497
00:44:06,357 --> 00:44:10,047
When you say locked-in syndrome, do you mean feeling locked inside your body,

498
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:13,347
having consciousness but not being able to react to external stimulations?

499
00:44:13,347 --> 00:44:15,367
That's right. It's locked-in syndrome.

500
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:18,267
I've only read about this in books. This is the first in a real life situation.

501
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:22,927
We need more time to be certain, but right now this is our best guess.

502
00:44:23,677 --> 00:44:26,007
Will she be able to get better again?

503
00:44:27,187 --> 00:44:29,007
The chances are very low,

504
00:44:29,007 --> 00:44:33,467
but there are some cases where they miraculously get better. Anyway, let's keep watching.

505
00:44:33,467 --> 00:44:35,457
Explain it well to the patient's guardian.

506
00:44:35,457 --> 00:44:38,307
- Okay.
- Alright.

507
00:44:46,307 --> 00:44:50,237
You come too often. It doesn't feel that great.

508
00:44:50,237 --> 00:44:52,347
Why?

509
00:44:52,347 --> 00:44:57,167
It feels like since I'm a person who's about to die, you're being good to me.

510
00:44:57,167 --> 00:45:02,027
Father, this won't do. You don't know a person's heart.

511
00:45:02,027 --> 00:45:06,397
Now you're not going to be able to see my face. I'm only going to show you if you beg to see it.

512
00:45:06,397 --> 00:45:11,147
Okay, fine. I have nothing to lose.

513
00:45:29,457 --> 00:45:31,817
By the way, what will the husband do...

514
00:45:31,817 --> 00:45:35,627
It looks like he quit his job and is just hanging around here.

515
00:45:35,627 --> 00:45:40,587
Even so, she's alive. If she's alive, then there's hope.

516
00:45:40,587 --> 00:45:43,747
If he really loves her, he'll be able to get through it.

517
00:45:43,747 --> 00:45:46,287
I think he really loves her.

518
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:50,947
All the ladies in the neuro department are saying he's their ideal type, a pure man.

519
00:45:50,947 --> 00:45:53,197
Doctor.

520
00:45:53,197 --> 00:45:55,247
What's happening?

521
00:45:55,247 --> 00:45:58,877
She can't speak at all, she also can't move.

522
00:45:58,877 --> 00:46:02,667
Calm down first. Let's sit there for a bit.

523
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:05,467
How can I be calm right now?

524
00:46:05,467 --> 00:46:09,197
She just laying there like a living corpse.

525
00:46:12,657 --> 00:46:14,537
I'm sorry.

526
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:16,227
No, it's okay.

527
00:46:27,897 --> 00:46:31,247
It isn't as bad as I thought.

528
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:34,537
You can think, you can have feelings.

529
00:46:34,537 --> 00:46:39,947
It's just that you can't move comfortably.

530
00:46:39,947 --> 00:46:45,227
Ah right. You really liked dancing. You won't be able to dance again.

531
00:46:45,227 --> 00:46:48,147
But it's okay for me.

532
00:46:48,147 --> 00:46:53,427
Then I won't have to see you playing with other men.

533
00:46:56,857 --> 00:47:01,387
You can open your eyes. Open them.

534
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:07,647
I love you.

535
00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:35,217
Pay attention to patient Kim Jin Han's pain control. Give the antibiotics in advance.

536
00:47:35,217 --> 00:47:36,767
Yes.

537
00:47:39,627 --> 00:47:41,707
Why are you avoiding me?

538
00:47:44,087 --> 00:47:45,937
I'm not.

539
00:47:47,247 --> 00:47:50,797
We're going to start radiation therapy next week, so inform her thoroughly so she won't worry.

540
00:47:50,797 --> 00:47:51,957
Okay.

541
00:47:51,957 --> 00:47:54,897
Hey, he's leaving. He's leaving.

542
00:47:56,347 --> 00:47:58,847
- Who?
- What?

543
00:47:59,687 --> 00:48:03,117
- Over there. Locked-in syndrome patient's husband.
-Ah.

544
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:07,787
He's so cool. He's really affectionate, and he's the type that only looks at one girl.

545
00:48:07,787 --> 00:48:11,307
There's someone I know that's like that too. The type that only looks at one girl.

546
00:48:11,307 --> 00:48:14,717
Who is it? Is it Doctor Jeong Yoon Do?

547
00:48:14,717 --> 00:48:16,977
Doc Jeong is trash.

548
00:48:21,257 --> 00:48:24,997
Why am I here? Thinking I'd hear something nice.

549
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:33,437
As expected, the only person who can catch Knife Yoon is Doc Jin.

550
00:48:35,387 --> 00:48:39,237
Doc Jin got rejected by Knife Yoon.

551
00:48:39,237 --> 00:48:43,077
- What's good about Knife Yoon?
- If you can just get him, he's a catch.

552
00:48:49,437 --> 00:48:50,997
Seo Woo.

553
00:48:53,777 --> 00:48:57,197
This is work. A professional place.

554
00:48:57,197 --> 00:49:00,407
I don't like it when people talk about you.

555
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:03,957
Why? Are people saying things because I got rejected by Knife Yoon?

556
00:49:03,957 --> 00:49:06,357
Yeah.

557
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:10,097
I'm humiliated, Yeong Gook. Why am I hanging over a man?

558
00:49:10,097 --> 00:49:12,297
Because you're a woman.

559
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:16,837
As expected of Bi Yeong Gook. You're clear.

560
00:49:16,837 --> 00:49:19,877
It's true. It's because I'm a woman.

561
00:49:22,437 --> 00:49:27,287
Change your style in men! There's no man that's worth respecting!

562
00:49:31,337 --> 00:49:34,307
The food you ordered is ready.

563
00:49:34,307 --> 00:49:36,657
Hey! Why didn't you show up yesterday?

564
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:40,897
The two of you probably drank together. Soon Hee!

565
00:49:40,897 --> 00:49:43,197
Teacher!

566
00:49:45,487 --> 00:49:51,187
Hello, do you not remember me? I remember you.

567
00:49:52,967 --> 00:49:55,597
You're starting again. We'll meet again later.

568
00:49:55,597 --> 00:49:58,027
- We'll be dating the third time we meet.
- Yes.

569
00:49:59,377 --> 00:50:00,867
Is business going well?

570
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:04,707
Yes. It usually goes well.

571
00:50:04,707 --> 00:50:07,757
Why isn't Hye Jeong with you?

572
00:50:07,757 --> 00:50:10,117
I think she's being sulky towards me.

573
00:50:10,117 --> 00:50:14,577
Not sulky, but you probably did something wrong.

574
00:50:14,577 --> 00:50:19,187
Yes, I did something wrong. I forgot for a moment that you were best friends. Give me a lot of good food.

575
00:50:19,187 --> 00:50:21,067
Okay!

576
00:50:42,937 --> 00:50:45,687
I know that you can think.

577
00:50:46,787 --> 00:50:50,097
I know that you can feel, as well.

578
00:50:53,027 --> 00:50:56,247
You need to open the door closed through surgery.

579
00:50:56,247 --> 00:51:00,767
You need to think that you have to get out, no matter what.

580
00:51:03,157 --> 00:51:05,367
Please help me.

581
00:52:06,687 --> 00:52:08,917
Go outside so that we can talk.

582
00:52:12,237 --> 00:52:14,617
What are you doing here at this time?

583
00:52:14,617 --> 00:52:16,137
Are you feeling okay?

584
00:52:16,137 --> 00:52:18,057
I'm okay.

585
00:52:18,057 --> 00:52:21,017
How could you do this to me?

586
00:52:21,017 --> 00:52:24,447
What did you say while giving me the breakdown of my secret fund? You said that was it.

587
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,157
So?

588
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:32,107
So...? That wasn't all that was remaining from my secret fund!

589
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,047
I found it while searching through your office!

590
00:52:35,047 --> 00:52:36,067
What?

591
00:52:36,067 --> 00:52:39,497
What did our Myeong Hoon do so wrong? Who raised the hospital this far?!

592
00:52:39,497 --> 00:52:43,097
By raising the hospital, your stomachs have only gotten plumper.

593
00:52:43,097 --> 00:52:47,677
What benefit does it bring for us? Never judge from the appearance...

594
00:52:49,507 --> 00:52:51,137
How have we come this far?

595
00:52:51,137 --> 00:52:53,437
That's what I am supposed to say.

596
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:56,997
Since you can't handle your son, are you eating out of the palm of his hand?!

597
00:52:56,997 --> 00:53:02,557
When you get older, your child's road becomes your road.

598
00:53:03,367 --> 00:53:07,217
From there, the road with you and me has changed.

599
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,737
You are out of your mind.

600
00:53:10,737 --> 00:53:14,897
Now its war. You and me, Ji Hong and Myeong Hoon! Let's fight.

601
00:53:14,897 --> 00:53:16,547
I told you to leave the kids!

602
00:53:16,547 --> 00:53:19,357
You say to leave the kids but why are you taking our Myeong Hoon?!

603
00:53:19,357 --> 00:53:22,797
Do you think I'll leave Ji Hong alone?!

604
00:53:22,797 --> 00:53:28,637
Hey, hey hey! Seong Jong! Seong Jong!

605
00:53:28,637 --> 00:53:31,297
Seong Jong! Seong—

606
00:54:02,547 --> 00:54:06,637
- Hey, let's toast, toast.
- Cheers!

607
00:54:10,037 --> 00:54:13,537
I like it, I like it. I really like alcohol.

608
00:54:13,537 --> 00:54:17,997
Between all of us, In Joo is the strongest with alcohol. Then me. You're last, Ji Hong.

609
00:54:17,997 --> 00:54:22,037
Hey! Do you know how hard it is to keep up with you guys with alcohol?

610
00:54:22,037 --> 00:54:23,117
Quit drinking.
 Chief Kim Tae Ho

611
00:54:23,117 --> 00:54:26,087
Doctor Kim Tae Ho

612
00:54:26,087 --> 00:54:27,957
- Yes, Chief.
- Where are you?

613
00:54:27,957 --> 00:54:29,917
Soon Hee Hawaii.

614
00:54:29,917 --> 00:54:32,877
Quickly come here! Something happened to your father.

615
00:54:32,877 --> 00:54:34,777
I'm going to go to the hospital.

616
00:54:34,777 --> 00:54:37,037
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, hey! Where are you going?

617
00:54:37,037 --> 00:54:38,487
Ah, wait!

618
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:55,947
Did he have these symptoms before?

619
00:54:55,947 --> 00:55:00,777
It's embolic brain infarction. A clot developed on the left cranial artery.

620
00:55:00,777 --> 00:55:01,887
Let's hurry.

621
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:06,777
Firstly, we should call Dr. Jeong Yoon Do to get an angiography.

622
00:55:06,777 --> 00:55:09,437
Gyeong Joon, first take my father back into his room.

623
00:55:09,437 --> 00:55:10,327
Yes.

624
00:55:10,327 --> 00:55:13,647
Guk Il Medical Center

625
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:17,167
Code Blue. 17th floor VIP ward.

626
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:18,657
Code Blue. 17th floor VIP ward.

627
00:55:18,657 --> 00:55:19,817
Father.

628
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:21,277
Hey!

629
00:55:24,127 --> 00:55:28,687
- What happened?
- I believe a ventricular fibrillation rhythm arose from an arrhythmia.

630
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:33,747
The blood pressure is dropping.

631
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,977
Bring the defibrillator.

632
00:55:34,977 --> 00:55:38,667
The chairman had already signed the DNR agreement.

633
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:41,587
Don't do cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

634
00:55:41,587 --> 00:55:42,757
Bring it!

635
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:44,507
Bring it!

636
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,147
This is not what the chairman wanted!

637
00:55:47,147 --> 00:55:52,477
Not waking isn't strange. I don't want to forcibly prolong my life.

638
00:56:08,017 --> 00:56:09,927
He's in arrest.

639
00:56:09,927 --> 00:56:12,297
Please bring me the defibrillator.

640
00:56:19,737 --> 00:56:21,997
Bring the defibrillator!

641
00:56:30,347 --> 00:56:32,827
Charge to 200 joules.

642
00:56:32,827 --> 00:56:34,637
Shock!

643
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:44,267
Clear. Shock!

644
00:56:48,187 --> 00:56:50,887
Clear. Shock!

645
00:56:56,107 --> 00:56:58,287
Clear.

646
00:56:58,287 --> 00:57:00,017
Shock!

647
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:37,157
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

648
00:57:39,217 --> 00:57:45,777
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

649
00:57:45,777 --> 00:57:50,527
To a man, a father figure is similar to yourself.

650
00:57:50,527 --> 00:57:56,027
To lose a father is similar to losing yourself.

651
00:57:56,027 --> 00:57:59,587
That day, I lost myself.
