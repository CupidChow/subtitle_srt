00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,320
Episode 13

2
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,290
A relationship is a joint history made both by the woman and the man.

3
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:58,010
How many of each other's past scars are understood and can be currently taken in

4
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,910
is the keyword of the love life written together.

5
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,440
- You're tired, right?
- Yes.

6
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,390
I'm being punished every day for the entire week.

7
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,130
- The chief is a little harsh.
- Not like it's two days.

8
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,360
Doctor, did the surgery finish?

9
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,720
Yeah. How's Lee Hye Jeong's mental state?

10
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,390
She's drowsy.

11
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,680
Neurosurgery Choi Kang Soo

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,510
Yes?

13
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,960
It's an emergency room patient. He fainted after trying to pick up his chopsticks that fell during dinner.

14
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,840
The CT shows a chronic subdural hematoma and he is in a mentally confused state after the fall.

15
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,140
Has he had any collision or fallen hard recently?

16
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,050
He said he had a minor fall off his bicycle around 3 weeks ago.

17
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,590
He likes rice wine.

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,470
Tell Gyeong Joon to get an operating room and then come upstairs. Yes.

19
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,500
- Work hard.
- Work hard.

20
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,000
Hong Hong Hong

21
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,000
Hye Jeong

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,290
Yes, Hye Jeong?

23
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,100
What are you doing?

24
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,110
Should I go?

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,250
I asked what you're doing. I'm in the elevator, so I'll get disconnected.

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,240
*89
Two new messages

27
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,210
*89 - Voicemail

28
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,550
But why aren't you asking the second question?

29
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,350
Let's date? My answer is yes. Yes.

30
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,100
To send, press 2.
Oh no.

31
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,530
Oh my, this. This was recorded. What do I do?

32
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,650
This has to be deleted.

33
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,400
Thank you for being a customer.

34
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,460
Guk Il Medical Center

35
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,220
Elevator.

36
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,170
Give me a self (retainer).

37
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,300
Irrigation.

38
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,810
Irrigation.

39
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,290
What time did you sleep?

40
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,720
Ah, yes. I'm sorry.

41
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,500
Do you want me to put you to sleep forever? Buried?

42
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,840
Go ahead and leave.

43
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,320
Go before I change my mind. I'll do it all.

44
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,280
I'm okay.

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,850
One, two—

46
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,260
Yes. Thank you.

47
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,090
Bipolar.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,930
Hello doctors. The midnight snack has arrived.

49
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,980
He's here!

50
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,140
Here, here!

51
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,530
Here? I'll put it here. Ah, Doctor Ahn Joon Tae likes me the most.

52
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,930
Ah, of course.

53
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,570
He doesn't like you the most, he likes this the most.

54
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,510
Here you go.

55
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,280
Ah, yes, thank you. Have a good meal. Have a good meal.

56
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,050
- Yes.
- Yes.

57
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,960
Yeong Gook, hurry up and come here.

58
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,380
Ah, come here.

59
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,160
- Ah, that surprised me!
- Ah, that surprised me!

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,380
Hello, Doctor.

61
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,810
Yes, go safely.

62
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,230
Hey, you guys ordered something. Why didn't you call me?

63
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,660
It just came. Just came.

64
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,350
E-Excuse me, could I ask you just one thing?

65
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,820
You can ask two things.

66
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,880
It's a seven-year-old boy...

67
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,100
If he waddles when he walks, there must be a problem, right?

68
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,140
Who is it? The seven-year-old boy?

69
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,240
He's my son.

70
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,790
You have a son? I thought you were a bachelor.

71
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,790
I have two sons. One is 9 years old and the other is 7 years old.

72
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,860
Ah, that must be nice.

73
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,240
Anyway, how does he waddle?

74
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,770
So when he walks, his leg bends a little.

75
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,160
When we went to the neighborhood hospital,

76
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,080
they said there could be a problem with the brain and to go to a big hospital.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,310
I'll set up an appointment for you, come by. You can meet Doctor Hong Ji Hong.

78
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,840
- Ah, really?
- Yes.

79
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,540
Thank you, Doctor. No, thank you, Doctors.

80
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

81
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,680
- Thank you.
- And make sure to call when you come.

82
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,900
Did you do back-to-back surgery, Doc? You're tired, right?

83
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,360
Well, it's work.

84
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,610
As expected.

85
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,330
Doctor. What's going on? You aren't on duty.

86
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,370
I was just stopping by to see if everything was fine.

87
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,190
Ah, you're really amazing.

88
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,840
How can you only think about your patients? Right?

89
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,180
Yes.

90
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,330
I'll be back.

91
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,240
Okay.

92
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,750
What's going on?

93
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,500
You called me over.

94
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,590
- I did?
- Weren't you calling me over when you asked what I was doing?

95
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,730
Stop looking at me.

96
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,050
Are you going to take a break now?

97
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,170
Yes. I was thinking of closing my eyes for a bit.

98
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,120
That can't be though.

99
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,160
You're not late yet, right?

100
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,140
Yes, it's okay.

101
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,750
Oh, Hye Jeong.

102
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,430
Doc!

103
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,100
- Hye Jeong.
- Ah, seriously.

104
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,880
People can't see us.

105
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,720
We can go somewhere that people can't see.

106
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,080
Out of the trails in our hospital, this trail is the safest.

107
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,010
Why could we have come to the safest trail?

108
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,240
Hey, I like going on walks.

109
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,620
Ah, by the way, I saw this in a movie, and I wanted to try it.

110
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,670
Put your hand out.

111
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,170
Is it good?

112
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,010
Then I'll do this.

113

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,310
Wow, Kang Soo.

125
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,530
What?

126
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,320
A 29-year-old male. He got hit by a billboard while walking.

127
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,600
Mental state is deep drowsy, and the GCS ( Glasgow Coma Scale ) is 7 points.

128
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,210
Take a CT scan, I'll go immediately.

129
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,110
Okay.

130

Today's romance ends here.

Oh my baby. How do you laugh so nicely like this?

136
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,510
My vitamin.

137
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,530
What about me? What am I?

138
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,930
You're the moon. You're Dal. (Dal is the word for moon in Korean)

139
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,470
Yeah, you're Dal. You're Nam Dal.

140
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,440
Why is Hyung the vitamin?

141
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,010
You're my vitamin.

142
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,390
- Nam Dal?
- Ah, yes!

143
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,740
Come on in.

144
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,420
Let's go in!

145
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,300
- Hello.
- Yes. Hello.

146
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,790
Please sit.

147
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,540
Hi Dal!

148
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,070
You have to say hello!

149
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,640
Hello.

150
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,890
You can be the dad.

151
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,880
Why did you come in today?

152
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,920
He didn't before, but he started to limp when he walks.

153
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,470
- Nam Dal.
- Yes.

154
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,250
Can you walk in front of me?

155
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,080
Let's walk for him.

156
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,770
Start at the nurse, and slowly walk over to me.

157
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,010
Good job. Now walk over back to your dad slowly.

158
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,310
Wow. The revenue for the neurology department has increased a lot this month.

159
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,780
We've gone up 2 billion won more than last month.

160
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,170
Like I told you before, it's thanks to Doctor Hong Ji Hong.

161
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,700
It's because of the DBS surgery video of Olympian Lee Soo Jeong.

162
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,120
I've told you, it's all about marketing.

163
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,530
It's nice to see Deputy Director Kim Tae Ho do as I ask.

164
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,350
And please continue to do so in the future.

165
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:56,160
The company card, it'll be restored to its original state and the neurosurgery department vacation will be restored as well.

166
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,590
I am a very rational person.

167
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,320
We are starting our hospital anew.

168
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,910
As we speed up the process of building the Elderly Rehabilitation Center,

169
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,940
Let's turn our hospital into one for the future of the 21st century!

170
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,200
I do think he has a problem in his brain. We have to take an MRI to be sure.

171
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,070
Ah, I see.

172
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,800
Are you uncomfortable somewhere?

173
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,440
Oh no, it's nothing.

174
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,340
- Dad, I have to go to the restroom!
- It's almost over, just wait a little.

175
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,760
- I think I'm gonna burst!
- Just wait a second.

176
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,060
But, the MRI is uninsured, right?

177
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,810
Yes, but not all cases are uninsured.

178
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,800
- If it shows to be a disease after the test, then insurance will cover.
- Oh, is that so?

179
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,860
I can't wait anymore!

180
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,330
I'm sorry, Doctor.

181
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,780
It's okay. Your children are very cute.

182
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,850
Are you okay? You should be careful!

183
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,100
- Restroom, restroom!
- Over there!

184
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,260
Ta da!

185
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,870
Thank you!

186
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,250
Your smile is very pretty. Where are your parents?

187
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,540
I don't know. I ran out because I needed to pee.

188
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,510
They'll probably be where you came from before then, right? Let's go!

189
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,770
- But, Noona, are you a doctor too?
- Yep!

190
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,010
You're very pretty.

191
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,140
Thank you. That's something I've been needing to hear lately.

192
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,150
Do you normally laugh a lot?

193
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,740
Yes. That's why I'm sad.

194
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,180
Why are you sad if you're laughing?

195
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,530
My name is Hae (Sun), and my little brother is Dal (moon).

196
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,530
I keep laughing even though Dal is in pain.

197
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:10,200
I'm so sorry because I keep laughing even though I'm sad.

198
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,930
Hey, Hae!

199
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,830
Dad!

200
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,070
Are you okay? Let me see.

201
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,670
Why do you have to pee so much lately?

202
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,340
I know, right.

203
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,930
Hyung, where were you?

204
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,310
- What?
- That kid is acting weird.

205
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:37,010
Does Hae normally laugh this much?

206
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:42,200
Ah, yes. It's the happy virus. He's always laughing.

207
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,280
He sometimes laughs in his sleep too.

208
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,370
- How old is he?
- Nine, why?

209
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,040
I think his laughing is a symptom.

210
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,820
Laughing is a disease?

211
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,370
Sunbae, he keeps needing to pee and is falling a lot. You saw his laughing, right?

212
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,370
I think it might be gelastic seizure (seizure where patient has a burst of crying or laughing).

213
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,580
Right?

214
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,710
I think we'll have to do a test.

215
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,970
That's why the leader is important for any organization.

216
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,070
- From this moment forward, our Guk Il Foundation will—
 - Gul Il Hospital, which is currently going under tax investigation,

217
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,640
is also being accused of corrupt hiring practices and angering our citizens.

218
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,110
Gul Il Hospital's Administrative Director Mr. Kim and Accounting Manager Mr. Lee,

219
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,530
during the latest hiring which had an acceptance rate of 100 to 1,

220
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,740
is undergoing a police investigation for getting their daughters hired by

221
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,200
acquiring the test, with all the answers, before the actual exam.

222
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,790
Following tax evasion investigation with corrupt hiring practices has—

223
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,460
What is this about corrupt hiring practices? Why is something I don't know about happening? Did they really do that?

224
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,510
I believe so.

225
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,010
You believe so? These bastards!

226
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,460
I swear, Jeong Yoon Tae is a crazy bastard.

227
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,290
If a patient loses consciousness, he sends them off to our department immediately!

228
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,200
Let's go upstairs. We can come back down if we get called.

229
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,980
If we stay here, we're just going to become bait for emergency residents.

230
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,470
Man, I'm so irritated.

231
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,960
Yes, this is Choi Kang Soo.

232
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,910
Yes, hello, this is writer Yoo Hye Sun from SBC Focus People.

233
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,320
You're the artist of the blog webtoon Girl Gangster Doctor, right?

234
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,620
Ah yes, you're the one who left a note before?

235
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,880
You said you based if off of a real model, right?

236
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,840
- We were hoping to cast her on one of our programs.
- Why?

237
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,180
She matches perfectly with our program concept.

238
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,870
The woman who overcame her dark past and became a doctor. A beautiful woman doctor.

239
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,730
Ah, I'm pretty sure she doesn't do stuff like going on television.

240
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,280
Please don't be so quick to make decisions—

241
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,030
No, you shouldn't be so quick to make decisions yourself.

242
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,490
I'm very sorry. Please just enjoy the webtoon as a webtoon.

243
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,690
What is it?

244
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,090
If Doctor Yoo finds out, she's gonna kill me.

245
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,360
Where are you going, Doc?

246
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,810
Oh...to eat.

247
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,810
You want to go together? To the hospital cafeteria?

248
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,120
You guys have time to eat? At the hospital cafeteria?

249
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,040
No, we have a mountain of stuff to do. We're going to order take out.

250
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,040
This kid can't get it together!

251
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,460
Let's go, Kang Soo.

252
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,930
But what you said ...

253
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:25,760
♫ Oh my girl. I only know you ♫

254
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,220
♫ That's what my heart says ♫

255
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,600
It's really hard to eat one meal together.

256
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,960
♫ Every day all I see is you ♫

257
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,990
You can do it!

258
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:47,470
Your gestures and glances tell me that you love me ♫

259
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:53,040
♫ I even like you when you're sick and sulky ♫

260
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:01,400
♫ You who have changed my destiny, you are beautiful ♫

261
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,990
♫ My heart says it only knows you ♫

262
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,410
Hey, Ji Hong, over here!

263
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,030
Come here!

264
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,510
Damn it...

265
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,420
You said you couldn't eat with us when we asked you before.

266
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,960
Didn't you guys say you were going to eat earlier?

267
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,110
What, you don't want to eat with us?

268
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,530
What do you want me to do?

269
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,240
Doctor Yoo!

270
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,410
Come here!

271
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,270
It's been a while, Doctor Yoo.

272
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,100
But why do I feel like the two of you came here to eat together?

273
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,140
- Did we tactlessly call you over here?
- Yeah.

274
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,080
What?

275
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,680
I'll formally introduce you guys. This is my girlfriend, Yoo Hye Jeong.

276
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,800
Hello, I am Hong Ji Hong's girlfriend, Yoo Hye Jeong.

277
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,660
- Hey. What is this?
- There was this kind of side to you?

278
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,210
There was, so stop making fun of me.

279
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,150
Go ahead and eat.

280
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,490
This is when it's good. Reminds me of old times.

281
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,840
This is the happy stage. After that, it's the tiring stage.

282
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,530
Then you start trying to reaffirm your feelings and it moves onto getting sick of each other.

283
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,810
Ennui becomes my friend.

284
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,010
These punks...

285
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,730
Seriously, congratulations. You've accomplished something huge at your age.

286
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,860
- We'll keep your secret.
- Of course!

287
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,840
Work place dating is all about the secret (kiss).

288
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,900
That's the best part!

289
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,580
Pervert.

290
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,660
Thanks, I haven't had much reason to smile lately.

291
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,200
Oh, Unni.

292
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,010
Do you want to eat this too?

293
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,230
What's this sudden blow?

294
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,700
It looks like the hospital image is going to mush.

295
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,410
Isn't this because of the tax evasion investigation?

296
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,110
I guess someone who didn't get hired by our hospital saw an opportunity and reported us.

297
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,860
What did you do while your underlings were causing a ruckus? Why didn't you know?

298
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,130
I'm upset, so at least put in a good word for me at the prosecutor's office.

299
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,970
The prosecutor in charge of our case is a VIP Wellness member at our hospital.

300
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:30,510
Alright. I hope this doesn't spread quickly and ends soon.

301
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,760
Hey, why does the hospital feel so restless lately?

302
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,820
Guardians of patients are asking if doctors get hired through connections.

303
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,680
It's because of the news. I've heard that, too.

304
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,770
Who even wants to major in neurosurgery these days? They don't even know how hard it is.

305
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:47,560
But Doc, there's news that Choi Kang Soo's webtoon is going to be published as a book. Did you hear?

306
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,080
Isn't he amazing? He's a first year, but he even does his job perfectly, too.

307
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,200
I thought he was slacking off. So he's been doing other stuff instead of working. This—

308
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,760
It'd be better to look good to him.

309
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,120
- Why?
- If he becomes a best seller author,

310
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,050
then we can at least reap some benefits.

311
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:08,250
Come to think of it, Kang Soo has sense.

312
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,040
Joong Dae, Joong Dae, An Joong Dae is the problem.

313
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,870
- What's wrong with me?
- Won't you let go? Let go. You're heavy. Let go.

314
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,740
Is patient Ahn Soo Yeong still on wafarin?(Wafarin - blood thinner, given to patients with high blood pressure.)

315
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,730
- I don't think so.
- Hey, did you check to be certain?

316
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,040
Kang Soo should've done it.

317
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,600
Hey, why did you tell him to do it? You should do that. It's your job!

318
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,040
Ahn Joong Dae, this kid... Check it quickly.

319
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,130
Hurry! Hurry!

320
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,280
Is Kang Soo a good artist?

321
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,840
There is a hamartoma (benign growth) on the hypothalamus. It is gelastic seizure, which is often caused by a hamartoma.

322
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,940
You did well, Jin Seo Woo.

323
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,400
- What are you looking at?
- I got two compliments today.

324
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,070
One from the kid who laughs easily, and one from Sunbae.

325
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,300
How did you become like this?

326
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,610
- How do I look right now?
- You look pitiful.

327
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,220
There's no connection between being pitiful and being lovable, right?

328
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,620
- Of course, there isn't.
- I figured as much.

329
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,460
Do you still have feelings for me?

330
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,040
Are you still interested in Hye Jeong?

331
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,470
As expected, you know where it hurts me the most.

332
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,060
I should go see this patient's guardian.

333
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,870
I heard this patient's younger sibling is professor Hong's patient.

334
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,290
- What's his reason?
- I'm not sure.

335
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,680
The MRI should be out for that patient too.

336
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,460
Try calling them.

337
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,860
Why?

338
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,570
I don't like you.

339
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,650
I really don't like you,

340
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,480
but I like you.

341
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,780
I really like you.

342
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,060
Why do you like me? Why do you really like me?

343
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,680
- Isn't it because of my status?
- At first, it was.

344
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,510
You're a person with better conditions than mine.

345
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:56,900
All of the guys who liked me liked me because they were greedy for my good status.

346
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,980
I can be relieved with you for that part.

347
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,400
Take a good look into your heart to see whether it's love or

348
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,990
if it's because you're reassured.

349
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:11,200
- What's the difference?
- Having confidence in a person and loving a person are different.

350
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,510
Even if you don't have confidence in someone, if you love them, you can go till the end.

351
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,380
That's too reckless.

352
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,620
They do it because it's reckless. Love.

353
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,550
The both of you, were caught while being lovey dovey. Then don't be embarrassed,

354
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,670
and say that you were talking as a staff and fellow. Isn't that a perfect alibi?

355
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,690
What, lovey dovey? Are we kids?

356
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,090
- You can't end it with this.
- It's the end.

357
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,630
- Yes?
- Patient Nam Dal. Seven years old. Have you seen the MRI results?

358
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,550
- No, not yet.
- His older brother is Jeong Yeon Do's patient.

359
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:58,400
I think we should have a discussion about it.

360
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,520
Oh, okay.

361
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,490
I paid some attention to my hairstyle, but the wind is blowing a lot.

362
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,050
Do you want me to fix it for you?

363
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,530
Doctor!

364
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,110
What... is it?

365
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,890
I have something to say to Doctor Yoo.

366
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:32,030
-You must be happy.
- It's not like that.

367
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:35,560
I'll go first. Because having trust is important.

368
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,980
- What's wrong?
- Can you promise me

369
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,940
that you won't kill me?

370
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,000
What is it?

371
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,040
Is that me?

372
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,360
Am I this ugly?

373
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,790
That's not it! You're way prettier!

374
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:59,180
I didn't use you as the model. The story is just a bit similar.

375
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,310
How can you publish people's stories without getting their permission?

376
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:05,400
So that's why I said I'll make you into a star.

377
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,320
I looked into it and found out that SBC Focus People have a high viewers' rating.

378
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,030
And I heard that it's considered a great program.

379
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,330
- I'm sorry.
- Do well.

380
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:22,300
Don't give the broadcasting station my number. Don't even connect me to them.

381
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,060
Okay.

382
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,400
Sorry. I'm a little late.

383
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,300
No no, I just came in right now too. Here, have a seat and take a look.

384
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,360
What does it look like?

385
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:51,350
- It's a medulloblastoma.
- You heard her? She said it's a medulloblastoma.

386
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,670
Wh-What are you doing?

387
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,610
What could we be doing? We're doing a diagnosis.

388
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:00,240
The atmosphere is very different. Jin Seo Woo, what do you think?

389
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,570
I think the atmosphere is different, although I don't know what exactly is different.

390
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,840
Let's stop talking about things we don't know. Doctor Jeong, how's your patient?

391
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,730
For Hae, we're going to do radiation therapy.

392
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,910
The tumor is big too, as well as the area. The risk is too high.

393
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,310
- What about family history?
- There's nothing too special.

394
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,920
Then let's talk to the patient's guardian, and decide where to go from there.

395
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,130
You tell the guardians, since you will be doing the surgery.

396
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,900
Okay.

397
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,960
Dal has a tumor called a medulloblastoma.

398
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,370
This tumor is one that

399
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:42,370
forms in vermis cerebelli and the fourth ventricle.

400
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,430
Along with vomiting, headaches, and poor motor skills, it could result in internal hydrocephalus. (accumulation of fluid within ventricles of the brain),

401
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:50,030
It makes someone suddenly not walk well and keep being unstable.

402
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:53,320
- Oh, is that why Dal...
- Yes.

403
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,140
For Dal, the tumor is quite large. So, we suggest that we start treatment as soon as possible.

404
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,120
Will he be able to become perfectly healthy once he receives treatment?

405
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,880
Yes, we will remove the tumor through surgery,

406
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,160
and he will also need radiation therapy along with treatment through medication.

407
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:14,200
Okay then. Let's do the surgery quickly.

408
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,200
The surgeon will be Hong Ji Hong, and I will be his assistant.

409
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,560
Please ask me anything you are curious about.

410
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,580
Doctor, would it be okay to ask how much the surgery cost is?

411
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,910
Ah, I'm not sure about that.

412
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,220
You should probably receive a call from the hospital administration office.

413
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,350
It's burdensome because of the surgery fee, right?

414
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,030
I'm raising my children by myself.

415
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,010
They don't have a mother.

416
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,460
Is it possible to know what Hae's illness is?

417
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,910
I think you should talk to Hae's doctor in charge, Professor Jeong Yoon Do.

418
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,300
Okay, I got it.

419
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,050
Would you like them to be admitted first?

420
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,690
I will ask about the hospital fee at the community support center.

421
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,230
Thank you, Doctor.

422
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,200
Thank you.

423
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,440
Hae's laughing is a symptom of a type of seizure. When a person uncontrollably laughs without reason,

424
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,450
It's called gelastic seizure.

425
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,590
What I don't understand is why laughing is a sickness...

426
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:30,020
He wasn't laughing because he wanted to.

427
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,930
It was because the tumor was putting pressure on the hypothalamus.

428
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:39,030
The hypothalamus regulates everything. Temperature, breathing, emotions and even development.

429
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,930
Laughing was because he was sick...

430
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,510
As a father, I didn't even know that...

431
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,380
Most people don't know. You don't have to feel guilty.

432
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,770
What's important is what happens from now on.

433
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,140
Then Doctor, what should I do in the future?

434
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:57,120
He's in the middle of his growth, so treatment is needed as soon as possible.

435
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,550
If it doesn't have any effect on his life, I wish to have the operation next year. Would that be okay?

436
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:09,350
The hypothalamus affects your development, so if you leave it alone, he could be subjected to precocious puberty. (unusually early puberty)

437
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,460
It can even affect his breathing.

438
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:20,260
I'm going to start with Dal's surgery, and then Hae will go after.

439
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:25,940
Then let's do that. If you have any questions, then ask Doctor Jin Seo Woo.

440
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,100
Thank you.

441
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:46,240
Yeah. I'm sorry, I know you're having a tough time, but I'm asking for money.

442
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,980
How much do you think you can let me borrow?

443
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,320
Yes, yes, of course, President. If you let me borrow that much,

444
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,920
I will pay you back no matter what within three months.

445
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,350
I already got a loan from the bank.

446
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:12,140
But even with the loan, I'm still short. That's why I'm asking you.

447
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:17,650
No. Thank you for even worrying about me.

448
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,280
Yeah.

449
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,910
How can the vice-director be this calm?

450
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,310
What are you talking about?

451
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,080
The hospital's image has plummeted to the ground

452
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,940
so you need to put out a plan.

453
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,280
The administrative director and the accounting manager, how will you take care of them?

454
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,140
I fired them.

455
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,170
Fire the people who were hired as well.

456
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:09,180
That way, it will turn into a personal incident that has nothing to do with the hospital.

457
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,790
This person, seriously! This incident has nothing to do with me!

458
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:17,480
It progressed without my knowledge! These punks...

459
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,930
I told you to come up with a plan so why are you changing the subject?

460
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,230
We need to clean this up before coming up with a plan.

461
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,190
The head of PR is here.

462
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,580
What are you doing exactly?!

463
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,200
If something like this happened, you should have told me earlier and came up with a plan!

464
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,510
-You allowed it to reach broadcast?!
- I'm sorry.

465
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:40,680
Release a statement saying we've fired everyone involved in the case.

466
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,000
And that we apologize for not being aware of corruption by those individuals. Something to that effect.

467
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,420
Yes.

468
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,760
What are you going to do now?

469
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,120
Don't you have anything that'll make the hospital's image look good?

470
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,180
A program called "Focus People" under SBC contacted us to interview

471
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,180
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong of the Neurosurgery Department.

472
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,920
- Why?
- Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong is the model for the main character of a webtoon.

473
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:04,190
She overcame her difficult past to become a doctor. According to them, she's someone who can give hope to others.

474
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,990
That's a good one. Yoo Hye Jeong?

475
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,400
- Yoo Hye Jeong... That fellow from last time?
- That's right.

476
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,260
This worked out well. I think she and I get along well. Accept the offer.

477
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,590
But she refused.

478
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,990
If someone tells her to do it, she should do it.

479
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,820
Take charge of this and make sure it happens. You're the one who brought in that fellow.

480
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,950
Then is Chief Gyeong Joon in charge?

481
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,780
No, me. I was worried that Gyeong Joon would be chosen. He has to learn too.

482
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,920
I think Professor Hong and Doctor Yoo are dating.

483
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,740
Whether they date or not, I don't care.

484
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:46,100
Don't cause trouble with Doctor Yoo over problems of affection.

485
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,060
I won't. Even if I do, I lose every single time.

486
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,540
My dad told me to become close to her too.

487
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,890
I guess gold dust is scattered all over her body  (attracts people).

488
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,300
She's really friendly and connects with others unusually well.

489
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,080
You should have seen her get drunk next to the chief during the company dinner.

490
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,590
- Show me.
- You want to see?

491
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,810
Let's see.

492
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,390
Here it is.

493
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,460
How did she become like this?

494
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,860
You're prettier.

495
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,870
That's nice to hear.

496
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,120
Yes, Dad.

497
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,220
- There's a fellow named Yoo Hye Jeong in your department, right?
- Yes.

498
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:52,040
Bring her in. Let's all have a cup of tea together. I want to see who she is.

499
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,100
- Why?
- You'll know when we meet.

500
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,250
What is it?

501
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,410
You're doing Transcranial Doppler for Patient Lee Chung Yeol, right? (An ultrasound test of blood flow rate).

502
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,460
Yes, there are no problems.

503
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,000
Check every afternoon and if you see any signs of vasospasm, notify me immediately.

504
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,560
Yes. Oh? Father, hello.

505
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,120
Yes, hello. You should eat this with the other staff

506
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,510
and give this to Doctor Jeong Yoon Do.

507
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:22,050
You specially prepared something for him because he was the doctor in charge, didn't you?

508
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:25,030
He sometimes comes to our restaurant to eat.

509
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,790
He's Doctor Yoo's father.

510
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,150
Hello, Father.

511
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,460
Ah, yes. Hello.

512
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,080
- He's in a higher position than Doctor Yoo.
- Aigoo,

513
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,080
is that so? Please take good care of my Hye Jeong.

514
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:40,300
Ah, it's nothing. By any chance, do you remember me?

515
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,790
I don't know. I don't really remember...

516
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,570
If you have some time, would you like to have a cup of tea?

517
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,530
Ah, sure.

518
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,630
Neurosurgery Department, Hong Ji Hong

519
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,900
Now I remember. You came when my mother passed away, didn't you?

520
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,120
Yes, I was also Hye Jeong's homeroom teacher.

521
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:07,290
I'm sorry. I'm her father but I wasn't even able to visit you at the school and greet you.

522
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,360
- Drink.
- Yes, thank you.

523
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,500
By the way, how did you become a doctor?

524
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,200
I was originally a doctor.

525
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,780
- I was just temporarily working as a teacher back then.
- Ah,

526
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,770
I see.

527
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:31,700
- Please give me your business card. I often think about Grandma's rice soup.
- Ah, yes.

528
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,910
It's not the same taste but if you're not very sensitive to taste, there's not much of a difference.

529
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,340
I have my mother's cooking skills.

530
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,980
Grandma's Rice Soup

531
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,310
Did you call Hye Jeong before coming here?

532
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:49,650
No. She doesn't like me.

533
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,180
I thought she would avoid me if I called her before coming so I just came.

534
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,490
She wouldn't avoid you.

535
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,140
Father

536
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,550
This is Yoo Hye Jeong.

537
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:30,080
This is the director's secretary. The director wants to see you.

538
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,990
I understand.

539
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,470
How is working at this hospital? Do you like it?

540
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,570
It's good.

541
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:48,250
Our Seo Woo isn't very flexible and is too serious, so I think she has a hard time socially.

542
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,730
It seems you two are the same age so become close friends.

543
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,010
By the way, I heard from the PR department.

544
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:02,230
I heard that SBC's program, "Focus People" are coming out to do an interview with you. Do well.

545
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,720
I've already declined that because it doesn't suit me well.

546
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,250
What do you mean it doesn't suit you?

547
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:10,260
When the hospital is in crisis, everyone has to work together.

548
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,780
If Seo Woo was in your position she would do it, but she can't because she's not relevant.

549
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,550
I'll believe that you'll do it. It was nice meeting you.

550
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:21,020
I like young people.

551
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:43,470
I live like this. I don't gain everything easily either.

552
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,510
Let's get off of work now.

553
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,360
Why don't you drive me home today?

554
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,080
I like things like this. I wasn't feeling good, but now I feel much better.

555
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,400
Hm? Why didn't you feel good?

556
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,640
I met the Director with Seo Woo.

557
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,060
I think it's nice to look at someone else's life from far away.

558
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,610
When you take a closer look, it's cruel.

559
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,420
Yet, do you still want to come into my life?

560
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,410
I will gladly enter.

561
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,490
Then let's go!

562
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,960
Get in.

563
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,180
It's an honor.

564
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,500
Watch your head.

565
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:10,520
♬  For me, you've become a cloud. You come down into my love  ♬

566
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:18,000
♬  For only you, my feelings can grow  ♬

567
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,880
♬ so that your warm touch, the melody of just the two of us  ♬

568
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,470
I've just started to enter someone else's life.

569
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,800
My heart is pounding.
♬ The dream which everything will be made into  ♬

570
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,490
I try not to but

571
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,400
whenever something hard happens, I always think of you.

572
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,870
Why can't it be me?

573
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:35,410
Why not? We like each other.

574
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,930
We know each other so well.

575
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,830
Fool, it's not that it can't be you. It just can't be me.

576
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,800
We suit each other so well.

577
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,730
You're tall. A woman as tall as me is perfect for your height, look.

578
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,590
You're right about the height. Your height is perfect.

579
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:07,290
I'm losing my nerve since you acknowledge it so quickly.

580
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:11,140
I had nothing to boast about aside from my height.

581
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,080
Go back in. Other people will see.

582
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,950
Who cares if people see or not?

583
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:21,660
People like you and me have two choices:

584
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,400
we can either follow our parents' decisions or not follow them.

585
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,770
If we don't follow their choices, we have to give them something to justify not following their decisions,

586
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,180
but you can't do that.

587
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,430
I can't do it.

588
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:39,970
No matter how hard I try, I just can't fulfill their expectations.

589
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,850
Do you know why?

590
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:47,780
Expectation is just personal greed you've set, based on your own standards,

591
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,100
being imposed on someone else.

592
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:58,150
My dad is nice. He was nice when I was young.

593
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,040
Leave now.

594
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:08,390
Stop whining like a child now and escape from your parents' shadows.

595
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,780
Yes.

596
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:47,340
Ah, I... I understand. Yes.

597
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,670
- Hey!
- Yes?

598
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,670
Can you even eat right now?

599
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,150
Why didn't you take a CT scan when Patient Kim Hee Jeong's mental state declined?

600
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:56,610
Ah, I told Nurse Hyeon to do it.

601
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,760
You didn't do it?

602
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,890
When did you tell me to do it?

603
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:02,690
I clearly called you in the middle of the night to do it.

604
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,480
This is my first time hearing about this.

605
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,080
And you need to give me orders like that formally... I'll go now.

606
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,470
Yes.

607
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,670
Hey, what's with you?

608
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,150
You ordered Kang Soo to check earlier and now you're using Nurse Hyeon as an excuse?

609
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,110
It's the truth, not an excuse.

610
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:24,140
How can you not even communicate with a nurse, someone under you?

611
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,670
Can you not communicate in general?

612
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,090
If the patient's mental state continues to decline and she dies, will you take responsibility?

613
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:32,100
Will you not get your head straight?!

614
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,490
Oh? Why get up?

615
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,400
Hey, hey! The rice balls, hey!

616
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,830
Hey!

617
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,180
Chief, I think you were too harsh.

618
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:49,510
Harsh? How was I harsh? I'm just doing this so you all won't make any mistakes in the future.

619
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,120
You're good.

620
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,310
Hey, it's a garlic!

621
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,110
It's to make you a human.

622
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:59,300
There is a Korean legend of a bear and tiger eating garlic and mugwort in a cave to become human.

623
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,320
Enjoy your meal.

624
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,690
Did you come alone?

625
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,150
Yes. Give me some alcohol and lots of snacks.

626
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,810
Alright.

627
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,730
Here you go.

628
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,760
By any chance, if someone looks for me,

629
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,820
especially people from the hospital,

630
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,780
please tell them I'm not here.

631
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:42,330
There's nothing for me to tell them.

632
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:45,620
You're big, so there's no way they wouldn't see you.

633
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,240
Is he crying?

634
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,680
- What is this?
- Hello. Did you take a shower?

635
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,120
Ah, why are you like this? Aunt, do you not have a house of your own?

636
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,110
How can you just barge in whenever you want?

637
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,820
I'm tired. If you have anything refreshing, give it to me.

638
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,820
Auntie.

639
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,600
I heard that you like women with a past.

640
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,620
You can't like me, alright?

641
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,550
I only like women with certain pasts!

642
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,250
So you can't like me.

643
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,330
I've had such a difficult past.

644
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,930
Don't worry about anything.

645
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:34,900
Please don't come to my house! I have so much to do!

646
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:39,940
Yoon Do, your uncle is here! Oh? In Joo is here too.

647
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,940
I'm going crazy...

648
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,420
Uncle, please don't come to my house! You have your own house so why keep coming to mine?

649
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,350
I'm lonely.

650
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:51,220
Me too! I like coming here these days.

651
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,960
Me too! Honestly, we're both divorced so it would be strange for us to just be together by ourselves.

652
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,340
Right, it would just be too ordinary with us two.

653
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:01,780
If he's here, the picture is nice and it's fun to tease him.

654
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:06,650
As expected, you're my best friend!

655
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:09,320
I'm going to date no matter what.

656
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,560
I'm going to leave my girlfriend at home and make sure no one can come in.

657
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,890
Go ahead.

658
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:19,250
But your personality isn't exactly the type that attracts women either.

659
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,770
- Auntie.
- Did you buy the cup ramen?

660
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:25,480
If you bought it, I'll acknowledge that you're a fine man.

661
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,180
I'll go buy the cup ramen.

662
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,430
- Right now?
- No, tomorrow!

663
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,900
- In Joo!
- Aish.

664
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,950
We've arrived.

665
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:50,750
Do this for me.

666
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:55,800
- What?
- You like things like this, things like protecting and taking care of others, no?

667
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,310
I think you know too much about me.

668
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:03,390
Yeah. I learned properly after I was scolded before.

669
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:07,530
You're the same as before, seeing that you still hold grudges.

670
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,260
What?

671
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,040
I think it's racy.

672
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,140
- Aren't you hungry? Do you want to eat before you go?
- No.

673
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,340
Then do you want to play the claw machine?

674
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,270
I lost.

675
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,580
Wow.

676
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:50,940
You're good now.

677
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,750
I'm good at whatever it is, once I've been taught.

678
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:57,750
How did you even come up with the idea of having a claw machine in your house?

679
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:01,570
Something to compensate for the things I didn't get to do when I was a child.

680
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,850
It's something I need as well.

681
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:07,150
I met your father.

682
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,170
Should I not tell you?

683
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,650
Go ahead.

684
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:21,160
Now that I'm about to tell you, I'm not sure how I should approach the topic.

685
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,200
- I don't like him.
- I know.

686
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,370
Whoever tells me to reconcile with him, I won't see that person anymore.

687
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:32,000
I can meet him, right?

688
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,540
Why do you want to meet him?

689
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,880
I want to eat Grandma's rice soup. I long for that taste.

690
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,180
I long for that too.

691
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:48,410
I'm only telling you this now, but do you know why I don't cook?

692
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,960
It's because I think I'll be good at it.

693
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,250
If I'm good at it, I'll think of my grandmother.

694
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,630
I tear up whenever I think about her.

695
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,340
I don't know what I should do then.

696
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:15,070
It's alright to tell me that you don't know. I'll teach you.

697
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,010
At times like these,

698
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,620
spread your arms like this

699
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:39,540
and hug me like this.

700
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:43,040
♬  You are everything in my life  ♬

701
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,580
♬ You're the reason I live  ♬

702
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:54,130
♬ It's an unexplainable miracle  ♬

703
00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:01,200
♬ If love is needing my comfort,  ♬

704
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:08,570
♬ take another step forward  ♬

705
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:12,050
♬ Yes, I believe my destiny  ♬

706
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,580
Dal, surgery is not a big deal.

707
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:24,220
If the doctor says, "Please close your eyes", you just have to close your eyes.

708
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:27,240
If they say to sleep well, you just have to sleep. That's all.

709
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:32,690
Okay. What about Hyung? Is Hyung coming too?

710
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:36,490
They said I'm not doing it today. Right, Dad?

711
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:39,140
Hae will do it next, Dal.

712
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,670
My vitamin.

713
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:56,960
Hi, Hae and Dal.

714
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,390
- Don't worry too much.
- Ah, yes. I'm not worried.

715
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:03,300
Dal, how are you feeling today?

716
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,260
Good.

717
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,530
- Good.
- I'm good too.

718
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:08,140
Let's do well together with me today.

719
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,130
Handshake.

720
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,780
Dal didn't drink water for the whole night, right?

721
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,420
Ah, no.

722
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:42,170
♫  I can't believe this moment ♫

723
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:49,670
Give me the gown.

724
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,030
Just stay.

725
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,360
Keep going.

726
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,280
Micro troyo (a micro hand instrument).

727
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,360
I've opened up the arachnoid membrane.

728
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,510
You worked hard.

729
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:51,920
Give me the bipolar.

730
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,500
Trocar.

731
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,460
The BAEP (the test that shows the condition of the nerves) is not showing up!

732
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,910
Everyone stop.

733
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:37,200
How is it now?

734
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,870
It's returned to normal.

735
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,650
Okay.

736
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:51,110
A lot.

737
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,670
Operating Room
Nam Dal

738
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,400
The surgery finished well.

739
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,520
Thank you, Doctor.

740
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:35,050
We'll look at his progress after he wakes up from anesthesia. I don't think you have to worry too much.

741
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:39,360
Yes, thank you, Doctor.

742
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,060
Was there a surgery today?

743
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:55,490
I came after doing one as the assistant for Professor Hong Ji Hong's surgery.

744
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:00,670
Truthfully, I'm getting a lot of pressure from the director

745
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:04,670
to convince you to appear on the broadcast for the hospital's PR sake.

746
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:11,730
Is it a very... difficult thing to do?

747
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,540
If you tell me to, I'll do it.

748
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,490
I have a lot of likes and dislikes even when it comes to people.

749
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:22,740
Huh? This is too simple.

750
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,090
Were you such an easy person?

751
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,240
Yes, I was such an easy person.

752
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,280
To you.

753
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:42,330
♫ I want you. As if an alarm is ringing  ♫

754
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:47,990
♫ You wake up the love cells in my heart  ♫

755
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:52,200
After the surgery ends, all the tension wears off and I become exhausted.
♫  You’re pretty.  ♫

756
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,740
♫  You're breathtaking whatever you do. ♫

757
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,980
♫  You're pretty. Oh my oh my girl ♫

758
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,050
♫  I don't know anyone but you. ♫

759
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:06,410
What do you want to eat? I'll make you everything you want to eat today.
♫  My heart says it only knows you ♫

760
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:07,990
Really?
♫  Morning, afternoon, evening, ♫

761
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:11,620
Then I...
♫ Everyday in my eyes everyday I see only you.  ♫

762
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:16,500
Then Hye Jeong...
♫  Do you see me? Do you see me ♫

763
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,190
Drop everything in! I'm going to buy anything you want!

764
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:20,950
Awesome.

765
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:25,250
This is dessert. Do you want some ramen before you go? (Korean version of netflix and chill.)

766
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:29,100
This and this!

767
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:41,080
Ah, this looks good.
♫  You're dazzling. Like a chameleon ♫

768
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:46,500
♫  Frequently from time to time you change. ♫

769
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:47,860
How's this?

770
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,180
Ooh, fresh, fresh!

771
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:53,190
♫  You're breathtaking no matter what you do. ♫

772
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:54,670
- This won't do.
- What about this?

773
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,900
Do we have to cut it open to see? Scalpel.
♫  You're pretty ♫

774
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,730
A scalpel... there's one at home. Then we're going with this.
♫  Oh my oh my girl  ♫

775
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:04,590
Yes.
♫  My heart says it doesn't know anyone but you.

776
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:06,640
♫  Morning, afternoon, evening,  ♫

777
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:11,130
♫  Everyday in my eyes everyday I can only see you ♫

778
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:16,510
♫  Do you see me? Do you see me? ♫

779
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:19,890
Okay, today's highlight.

780
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:24,790
♫  I just wanna fall in love ♫

781
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:27,580
I don't think this is it.

782
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:28,880
I'll eat well.

783
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,450
Yes.

784
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:43,870
Why?

785
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:45,470
It's like my grandmother's soup.

786
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:47,210
Is it tasty?

787
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:50,610
Yes, it's really really tasty. Where did you buy it?

788
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:54,060
Granny's Rice Soup in Mangwon-dong.

789
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:12,300
Entering your partner's life, is the start of a relationship.

790
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:18,740
Inversely, it's also happily greeting the partner trying to enter my life.

791
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,960
It would be very hard to happily greet.

792
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:29,000
♫  Don't say you're sorry, No way. Don't leave me, No way ♫
