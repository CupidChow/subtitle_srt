00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,080
Episode 5

2
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:38,350
I hear you still go around beating people up. Kang Soo told me everything!

3
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,470
Why did you want to see me? We would have seen each other at the hospital tomorrow anyway.

4
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,350
Something kept bothering me, so I wanted to first resolve it right away.

5
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,260
What is it?

6
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,560
Why do you keep on marrying me off?

7
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,380
I didn't marry you off. You're the one who did.

8
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:03,550
You've changed. Why do you listen to others and make judgments? I didn't get married!

9
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,860
Okay. You didn't. I want to leave now.

10
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,170
This girl.

11
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:17,800
I became determined, you see. At least to never get hit by you.

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:24,370
In a dangerous situation, the body reacts first according to how it was taught, by its habits, and how it practiced.

13
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,580
The body's daily habits are learned in your childhood.

14
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,130
Once those childhood years pass, nothing can replace them.

15
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,860
I give up! I give up!

16
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,850
Is this the mount position?

17
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,280
Yes. Could you get off now?

18
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,170
Yeah, sure. I'm sorry.

19
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,500
I was only thinking about winning. You aren't hurt?

20
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,240
I'm not hurt.

21
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,100
That's a relief.

22
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,280
You brat. If only you hadn't attacked, the mood would have been really pleasant and nice.

23
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,490
I'm not going to grapple with you anymore.

24
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,520
I'm not going to do it with you either. But why not?

25
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,530
Just because.

26
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,590
Ah, seriously.

27
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,990
Are you okay?

28
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,710
Wow, you've become way too strong.

29
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,080
Have you regained your consciousness?

30
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,470
As soon as she regained consciousness, I removed the intubation tube.

31
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,800
Why are you here?

32
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,970
I feel responsible for this woman.

33
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,400
What's your name?

34
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,570
That b*tch...

35
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,370
Can you understand me? What's your name?

36
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,960
That b*tch...

37
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,230
Tell us your name first.

38
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,940
Oh... Young... Mi.

39
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,730
She's in a mental-drowsy state. It's okay.

40
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,260
Lift your right hand.

41
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,840
Lift your legs.

42
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,420
She can obey (follow directions).

43
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,320
You need absolute rest.

44
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,730
Administer 100mL of mannitol every 6 hours.

45
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,380
If her blood pressure is too low, there might be a risk of cerebral vasospasm and other damage.

46
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,500
- Approximate her systolic pressure to be around 180 rather than 160.
- Yes.

47
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,780
An aneurysm won't burst again, so don't be scared.

48
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,080
Maintain her stable condition using nimodipine.

49
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,350
If she says her head hurts a lot, then administer NSAIDs via intramuscular injection (IM).

50
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,330
If it still hurts, then half an ampoule of morphine.

51
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,410
I like you.

52
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,910
What?

53
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,870
In the end, this is how I confess... It's a bit of a downer, but I still want to do it.

54
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,040
What are you talking about?

55
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,870
I liked you when you were dating someone else, and I liked you when you broke up.

56
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,250
Of course, I'm not saying I fell in love with you at first sight.

57
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,450
- Why?
- You know what kind of girls I like.

58
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,650
I know. But it's time you stop getting hurt.

59
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,440
I don't think I got hurt. As much as I got hurt while I loved them, I grew.

60
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,950
Grow, my ass. Who took care of you when you got drunk and whined?

61
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,630
Why do you like a woman with a past?

62
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,180
I know. Seriously... Why do I like a woman with a past?

63
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,150
I'm bright with a good family and background, and a pretty face—

64
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,380
That's enough. Go and do well with another man.

65
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,950
You really have weird taste.

66
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:32,180
That's right, I have weird taste. Why are you getting upset about my preferences? Is it because of Yoo Hye Jeong?

67
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,720
Why are you mentioning Yoo Hye Jeong right now?

68
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,660
You know you get really bothered about Doctor Yoo. You said you went to the same school. Were you rivals?

69
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,780
- Why am I rivals with her?
- See this?

70
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,240
It seems like Yoo Hye Jeong has a story.

71
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,400
- Are you interested in her?
- Of course, I am.

72
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,070
Did you fall in love with her at first sight? Do you know the kind of person she is?

73
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:53,320
You don't like Yoo Hye Jeong, right? Even though I can't accept your confession, I will kick Yoo Hye Jeong out.

74
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,710
- For me?
- As if... It's for me.

75
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,570
I don't like her. She's not skilled, but she always gets involved. She's rude, too. On top of that, she talks back.

76
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,390
But how can you kick her out because of that when the supervisor is here?

77
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,780
We just need a brain aneurysm case.

78
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,080
Have you seen reality surpass imagination?

79
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,160
I have. You!

80
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,650
I knew you were going to be living well, but I couldn't have imagined you being a doctor.

81
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,490
It means the world is still worth living since I could raise my social status through education.

82
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,470
Are you okay?

83
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,330
Yes.

84
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,740
Do you want me to teach you how to place a catheter without navigation?

85
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,230
I would like that!

86
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,520
Then come work under me starting next week.

87
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,750
I'll be at work tomorrow but not officially. I'm just going to check up on patients.

88
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,090
Okay.

89
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,470
Go in now.

90
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,950
Go first. I can go by myself.

91
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,090
Do you know what you really need to learn, besides how to place a catheter?

92
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,890
What is it?

93
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,230
Accepting protection from others.

94
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,650
This doesn't seem like much to you, right? Since you can do everything by yourself.

95
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,920
I can protect myself.

96
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,450
People who grow up being assured that they are protected trust themselves and society. That's a basic rule in life.

97
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,620
Basics protect you when life gets unsteady.

98
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,420
Receiving protection is a childhood luxury.

99
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,490
- The past cannot be altered or secured. You can only accept it.
- Wow!

100
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,130
You still don't listen to others.

101
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,870
I learned this after paying a ton of tuition fees.

102
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,850
You can't change circumstances, but you can change hearts.

103
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:10,280
Where do I start with you and what should I teach you first? I should make a curriculum when I get home.

104
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,330
Why?

105
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,370
- Why?
- Just because.

106
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,810
Go in now. I'll watch you go in. Don't look back and go straight ahead.

107
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,620
See? You're not listening again.

108
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,570
Teacher!

109
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,700
Oh, Soon Hee!

110
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,100
Congratulations on your marriage!

111
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,630
- No, that's not it.
- Omo.

112
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,150
Sorry! Then did you get divorced?

113
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,940
I said that's not it!

114
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,430
You've changed. Your mouth has gotten cheap (have a big mouth).

115
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:08,110
Oh you don't know. Hye Jeong's mouth is worth only 10 cents (quick to divulge) to someone she likes.

116
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,860
That's right.

117
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,010
Yeah.

118
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,090
Hurry! Hurry!

119
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,530
You drop it every day!

120
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,120
With whose permission? Did you just wake up?

121
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,010
No, I didn't.

122
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,120
Come close.

123
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,420
Why are you lying? You just woke up.

124
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,360
I didn't.

125
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,240
Put your eyes downward.

126
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,850
Well, you can button up wrong, but how is this evidence that I woke up just now?

127
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,880
This jerk, seriously. Do you think I'm an idiot?

128
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,330
I told you that if you make a mistake, acknowledge your mistakes!

129
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,410
We woke up and dozed off a bit. Then we got your call!

130
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,090
Why did you doze off? Why? Why?

131
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,050
England. Where's Yeong Gook (Korean name for England)?

132
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,100
Neurosurgery Dog

133
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,660
Patient Lee Gi Cheol's lab values are normal.

134
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,780
We've changed his medication from injections to oral medication.

135
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,840
- He became better. How about his hematoma?
- It declined to 20cc.

136
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,810
Am I your morning call (alarm) or something? You just woke up, didn't you?

137
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,490
That's not true. I checked on Patient Do Yeong Gyeong, before Professor Hong Ji Hong started rounds.

138
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,510
I'm upset. I was worried that you, Chief (Resident), would be in trouble if I messed up so I was over there working—

139
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,810
I got it, I got it. Acknowledged!

140
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,620
You, scan this book.
 Youman's Neurological Surgery

141
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,180
This is my book that you borrowed yesterday.

142
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,480
It's because I have no money, no money to buy books!

143
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,600
Never mind, I'll just give it to you.

144
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,890
You, go to the Korea Meteorological Site, check the weather for the last couple of years, and organize the data.

145
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,480
Is it for your thesis paper, chief?

146
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,160
Why do you ask those things when you already know?

147
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,400
- Joong Dae, Joong Dae, Ahn Joong Dae!
- Yes?

148
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,190
He keeps following you because you keep asking useless questions!

149
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:32,480
That's not it. We're already busy enough as it is, but since you're making us run personal errands for you, I just asked.

150
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,150
- The upper years have to do well, so that the lower years can do well too.
- Ye.s

151
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,740
He doesn't understand any words that are said if they put him at a disadvantage.

152
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,660
Grandma Hwang Jeong, she's your patient, right?

153
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,540
That grandma had an intracranial aneurysm.

154
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,170
We couldn't even see it because it was too small,

155
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,100
but I think it burst 3 months ago because it was cold.

156
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,670
Look into it so that we can see if it can be included in the paper.

157
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,690
Chief, can't you make Hyung Yeong Gook print the relevant research?

158
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,390
I'm just sitting over here minding my own business. Why are you suddenly bringing me into this?

159
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,710
I just have too much work, really.

160
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,680
Then, do I have nothing to do?

161
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,500
This rascal, seriously. How is it you haven't been trained no matter how many times you have been hit?

162
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,460
Are you some kind of wild horse? Be docile, huh!

163
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,800
I'll do it. Those research papers, I'll get them for you.

164
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,260
You saw that, right? You need to take after him in aspects like this!

165
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,480
It's times like this that the merits of aging show.

166
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,100
- I'll do my best.
- Right on!

167
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,560
I live like this you know.

168
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,620
Yes, I understand.

169
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,590
As for me, I won't get involved like that.

170
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,550
What are you talking about? Are you done preparing for rounds?

171
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:32,420
Just see what happens if I hear that you were scolded by the professors.

172
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,660
Professor, Patient Do Hyeon Gyu's hematoma has increased in size a bit.

173
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,560
It hasn't increased by a lot, so administer urokinase irrigation (UK) every 6 hours.

174
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,130
Be careful not to do too much. If any cerebrospinal fluid comes out, close his head right away.

175
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,630
Yes.

176
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,900
- You came to work?
- I'm leaving soon.

177
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,800
- What about your afternoon rounds?
- I will come back.

178
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,160
I'd rather just stay if it were me.

179
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,020
It's been a while since I've earned a vacation. I'm going to use it to the full extent,

180
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,800
and Dr. Yoo Hye Jeong agreed to work under me.

181
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,420
When did you meet with her to decide that? Are you really someone who's on vacation?

182
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,060
I put dibs on her first just in case, Doctor Jeong Yoon Do would take her from me.

183
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,360
Ah, that attitude is good. Having something taken away and giving something away are really different.

184
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,230
Would you like a cup of tea?

185
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,190
I have to attend a meeting. I don't know why there are so many meetings.

186
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,520
Wait. You haven't seen the research labs yet, right? I'll show them to you.

187
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,020
Yeah.

188
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,360
June Earnings Report for Guk Il Medical Center

189
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,370
This month's highest profiting department, as expected, is the general surgery department. You worked hard, Professor Baek.

190
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,540
Director Jin Myeong Hoon

191
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,040
I'll increase the credit card limit on the business account.

192
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,580
If you have good results, then I surely must give you the appropriate treatment.

193
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,800
Don't you think that's the benefit of living in a capitalist market society?

194
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,890
Thank you.

195
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,900
Neurosurgery Department Professor Kim Tae Ho, and our vice-director,

196
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,060
the general surgery's earnings last month came close to 10 million ₩.

197
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,670
What is 46 million ₩, neurosurgery department?

198
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,290
Is it good for him to be the only one doing well?

199
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,890
Do you have a plan for increasing the department's earnings?

200
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:00,430
I have hired a new talent. I've scouted John Hopkins' professor Hong Ji Hong. It will get better.

201
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,820
Will sales rise just because you employ someone new?

202
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,370
You! You're the vice-director of this hospital but you oppose the hospital management initiatives.

203
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,460
Why are you against it when I said we would build a geriatrics center?

204
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,290
Rather than a geriatrics center, having a transplant center is more beneficial for the advancement of medical—

205
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,080
If you're going to spout such b*llshit, then resign from your position as vice-director.

206
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,190
We need to survive in order for there to be progress. Last year there was a loss of 253 million ₩.

207
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,250
But our additional profit exceeded 1 billion ₩ didn't it?

208
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,190
That kind of progress is an apt example of the cart coming before the horse.

209
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:29,020
A hospital has to live off of its profits made from the hospital; would it live off of the profits made from a restaurant?

210
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,290
Return the entire neurosurgery department's vacation days this month.

211
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,410
There has to be at least one more patient and you need to do one more surgery. What do you mean vacation?

212
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,420
Nice putting.

213
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,030
Is your condition just not good today or have you gotten old?

214
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,390
My condition isn't good.

215
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,650
Since we're old, there are more days in which we're not in the best condition.

216
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,610
Isn't it about time for us to retire?

217
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,490
We have to. We should secure the basics and leave it to our children.

218
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,080
You know, Myeong Hoon? Not just because he's my kid, but he's excellent at hospital management.

219
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,410
He's pretty good, but we should change it up a bit.

220
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,430
Why change when it's going well?

221
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,530
We have to help him grow.

222
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,980
If an entire organization only relies on one person, it will stagnate.

223
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,520
Are you leaning towards Neurosurgery Department's Vice-Director Kim Tae Ho, or if not, Ji Hong?

224
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,980
Isn't it enough to have him promoted to a director?

225
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,680
There's no need to shake the leadership at the top. We can have them controlled from the bottom up.

226
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,770
Myeong Heon already has a subsidiary.

227
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:46,660
With that he doesn't need to work a day in his life. He likes money, correct?

228
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,170
Let's not talk about that anymore. I'm busy.

229
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,650
Are you looking down on me right now?

230
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,120
Are you thinking that my child is pathetic as a doctor and all he does is show off his desire for money?

231
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,500
Guk Il Medical Center's Revenue Chart for June

232
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,240
Cardiothoracic Surgery, General Surgery, Neurosurgery

233
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,790
- Father, you're here.
- Yes.

234
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,060
The general hospital department's earnings are the highest,

235
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,730
but why is the bed turnover rate for the Neurosurgery Department so bad?

236
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,950
I shook down the Neurosurgery Department over that, today.

237
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,350
Good job.

238
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,460
Give this to Chairman Jeong when you see him later.

239
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,290
What is it?

240
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,690
It's time we send Doo Sik home.

241
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,980
Don't pick it up! Don't pick it up! One, two, three, four, five...

242
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,820
Hello, Hyung-nim.

243
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,700
Why are you like this? If someone saw, they would think I'm your boss.

244
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,530
- One bite?
- No it's okay.

245
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,420
It's grape flavored.

246
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,860
Don't lower your guard, and stay as quiet as a dead mouse.

247
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,550
Yes, I understand, Hyungnim.

248
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,600
- How do you feel?
- I'm fine.

249
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:29,970
You need absolute rest. Do you need to have all those people posted outside?

250
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,280
I have lots of enemies.

251
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,080
If the rumor gets out that I've gotten weak, there will be many people who'll be out to get me.

252
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,030
Although it would be nice avoiding things that can be avoided,

253
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,260
things that are meant to find you will find you. I've learned that in life.

254
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
You finished checking his vitals, right?

255
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,480
Yes, there are no problems.

256
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,720
Rest up.

257
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,980
Be safe on your way back, Doctor.

258
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,030
Be safe!

259
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,920
- Are there anymore canned peaches?
- We ate them all.

260
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,770
Continue to check that the surgical wound is healing well.

261
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,060
Should I continue changing his wound dressing?

262
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,540
Of course. We're going to monitor him for a week and discharge him next week.

263
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,030
- Where are you going to go?
- The ICU. What about you?

264
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,320
ER General Surgery's Sun

265
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,520
Yoon!

266
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,980
Yoon, wake up, please. Yoon!

267
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,420
Please move him here.

268
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,500
Hey, where is the patient in a semicomatose state?

269
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,140
Yoon, wake up.

270
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,420
I'll check on him.

271
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,190
He went out for school and then suddenly collapsed. Please save him, Doctor.

272
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,680
Mother, Mother, please calm down. I'll take a look.

273
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,620
- Please move him.
- Yes.

274
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,030
Yoon, Yoon...

275
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,340
Ah, I'm about to get irritated.

276
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,950
Hey! He's not semicomatose, he's in a stupor (near-unconsciousness, insensible).

277
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,020
Whatever. He's going to be a neurosurgery patient anyway.

278
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,520
I was scared! Wow, I'm the crazy one.

279
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,490
I came down listening to a dirty general surgeon kid who can't even determine a mental state property. I'm really going to ***—

280
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:27,500
Where are you going? Where, where, where? You were the one that said the Emergency Room can't operate without the help of the Neurosurgery Department.

281
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,260
So, just stay down here, you kiddo!

282
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,630
You're not letting go? Let go of me. Let go.

283
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,060
- Should I lay a hand on you? Call me hyung, I'm your hyung!
- Let go, let go! I'm telling Mom. Hurry and let go.

284
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,960
Do you know today's date?

285
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,640
I want to see that b*tch.

286
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,460
Exactly who is that "b*tch"?

287
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,570
If she wants to see her that much, why won't you call her?

288
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,870
You can meet her once you move down to a regular patient room.

289
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,580
Seeing as how you're calling her a b*tch, I don't think you have nice feelings towards her.

290
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,290
It would be nice to see her when you're healthy.

291
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:03,250
As expected, you're a smart miss— Uh, doctor.

292
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,000
Given your condition, you'll be able to move down to a regular patient room soon.

293
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,310
Patient, cheer up.

294
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,060
You're taking such attentive care of that patient.

295
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,900
You always follow me in even though she's not your patient.

296
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,810
I guess you have lots of free time these days. I should make you run around more.

297
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,790
Anyway, you're a psycho. You can't stand to see me be comfortable.

298
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,390
Choi Kang Soo

299
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,480
Yeah, what?

300
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,320
Male, 15 years old. He suddenly collapsed on his way to school.

301
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,440
His right pupil is dilated about 5 mm. His motor reflexes are a bit depressed.

302
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,430
I'll be right there.

303
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,020
- What's wrong?
- Kyeong Joon, follow me.

304
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,660
Ah, yes.

305
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,310
The daughter sac (irregular protrusion on aneurysm wall) burst. This might be complicated.

306
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,130
Prepare for surgery, and call Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong.

307
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,630
Not Doctor Jin Seo Woo?

308
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,600
From now on in my surgeries, Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong is going to come in.

309
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,050
W-W-Why?

310
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,210
Finally the war has started.

311
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,920
Where are you going?

312
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,070
To prep for Dr.Jeong Yoon Do's aneurysm surgery.

313
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,850
Really? Then why didn't you notify me?

314
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:30,250
Doctor Jeong Yoon Do changed his assistant. Finally, the war has started with the two of them.

315
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,120
War?

316
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:39,340
For me, I put in my vote that Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong will get kicked out. What about you?

317
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,190
Did you not hear my instructions to prepare and come in for surgery?

318
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,670
I heard.

319
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,490
But what is up with your outfit?

320
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,230
I know that Doctor Jin Seo Woo is your assistant.

321
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,420
Starting today, you are going to come to train under me.

322
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,620
What training do I have to receive from you?

323
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,940
I'm not interested in learning the aneurysm operation through craniotomy (surgical opening into the skull).

324
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,100
Also, I've done plenty already.

325
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,950
So you're only going to do coiling? As long as I'm here, that won't happen.

326
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,500
I told you this once before, but I'm not the right major assistant to work under you.

327
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:24,130
You won't work under me? Then you should do it yourself. I'll acknowledge you then.

328
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,960
If I succeed?

329
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,410
I'll do whatever you want.

330
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,080
I'll do it.

331
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,850
If you fail, you could get kicked out of the hospital.

332
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:43,690
I respect Chief Kim so I was going to just let things go, but you act too much like a gangster.

333
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,550
You don't have any regard for your superiors, nor do you have respect.

334
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,200
Your skills are terrible, yet you still don't have the correct attitude to learn.

335
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,380
Then shouldn't you leave?

336
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,890
How is it?

337
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:03,170
It's seems nice. Is there anywhere in the hospital where I can work out?

338
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:09,980
There is. Our chairman thinks of those types of things as important. Amenities have been set up well.

339
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,510
That doesn't sound like a positive.

340
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,760
Because it's not free.

341
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,320
What is free in the world? Is he really picky in real life?

342
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,630
He's a pigeon. He's really picky.

343
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,240
But still, people like our chairman are very practical.

344
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,690
They can read the flow well. When people are busy arguing about the old liberalism and conservatism, he takes the money.

345
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,010
Well, that's the same in America, too.

346
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,350
That's what I'm saying.

347
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,070
This month the entire neurosurgery department has no break.

348
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,590
Our profits were worse than the general hospital department.

349
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:47,050
To get more profit, we need to discharge patients fast and raise the turnover, but

350
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,720
I really don't want to make our kids do that!

351
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,700
Then you deal with it and don't release your stress on us.

352
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,300
Hey, how can I receive all this stress by myself? You need to share it with me!

353
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,130
In the past you said, for sure, that as long as you can distinguish between good and evil in people, things are easy.

354
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,770
"There's nothing that can beat the value of eating and living."

355
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,050
But we're still human.

356
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,000
There are always people who do what they want no matter what, even if it means death.

357
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,380
That's the same for you and me, right?

358
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,030
Are you giving me pain and then medicine?

359
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,240
Just a moment.

360
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,990
Neurosurgeon Jin Seo Woo

361
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,110
Yes, Seo Woo?

362
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:29,800
Yeah. What is the problem?

363
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,690
This surgery, can a fellow do it?

364
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,720
This looks very serious.

365
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,960
A regular aneurysm surgery is complicated enough but this case has a ruptured daughter sac.

366
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,900
A fellow can't do this. Are you going to do it?

367
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,030
No, Hye Jeong said she would do it.

368
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:50,480
Says who? Who decides on the operating surgeon for this type of operation?

369
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,460
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong is supposed to be under my training.

370
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,550
You shouldn't take her without my permission.

371
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:03,660
I am under the impression that you officially start next week. Doesn't that apply starting then?

372
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,670
I'll let you know the updated news. I start working today.

373
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,690
There wasn't an agreement with the fellowship, so it's invalid.

374
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,460
In this surgery, Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong isn't an assistant but the lead surgeon, so that doesn't matter.

375
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,330
Then I'll go in.

376
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,200
A fellow cannot perform a surgery of this level.

377
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,210
It's my patient.

378
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:26,200
You said it was Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong's surgery a little while ago. Then it must be her patient.

379
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,060
It is my patient.

380
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,910
I won't give you my permission.

381
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,970
I start with you next week. I'm still free. I will do what I want.

382
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,390
Why are you like this? Can you handle it?

383
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,600
I'm confident.

384
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,830
This person always goes beyond herself like this.

385
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,370
Still nothing changes. I'm going in.

386
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:54,090
Then do that. I'll be the referee.

387
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,200
I'll do it.

388
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,190
It's my fight. I don't avoid fights that come to me.

389
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:06,000
Don't worry. I only get into fights that I can win.

390
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,040
Don't forget that I'll always be next to you...

391
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,890
And that I'm always ready to help you.

392
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,520
I'll do the assist. Come out.

393
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,330
Ah, yes.

394
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,430
Irrigation.

395
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,610
Hand me the dissector.

396
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,340
Diatherm (electrosrgical cautery tool).

397
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,380
Please give me the surgical cottonoids.

398
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,350
I think they found it.

399
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,600
They won't be able to find it easily.

400
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,220
Clip.

401
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,850
They found it.

402
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,060
It burst.

403
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,640
Suction.

404
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,970
Raise the suction.

405
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,440
I'll do it.

406
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,450
I can do it.

407
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,970
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong. Pass it to Doctor Hong Ji Hong.

408
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,520
Hye Jeong.

409
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,790
Blood pressure's falling. Bring more blood.

410
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,290
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong, are you planning to kill the patient? Doctor Hong Ji Hong!

411
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,560
Concentrate.

412
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,770
Clip.

413
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,610
Ah, it's done.

414
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,490
What a relief.

415
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,900
Will you do it?

416
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,820
It's your surgery. Finish it too.

417
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,620
Suction.

418
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,610
Lower the suction.

419
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,960
Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong.

420
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,280
I'm sorry.

421
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,320
If you apologize this easily, I'll lose my fighting spirit.

422
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,900
If I lose, I immediately put my tail down.

423
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:51,220
I'm going to respect your decision now, whatever that decision is.

424
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,450
Everything I do is like a gangster, I don't have respect for anyone, and my skills are crap.

425
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,710
And I don't have the correct attitude to learn, so what could I do?

426
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:02,220
I... apologized just a moment ago.

427
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,670
You really hold grudges.

428
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,330
- You're quite strange.
- I am a bit strange.

429
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:10,950
You're quick to accept. It's good that you're simple-minded.

430
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,430
My grandmother was like this, too.

431
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:16,370
She'd scold me like crazy but got happy as soon I gave her something she wanted.

432
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:20,480
That's a compliment, right? I am quite simple.

433
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,070
You like it even now.

434
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:30,330
Doctor Hong Ji Hong seems to have excessive affection for his students.

435
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:33,430
When you were in school, he must have favored you over Seo Woo.

436
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:38,880
No. He probably shared the feeling of a parent who is kinder to the troublemaker child.

437
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,510
I was expelled from high school.

438
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,620
You're scared, right? I was expelled and everything.

439
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:50,070
Ah, seriously! What's scary about that?

440
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,870
I played around a bit in school, too.

441
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,660
You probably played around at the arcade.

442
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,550
What are you doing?

443
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,860
Oh, Uncle.

444
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,850
It's good that I ran into you. Let me sleep at your place tonight.

445
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,640
Why would you sleep at my house instead of your house with a slim model in it?

446
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,340
- I don't want to go because of that slim model.
- You loved her to death.

447
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,380
She wants to get married. When I said we should break up, she stuck herself to the house like a built-in closet and won't leave.

448
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,650
Take this opportunity and get settled.

449
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,450
You know my father, your grandfather.

450
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,210
He married three times and between those marriages, he dated.

451
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,200
Even during his marriages, he dated other women.

452
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,130
Also, your father, my big brother.

453
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:45,140
He swore that he would never turn out like my father but he's preparing for his second divorce.

454
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,450
There is no such thing as "long-lasting" in our family.

455
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,780
I'm going to change my DNA.

456
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:56,140
I was like that, too, when I first got married, but genes don't change, no matter how much you try to change them.

457
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,260
- Are you going to let me sleep at your place or not?
- I can't give you my password.

458
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:05,290
Why are you so inflexible? You can change it after you tell me.

459
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:08,360
Oh, that's true.

460
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:14,750
You've been looking dazed since before. Do you perhaps like that girl who went by earlier?

461
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,800
- What are you saying?
- It's bull****.

462
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,790
Hey. Next week Doctor Hong Ji Hong is transferring to your department, right?

463
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,330
You should get along well with him. He's a close friend of mine.

464
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,960
That ship has sailed.

465
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,100
What? Did you meet Ji Hong already?

466
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,360
I bought yours too. Do you want some coffee?

467
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,610
Instead of coffee, I'd like some water.

468
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,710
I'll give it to you.

469
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,890
Here.

470
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,040
I want to drink coffee too.

471
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,390
I'll give you that too.

472
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,670
- Did you meet the guardians?
- Yes, I reassured them.

473
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,950
You're being good to me because I assisted your surgery well, right?

474
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,210
With this, you're saying that I'm being good to you?

475
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,050
Hye Jeong.

476
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,510
Are you going to keep living like this?

477
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,330
How am I living?

478
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,270
Your competitive spirit is too strong.

479
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:30,200
You succeeded, so you should enjoy it. You should know how to play, too.

480
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,000
How many hours do you sleep a day?

481
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,580
I sleep ten hours a week. It's become a habit.

482
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:40,110
If I slept and played like others, there wouldn't be the me that there is now.

483
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,500
Are you happy right now?

484
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,510
I have nothing to be happy about.

485
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,260
Why?

486
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:57,220
When I first told you that I wanted to live differently ...

487
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,640
You said you wanted to allow your grandmother to live in extravagance.

488
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:06,200
I'm living differently and I succeeded, but my grandmother isn't here anymore.

489
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,120
I can't help you with that. Accept it.

490
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,890
Why do you keep saying you'll help me?

491
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:22,470
Do you still see me as your disciple?

492
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,560
Although I may still look like the 18-year-old who caused trouble everywhere—

493
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,270
To you,

494
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,120
do I look like I'm doing this because I'm your teacher?

495
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,140
If you think like that, you're really an idiot.

496
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,310
Or should I be happy about it?

497
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,970
You became a doctor before you could date anyone,

498
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,970
so your dating cells have died. You can't recognize the gaze a man gives to a woman.

499
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,060
If I think about you,

500
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,810
the scene where we met for the last time always comes to mind.

501
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,010
♫  The first time I saw you. ♫

502
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,400
I should have grabbed you at that time.
♫ You seemed as anxious as a child. ♫

503
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,510
Are you rejecting me like this?
♫  One day when you were standing beside me ♫

504
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,970
Oh, no, no.

505
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,840
Then are we dating?
♫  You had changed to be so lovely.♫

506
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,010
- No.
- Are you rejecting me?

507
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,660
Oh.

508
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,410
No.

509
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:51,070
What is this? You say no to everything. Your habit is to respond first with no to everything, right?

510
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,750
No.

511
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,590
It is.

512
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,010
I'll ask you again next time.

513
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,060
It's because I feel more awkward.

514
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,070
Weirdly,

515
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:11,530
when I meet you it's serious at first but the ending is always comical. Whose fault is this?

516
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,120
What was that reaction?
♫  If love is needing my comfort ♫

517
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,230
You're weird. You've become weirder
♫  If love is needing my comfort ♫

518
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,750
Bad brat.

519
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:24,690
♫  Take a step closer. ♫

520
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,400
I'm going to ask you again next time.

521
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,340
At that time, no matter what I ask, it's an unconditional yes.

522
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:39,860
♫  I think it' probably now is our love. ♫

523
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,380
Thank you for coming here even though you are busy.

524
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,330
It's been a while.

525
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,320
While I'm here can I see my child?

526
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,200
Yoon Doo is currently in surgery.

527
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,440
After leaving to go live on his own, I have to look for him in order for him to barely show me his face.

528
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,120
Both men and women must get married to understand their parents' heart. Am I right?

529
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,110
Would I be able to see Seo Woo?

530
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:24,340
From what I hear, she is also in surgery.

531
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,720
That's good. Working together is really good.

532
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,740
Let's go in.

533
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:37,290
President Hong holds a lot of the Medical Care company stocks,

534
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,340
but will this be enough for his impeachment?

535
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,480
If we say that he bought the stocks with the sole purpose of making money, it'll change the whole story,

536
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,020
since he has a high regard for honor.

537
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,690
Are you saying he will resign on his own?

538
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:51,460
That is what I am hoping for. But we shall wait and see.

539
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,990
What does the Ministry of Health say? Will it get approved at the upcoming national assembly?

540
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:59,400
The public is refusing because it's an investor-owned hospital,

541
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,620
and the civic group is rebutting.

542
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,000
Until when do doctors need to be dragged around?

543
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,800
Just like in the US, the hospitals need to be privatized, and

544
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,720
the hospitals need to be commercialized to for fair competition.

545
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,730
We need to ban public health insurance, and let people see doctors when they want.

546
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,870
A privatized hospital has been approved at Jeju Island, so our plan will work out.

547
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:20,170
In the end, the hospitals will have no choice but to be commercialized.

548
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:25,500
Next week I will be meeting with Assemblyman Nam. Let's meet him together.

549
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:39,330
Release it to the press. Something like, "The hospital has a dire need to earn money".

550
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,390
Yes, I understand.

551
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,250
Ahn Joong Dae.

552
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,700
- Why?
- Patient Lee Gi Chan is complaining that he can't sleep at night.

553
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,790
Should I prescribe him sleeping pills or not? His mental state seems fine.

554
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:06,990
What's the problem? You said he's sane.

555
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:15,520
Hey, you bastard! Do you prescribe pills based on what could happen in the future?!

556
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,050
What did I tell you?

557
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,630
Please give Patient Yoo Gi Cheol the sleeping pills.

558
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,080
Yes.

559
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,360
Hey, you're more hateful.

560
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,520
Hyungnim, why do you have no sense? Why do you keep asking about everything?

561
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,670
Do I ask because I want to ask? Who said that I'm going to die if I don't notify correctly?

562
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,480
He said correctly, not frequently.

563
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,820
His words are true.

564
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,160
Hyung, Doctor Jin Seo Woo was looking for you.

565
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,550
She always looks for someone, but I don't always answer,

566
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,480
because I'm expensive (valuable).

567
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,490
What is he saying?

568
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:59,230
Hey! Do you want to die! Why are you in my room!

569
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:04,520
Missed Call
Teacher Hong Ji Hong

570
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,240
What?

571
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,610
Doctor! Patient Ji Min Gyo is yelling!

572
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,430
Why are you notifying me? Is it serious?

573
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:22,800
Aigoo. Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo.

574
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,090
Hello.

575
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,990
He kept trying to jump off the bed so we tied him down.

576
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,430
We have the prescriptions we received after the consult with the psychiatry department, right?

577
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,280
Yes. We took the same steps, and they gave us the same prescriptions.

578
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,650
Then why did you call me?

579
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,560
I didn't call you.

580
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:46,510
Tell Gyeong Joon to come here. Where is he and what is he doing?

581
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,710
Yes, Doctor.

582
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,050
What are you doing?

583
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,510
There's nothing special so why did you notify me?

584
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,530
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you so disorganized?

585
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:02,460
Ah, take it easy, Doctor.

586
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,530
Where were you earlier, not even picking up your phone?

587
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:07,640
Do you think I couldn't pick up my phone because I went somewhere? I couldn't pick up because I was busy.

588
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,030
Good for you.

589
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,230
You've been working here for a while already. Can't you listen when your underling's got something to report?

590
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,940
He said he notified me because he was scared he would get scolded if he notified you.

591
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,270
- You—
- I'm sorry.

592
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,180
I'll talk to him about this

593
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,330
to make sure this doesn't happen in the future.

594
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,000
Joon Dae.

595
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,320
Yes.

596
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,990
Come with me for a minute. I have something to tell you.

597
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,900
- Can you not tell me here?
- No, I can't. Let's go together.

598
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,200
- Um, please ...
- Go.

599
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,860
Then Doctor, I'll see you later.

600
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,680
Ah yes.

601
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,080
Why did you call?

602
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,540
I got a call from Doctor Hong Ji Hong, but I ignored it.

603
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,370
- Why?
- Right, why?

604
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,520
- What should I do?
- Did you do something wrong?

605
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,260
That couldn't be it. You wouldn't do something wrong.

606
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:04,150
Call him back instead of being restless and imagining what he could have called about.

607
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,600
Do I seem restless?

608
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,030
Call him. My answer is only this.

609
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,340
Because of what happened today, I wanted to clear the air with you, so I called you.

610
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,620
Clear the air about what?

611
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,230
In the past, too, 13 years ago,

612
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:28,960
we suffered a lot of emotional indignity because of useless misunderstandings.

613
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,910
I don't think we should step back onto that train again.

614
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:33,340
I don't think it was a misunderstanding.

615
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:37,280
Okay. If you think of it like that, then I'll respect your thoughts.

616
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,250
Let me make a correction then.

617
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:44,070
I need to make sure that in the future no more misunderstandings happen.

618
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:47,710
Are you like this because I told you about Hye Jeong's surgery earlier?

619
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:52,740
That included. I still like Hye Jeong.

620
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,750
Why are you telling me these things? You should tell Hye Jeong.

621
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,780
Do you think I would tell you first without telling Hye Jeong already?

622
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,760
That's good. I was uneasy when she appeared in my life again.

623
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,910
What is she going to take away from me this time? I guess at least it won't be a man.

624
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,440
I'm starting to like Doctor Jeong Yoon Do.

625
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,450
He's a college senior of mine and he's from a respected family so we can understand each other.

626
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:25,310
I just want you two to get along. Can't I ask you a favor to get along with her?

627
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:31,390
I didn't mess with her first. She's always the one that messes with me first.

628
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:36,950
She's the one that approached me first to teach her how to study, and from then on my life was ruined.

629
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,420
I miss Unni In Joo since she's a victim of Hye Jeong, as well.

630
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,880
I shouldn't have brought this up. We can't seem to clarify this issue.

631
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,400
Hong Ji Hong!

632
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,120
Uncle.

633
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,460
Do you two know each other?

634
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,560
Do you two know each other?

635
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,090
I asked first, but I'll answer first. We do. We're best friends.

636
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:03,960
Him, me, and In Joo. We always went around together in college, right?

637
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,230
Must you confirm it?

638
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,170
Why wouldn't I confirm it?

639
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:12,880
Ugh, you rascal! If you came, you should have come to me first! How could you make me look for you?

640
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,040
I'll leave first. Go ahead and speak with each other.

641
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,980
Yeah, we don't have anything to talk about. We're just going to drink. Right Ji Hong?

642
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,740
Hey you rascal, look at the time!

643
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,470
Why? Daytime drinking is good!

644
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:26,800
- Let's go quickly.
- Hey, wait!

645
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,140
Are you married?

646
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,770
No.

647
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,230
Do you have a boyfriend?

648
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,180
No.

649
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,270
Then that's all.

650
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:51,590
♫  I tried hard, yes. ♫

651
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:54,000
♫  Feels like ♫

652
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,880
Do you know what else you need to know other than learning to place catheters?

653
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,890
What is it?

654
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:03,320
♫ Things don't work out as I wished  ♫

655
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,750
Accepting being protected.

656
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,540
♫  Myself, ♫
♫  am I pitiful? ♫

657
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,220
♫  This world,
Do I hate it? ♫

658
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,910
♫ Perhaps you might be lonely?  ♫

659
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:23,380
I'll be finished quickly so don't sit around anxiously here. Go and eat something.

660
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:30,620
♫  I don't know if I can comfort you.  ♫

661
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:36,570
♫ These words may not be enough to comfort you.  ♫

662
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:44,100
♫  But, it's always like this. ♫

663
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,920
♫ It will be okay  ♫
Calling: Hong Ji Hong

664
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,370
Where are you right now?

665
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,640
Hey. Stay outside. I'm going to talk with a junior of mine for a minute.

666
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,270
Hey. Can't we be together? You said it's just a junior.

667
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:07,580
Ah, just stay outside.

668
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:11,820
Uh, hey, I saw that woman before. Hey, introduce me. I saw her twice.

669
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,700
Hey, leave already!

670
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,680
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

671
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,620
Do you not remember me? I remember you, though.

672
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,880
Ah, really!

673
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:27,510
We will meet again. At our third meeting we'll be dating.

674
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,780
Who is he?

675
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:36,000
A crazy person. He's a friend. He's a staff member in general surgery.

676
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,720
What did you have to say? You want me to ask you a second time already?

677
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,420
No, please don't do it yet.

678
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:46,420
You're being so serious that it's making me feel awkward.

679
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:50,220
I'm sorry. I have a favor to ask.

680
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,180
What is it?

681
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:54,750
Doctor, if you're the chairman's son and a doctor on staff here,

682
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:58,560
you can access all the information in this hospital, right? Even the top tier ones?

683
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,530
Top tier information?

684
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:02,670
In Guk Il Medical Center, you can access different amounts of information based on your level.

685
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,340
I'm only temporarily here so—

686
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:09,800
You're saying that the information you can access is restricted because you're just temporarily here?

687
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:18,310
What are you saying right now? Are you asking me to access something you can't—

688
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,360
Doctor, let's talk about it again later.

689
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,840
- Why? What...
- I saw a strange person.
- What? But—

690
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:11,550
Ah, you scared me.

691
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:18,320
You came in without a sound.

692
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:22,330
Where are all your underlings who were protecting you?

693
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,370
I sent them all back.

694
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:25,590
Why?

695
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,790
Because you told me to.

696
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:31,460
You listened to me? Do you expect me to believe that?

697
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:38,560
Well, from now on, I'm planning on listen to a woman's words, too.

698
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:44,720
Why are you here, Doctor?

699
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:48,670
Does a doctor need a reason to see her patient?

700
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,080
Rest.

701
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,710
Yeah, what?

702
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:20,360
The aneurysm patient's blood pressure is under 90. I prescribed dopamine and an IV, but it's still not going up.

703
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,700
What should I do?

704
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:24,520
I'll come.

705
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,970
Did you eat yet?

706
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:39,690
Not yet. I had an emergency patient and couldn't even sit down.

707
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:43,370
- Go and eat.
- There's so much to do.

708
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:47,370
I need to prepare for surgery and do the dressing for Boss.

709
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:51,540
I'll do the dressing for Boss. Then you'll have time to eat.

710
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,220
- You are too happy.
- Thank you.

711
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,970
But why are you so good to me? Do you like me?

712
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,880
Stop fooling around. Get off.

713
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,810
- How about you?
- I'm going back up to Boss.

714
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,640
Thank you.

715
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,410
Should I put it in deep?

716
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,450
You bastard, bring my younger brother back from the dead.

717
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,560
Then, I'll let you live.

718
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:59,020
She's becoming stable.

719
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,410
- Yes.
- Call her.

720
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,450
She's not answering.

721
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,340
Do I have to leave her to you?

722
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,390
Can I trust you?

723
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:24,030
Yes, you can.

724
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,950
Okay. I will trust you once.

725
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,460
What's going on?

726
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,420
Here is the drink you ordered. Enjoy.

727
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:08,960
Where should I put this?

728
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,820
O-Over there by the kitchen.

729
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:29,920
It's already summer. How's it going with Su Jin, the girl you are dating?

730
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,830
Kang Su Jin, Park Su Jin ? Which one?

731
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:35,610
It's Kim, you punk. Wait.

732
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:39,410
Yes, Soon Hee. I'm on my way to your place to grab some drinks.

733
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:43,700
Doctor, Hye Jeong is not answering her phone. I have important news to tell her.

734
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,280
She may not answer her phone. Try again later.

735
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:51,120
Doctor, you don't know Hye Jeong. No matter what, Hye Jeong always calls back.

736
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,790
If she can't answer she always sends back a text message.

737
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:57,710
This is the first time I'm here. Can you recheck this?

738
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:02,280
Anyway, can you please recheck? Otherwise I will go to the hospital.

739
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:08,100
- Looks like the delivery ahjussi has changed.
- Yes.

740
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:12,210
Doesn't it seem like we met before?

741
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:14,390
Do you know me?

742
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:20,860
No. No, no. How much...?

743
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:30,510
She doesn't answer?

744
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:33,110
That's strange. Isn't she the doctor on call?

745
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:38,120
Doctor. Let's talk later. I saw a strange person.

746
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,870
- You go ahead first.
- Hey!

747
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:44,970
Hey! Ah, that guy!

748
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:53,850
Hello.

749
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:56,770
Where is Doctor Hye Jeong?

750
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,500
She went to change the wound dressing for the gangster boss.

751
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,450
Why is Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong doing that?

752
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:04,850
She told me to eat so she...

753
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:07,180
You didn't eat yet?

754
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:11,690
Finding food in between, while working, is a skill. Increase your survival skills.

755
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:12,870
Yes.

756
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:16,100
Call Doctor Hye Jeong.

757
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,160
I can't leave and entrust the patients to you guys.

758
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,780
She's not answering. Should I go and take a look?

759
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,960
Tell her to check the cerebral aneurysm patient.

760
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,830
Yes.

761
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:28,060
No, go and eat.

762
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:31,190
-,No, no, no, I can go—
- Go eat.

763
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:34,960
- Don't make me tell you twice.
- Yes, thank you.

764
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,840
Do you know what type of person he is? If you do, you'll regret saving him.

765
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:50,120
He's not even human. Should I tell you how he killed my younger brother?

766
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:55,040
Should I tell you how he ruined my family? What he did to me?

767
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,050
I'll show you.

768
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:11,670
I've been waiting... for this day to come.

769
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:15,100
You can't have good luck forever.

770
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:18,020
Why? Do you have something to say?

771
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:28,610
- Your brother came to find me with his own two feet. The one who came to find me first was that guy.
- So?

772
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,430
You role-played the good brother, and now that he has no value to you, you buried him, you sh*t-faced dog.

773
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:35,590
You can't hit the head.

774
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:39,780
Sit down, or else he dies.

775
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:46,380
If I can't hit the head, is this okay?

776
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:51,670
Please don't do that. It hasn't been long since his surgery, something could go wrong.

777
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:55,000
If something happens to him, you'll have to be punished by the law.

778
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,280
Don't try to convince me.

779
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,010
Why are you in pain because of trash like him?

780
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:04,720
If you get arrested on charges of murder, you'll have to rot in jail forever, and his gang members

781
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,980
won't leave you alone in jail.

782
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,780
It's enough that you threatened him.

783
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:18,650
He's scared. He's scared that he'll die.

784
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:23,410
As long as he's alive, people like you will keep visiting him.

785
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:31,460
Don't get blood on your hands. Give me the knife.

786
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:56,130
It's quite complicated here. I don't want to get involved. I'm going to go out.

787
00:57:56,130 --> 00:58:00,230
Stop! Come next to the woman

788
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,840
or else this bastard dies.

789
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:14,760
Take him and leave.

790
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,600
I'll do it. Doctor Yoo, take him and leave.

791
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:24,790
Get out!

792
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:32,830
Kong Byeong Joo. Kong Byeong Joo!

793
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,540
People say this.

794
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:59,790
Forgiving isn't done for others, but for yourself.

795
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:06,100
You shouldn't say things like that. Forgiveness isn't as light as it sounds.

796
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,990
♫  Don't say you're sorry. ♫

797
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:09,500
♫  No way.  ♫

798
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,540
♫  Don't leave me, no way. ♫
