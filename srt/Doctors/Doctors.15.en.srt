Episode 15

2
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:27,607
I said stop it!
Episode 15

3
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:34,437
If they find out their father died for their hospital bills,

4
00:00:34,437 --> 00:00:36,847
what do you think will happen to your children's lives?

5
00:00:38,227 --> 00:00:42,397
Honestly, the path you're taking is because you couldn't carry the weight of your own life.

6
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:48,477
Do you think it's okay to be a dad and leave a shadow over the rest of your children's lives?

7
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:52,227
I won't stop you from dying. But even if you're going to die,

8
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:55,477
make sure you explain why to your children beforehand.

9
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:58,597
Dad isn't dying because of you.

10
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:06,147
No matter how many outside people help, no one can take a father's vacant role.

11
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:09,657
I was like that.

12
00:01:12,757 --> 00:01:18,127
Constantly, I wanted to die. The life my mom showed me,

13
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:25,127
was at an end of a road where I had to decide for myself.

14
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:35,037
Do you want to give that kind of life to Hae and Dal?

15
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:50,677
Drink this.

16
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,627
What happened to Hae and Dal's dad?

17
00:02:58,627 --> 00:03:03,587
He's probably with his kids. He's mentally exhausted.

18
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:05,577
You've worked hard.

19
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:13,927
Your pitifulness is ironic.

20
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:18,597
Your wounds became healing for Hae and Dal's dad.

21
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:20,607
I guess you could think of it that way.

22
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:21,827
Why? Is it not?

23
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:25,967
No, I think we both helped heal each other.

24
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:31,737
After seeing Hae and Dal's dad, I had a lot of thoughts about my dad.

25
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:36,597
But thinking about my dad is much less burdensome than before.

26
00:03:36,597 --> 00:03:40,267
- I don't know what is, but that's what it's like.
- I think I know what it is.

27
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:43,837
You can't explain it with words, but it's something that makes your heart feel comfortable.

28
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:50,657
You're right. But I think there's so much that I don't know about your childhood.

29
00:03:50,657 --> 00:03:54,277
What were your parents like?

30
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,287
They were both professors.

31
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:02,757
They both worked, and whenever I came home on weekdays I was always alone.

32
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:09,747
I went to the same school as my mom, but I never waited for her and always went home by myself.

33
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:13,817
Later, that tormented me,

34
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:17,547
because I thought, "Why didn't I come home together with Mom?"

35
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,767
I like these kinds of stories.

36
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:24,037
I like that you like these stories.

37
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:37,367
Tell Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong to come to my office tomorrow.

38
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:39,387
Yes, sir.

39
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:49,737
Neurosurgeons are sensitive.

40
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:56,067
Surgeries are always susceptible to sensitivity and surgeons must perform on areas that are as thin as paper.

41
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:58,877
They always feel a sense of urgency.

42
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:05,317
Our sensitivity is what protects us.

43
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:11,447
You scared me!

44
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:14,347
Do you think your body could be hidden?

45
00:06:23,337 --> 00:06:26,557
Dad

46
00:06:37,117 --> 00:06:40,887
The person you have called cannot be reached.

47
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:43,407
Try giving Seo Woo a call.

48
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:47,607
She's not picking up because she doesn't want to. Why should I call her?

49
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,817
Is that something you should say as a mom?

50
00:06:49,817 --> 00:06:53,327
I'm saying that because I am her mom. Ambition doesn't suit her.

51
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:56,487
She did what she could all these years trying to live up to your expectations.

52
00:06:56,487 --> 00:06:58,807
This is the result of doing what she could? What did she do?

53
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:02,557
She just needs to follow the path that's been laid out for her. What's so hard about that?

54
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:05,667
- Path that's been laid out, yeah right.
- What?

55
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:08,737
Have you gone deaf? Why can't you understand what I say?

56
00:07:08,737 --> 00:07:12,477
Anyway, I'm not going to cooperate with you.

57
00:07:21,427 --> 00:07:23,317
- What?
- I'll go alone.

58
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,337
Why would you go with me when I haven't done anything right?

59
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:27,477
It's better to be dragged in,

60
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:31,847
rather than walking in by yourself after no one went looking for you, right? Follow me.

61
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:38,157
How's patient Nam Dal?

62
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,657
His brain scans came out fine, and he barely has any headaches and isn't throwing up.

63
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:43,227
He's being discharged today.

64
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:46,017
The hospital fees got taken care of with their TV broadcast.

65
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:48,777
That's good. What about you?

66
00:07:57,457 --> 00:08:00,667
What are you looking at? Get your head together!

67
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,507
There's so much work.

68
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:05,497
You have to bring Joong Dae back. It's already been over a week.

69
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:08,557
At this point, it's embarrassing for him to walk in here alone.

70
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:10,687
Where on earth is this kid?

71
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:13,887
I've tried contacting all his close friends, and they say he's not there.

72
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:17,737
That's what I mean. He's a very strange one. It must be a hobby.

73
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:21,227
I was wondering why someone like him came into the neurosurgery department.

74
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:24,397
And I looked into it and found out he was previously a talented psychopath.

75
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:26,587
Surgeon? I guess he could become one.

76
00:08:26,587 --> 00:08:28,017
Is that a compliment?

77
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:30,307
Then is it profanity?

78
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:34,497
Hyung!

79
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:36,757
Joong Dae!

80
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:40,437
Make sure to lecture him well, to the point where he's exhausted and can't run away.

81
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,447
Yes, Doctor!

82
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:45,097
- Ahn Joong Dae!
- Yes!

83
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:47,527
Hurry up and start working on rounds!

84
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,677
Yes!

85
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:50,347
Joong Dae, Joong Dae, Ahn Joong Dae!

86
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:52,967
Aren't you going to change?

87
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:57,617
This gown, you missed it, right?

88
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:58,557
Thank you.

89
00:08:58,557 --> 00:09:01,077
Geez, do well.

90
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:07,187
Your body has become bigger. Much bigger.

91
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:10,497
We're discharging Nam Dal. What do you plan on doing with Nam Hae?

92
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:14,797
Hae just needs to come as an outpatient. Doctor Jeong Yoon Do said he can be discharged too.

93
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:26,587
What?

94
00:09:26,587 --> 00:09:29,877
The director wants you to come up for a minute.

95
00:09:29,877 --> 00:09:32,067
I don't want to.

96
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:42,917
You're outside?

97
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,387
Yes, hello, Doctor.

98
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:46,777
I watched the broadcast.

99
00:09:46,777 --> 00:09:51,277
It's really thanks to you we were able to figure out the discharge paperwork.

100
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:54,157
You shouldn't bathe the children with hot water for a while.

101
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:57,757
If they ever start having headaches or throwing up, make sure to bring them in immediately.

102
00:09:57,757 --> 00:09:59,157
Yes, I understand.

103
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:01,367
I'm going to check up on Dal.

104
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:04,127
Uhm, Doctor.

105
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:07,577
It really worked out well. You're getting a lot of support from people.

106
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:10,157
You shouldn't have any concerns about treatment fees from now on.

107
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:12,287
I won't forget for as long as I live.

108
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:14,267
Do you think well of me again?

109
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:17,317
Yes, I liked you, hated you...

110
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,437
Now I see you in a good light again.

111
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:24,137
The world is still quite warm.

112
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:27,777
It must be nice for Hae and Dal, since they have such a loving father.

113
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:32,277
It's not that. All fathers are like that.

114
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:38,517
I became a neurosurgeon

115
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:41,417
under the influence of my grandmother.

116
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:44,887
When I caused trouble, she said this.

117
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:50,127
"If you're born human, you at least need a secure job."

118
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:55,897
Even if you did your best, if someone dies, you should know to be embarrassed.

119
00:10:55,897 --> 00:10:58,177
Does it become forgivable if you've done your best?

120
00:10:58,177 --> 00:11:02,107
If you prove that I didn't try my best,

121
00:11:02,107 --> 00:11:04,677
I will receive your punishment.

122
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:08,357
Yes?

123
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:14,847
Doctor Yoo, sit here.

124
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:20,057
Are you busy?

125
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:24,717
Yes, a bit. What's the matter? You seem to be contacting me often.

126
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,297
I called you just last week. Isn't this the second time?

127
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:31,367
It's only once a week, but does it seem so often to you?

128
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:32,807
What did you want to say?

129
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:34,877
Nothing special.

130
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:38,647
You seem to live diligently, so I thought I would call you every so often to drink tea to remind myself to live diligently.

131
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:42,577
You get lazier as you get older.

132
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:46,647
Choi Kang Soo

133
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:49,847
I'll be going. There's an emergency.

134
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:52,227
Okay, do your work. Oh, right...

135
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:54,957
How is my Seo Woo doing?

136
00:11:56,207 --> 00:12:00,827
That's not a question to ask me. I think you can call her and ask her yourself.

137
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:10,227
I watched you well when you were on TV.

138
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:12,277
Please talk.

139
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:19,437
She's okay.

140
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:23,057
After she went on TV, I received a lot of calls from my friends.

141
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:26,177
Use her a lot for the hospital's advertising.

142
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:28,317
Ah, because of that I want to fire her, but I can't.

143
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:29,767
Why fire her?

144
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:31,447
It's just like that.

145
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:34,447
Isn't today the funding contract day for Ji Hong?

146
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:39,697
It probably is. He's probably going to start something with that, but will that even work?

147
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:44,097
He'll see later, how much he was like a frog inside of a well. (Korean proverb that means to be narrow-minded)

148
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:46,327
Wow, anything can happen.

149
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:48,207
Good work.

150
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:52,097
Twenty-seven year old male. Due to a gas explosion at the construction site,

151
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:54,807
a battery flew into his eye and is embedded. As for the CT—

152
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,807
- A battery is embedded?
- Yes.

153
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:59,197
- Mental state?
- His mental state seems alert.

154
00:12:59,197 --> 00:13:01,377
Let's go see.

155
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:05,127
Stay still please!

156
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:08,617
Patient, patient! Can you hear my voice?

157
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:12,487
Yes, I do. But... It hurts so much!

158
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:15,727
Calm down. Can you lift your right arm?

159
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:17,147
Yes.

160
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,737
What about the left leg?

161
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:24,167
Hold on please.

162
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:30,647
His pupillary and motor reflexes are normal. Let's take pictures right away. Call Prof. Hong Ji Hong.

163
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:33,427
Professor Hong isn't giving medical treatment until this afternoon.

164
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:34,887
Why?

165
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:47,727
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

166
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,287
Nice to meet you.

167
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:54,367
Hello. Nice to meet you.

168
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,947
This way.

169
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:10,907
Hong Ji Hong

170
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:14,707
Thank you.

171
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:29,327
The battery went through the wall of the left eye socket.

172
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:33,077
There is head trauma in the frontal lobe and an epidural hemorrhage.

173
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:35,547
We have to do this with the ophthalmology department.

174
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:37,577
I contacted them and they're coming right now.

175
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:41,447
We will go in after Ophthalmology extracts the battery from the eye.

176
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,427
Fortunately, there isn't a lot of bleeding.

177
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:47,907
The subdural space doesn't look torn. We can only hope.

178
00:14:47,907 --> 00:14:50,357
First, prepare an operating room.

179
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,147
- Yes?
- An operating room.

180
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,987
Yes, sir.

181
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:06,447
But, why did you call me?

182
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,927
Aren't you Doctor Ji Hong's exclusive fellow?

183
00:15:08,927 --> 00:15:10,717
When I'm working, I'm not exclusive.

184
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:13,787
Then... What is exclusive?

185
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,737
Ah, Doctor Yoo is really funny if you look closely.

186
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:22,137
I'm sorry. Doctor Hong went into the board meeting.

187
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:24,457
That's surprising. He doesn't seem like he likes those things.

188
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:27,697
You can't live only doing the things you like.

189
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:29,687
Really?

190
00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:36,637
Director Jin Myeong Hoon

191
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:38,657
It's the Director.

192
00:15:38,657 --> 00:15:40,957
You're not picking up?

193
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:44,247
Do you know when I love being my father's son?

194
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:48,927
At times like this. Even if I do this, he can't mess with me.

195
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:51,867
- You must be happy.
- You're not being sarcastic, right?

196
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:57,037
I'm not. We can't choose the background we have.

197
00:15:57,037 --> 00:15:59,597
It's true that a good background is good.

198
00:15:59,597 --> 00:16:02,227
It's good that it's not twisted.

199
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:06,457
Anyway, aren't you yourself having a good time?

200
00:16:06,457 --> 00:16:08,337
- Yes, I like it.
- Hey...

201
00:16:08,337 --> 00:16:10,917
That's too honest.

202
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:15,867
I-I'm very hurt! Because of you, I'm going on an indecent road right now.

203
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:22,697
That doesn't mean you have to make that face.

204
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:24,547
It's just that the romantic rival is Doc Hong,

205
00:16:24,547 --> 00:16:28,227
so the indecent road sometimes doesn't seem like an indecent one.

206
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:32,717
Now you're already smiling again.

207
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:35,707
Doctor...

208
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:42,947
Today's agenda is to select a new director

209
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:46,847
and also reach an agreement on the construction of the geriatric wellness center.

210
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,187
Wasn't the construction of the geriatric wellness center already rejected?

211
00:16:50,187 --> 00:16:52,717
But isn't the situation different now?

212
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:55,167
We have to change to survive.

213
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:58,887
I'm Doctor Hong Ji Hong. I agree with the director.

214
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:01,387
We have to change to survive.

215
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,897
I also agree with the director.

216
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,267
I think change is something that switches direction.

217
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:10,987
Thus far our hospital has been chasing after external growth.

218
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:14,697
I believe that the geriatric wellness center construction is such an extension.

219
00:17:14,697 --> 00:17:19,297
Rather than increasing the size and taking on the high cost burden and risk to maintain it,

220
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:24,187
I think it would be better to focus on internal stability and increase the value of the brand.

221
00:17:24,187 --> 00:17:27,927
It's easier said than done. Focusing on internal stability will also have additional expenses.

222
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:30,277
What are you going to do about that cost?

223
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:44,487
Professor Hong Ji Hong was researching DBS(deep brain stimulation) dopamine sensor development.

224
00:17:44,487 --> 00:17:48,007
MH Med-Tech have agreed to fund 60 billion won.

225
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:51,717
Along with the the massive capital we will bring in,

226
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:56,387
we can increase our brand as a research institution that continuously conducts research.

227
00:17:56,387 --> 00:17:58,527
Using the incoming capital as our basis,

228
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:02,497
we feel as though it's time to comprehensively inspect the hospital's welfare foundation.

229
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:07,687
A hospital is a place where doctors and patients have to coexist.

230
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:29,927
You put up a good defense.

231
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:32,807
As a John Hopkins grad, your punch is very accurate.

232
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:37,257
No, it was you who brought up the topic of change.

233
00:18:37,257 --> 00:18:40,077
Ultimately, are you trying to expand the hospital's welfare system?

234
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,027
I'm sure the board of directors will do so accordingly.

235
00:18:43,027 --> 00:18:46,497
You're confident. Okay, then.

236
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:48,767
You did well today.

237
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,737
How is Patient Lee Jin Seo?

238
00:19:09,737 --> 00:19:14,067
His blood pressure is 160/100. After he had a bowel movement, his headache got more severe.

239
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:15,607
Did you administer diclofenac?

240
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:17,117
Yes.

241
00:19:17,117 --> 00:19:20,217
- You're not avoiding me, are you?
- Why would I?

242
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:24,217
It just seems like you don't act the same way towards me anymore.

243
00:19:24,217 --> 00:19:26,257
Could we go back to how we were before?

244
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:29,607
Emotions... They change.

245
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:35,927
Why? Are you scared I'll say I like you?

246
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:37,587
No.

247
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:39,447
It's Knife Yoon.

248
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:45,677
- Why are you making fun of me?
- I'm not making fun of you. I'm making fun of myself.

249
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,037
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

250
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:09,217
What is your problem? Why aren't you coming home?

251
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:12,167
I'm doing just as you said, working to death. So what is your problem?

252
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,437
Do you know how Hong Ji Hong treated me at the Board of Directors meeting?

253
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:16,277
Do you know how he fu**ed me up?

254
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:19,417
I told you to get closer to Hong Ji Hong. What were you doing?

255
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:22,177
You should've let me know what Hong Ji Hong was going to do to me!

256
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:25,187
- Do you think I became a doctor to be your spy?
- What?

257
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:28,407
- I have a dream too, as a neurosurgeon.
- So what?

258
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:29,917
Did I say anything about your dream?

259
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,877
I wasn't born to be an avatar to fit your expectations.

260
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:34,457
Is that something to say to your own father?

261
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:38,447
- To a father who loves you and supports you more than anyone?
- I love you too.

262
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,757
- That's why I've kept it in this much.
- Keep what in?

263
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:45,457
What did you say to Yoo Hye Jeong in front of me? Our Seo Woo isn't very flexible and is too serious,

264
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:48,047
- so she has a hard time socially.
- But it's the truth!

265
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:52,227
If that's the truth, should I say the truth as well? I went to the college you couldn't go to.

266
00:20:52,227 --> 00:20:56,847
- I have the appearance that you don't have, I have the—
- All the things you have I gave to you!

267
00:20:56,847 --> 00:21:00,867
Think of if you grew up in Hye Jeong's environment. Do you think you could be in this position?!

268
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:05,837
Do you think you could have been in your position without Grandfather? At least I was good at studying!

269
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:14,687
I'm sorry.

270
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:17,497
So why did you—

271
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:29,907
Neurosurgeon Hong Ji Hong

272
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,157
Ah, you scared me!

273
00:21:40,157 --> 00:21:42,187
Were you surprised?

274
00:21:42,187 --> 00:21:44,657
A little. You didn't even tell me you were coming.

275
00:21:44,657 --> 00:21:46,927
Do I have to tell you before I come?

276
00:21:46,927 --> 00:21:49,917
Mm, I feel as though I will have to be careful answering that question.

277
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,597
Sit down.

278
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:56,707
Why didn't you tell me you were going to the Board of Directors? Do I have to hear that from Kyeong Joon?

279
00:21:56,707 --> 00:21:58,417
Wow.

280
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,927
- I'm scary, right?
- A little.

281
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:05,457
You need to always make sure you take your vitamin D.

282
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:09,517
For people who don't see the sunlight, and are confined to live in the operating room.

283
00:22:09,517 --> 00:22:11,347
What are you doing right now?

284
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:14,527
I'm worried that you might get sick.

285
00:22:15,527 --> 00:22:18,127
Can we leave work together today?

286
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:20,067
I have an appointment today.

287
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:27,387
Alright. I planned to eat dinner with over funding matters.

288
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,787
Do I pass?

289
00:22:28,787 --> 00:22:30,747
Yes, you pass.

290
00:22:32,947 --> 00:22:36,757
Ah, why am I like this? I want to check up on everything.

291
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:39,107
- You would get tired of me, right?
- I wouldn't get tired.

292
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,777
It's okay. You can keep on checking up on me.

293
00:22:44,027 --> 00:22:46,827
- What is this?
- Drink it, it's vitamin C.

294
00:22:46,827 --> 00:22:49,567
Ah, I don't like things like this. I feel like a child!

295
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:52,477
You can't do that. For your health!

296
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:01,917
It's okay...

297
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:06,927
- Drink all of it.
- Yes ma'am.

298
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:15,827
Oh? Doc Bi? Doctor Bi Yeong Gook is going to come, right?

299
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:19,927
No, today I'm alone. Give me some alcohol.

300
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:22,527
Alright.

301
00:23:23,347 --> 00:23:26,857
But, is Ahn Joong Dae at the hospital?

302
00:23:26,857 --> 00:23:28,657
He probably is.

303
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:33,197
He's probably going to be punished for a month. Seeing that he ran away and got caught today.

304
00:23:33,197 --> 00:23:35,427
Hye Jeong apparently caught him.

305
00:23:37,317 --> 00:23:39,757
But she won't say where she caught him.

306
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:41,327
Did she tell you?

307
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:43,317
I don't know.

308
00:23:43,317 --> 00:23:44,967
Do you have secrets between each other?

309
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:49,537
- We don't have secrets between us.
- Then do you know why Hye Jeong came to our hospital?

310
00:23:49,537 --> 00:23:55,347
She probably went because it's a large hospital! Your hospital's cafeteria food is so delicious.

311
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:57,787
You do have secrets between each other.

312
00:23:57,787 --> 00:24:00,627
She didn't tell you.

313
00:24:00,627 --> 00:24:03,157
What does she keep saying...

314
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,607
You look happy. Are you dating?

315
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:11,247
I'll tell you later.

316
00:24:11,247 --> 00:24:14,317
- You  are  dating!
I love you!

317
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:16,187
What? What is that sound?

318
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:18,087
It's nothing.

319
00:24:18,777 --> 00:24:23,087
I feel so comfortable because you look so happy.

320
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:29,007
This is the first time we've had a meal together since the chairman left.

321
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:31,167
I'm having a ton of thoughts about the chairman today.

322
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:35,487
You were the disciple that the chairman loved the most.

323
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:37,477
Hong Ji Hong.

324
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:41,497
Neither my wife nor my friends,

325
00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:44,367
in those areas that they don't understand about me,

326
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:46,727
you have filled those voids.

327
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:49,647
Besides us, it's hard for people to understand

328
00:24:49,647 --> 00:24:51,977
the life I have to live as a neurosurgeon.

329
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:58,257
So you have to be good to me! I am older than you! I'm going to die sooner than you!

330
00:25:01,297 --> 00:25:03,907
I was thankful back then.

331
00:25:03,907 --> 00:25:08,127
Because of me, you went against Father's last wishes.

332
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:11,907
Later,

333
00:25:11,907 --> 00:25:17,077
later when I meet the chairman, I will have to beg for forgiveness then.

334
00:25:17,077 --> 00:25:21,387
Then he'll probably say this, "When did you guys ever listen to what I said? I knew this would happen."

335
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:51,647
Do I have to have look out for others while going into my own home?

336
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:55,037
I'm dying because of the beagles.

337
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:58,577
No. I need to kick them out if they're there.

338
00:25:58,577 --> 00:26:01,477
I need to let them know how scary the owner is today.

339
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:16,767
They're not here.

340
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:25,697
They're not here.

341
00:26:32,787 --> 00:26:36,067
Yes! Yes!

342
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,237
What is this?

343
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:45,137
No, no. They know the password. There's no way that the beagles would ring the doorbell.

344
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:53,917
Hey y-you, what are you doing here?

345
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:57,547
When you say I'm like a sibling, this is like being a sibling. I'm not going home.

346
00:26:57,547 --> 00:26:59,187
Hey!

347
00:27:00,377 --> 00:27:04,537
Already this home isn't like my home to me! Just—

348
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,337
You came home early today.

349
00:27:07,337 --> 00:27:10,527
We came in late on purpose so that you could have some time alone.

350
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:14,597
- Seo Woo, you're here.
- Hello, I also came to be indebted.

351
00:27:14,597 --> 00:27:18,977
Aigoo, what do mean to be indebted? This is a homeless' heaven.

352
00:27:18,977 --> 00:27:21,047
I welcome your arrival in heaven, Seo Woo.

353
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:23,857
Thank you Uncle and Unni!

354
00:27:28,177 --> 00:27:31,827
You know, you are pushing this way too far. I have something called privacy, as well!

355
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:34,247
Uncle. Let's really not do this. Take all of them out.

356
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:36,327
- Hey, you get out.
- Right.

357
00:27:36,327 --> 00:27:39,977
That's right. If you get out, then the three of us are comfortable.

358
00:27:39,977 --> 00:27:43,627
- B-But, this is my house?
- Wow, you're really pushing it that you have a house.

359
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:47,697
But, I have a house as well, so I'm not that sad.

360
00:27:47,697 --> 00:27:51,307
Alright, I'll leave.

361
00:27:51,307 --> 00:27:53,497
Live happily among the three of you.

362
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:57,127
Should I teach you the password to Ji Hong's house?

363
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:02,177
Do you know it?

364
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:15,597
- Oh, what is this?
- Did you arrive?

365
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:18,357
- I was kicked out from my house.
- Isn't it your house?

366
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:20,447
Aigoo, the fist seemed to come before the law.

367
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:24,407
Dude, still, it's not even your house. How can you trespass?

368
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:28,567
Do you think I'm going to go upstairs even if you do that? Rather than being with the beagles,

369
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:30,617
I want to be beaten to death here.

370
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:35,657
I couldn't dare to open your refrigerator, though. Because I thought we weren't close enough to do that.

371
00:28:35,657 --> 00:28:39,837
We aren't even close enough for you to open my refrigerator, but you say that you are going to sleep at my house?

372
00:28:39,837 --> 00:28:43,547
We can get closer, starting now. This building's humans only consist of you.

373
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:46,527
We, as humans, should get along together well.

374
00:28:46,527 --> 00:28:49,947
Then, I will open the refrigerator.

375
00:28:49,947 --> 00:28:51,887
What would you like to eat?

376
00:28:53,297 --> 00:28:55,157
Bring some beer.

377
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:03,747
Is this a rebel in her teens? Why would you run away?

378
00:29:03,747 --> 00:29:05,947
- How is it for you, Unni?
- How is what?

379
00:29:05,947 --> 00:29:10,097
- Living.
- Do you normally ask yourself how living is before you live?

380
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:12,727
I live because I'm alive.

381
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:16,317
It seems like I'm becoming more and more worthless.

382
00:29:16,317 --> 00:29:19,217
If you know that you are becoming worthless, then that's a good thing.

383
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:22,577
I'm going to sleep now. I'm sleeping on the sofa, but where are you going to sleep?

384
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:25,837
- I'm going to sleep a little bit later.
- Okay then.

385
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:33,687
♫  The loneliness which cannot grow any larger  ♫

386
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:40,767
When I think about it, when I felt most worthless,
♫  in my heart ♫

387
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:43,717
I don't think I knew that I was worthless.

388
00:29:44,357 --> 00:29:49,417
I only knew after it passed already.
♫  The love which has grown alone grows  ♫

389
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:51,197
I'm going to sleep!

390
00:30:00,137 --> 00:30:02,417
Fin.K.L. Land

391
00:30:04,357 --> 00:30:09,387
♬ While looking at you I knew ♬

392
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:11,777
The person you have called cannot be reached.

393
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:16,997
♫  The familiar feeling in your eyes  ♫

394
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:21,627
♫  which are looking at me  ♫

395
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:23,317
I'll call you later.

396
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:27,557
You are my friend. I'll never forget about you. 
♫  My tears are a pool of rain  ♫

397
00:30:31,437 --> 00:30:33,017
Soon Hee Hawaii.

398
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:40,467
♫  Shining so brightly in my heart ♫

399
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:47,767
♫  The rain which is you falls and slowly tinges me ♫

400
00:30:47,797 --> 00:30:51,377
♫  I go wherever you go  ♫

401
00:30:51,467 --> 00:31:02,167
♫  As for me always, I am here with you.  ♫

402
00:31:02,257 --> 00:31:05,927
♫  For me you've become a cloud  ♫

403
00:31:05,927 --> 00:31:09,647
♫  You come down into my love ♫

404
00:31:09,647 --> 00:31:13,317
♫  For only you my feeling  ♫

405
00:31:13,317 --> 00:31:17,037
♫  Can grow so that  ♫

406
00:31:17,037 --> 00:31:20,797
♫  Your warm touch  ♫

407
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:24,687
♫  The melody for just the two of us  ♫

408
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:30,157
♫  The dream will be realized ♫

409
00:31:33,817 --> 00:31:35,237
Are you going out now?

410
00:31:35,237 --> 00:31:36,597
Yeah.

411
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:43,517
It can't be... Don't tell me you're packing meals for Doctor Yoo.

412
00:31:43,517 --> 00:31:44,627
Why? I can't do that?

413
00:31:44,627 --> 00:31:46,647
No, you can't.

414
00:31:46,647 --> 00:31:48,337
Why not?

415
00:31:48,337 --> 00:31:53,917
Isn't that too much? Since I'm here, you should have breakfast with me

416
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:57,457
and go to work together with me. Isn't that how it's supposed to be?

417
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,077
Why are you acting like this? So indecent.

418
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:05,127
Anyway, I'm going to get going. You can eat the ones I made that I ruined.

419
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:08,817
Doctor Hong.

420
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:12,277
Lend me some underwear, please. I need to shower.

421
00:32:12,277 --> 00:32:15,077
Don't you have cleanliness disorder? You're okay with other peoples underwear?

422
00:32:15,077 --> 00:32:16,617
I'm not sensitive to those.

423
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:19,207
I am. I'm not sharing my underwear with you.

424
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:24,007
- He's asking to borrow my underwear...
- Teach!

425
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:29,477
How did I come to this point?

426
00:32:30,677 --> 00:32:35,147
Where are the underwear... Where?

427
00:32:45,107 --> 00:32:49,307
I didn't make it. I blended it. Watermelon juice.

428
00:32:49,307 --> 00:32:51,907
I want to eat the food you cook.

429
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:57,477
I'm saying I'm curious of how you cook.

430
00:32:58,447 --> 00:33:02,387
Even without you telling me, I've been wanting to cook for a while.

431
00:33:02,387 --> 00:33:03,877
Why?

432
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:07,047
Because I want to cook for you.

433
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:09,247
We're on the same page.

434
00:33:10,787 --> 00:33:12,627
It would be great.

435
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:14,067
What?

436
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:17,127
The answer to your second question.

437
00:33:20,577 --> 00:33:22,917
What are you doing today?

438
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:26,357
If there's no emergency call, I'm going to stay home and write my thesis.

439
00:33:27,247 --> 00:33:30,777
I can grant this, but you can't write much of your thesis today.

440
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:40,457
- No. No. It looks delicious.
- Eat.

441
00:33:40,457 --> 00:33:43,427
- I'll enjoy the food.
- Yes.

442
00:33:45,097 --> 00:33:47,077
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

443
00:33:48,687 --> 00:33:50,637
It's arrived.

444
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:54,767
What happened?

445
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:57,657
We were heading to our wedding, but a car crashed into us.

446
00:33:57,657 --> 00:33:59,787
You seem to be badly hurt as well. Are you okay?

447
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,077
Yeah, yeah I'm good.

448
00:34:01,077 --> 00:34:06,547
Please save our Hee Yeon first. We have a baby. She's pregnant!

449
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:09,037
Please move her quickly. Hey, quickly call Ob/Gyn.

450
00:34:09,037 --> 00:34:12,187
- Quick!
- Please hurry.

451
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:27,287
Our Hee Yeon. Please save our Hee Yeon...

452
00:34:27,287 --> 00:34:30,557
Please calm down. You should wait in the waiting area, alright?

453
00:34:34,647 --> 00:34:37,027
You can't.

454
00:34:37,027 --> 00:34:41,107
Patient. Patient can you hear my voice?

455
00:34:55,077 --> 00:34:56,087
Did you obtain an x-ray?

456
00:34:56,087 --> 00:35:01,077
Yes, I did, but the patient is pregnant.

457
00:35:01,857 --> 00:35:04,967
- And the obstetricians?
- They'll be here soon.

458
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:21,147
Finally, I'm wearing a wedding dress.

459
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:22,287
It's that exciting?

460
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:26,497
Yeah! Our Jin Jin.

461
00:35:26,497 --> 00:35:30,157
I want to finish all the procedures before Jin Jin is born.

462
00:35:30,157 --> 00:35:33,787
I'm sorry, and thank you,

463
00:35:33,787 --> 00:35:38,787
for enduring, taking care, helping and following me well.

464
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:45,747
No, you had it harder. Tirelessly working and being obsessive.

465
00:35:45,747 --> 00:35:51,877
Right. Now we have a house. We're getting getting married, and when Jin Jin is born,

466
00:35:51,877 --> 00:35:54,917
we're only left with happy things.

467
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:57,987
Honey, I love you.

468
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:12,337
The patient Lee Gi Hwan went from stupor to drowsy.

469
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:16,357
- What about the migraines?
- They say it's okay for the area he got surgery on.

470
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:18,697
Wait a second.

471
00:36:18,697 --> 00:36:19,597
Yes?

472
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:21,767
A car accident patient just arrived at the ER.

473
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:25,627
A 29-year old female patient in semi coma. Her GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) is a 5.

474
00:36:25,627 --> 00:36:27,427
I can't see any motor function in her limbs.

475
00:36:27,427 --> 00:36:28,447
What about CT?

476
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:31,517
There is a bleeding, about 80 cc, in the parietal lobe.

477
00:36:31,517 --> 00:36:34,167
The Arteriovenous Malformation(AVM) looks torn.
(An AVM is a malformation of blood vessels).

478
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:36,737
She's 20-weeks pregnant.

479
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:40,347
20-weeks pregnant... Alright, I'm coming.

480
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:09,617
There's a lot of bleeding. What did the Ob/Gyn doctors say?

481
00:37:09,617 --> 00:37:13,607
They said the baby is okay. Are we going to perform a surgery?

482
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,717
Tell me your medical opinion on this, Yeong Gook.

483
00:37:15,717 --> 00:37:19,167
Dr. Hong can make the decision. I'm not the instructing doctor.

484
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,017
Who told you you're going to instruct?

485
00:37:21,017 --> 00:37:25,157
I am asking you what's the best solution as a surgeon. Gyeong Joon.

486
00:37:25,157 --> 00:37:27,807
I think we shouldn't do a surgery.

487
00:37:27,807 --> 00:37:30,247
- Why?
- GCS 4.

488
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:35,057
The mid-line of the brain is 15cm off, and her pupils are dilated.

489
00:37:35,057 --> 00:37:36,427
What about you, Dr. Yoo?

490
00:37:36,427 --> 00:37:38,777
I don't think she will get better even with surgery.

491
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:44,257
However, I think under these circumstances, the guardian's opinion comes first.

492
00:37:45,657 --> 00:37:50,187
You're thinking like an amateur. As a surgeon you're missing the point.

493
00:37:51,287 --> 00:37:54,137
We won't do the surgery.

494
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:59,257
With this much damage, she won't recover even with a surgery.

495
00:37:59,257 --> 00:38:05,577
This will only add pain to the guardian. Tell the guardian to come see me.

496
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:18,517
- Doctor.
- This is Patient Lee Hee Yeon's guardian.

497
00:38:22,127 --> 00:38:30,267
We're sorry, but the patient has suffered too much damage. She has little chance of recovery.

498
00:38:39,997 --> 00:38:45,847
You're not saying there's absolutely no chance of her getting better, right?

499
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:52,737
There's a slight chance, right? Can she have surgery?

500
00:38:53,717 --> 00:38:55,887
We won't do it.

501
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:58,617
Why?

502
00:38:58,617 --> 00:39:03,157
Because even with a surgery, she won't get better.

503
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:10,847
We're sorry, but we don't want to risk the baby's life.

504
00:39:18,177 --> 00:39:21,387
That can't be it...

505
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:26,117
It's our wedding day after living together for three years.

506
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:32,927
She was so excited. It can't be her funeral today.

507
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:41,157
This might be hard for you, but for the patient and the baby's sake, please accept it.

508
00:39:41,907 --> 00:39:46,297
We're sorry. As a physician, this is our limit.

509
00:39:46,297 --> 00:39:48,347
Please!

510
00:40:05,747 --> 00:40:10,707
First transfer the patient to ICU. If there's any change, tell me right away.

511
00:40:10,707 --> 00:40:12,937
I think I'm an amateur.

512
00:40:14,507 --> 00:40:17,817
I was sure after meeting the patient's guardian.

513
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:20,487
I feel that it is right to do the surgery.

514
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:23,857
A surgeon needs to be careful of sloppy feelings.

515
00:40:23,857 --> 00:40:26,387
Aren't you only thinking about the patient's perspective?

516
00:40:26,387 --> 00:40:28,717
A doctor should think about the patient's perspective, who else?

517
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,787
It's a patient without consciousness,

518
00:40:30,787 --> 00:40:35,517
and the patient's guardian decision has the greatest influence on the patient's life.

519
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:36,467
So?

520
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,087
Whether you do the surgery or not, the result is the same.

521
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:41,587
They aren't the same.

522
00:40:41,587 --> 00:40:44,847
A patient needs to have a fight which is surgery. Why do I need to give them that burden?

523
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:50,327
If you do surgery to reduce pressure in her brain stem to prevent further damage, she can live.

524
00:40:50,327 --> 00:40:52,147
The patient is in a state where there isn't even natural breathing.

525
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:55,627
They can unexpectedly die during the surgery, as well as the fetus in her stomach.

526
00:40:55,627 --> 00:40:57,837
You don't know...

527
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:01,227
if she might miraculously recover.

528
00:41:03,057 --> 00:41:07,947
If she doesn't have surgery, the possibility of that miracle happening disappears.

529
00:41:07,947 --> 00:41:09,147
For who?

530
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:12,437
Please give time, to the guardian.

531
00:41:14,197 --> 00:41:17,507
He has to suddenly face the death of his wife and his child.

532
00:41:21,497 --> 00:41:25,677
If you would not like to do this surgery, can I?

533
00:41:27,837 --> 00:41:28,657
Yoo Hye Jeong.

534
00:41:28,657 --> 00:41:31,317
I'll do it. It's okay if I do it.

535
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:34,047
You are trying to cross the line between a staff and a fellow.

536
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:36,707
If you are coming in like this because you and I are in a personal relationship—

537
00:41:36,707 --> 00:41:39,957
If I was thinking about personal relationships I wouldn't have been able to act this way.

538
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:44,807
As a doctor. I was expressing my opinion.

539
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:49,027
Then persuade me after you firmly establish your opinion as a doctor.

540
00:41:50,997 --> 00:41:53,367
What if I were lying like that?

541
00:41:58,127 --> 00:42:00,487
Would you give up on me, as well?

542
00:42:07,187 --> 00:42:12,127
That's cheating. Because you aren't persuading me as a doctor.

543
00:42:12,127 --> 00:42:16,937
<--Emergency Medical Center

544
00:42:34,287 --> 00:42:37,287
- Oh, Director.
- Aigoo, Assemblyman. How have you been this way?

545
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:39,957
Ah, I sprained it after trying to hit a drive.

546
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,247
It was angry because you were full of energy.

547
00:42:42,247 --> 00:42:43,887
It means that you are still young, no?

548
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:46,207
Aigoo, what do you mean by young?

549
00:42:46,207 --> 00:42:47,827
Anyway, please take good care of me.

550
00:42:47,827 --> 00:42:52,127
Even if you don't ask, anything passes between you and me.

551
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:55,917
Thank you. Then while I'm here for a few days, who is going to take care of me?

552
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:57,597
Alright, let's go in first.

553
00:42:57,597 --> 00:43:00,117
Yes, thank you.

554
00:43:06,707 --> 00:43:09,017
Oh, welcome.

555
00:43:09,017 --> 00:43:12,157
The assemblyman said that he wanted to be diagnosed by Professor Hong, so I called you.

556
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:14,067
I am the neurosurgery professor, Hong Ji Hong.

557
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:16,797
Professor Hong, do you not remember me?

558
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:20,797
I didn't attend your father's funeral, but I did send my condolences.

559
00:43:20,797 --> 00:43:21,777
Thank you.

560
00:43:21,777 --> 00:43:24,757
Oh, right. I saw Athlete Lee Soo Jung's video.

561
00:43:24,757 --> 00:43:28,807
Wow, that was really fascinating.

562
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:31,577
He's our hospital's billboard surgeon.

563
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,067
Oh, welcome!

564
00:43:35,067 --> 00:43:39,547
Wow, I finally get to meet you. I'm a fan.

565
00:43:39,547 --> 00:43:40,487
Hello.

566
00:43:40,487 --> 00:43:43,757
I called you together because Assemblyman Da wanted to see you together.

567
00:43:43,757 --> 00:43:47,207
I like people showing up on television.

568
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,967
I heard you can fight really well, right? Like a gangster.

569
00:43:51,707 --> 00:43:53,047
You said you had sprained your waist?

570
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:57,117
Ah, while I was playing golf, it was extremely painful.

571
00:43:57,117 --> 00:43:59,637
I will see it specifically now, to see what's hurting.

572
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:03,217
Please lie down. If you lie down on your side, then...

573
00:44:03,217 --> 00:44:05,547
Please try lifting your left leg.

574
00:44:06,587 --> 00:44:08,167
Ahew, I can't do it.

575
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:11,957
Then I will try lifting it. If you have pain, please tell me.

576
00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:16,467
Yes. That's all.

577
00:44:19,877 --> 00:44:23,087
It seems like a mid-back sprain, and the beginning stage of a disc.

578
00:44:23,087 --> 00:44:26,177
In order to be certain, I will confirm after taking an MRI.

579
00:44:26,177 --> 00:44:29,277
Doctor Yoo. Please let me know after you take an MRI.

580
00:44:29,277 --> 00:44:31,037
Yes.

581
00:44:59,467 --> 00:45:02,557
Do you still think your scientific opinion is correct?

582
00:45:02,557 --> 00:45:05,787
Yes. What about you?

583
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:07,457
Me too.

584
00:45:21,347 --> 00:45:26,037
Gyeong Joon. Is Patient Lee Hi Young in the intensive care unit?

585
00:45:26,037 --> 00:45:28,307
Ah, the patient who came in wearing a wedding dress?

586
00:45:28,307 --> 00:45:31,277
Ah, there weren't any spots in the intensive care unit, so she is still in the emergency room.

587
00:45:31,277 --> 00:45:33,807
If a spot comes up, I will transfer her immediately.

588
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:45,557
Restricted entry

589
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:11,617
Doctor.

590
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:20,407
I really cannot live.

591
00:46:20,407 --> 00:46:23,857
If I cannot do anything and end up sending her off.

592
00:46:27,697 --> 00:46:34,267
If you can prolong her life for only 10 minutes...

593
00:46:35,987 --> 00:46:38,917
if she lives for only 10 minutes,

594
00:46:41,037 --> 00:46:45,297
and if she can spend that time with the child inside her...

595
00:46:49,937 --> 00:46:52,457
I want to do anything I can for her.

596
00:47:15,637 --> 00:47:17,037
Bring the defibrillator.

597
00:47:17,037 --> 00:47:20,227
The chairman had already signed the Do Not Resuscitate agreement.

598
00:47:20,227 --> 00:47:22,047
Bring it!

599
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,697
This is not what the chairman wanted!

600
00:47:24,697 --> 00:47:26,917
Not waking up isn't strange.

601
00:47:26,917 --> 00:47:29,747
I don't want to forcibly prolong my life.

602
00:47:37,787 --> 00:47:39,717
He's in arrest.

603
00:47:39,717 --> 00:47:41,987
Please bring me the defibrillator.

604
00:47:58,247 --> 00:48:01,617
Restricted entry

605
00:49:14,607 --> 00:49:16,427
Please give me my gown.

606
00:49:25,217 --> 00:49:26,777
I opened up the dural region.

607
00:49:26,777 --> 00:49:29,457
Gynecologist, just to make sure, please monitor the fetus.

608
00:49:29,457 --> 00:49:30,267
Yes.

609
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:32,517
Please give me the microscope.

610
00:49:41,257 --> 00:49:43,307
Irrigation.

611
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,287
Cottonoid.

612
00:49:57,357 --> 00:50:00,147
The fetus's heartbeat is slowing down.

613
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:05,827
I'm almost done. I just need to work on the draining vein. Microscissors.

614
00:50:13,907 --> 00:50:15,577
Bipolar.

615
00:50:18,397 --> 00:50:19,997
It's still dropping.

616
00:50:19,997 --> 00:50:22,197
We have to close it quickly.

617
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:33,247
Why'd you do it so late?

618
00:50:33,247 --> 00:50:34,877
I did it late?

619
00:50:35,557 --> 00:50:38,967
No, you did well. Did you check Patient Lee Chung Ja's mental status?

620
00:50:38,967 --> 00:50:42,317
Ah, Kang Soo is supposed to do that. I am a 2nd year resident.

621
00:50:42,317 --> 00:50:45,587
What is there in making a distinction between Kang Soo's work and your work?

622
00:50:47,267 --> 00:50:49,327
You should make a distinction. You are right.

623
00:50:49,327 --> 00:50:51,397
Ok. Thank you.

624
00:50:51,397 --> 00:50:54,187
Are you guys fooling around again?

625
00:50:56,217 --> 00:50:58,187
Every time we're talking he thinks we're fooling around.

626
00:50:58,187 --> 00:51:00,877
- What are you muttering?
- It's nothing.
- Nothing.

627
00:51:00,877 --> 00:51:02,407
- Ahn Joong Dae.
- Yes?

628
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:06,137
As a 2nd year, you run away? Aren't you embarrassed to even face a 1st year?

629
00:51:06,137 --> 00:51:07,357
- Gyeong Joon.
- Yes?

630
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:10,367
You're probably nagging at him a lot, right? What are you going to do if he runs away again?

631
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:14,227
No matter how much I pick on him, it's minuscule compared to how much you pick on me.

632
00:51:14,227 --> 00:51:14,917
What?

633
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:19,617
Doctor Hong Ji Hong bought us a midnight snack before.

634
00:51:19,617 --> 00:51:21,247
Why are you telling me that suddenly?

635
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:25,567
You're right. Why did I suddenly think about that? I don't know either.

636
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,877
That time when he ordered braised spicy seafood, we ate it really well, right?

637
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:32,617
Right? Joong Dae, you can read my heart!

638
00:51:32,617 --> 00:51:33,957
You wanna come in?

639
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,687
These people really...

640
00:51:35,687 --> 00:51:38,517
Are you not going to express your opinion directly? How dare you beat round the bush?

641
00:51:38,517 --> 00:51:42,317
Doctor Hong has his rules and I have my rules.

642
00:51:42,317 --> 00:51:44,417
- Do you want to go to check Patient Lee Cheong Ja's mental status?
- Should we?

643
00:51:44,417 --> 00:51:46,677
- Let's go.
- Yes.

644
00:51:46,677 --> 00:51:49,987
Hey. Hey!

645
00:51:52,727 --> 00:51:55,307
The fetal heart rate is 90.

646
00:51:55,307 --> 00:51:57,237
If it drops any more, that's the end.

647
00:51:57,237 --> 00:51:59,087
Micro scissors.

648
00:52:07,827 --> 00:52:09,507
Bipolar.

649
00:52:13,477 --> 00:52:14,837
The end.

650
00:52:20,577 --> 00:52:21,957
We need to close.

651
00:52:21,957 --> 00:52:24,277
Yes. Please take out the microscope.

652
00:52:24,277 --> 00:52:26,347
And please prepare the sutures.

653
00:52:45,407 --> 00:52:49,987
Operating Room

654
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:06,567
For the specifics, we need to monitor the progress.

655
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:12,097
The damage was severe from the beginning. We aren't seeing any reaction still.

656
00:53:12,097 --> 00:53:14,347
But the surgery went well, right?

657
00:53:14,347 --> 00:53:15,927
Yes.

658
00:53:18,767 --> 00:53:23,187
Then she can wake up soon, she can get better right?

659
00:53:25,487 --> 00:53:28,337
I can't promise anything.

660
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:33,917
How about the baby? Is it alright?

661
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:40,137
The baby is healthy. The heart is beating well. The placenta and amnion are both safe.

662
00:53:41,207 --> 00:53:45,527
But the patient's health is very bad.

663
00:53:46,787 --> 00:53:48,717
I am prepared for this.

664
00:53:50,077 --> 00:53:52,937
I did all I could.

665
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:57,817
I understand. Thank you.

666
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,407
Yes.

667
00:54:11,787 --> 00:54:14,527
What is the reason why you suddenly decided to perform the surgery?

668
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:19,147
Because it seemed that I could possibly block the opportunity for a miracle to occur.

669
00:54:19,147 --> 00:54:22,817
You believe that miracles and doctors don't go hand in hand.

670
00:54:23,837 --> 00:54:25,917
I did.

671
00:54:32,507 --> 00:54:36,457
Neurosurgeons and miracles do not go well together.

672
00:54:36,457 --> 00:54:40,127
We always doubt and doubt again.

673
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:45,117
Despite that, anticipating a miracle...

674
00:54:45,117 --> 00:54:47,977
is because we are insecure.

675
00:54:48,867 --> 00:54:53,037
One week later

676
00:55:39,987 --> 00:55:41,527
The guardian?

677
00:55:42,597 --> 00:55:45,427
He's outside waiting.

678
00:55:46,717 --> 00:55:48,407
Let's go.

679
00:55:58,317 --> 00:56:01,107
Neurosurgery ICU

680
00:56:06,487 --> 00:56:11,187
The patient is close to a state of being brain dead.

681
00:56:12,277 --> 00:56:16,517
Soon, the other organs will slowly cease.

682
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:19,477
And her respiration will cease.

683
00:56:24,117 --> 00:56:27,197
It must be painful to experience this sudden event.

684
00:56:28,207 --> 00:56:30,797
But, you need to make a decision.

685
00:56:31,637 --> 00:56:33,787
What do you mean choose?

686
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:37,637
What kind of choice would I make?

687
00:56:42,587 --> 00:56:46,267
Your wife won't be able to wake up.

688
00:56:46,267 --> 00:56:52,197
In this kind of situation, the baby might not be able to make it either.

689
00:56:52,197 --> 00:57:00,097
Are you asking me to give up on my wife and baby?

690
00:57:00,097 --> 00:57:06,537
The only thing we can do right now is to sustain her with various devices.

691
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:10,337
What happens if you continue to sustain her in this state?

692
00:57:11,067 --> 00:57:14,937
If you were to assume that a miracle would exist...

693
00:57:14,937 --> 00:57:21,327
If your wife can bear this, the child can continue to live inside the mother's body.

694
00:57:23,257 --> 00:57:28,007
The fetus is only 20 weeks. It cannot survive without the mother.

695
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:33,827
Can they endure it?

696
00:57:34,637 --> 00:57:36,477
We don't know.

697
00:57:42,907 --> 00:57:45,857
But until the moment that artificial intubation is possible,

698
00:57:47,387 --> 00:57:53,137
we will try our best to sustain your wife.

699
00:58:03,257 --> 00:58:05,367
They're going to endure it.

700
00:58:08,357 --> 00:58:10,537
She's a good woman.

701
00:58:12,107 --> 00:58:18,537
She won't take the baby with her and leave.

702
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:31,747
A miracle didn't happen.

703
00:58:31,747 --> 00:58:35,897
It is normal for miracles not to occur.

704
00:58:36,857 --> 00:58:39,247
That's why it's called a miracle.
