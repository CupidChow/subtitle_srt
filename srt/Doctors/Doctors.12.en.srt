00:00:25,337 --> 00:00:28,717
Episode 12

2
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:33,917
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:25,247 --> 00:01:30,967
The cells that make up a human are always disturbed.

4
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:33,467
Disturbance is a part of living.

5
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:37,407
In the end, the essence of life changes.

6
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:39,787
Father always said this:

7
00:01:39,787 --> 00:01:44,427
deciding things on our own, taking responsibility by ourselves, is the life of a man.

8
00:01:44,427 --> 00:01:46,957
Now it's starting again.

9
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:54,587
3 weeks later

10
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:58,637
Guk Il Medical Center

11
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,570
♬ I love

12
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,150
you.

13
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,250
Open your eyes. You really liked this song.

14
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,760
Hey I'm singing for you and wiping you clean, you should look at me.

15
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,180
You are really selfish.

16
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,540
- You're here.
- These days, she doesn't open her eyes.

17
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,010
It seems like something is wrong.

18
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,800
It's fine.

19
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,670
Ms. Jo Soo Ji, open your eyes please.

20
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,860
Patient, follow my fingers with your eyes.

21
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,590
- Choi Kang Soo.
- Yes.

22
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,880
- For now, keep checking on the patient's motor skills.
- Yes.

23
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,400
Professor Hong Ji Hong is coming to work in the afternoon right?

24
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,970
I think he's left his patients to me for too long.

25
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,230
He didn't contact me so I don't know.

26
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,150
You don't contact each other?

27
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,190
You haven't been in touch ever since he left for the States to sort out the chairman's will?

28
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,110
Yes.

29
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,300
If he didn't contact you, you could have reached out to him first and asked.

30
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,230
I thought I would be interfering, so I couldn't do it.

31
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,370
What would you interfere with?

32
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,180
It seemed like he would want to be alone.

33
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,080
You really don't know men...

34
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,670
If he's someone you really love and want, now is the time to enter his life.

35
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,270
The timing is really good.

36
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,070
Is that so?

37
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,820
Ah, why am I teaching you this.

38
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,070
Doctor, have you eaten yet?

39
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,980
Why?

40
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,370
I don't have anyone to ask about men.

41
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,110
You're a Dating Go Ja (suck at dating), right?

42
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,300
What's a Dating Go Ja?

43
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,200
There are a lot of things you don't know. Ah, Professor Hong is going to have a hard time.

44
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,950
Ah, serves him right.

45
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,180
- You've had a hard time.
- Why did you come all the way here.

46
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,610
I thought you were going to come out crying but you're even talking. So, did you take care of everything you needed to?

47
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,010
It's almost all settled. Surprisingly, there are a lot of things to settle.

48
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,940
Shall we go to the Hospital for lunch? Today's Director Jin Seong Jong's inauguration. The food must be good there.

49
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,550
Let's eat outside.

50
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,780
Is it okay for you not to go? You're a doctor.

51
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,230
Why would I go to that when I didn't even go to my father's inauguration.

52
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,610
- You're going to keep avoiding him?
- I should say hello at least.

53
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,220
Okay. Anyway, good to see you, Friend!

54
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,050
It's hot, it's hot. Let's go! To the hospital.

55
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,420
Congratulations.

56
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,560
I should be asking you to take care of things. You should do well.

57
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,140
Especially, please take care of me.

58
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,300
Now, let's all go in.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,520
The big man of Korean neurosurgery,

60
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,860
Chairman Hong Doo Sik of Guk Il Hospital passed away.

61
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,170
"I married my patients", he left these words.

62
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,260
Dedicating his whole life for the advancement of Korea's medical technology,

63
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,590
Director of Guk Il Financial Group, Hong Doo Sik,

64
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,750
will be remembered as a legend of Korean neurosurgery.

65
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,610
We will not forget your beautiful life.

66
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,050
Inauguration for the second chairman, Jin Seong Jong

67
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:14,560
I am the former chairman's friend and his lifelong companion.

68
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,680
I will follow his wish and I will lead Guk Il Hospital

69
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,340
and Guk Il Financial Group. I make this promise to you.

70
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,450
Song Yo Hoon Jin Myeong Hoon

71
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,630
Kim Tae Ho

72
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,880
Divide these among yourselves.

73
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,850
What is this?

74
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,980
They're rice cakes and towels in commemoration of the chairman's inauguration.

75
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,650
Rice cake? Oh yeah. But is this it?

76
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,650
He wants to do it simply.

77
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,300
You guys are here!

78
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,320
You're here. Have some rice cake.

79
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,310
Doctor Bi, can you take a look at a patient? The patient has been complaining about pains.

80
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,980
Okay, let's go together.

81
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,800
Okay.

82
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,030
I'll be back.

83
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,910
- What are you doing?
- Pardon?

84
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,810
How can you be eating everytime I see you?

85
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,080
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,810
No, no.

87
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,740
Why would you study when there's no use for it?

88
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,130
Didn't I tell you to get permission (for surgery)

89
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,970
from Patient Kim Mi Young? Did I tell you or not? I'm just really curious. Did I or did I not?

90
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:27,490
I am going later to do the dressing and while I'm on my way, I was going to get it, you see.

91
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,940
- While you were on your way.
- Yes.

92
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,020
- While you were on your way.
- Yes.

93
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,720
While you were on your way!

94
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,910
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:38,050
Those punks, they'll mess around whenever you give them a break.

96
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,740
Wow, there's a lot.

97
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,370
Hey.

98
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,860
He's coming, he's coming.

99
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,880
Eat this while you work...

100
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,690
- Yes.
- Thank you.

101
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,960
Thank you.

102
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,010
Thank me? I should be thanking you. You guys took great care of my wife

103
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,050
whenever I was absent for just a little while.

104
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,020
You should let someone else take care of her and get some rest.

105
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,060
To be honest, I am tired physically...

106
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,290
But my heart feels better, being together with her.

107
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,200
Ah, yes.

108
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,030
"To be honest, I am tired physically... But my heart feels better, being together with her."

109
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,740
Goosebumps. Isn't he so cool?

110
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,640
Yes, he isn't.

111
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,320
I guess he's jealous.

112
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,630
This person, seriously. How is that love?

113
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,680
He should work while loving. Who's going to pay for the medical expenses like that?

114
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,340
That guy, is a freelancer. Freelancer.

115
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,760
There are different types of freelancer.

116
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,410
Freelancers aren't all that well off either.

117
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,810
Why are you guys all so negative?

118
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:47,950
Right, it's my first time seeing such a loving husband as a nurse.

119
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,890
It's so beautiful.

120
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,000
What's so beautiful?

121
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,130
Is it nice to stick together all day? I think it's so-so.

122
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,120
I can't communicate with men.

123
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,950
Why are you like that? Are you sick?

124
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,220
No, I'm okay.

125
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,440
When did you get here? It's all finished?

126
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,110
Yeah, finished. I was bored to death. Did you check up on Patient Lee?

127
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,620
Yeah, I prescribed painkillers.

128
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,420
Come in.

129
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,650
Hello. Please sit here.

130
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,570
Okay. I don't need tea.

131
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,010
We had some simple dessert after the inauguration.

132
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,940
Okay.

133
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,390
- Did I interrupt your work?
- I was in the middle of working.

134
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,990
Say something polite.

135
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,150
I know you work hard and are excellent, but this is not enough.

136
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,290
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,980
What are you going to do with our Seo Woo?

138
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,410
We've settled things amongst ourselves.

139
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,350
Everything isn't settled if you settle things between yourselves.

140
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,320
The parents are still here. Are you an orphan?

141
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,460
Um, I have to go out right now.

142
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,690
Why are you rejecting her? There's no one like our Seo Woo.

143
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,970
Even though I'm her mother, nothing is lacking with her.

144
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,760
Ma'am, I'd like it if the parents didn't get involved.

145
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,250
I will deal with it on my own.

146
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,660
You should listen to me. There's nothing more important than family.

147
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,030
I've listened well to your advice.

148
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,460
I want my daughter to be happy as a woman.

149
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,210
Taking over this hospital will only give her headaches.

150
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,070
What's so great about this that he is forcing all this on her?

151
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,560
What are you going to do about Tae Ho? Are you just going to leave him like that?

152
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,130
Yes. I like that someone important like him is under me. Same goes for Hong Ji Hong.

153
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,840
It seems that you're going to be an extraordinary person.

154
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,160
I'm the one who's providing for those great people!

155
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,000
It must make them feel like they're on cloud nine!

156
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,900
What are you going to do about the elderly rehabilitation center?

157
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,630
By the end of the month, we're going to have a voter's meeting and make the final decision.

158
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:03,730
Your father is supporting your back, so do whatever you want.

159
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,570
Department head Kim Chae Won is here from the other branch.

160
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,270
Why did he come here?

161
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,680
I have to go. Take care.

162
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,720
Congratulations on your promotion, Chairman.

163
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,260
Thanks.

164
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,900
You're so busy lately. I brought this because I was worried you weren't taking care of your health.

165
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,150
-I don't need this, so take it back.
-Director!

166
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,530
I hate people whose real character shows when the other becomes weak.

167
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,190
You asked what would happen if you got on the wrong side of ChairmanHong, right?

168
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,140
I'm sorry. At the time, Professor Hong Ji Hong came onto me so strongly...

169
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,770
I don't want to hear it. Your branch is unstable and breathing its last anyway.

170
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,840
Director, you know there's a saying, "don't kill Santa until after Christmas"?

171
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,560
Do you think I only learned how to do surgeries under you?

172
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,210
Don't beat around the bush; tell me what you have on me.

173
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,470
The anesthesiology records...you know they're thrown out after ten years, right?

174
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:14,710
You kept those? It doesn't matter because they can't do anything with respect to the law.

175
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:20,420
Why do you think there's a saying "fist before the law"? Especially when the opponent is Director Hong Ji Hong.

176
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,620
You can leave now.

177
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,810
Bring me to this branch. I know I can be of help.

178
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,950
I said to leave!

179
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,490
Please!

180
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,950
Thank you~

181
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,950
I decided everything and did everything by myself. It became a habit.

182
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,120
It has nothing to do with you.

183
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,540

Yoo Hye Jeong

186
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,940
You're not getting off?

187
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,730
You're coming out to the hospital?

188
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,430
The hospital is my workplace, of course I would come here. Why are you here?

189
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,800
I stopped by in passing.

190
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,860
And director, I give my belated condolences.

191
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,970
You change the topic very easily. You still don't remember?

192
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,650
My memories feed off of kindness.

193
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,600
Negotiations are open.

194
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,210
I'm normally a very kind person.

195
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,590
I will keep that in mind.

196

Neurosurgery Choi Kang Soo

197
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,430
Yeah, what's up?

198
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,100
Professor Hong Ji Hong is back, and he's discharging patient Jo Soo Ji.

199
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,430
Oh, okay.

200
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,460
The hospital seemed so empty without you here, Professor.

201
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,240
How's patient Jo Soo Ji's condition?

202
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,970
She was able to spontaneously breathe, so I extubated her. But, her motor function still has not returned.

203
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,820
Let's go.

204
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,260
Yes.

205
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,240
Yes.

206
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,560
You're tired, right?

207
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,090
Please. I'm just glad I can do what I can to help.

208
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:31,010
Excuse me...my phone...I need to take this.

209
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,910
Ah, yes.

210
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,860
I'll leave her in your hands.

211
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,540
Thank you.

212
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,100
Oh wow, she's moving!

213
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,600
I'll bring the doctor!

214
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,330
That man is not my husband!

215
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,670
Doctor! Patient Jo Soo Ji's motor functions returned!

216
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,490
Good news as soon as I'm back. Shall we go?

217
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,050
Yes.

218
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,890
What's wrong?

219
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:44,600
Huh? Her hand movements returned. She's recovering.

220
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,130
Thank you so much. Thank you.

221
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,580
It's nothing. It's thanks to the patient fighting hard by herself.

222
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,700
- No, it's because you came back, Doctor.
- Not at all.

223
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,330
- Hello.

224
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,450
Ah, hello.

225
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,020
I'm going to look at your surgery scars.

226
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,660
I'll see you again.

227
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:16,170
Doctor...how much hope does she have if her hands are moving?

228
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,450
When will she be able to talk and walk around?

229
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:25,620
I can't give you a guaranteed answer. She might stay this way.

230
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,960
Ah, I see.

231
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,120
Then I'll see you next time.

232
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,490
Yes.

233
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,150
What is Jo Soo Ji's guardian's occupation?

234
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,630
He says he's a freelancer, but I think works via computer. He basically lives in the hospital room.

235
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,290
Hye Jeong, was there nothing strange about the patient?

236
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,820
There was nothing weird, why?

237
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,680
It's nothing. You guys can do your work now.

238
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,040
Yes.

239
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,160
Doctor Jin! I was about to call you.

240
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,140
-Why?
-Doctor Jeong Yoon Do wants you to come into an emergency surgery.

241
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,540
-Me?
-Yes.

242
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,150
You wanted me to come into surgery?

243
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,220
Yes, you think I'd make a mistake like that?

244
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,350
You have Hye Jeong, right? Isn't this a good opportunity? Don't you have to take action while Doctor Hong isn't here?

245
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:41,370
I'm not going to raid an empty house. I know I said I'd take the low road, but I'm not going to do something that low.

246
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,840
Come in after changing into scrubs. And Doctor Hong is back.

247
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,520
What kind of assistant comes in after the staff? Aren't you supposed to be inside getting ready?

248
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,590
Why are you nagging? I'm already in a bad mood as it is.

249
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,090
If you get nagged at, then you can focus on the nagging.

250
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,790
You don't have to constantly look to your father. You're not an eighteen year old girl anymore.

251
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,600
I'm going to go inside and prepare instead of you. Even though I'm on staff.

252
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,060
Stop overreacting.

253
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:33,490
I'm overreacting because I can. Why wouldn't I? I told you to put your head on straight.

254
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,300
Hasn't it been too long since it's been cleaned?

255
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,190
I'll make sure to fix it.

256
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,170
The generation of Jin Myeong Hoon has arrived.

257
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,440
His facial expression looks bright.

258
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,590
Bring Professor Hong Ji Hong.

259
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,850
Director.

260
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,240
Has everything been taken care of?

261
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,850
Why are you looking into my background?

262
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,880
Is looking into patient Kang Mal Soon from thirteen years ago the same as looking into your background?

263
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,710
If there's something you're curious about, you can just ask me personally.

264
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,100
I'm saying this because I heard that you visited the medical resident who was training under my supervision.

265
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,840
What are you curious about?

266
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,820
Do you even remember that surgery?

267
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:42,130
I don't remember because I only remember the things that make me happy.

268
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:47,380
Let's do well together. Let's gather up the friendship and advancement from your father's and our generations as well.

269
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,730
Friendship and progress happen when we've earned each others' trust.

270
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,630
Let's trust and live.

271
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:57,020
You're my style; I like smart people.

272
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,200
The TA (Traffic Accident) Patient is 28-years old and looks like he has multiple bone fractures.

273
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,700
He had no consciousness, so I performed the CT scan right away. It seems like an aneurysm in the middle cerebral artery region has ruptured.

274
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,000
His left pupil is dilated about 3mm.

275
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,710
Thankfully, his vitals are stable.

276
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,350
- What about the amount of bleeding?
- It's about 30cc. Are you going to ligate it?(ligate = tie off)

277
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,730
The staff physician should make the decision.

278
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,560
By staff...should I call Doctor Hong Ji Hong?

279
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,630
Let's see.

280
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,290
You saw the CT, right? The neck (the neck portion of aneurysm) is wide.

281
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,450
Call the anesthesia team. Prepare for surgery immediately.

282
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,060
Yes.

283
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:59,060

297
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,800
It's the one near the temporal lobe.

298
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,960

304
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,690
Why aren't you going in?

305
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,870
Hello.

306
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,430
Go in.

307
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:38,660
No, it's fine. I think you made an appointment with him; you can go in.

308
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,270
I didn't make an appointment.

309
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,800
Ji Hong and I aren't in a relationship where we meet each other after making an appointment.

310
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,260
Ji Hong is just a male friend.

311
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:55,320
Right now at this moment, if I have to choose between who to meet between you and Ji Hong,

312
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,260
I'll choose you.

313
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,720
I kept thinking that I should meet you, but I purposefully didn't because I didn't want to contact you.

314
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,000
Since Ji Hong is there, I thought that we would end up meeting one day.

315
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,690
Why didn't you want to contact me if you wanted to meet me?

316
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,530
Because I would have to confront my childishness from when I was young.

317
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,560
At that time, I was old enough and thought I was an adult.

318
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,510
I was 27.

319
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,440
I'm sorry.

320
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,910
Should I forgive you or not?

321
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,180
You should. It's hard for me these days.

322
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,450
In terms of the Neurosurgery Department, I'm having a mental stupor.

323
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,670
That's a great stupor.

324
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,650
You didn't forget that you promised to buy me dinner last time, right?

325
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,030
So? Where are you?

326
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,600
Come in.

327
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,830
Hey, Ji Hong! Welcome!

328
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,490
-Who wants ramen?
-Don't scramble the egg, put lots of green onion in it.

329
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,570
Put an egg in, don't pop the yolk, and no green onion.

330
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,330
Ah, seriously...these old men, what do you want me to do?

331
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,460
I'm the crazy one for listening to you, Uncle.

332
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,450
We should have a drink while he's making the ramen. In Joo will come soon too.

333
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,530
You're working hard at various aspects today.

334
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,080
For some reason, the house seems bigger.

335
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,630
Both of our houses are leased by the hospital, but why is there such a big difference?

336
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:48,130
Let's talk about that again after I've been over to your house.

337
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,250
You want to come over to my house?

338
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,200
Where is your house?

339
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:13,150
Over there! 3rd floor!

340
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,300
Oh! Oh, Unni!

341
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,160
Ah, I can't get back up.

342
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:26,290
Hey! Hong Ji Hong!

343
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,330
Hong! Ji! Hong!

344
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,330
Jeong Pal!

345
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,530
Unni, you'll wake the neighborhood up.

346
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,430
How much did she drink again?

347
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,130
Wake up, you wench.

348
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,020
What? Wench?

349
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,130
-Ah! That hurts! Let go!
-Do you want to die?

350
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,660
Hurts, hurts! In Joo, let go of me, let go!

351
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,770
Doctor Yoo, you're here.

352
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,980
Hey, let's exchange greetings later.

353
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,380
Aish, I got it.

354
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,500
Hey!

355
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,540
-Hey, I can walk by myself.
-Yes, yes, yes.

356
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,760
Doctor Yoo, you should come in too.

357
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,500
She wasn't that bad before.

358
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,490
Do you want to come in?

359
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,630
No, I want to leave.

360
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,350
Alright then.

361
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,290
Alright then?

362
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,060
How could you tell me "alright then"?

363
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,760
I told you to go because you wanted to go.

364
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,020
Since when did you listen to me so well?

365
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:50,310
So what do you want to do now? Do you want to go home or do you want to talk with me?

366
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,510
Come in.

367
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,910
Do you want some tea?

368
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,230
You have something like this at home?

369
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,390
Yeah, I do. Do you want to try it?

370
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,050
No.

371
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,000
Sit down.

372
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,230
I'm sorry.

373
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,620
For what?

374
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,400
I don't know a way to comfort grief.

375
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,530
because I've never been comforted for my own grief before.

376
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,160
Even when my grandmother passed away, I endured it on my own.

377
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:59,680
I thought that grief was something you had to endure alone.

378
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,620
I missed you.

379
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,630
As I always did before, I did it alone again this time too.

380
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:15,600
I took care of all of my father's belongings and handled his personal affairs.

381
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,660
In the past, I would have felt familiar and comfortable with it,

382
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,600
but I kept thinking of you to the point it drove me insane.

383
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,750
Then why didn't you contact me?

384
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,000
I waited for you to contact me.

385
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,930
In the past, I was always the one to act first if I wanted something.

386
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,720
I used that same mindset when I confessed to you.

387
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,560
But this time, through you, I learned

388
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:55,580
that waiting can be the most direct action towards a woman you like.

389
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,090
I was flustered.

390
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,480
I cornered you to change.

391
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,610
I'm sorry.

392
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:16,420
I want to be loved for who I am, but I told you to change.

393
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,300
You clean up well and you admit things quickly. You were always like that; it's a good trait.

394
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,480
I want to enter your life.

395
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,760
I'm sorry for telling you to change.

396
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,730
Please decide things yourself and choose.

397
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:40,250
I will be by your side.

398
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,570
Can't I?

399
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,070
You can.

400
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,430
I'll be going now.

401
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,830
I can't hold onto you right?

402
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,950
Yes, don't hold on to me.

403
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,390
Do you know how scared I was today?

404
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,290
Although it won't happen, I thought your heart changed... You also didn't pick up the phone.

405
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,920
I didn't pick up the phone?

406
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,510
- Yes, you didn't.
- Sorry, I didn't know.

407
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,390
I'll like it if you'd pick up the phone from now on.

408
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,910
You lied to me earlier, didn't you?

409
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,960
- No.
- Really?

410
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,180
Yes, really.

411
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,700
Then... you wanted to play the claw machine.

412
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,560
How did you know?

413
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,180
Try it.

414
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,860
- It's fascinating, right?
- Yes.

415
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,230
Here, you put your hand there...

416
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,010
♫ Like wanting you as if an alarm is ringing ♫

417
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:03,210
♫  You wake up the love cells in my heart ♫

418
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:12,120
♫ You're pretty, breathtaking no matter what you do ♫

419
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,760
♫ You are pretty Oh my Oh my girl. ♫

420
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,670
A bit more forward.
♫ I don't know anyone but you. ♫

421
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,660
♫ Those are my feelings. ♫

422
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,540
Ah, I failed!
♫ Breakfast, lunch and dinner.  ♫

423
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,260
How are you so good at this?
♫ Seeing you every day  ♫

424
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,610
You just need to do it. Now...
♫ Everyday only you appear. ♫

425
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:32,160
♫ Do you see me? Do I appear? ♫

426
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:40,200
♫ Your gestures and your glances tell me that you love me.♫

427
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:11,240
♫ You are my entire life, you are the reason why I'm living. ♫

428
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,940
♫ It's an unexplainable miracle. ♫

429
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:25,960
♫ If love is needing my comfort, ♫

430
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,670
♫ Take another step closer. ♫

431
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:39,580
♫ You are my entire life. You are the reason why I'm living. ♫

432
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:45,240
♫ It's an unexplainable miracle. ♫

433
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:53,380
♫ If love is needing my comfort, ♫

434
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,910
♫ take another step closer. ♫

435
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:06,410
♫Yes, I believe my destiny. ♫

436
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,150
Ah, these people, really!

437
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,610
Uncle!

438
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,450
I'm sleeping.

439
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,940
- Ah, wake up! You're going to be late for work.
- Ah...

440
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,130
Aunt!

441
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,830
Aunt! Get up!

442
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,720
What time is?

443
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,570
- 6:50am.
- I can sleep a bit more!

444
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,920
Aunt! What's with you?

445
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,280
Who are you calling aunt?

446
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,840
You're bigger than me and quite old too.

447
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,180
You're rude.

448
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,270
No. In addition to room and board, I even provided the drinks.

449
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,110
Are you going to be like this?

450
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:09,450
So why am I an aunt? Not even a noona.

451
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,120
You're my uncle's friend. So you're an aunt to me.

452
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,920
What kind of old-fashioned relationship-sorting is this?

453
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,470
I'm going to wash up.

454
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:26,210
Squeeze some oranges so I can have fresh orange juice when I get out of the bathroom.

455
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,270
Huh?

456
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,400
Uncle is not helpful to me at all. Even his friends aren't.

457
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,930
Moron Hong is downstairs. This is a new face, Moron Jo.

458
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,530
Yes!

459
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,550
Orange juice...

460
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,080
Sleep.

461
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:54,850
I am continuously performing checks on Jo Soo Ji's motor function, but there's no change.

462
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,780
Let's go.

463
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,520
Doctor Yoo...

464
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,510
Yes.

465
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,870
Let's go together.

466
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,300
The purchase order has been confirmed.

467
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:33,650
Honey! Huh?

468
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:40,690
For my honey, I feel like I'm doing everything. Right?

469
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,920
Open your eyes.

470
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,960
Honey, let's talk, open your eyes.

471
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,520
There we go.

472
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,410
How do I look today?

473
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,700
If I'm handsome, blink once.

474
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

475
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:14,220
Let's see. How's your hand?

476
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:18,720
It's normal. The left side as well...

477
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,150
Alright...

478
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:38,880
There aren't many changes. I think you'll have to work hard for a little longer.

479
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,900
- I'll try my best.
- Yes.

480
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,510
Let's go.

481
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,870
Is it possible to separate patent Jo Soo Ji from her guardian?

482
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,520
He basically lives in the patient's room.

483
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,550
That's why I'm saying that won't do.

484
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,020
It's possible.

485
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:30,470
I told you to wait. It didn't hit the peak yet.

486
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:33,750
If you're confident you won't regret anything, go ahead.

487
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,770
I'll call you later.

488
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,420
Excuse me...

489
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:45,530
We would like to receive some counseling for purchasing stocks. I have some debt.

490
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,470
Stocks?

491
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,660
I suddenly landed myself in debt. Please help us this once.

492
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,550
Of course.

493
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,590
Then, can we talk a bit outside?

494
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,550
Yes. But, my wife...

495
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,600
It could be loud for her.

496
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,520
I'll pour you some coffee.

497
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,390
Yes, I want to invest in some stocks, but I'm not sure where I should start and how.

498
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:12,060
The coffee there is really good.

499
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,100
I'm going to verbally communicate with you like this right now. If it's yes, blink once.

500
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,030
Blink twice if it's no.

501
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,310
Is something uncomfortable for you.

502
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,030
Is it because of your husband?

503
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,710
Doctor, he's coming.

504
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,050
What's happening?

505
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:01,130
It fell. It fell.

506
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,670
It's not getting worse, is it?

507
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,570
We have to check.

508
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:14,100
You don't have to worry too much. We'll do a CT and we'll be back.

509
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,350
- Doctor Yoo.
- Yes.

510
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:32,060
Guardian!

511
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:37,740
You can't go in. We'll be back once we're done.

512
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,600
Yes.

513
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,360
Let's go.

514
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,800
Doctor!

515
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:10,280
Nuclear Medicine

516
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,880
Consonant

517
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,890
Vowel

518
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,080
Att

519
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,240
A

520
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,550
CK

521
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,790
E

522
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,710
R

523
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:46,940
Attacker

524
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,610
Yes.

525
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,930
She'll be alright. Once the CT results come out, I'll let you know.

526
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,680
Yes, Doctor.

527
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:27,700
We reported it to the police. Patient Jo Soo Ji is filed as a missing person.

528
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,940
- Missing person?
- Yes. Her parents reported it.

529
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,770
He's her husband. Why did they report it?

530
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,580
My dear.

531
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,610
You're pretty.

532
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:53,150
Honey, do you remember when we first met.

533
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:58,220
Seriously, I felt like I was hit by lightning.

534
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,990
I told you not to do that.

535
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,140
I like you a lot.

536
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,690
Give me one chance.

537
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:30,420
What do you want me to do, that you're doing this much?

538
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:35,250
Now I'll put everything in my life on the line

539
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,160
and only protect you.

540
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:50,610
Also, when I begged you to register for marriage first

541
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:54,390
and went to the city hall and did it,

542
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:59,200
I really felt that I had everything in the world.

543
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:06,160
Why didn't I know back then that a man who puts everything on the line for me was disastrous?

544
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,680
Jo Soo Ji's parents are coming.

545
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,070
She has a husband, so why is she listed as a missing person?

546
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:18,710
Miss Jo Soo Ji is unmarried. We think the man registered for marriage in secret.

547
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,260
So it's someone that Jo Soo Ji doesn't know at all?

548
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:27,190
That's not quite right. But according to her parents, he kept following her around so they dated for a few months.

549
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:31,260
She broke up with him because he was too obsessive.

550
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,010
Then it was a parting crime.

551
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,870
That's right.

552
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,430
We can't leave them alone.

553
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,880
Where are you going? They're here.

554
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,360
He isn't wary of me, I'll bring him out.

555
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,140
If you do that, it'll be nice for us.

556
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,330
- I'll do it.
- No.

557
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,040
Being protected... let's accept it.

558
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,260
Please do it.

559
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,880
Doctor, you don't have to explain it to me while looking at the CT scan.

560
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,490
It's easy to explain it to you while looking at the picture.

561
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:18,670
Is there something special-

562
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,660
I have a question.

563
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,970
I'm sorry, I have to go to the toilet.

564
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:32,050
She's a female. She's my daughter.

565
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,310
How can I find out which room she's in?

566
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,430
Guk Il hospital

567
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:09,570
This is Patient Jo Soo Ji's consent form for the operation, and it has her guardian's contact info and resident registration number.

568
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,170
Yes, thank you.

569
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,770
He looked like he was nice.

570
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:16,340
Hey, people with his eyes are the scariest.

571
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,830
No.

572
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,190
Thanks for your cooperation.

573
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:22,620
- Yes.
- Good work.

574
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,620
Did they catch him?

575
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:34,180
No, they asked a lot of questions about his behavior up till now and his personal information.

576
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:39,860
Since this morning, the ER was a huge mess and we shot a crime film in the patient's room. It was a hectic day, Doctor.

577
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,690
Are you going home?

578
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,310
Yes. How about you?

579
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:43,520
I'm on evening rotation.

580
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,920
I'm on evening rotation for a whole week as punishment.

581
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,570
Hey, it's all for you guys...

582
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,910
- I'm doing this so you can be a great surgeon later on.
- Of course.

583
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,230
Good bye.

584
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:04,510
It's free.

585
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:11,270
Whoever you're waiting for is taking a long time. Try to call them!

586
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,200
I'm not waiting for anyone.

587
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:20,630
Ah, I see... Aigoo...

588
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:28,660
Oh Seo Woo! What's going on? Are you alone?

589
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:33,290
I'm alone. I came because this is the closest bar to the hospital.

590
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,990
Did anyone say anything?

591
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:40,370
♫  Are you perhaps lonely? ♫

592
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:50,020
Are you drinking alone?

593
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,490
Yeong Gook will be here. He's really busy since he's in his third year.

594
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:54,900
At least you have him around. It's good.

595
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,880
It seems like the cat is worried about the mouse.

596
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,920
♫ Everyone is like that.♫

597
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,020
When I was really down after a breakup, you used to comfort me a lot.

598
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,050
- Too bad, right?
- That's too bad.

599
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,350
Still, no matter what, I will never do that again.

600
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:14,920
Good thing. Be that way. Don't be a pushover to me.

601
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,070
The CT results...

602
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,090
You're on night duty again.

603
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,780
That's how it is for first years.

604
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,710
All the first years are like that.

605
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,110
You still haven't left, Doctor?

606
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:47,740
I wanted to go check up on Patient Jo Soo Ji once more. It's really sickening to mistreat someone saying you love them.

607
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,050
I thought he wasn't really right in the head earlier.

608
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,580
- Do your work.
- Yes.

609
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,050
I'll go get you some water.

610
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,600
You scared me. Why do you seem so shocked?

611
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:39,350
Did you think everything was over? Even when you die, you're mine.

612
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:42,410
You'll never be able to escape me.

613
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:51,270
I thought about this a bit...

614
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:58,130
and if you're going to just go to someone else, it would just be better for me to kill you.

615
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,980
That's okay with you, right?

616
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:37,180
Doctor, I think something's happening in Room 419.

617
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,620
No!

618
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,800
-Check on the patient!
-Yes!

619
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,520
Let go! No!

620
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,410
Stop it. This is violence, not love!

621
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,570
No!

622
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,620
-Prepare to take a CT scan.
-Yes, I understand.

623
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:20,600
Yoo Hye Jeong

624
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,560
Yes.

625
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,370
Patient Jo Soo Ji is in a semi-coma. There's bleeding in the previous surgery location.

626
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:32,610
-So suddenly? Why?
-You'll know when you come.

627
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:40,490
♫  I can't believe this moment.♫

628
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:46,750
♫ You walked towards me one step at a time. ♫

629
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,040
I want to save her, no matter what.

630
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,600
Since it's not active bleeding, this will be finished quickly.

631
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,940
♫  Wherever I am, I can't stop. ♫

632
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:19,030
I can't see properly, hold it.

633
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:22,440
There isn't that much bleeding.

634
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,350
Please give me the hemostatic pad.

635
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:30,130
♫ Above all else, I can't cry ♫

636
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:32,210
Irrigation.

637
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:42,170
♫  You make me forget all of my past. ♫

638
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:51,270
Nice! Hot, hot, hot!

639
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,360
Wow...

640
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,730
It's going to be delicious.

641
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,550
Yoon Do, you're here?

642
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,490
What is this? Where did you find that?

643
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,430
What do you mean "where"? I found it in the fridge.

644
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:11,650
This is the only thing you had to eat.

645
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,120
This is delicious.

646
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:18,940
Why are you here again? Ah, my house is a mess!

647
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:23,090
That model from last time still hasn't left yet and my house is far from the hospital.

648
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,380
I have an important surgery early tomorrow morning.

649
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,930
General Surgery Department's loser...

650
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,030
you can't even check a patient's mental state properly so how are you even a surgeon?

651
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:33,680
Do you think we couldn't be a psycho neurosurgeon, if we were paranoid?

652
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,520
-Nice, nice, our In Joo!
-Uncle!

653
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,820
-Don't call your uncle so desperately, go bring me some ramen.

654
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,940
Why don't you have any ramen at your house?
-Aunt!

655
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:46,020
Fine, I'll let you call me "Aunt". Give me some ramen.

656
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:49,180
Wait, what does ramen have anything to do with calling you "Aunt"?

657
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,250
Your aunt wants to eat ramen.

658
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:54,810
Aunt and ramen, they're related now, right? I like cup ramen.

659
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:56,310
-So?
-Go buy it.

660
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:59,360
-Go buy it yourself.
-I'm going to leave for work from this house.

661
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,950
My house is too far from the hospital.

662
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,060
Your house is big. We're surgeons,

663
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:09,290
living together in a cramped space has been a part of our life since we were interns.

664
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:14,940
This is a dream; this must be a dream. It's a dream, of course it is.

665
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:15,980
It isn't a dream!

666
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,990
Yoon Doo, get me some cubed radish kimchi and salt.

667
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,950
Go get it yourself!

668
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,820
Are you awake now?

669
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,500
You endured through it well.

670
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:44,390
It's a relief, you're regaining control of your motor functions.

671
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,480
[Tracing a heart]

672
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,900
Me too.

673
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,340
Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit

674
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,790
It was a long day.

675
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,710
I know.

676
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:46,640
Doctor...can't you take me home?

677
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,980
Of course I can! I love things like that.

678
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,610
Let's go.

679
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:06,570
Don't be like this. You can leave now.

680
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:10,120
We're all here. I'll leave after seeing you go in.

681
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:19,570
Go in first.

682
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,530
Leave first.

683
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:23,190
Go in first.

684
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,220
I don't want to. I want to see you leave first.

685
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:28,860
Alright.

686
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:39,410
I'm leaving.

687
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:42,330
-Yes...
-Yeah...

688
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:02,640
♫  The first time I saw you,  ♫

689
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,950
♫  You seemed as anxious as a child  ♫

690
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:16,420
♫  One day when you were standing beside me,  ♫

691
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:20,410
♫  you had changed  ♫

692
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,110
Back hugs can be moving.

693
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:27,850
A feeling that someone is enduring behind you and guiding you through life.
♫ Did you know,  ♫

694
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:36,610
This feeling is the biggest happiness lovers can give to each other.
♫ I never expected we would be in love  ♫
