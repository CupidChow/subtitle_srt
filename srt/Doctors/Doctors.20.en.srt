1
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,680
Can I really leave?

2
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,590
I hope that I never have to see you again, Teacher.

3
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,770
I met him again.

4
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,530
I didn't know I was going to meet him again in this fashion.

5
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,000
If I think about it, it was like this when we first met.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,410
It started as a coincidence, and it became something inevitable.

7
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,890
Then it turned into fate.

8
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,820
Are you okay?
Last Episode

9
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,980
I'm okay. I'm so embarrassed because of your mother!

10
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,010
So why didn't you admit yourself into the hospital when I told you to?

11
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,030
If you were admitted to the hospital as soon as you found out you were sick, this wouldn't have happened.

12
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,190
I'm going to go ahead and examine you.

13
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,820
No thanks, let's do it later.

14
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,200
Oh my, Teacher!

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,280
How have you been?

16
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,620
I mean, what's going on here?

17
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,710
- Why are you here?
- You know her?

18
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,080
Of course I know her! She's the girl from before that—

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,570
- She's my friend.
- What?

20
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,590
I said, she's my friend.

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,630
I think we have to move him to an in-patient room.

22
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,430
Let's do that.

23
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,160
We'll move him to a VIP patient room.

24
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,270
What in the world is going on?

25
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,580
This is the hospital. This is dad's and my work place.

26
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,640
I wish you would mind your manners here.

27
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,790
We will move you to a patient room.

28
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,740
I'm going to walk.

29
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,860
- My shoes.
- They're not here.

30
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,960
- Find me some slippers.
- Yes sir.

31
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,950
Does your head hurt, Honey?

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,820
What should we do?

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,540
How is he?

34
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,420
The tumor is still in the same condition. And there's no problem with his brain.

35
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,790
So I guess it is because of the sleeping pills.

36
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,880
I'm not even his doctor in charge. Why'd you call me?

37
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,040
I figured you would have the best judgment.

38
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,880
Isn't it better to ask Doctor Jeong Yoon Do?

39
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,820
As of yesterday, Director Jin reinstated you to the neurosurgery department.

40
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,250
It's not like he talked it through with me though.

41
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,800
He talked about it with me.

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,810
For now, make sure he is well hydrated.

43
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,680
Yes.

44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,350
I'm against Doctor Hong doing your father's surgery.

45
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,510
Are there not enough doctors, that your father has to get surgery from him?

46
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,950
There's Yoon Do! If not, go to America!

47
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,420
Doctor Hong Ji Hong doing dad's surgery is our best option.

48
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,750
Best? What do you mean, best?

49
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,660
We brought him from America because he was the best there.

50
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,480
What do you mean you want me to go to America?

51
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,350
It's because it hurts my pride.

52
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,190
Is your pride more important than Dad's surgery?

53
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,960
Geez, I've lived long enough to see something like this. How do we meet here of all places?

54
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,790
I saw your CT and MRI results, and nothing has changed from before.

55
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,230
Why are you here instead of Professor Hong?

56
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,260
You're going to accept surgery from Professor Hong?

57
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,550
Then who else am I going to get it from?

58
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,840
Why did you call me to the emergency room? Did you know that I was reinstated?

59
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,230
No, you're the best. That's why I called you.

60
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,580
That makes me feel good. Did you know about Director Jin's condition?

61
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,020
No, I just found out earlier. His condition is serious.

62
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,960
Even if we do the surgery, he won't be as healthy as he used to be.

63
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,600
Why are you trying to not do the surgery?

64
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,840
Until a few days ago, things weren't good between us.

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,090
The patient won't feel at ease with me.

66
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,530
Just because I'm good at the surgery doesn't justify me doing the surgery.

67
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,410
Doctor Kim Tae Ho

68
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,060
Yes, Doctor.

69
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,210
Ah, yes, come on in.

70
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,330
Well, now you two can talk it through.

71
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,250
Stay with us.

72
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,710
Whether the patient and doctor build walls or break them, you guys can figure it out.

73
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,040
After you're done talking, let's have a cup of tea.

74
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,130
- Thank you.
- For what?

75
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,100
You called for Professor Hong.

76
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,010
As a doctor, I made the best decision.

77
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,490
You don't like my dad.

78
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,400
I don't like him, but he's still a patient.

79
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,030
I can't take out my personal emotions.

80
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,920
I can't see my dad from a third party view.

81
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,090
That's why he's my dad.

82
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,700
I know he hurt you, but to me, he's a precious father.

83
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,560
There's a tumor on your cervical vertebrae 3 and 4. For more specifics, we'll have to run more tests.

84
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm suspecting it's an ependymoma.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,680
Ependymomas are created from cells that make up the brain and spinal cord.

86
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,170
And they're formed along the brain to the spinal nerves.

87
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,230
They can form along the middle of the spinal cord as well.

88
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:48,680
In your case, the tumor is in a very dangerous location.

89
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,180
Yes.

90
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,970
Director, before the tumor gets bigger, you have to receive surgery.

91
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,130
What if it gets bigger?

92
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,200
It's dangerous to your life.

93
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,780
How are you going to do the surgery?

94
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,740
Because it's a tumor located inside the spinal cord,

95
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,380
We have to open up from behind the spinal cord.

96
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,530
When you open it up and go in, it's going to leave a scar, right?

97
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,370
Even if we succeed, there's a chance sensation will be blunted.

98
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,600
Your senses for movement will be damaged as well.

99
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,510
If the spinal artery is damaged, there is a chance of quadriplegia ( paralysis of arms and legs).

100
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,290
Let's hurry up and do the surgery then.

101
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,620
- Can I really do the surgery?
- Yes.

102
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,960
I acknowledge your skills as a doctor.

103
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,640
- But there is a problem.
- What is it?

104
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,550
The assistant is Doctor Yoo Hye Jeong.

105
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,470
If I don't do it with Doctor Yoo, then I can't do this surgery.

106
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,560
Are you trying to harass me because of your personal feelings towards me?

107
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,410
It's a dangerous surgery. Doctor Yoo and I have been in sync for previous surgeries.

108
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,280
The chance of success is higher.

109
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,420
As a doctor, I want to save all patients.

110
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,660
Yoo Min Ho? Please come in.

111
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,330
Ah, yes.

112
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,680
♫ What if there was no light ♫

113
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,870
♫ Nothing wrong, nothing right ♫

114
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:39,720
♫ What if there was no time ♫

115
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,850
I was very happy that you asked to meet me first.
 ♫ And no reason or rhyme ♫

116
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,280
A few days ago, I went to go see Grandmother.

117
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,840
Oh really? I should go too.

118
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,780
I haven't been able to go lately.

119
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,210
Next time you go, do you want to go together?

120
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,200
Why did you settle for Grandma's medical malpractice case?

121
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,540
And did you move her to a better place because it got to your conscience?

122
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,370
At the time, there was nothing I could do.

123
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,150
I didn't know how to begin or what to do.

124
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,410
I even asked them to see the medical records. And I saw them.

125
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,830
But what am I supposed to do with them?

126
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,190
I don't know how to read them, and if we went to court, the case would be dragged out.

127
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,430
Then you should have at least not taken the settlement money.

128
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,480
To do who any good? In the end, that would only be good for the hospital.

129
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,560
In that situation, what was I supposed to do?

130
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,550
I had to eat to survive, and figure everything out. I wanted to explode.

131
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,530
But, that was the best I could do. What can I say?

132
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,430
You don't have any compassion for life.

133
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,270
Usually in a relationship between a parent and child, there are things that can't be forgotten.

134
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:55,370
But no matter how hard I think about it, I have no good memories with you, Dad.

135
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,520
It's strange. Even though I don't like you,

136
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,850
after hearing you were ill, I was very concerned.

137
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,450
If you become sick and weary,

138
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,150
I think I will want to help you.

139
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,690
But if that's not the case, it would be better for us not to meet.

140
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,470
I want to make a family.

141
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,380
But if I don't settle things between us,

142
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,000
I don't think I'll be able to start afresh. That's why I asked to meet you.

143
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,760
Are you getting married?

144
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,860
I'm sure I will one day.

145
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,150
I'm probably not going to contact you.

146
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,810
Please live healthily.

147
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:04,790
I'm sorry. That I, as a dad,

148
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,350
couldn't protect my fatherly position...

149
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,630
That I made your life difficult.

150
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,580
Thank you for apologizing.

151
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,780
I'll try hard not to be sick.

152
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,250
Please live happily.

153
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,530
Go outside so I can meet someone.

154
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,120
Meet them. Is anyone trying to stop you?

155
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,460
Exactly who is it that you can't meet them if I'm here?

156
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,760
I've become embarrassed because of you.

157
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,960
If there is a surgery scheduled I could just come in quietly, but what is this?

158
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,390
Yes?

159
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,290
Were you telling me to leave so you could meet her?

160
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,380
You left me out... Why'd you hide the fact that she and Doctor Hong are at this hospital?

161
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,060
I'm a patient.

162
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,860
You did it. Just how on earth did you become a doctor?

163
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,280
I told you to not!

164
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,440
I got it.

165
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,680
You heard the news from Doctor Hong Ji Hong, right?

166
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,350
I don't know what you're talking about.

167
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:35,130
Doctor Hong needs to do my surgery, but he's insisting on you being the assistant.

168
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,350
I'm not going to do it.

169
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:44,190
I'm thinking the same thing. If that's the case, I'd be too nervous to even get the surgery done.

170
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,070
Go and tell Doctor Hong.

171
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,170
I understand. I'll also change the attending physician to Doctor Kang as well.

172
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,890
Please do that.

173
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,200
Doctor Yoon Do.

174
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,190
Why don't you pick up your phone?

175
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,020
- Do I have to pick it up?
- Well, that's not the case.

176
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,330
Are you prepared for Patient Kim Ji Won's surgery?

177
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,440
I'm done. I just have to go in.

178
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,790
- Your father—
- He has something serious.

179
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,550
The placement of the tumor is too dangerous.

180
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,240
How did it start growing in his neck?

181
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
I heard Doctor Hong Ji Hong decided to do it.

182
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,500
No, it hasn't been decided yet. I don't know why it's like this.

183
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:08,080
All the nerves connected to the entire body pass through the neck. If something goes wrong ...

184
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:16,230
I feel really bad about it. I can't be without my father.

185
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:21,270
And my grandfather needs to have his trial. What am I going to do?

186
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,820
It'll work out well. I'll help you.

187
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,990
I see you were here.

188
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,730
I'll see you later.

189
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,600
What are your feelings towards Seo Woo?

190
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,970
Why do I have to tell you?

191
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,940
Because I'm Seo Woo's friend. Since I was there when Seo Woo was going through a hard time,

192
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,900
I believe I have enough of a right to get a response.

193
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,080
You're really blunt towards me.

194
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,810
By chance, did you like Seo Woo since you guys were in school?

195
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,650
Is that why you have hard feelings towards me or something?

196
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:36,410
I do like her, as a friend... Just not right now.

197
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,620
I'm the same thing as Seo Woo's biological older brother.

198
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:46,570
If you start dating Seo Woo, well, I'm all for it.

199
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,470
Do well. If you have a hard time, you can tell me too.

200
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,850
Aren't you too cool?

201
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,990
What is cool about me?

202
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,510
You, who found your love and are trying to protect her, are even more cool.

203
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,750
I understand, but Seo Woo's mentality is weak.

204
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,450
I'm leaving.

205
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,220
Wow, this is the same.

206
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,590
FireBear: Mr. BadDoctors! Of course you're the best!!

207
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,790
Kg: "It's not funny. Screw off hehe—" this crazy bastard.

208
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,440
The response to your webtoon isn't that great! Look, the ID  Kj  says it's bad!

209
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,200
This guy, KJ. I think I know him.

210
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,110
He keeps coming in and saying crap.

211
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,190
Is it you, chief? KJ. Kyeong Joon.

212
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,310
It's not. It's really not.

213
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,720
Is the only KJ me? Kwang Joo, Kyeong Ju, Kuk Ja, Kyeong Joon—

214
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,310
Kyeong Joon! You even solved it yourself.

215
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,290
Yeah yeah, so it's me. How'd you know? Was it that obvious?

216
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,850
Why are you like that, really?

217
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,190
Because you're doing so well, and I was worried you'd become an author.

218
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,130
Webtoons are fun, but that's just my hobby. My dream is to become a surgeon.

219
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,490
Don't worry about useless things and just don't do things like this!

220
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,750
I got it, I got it. I got it.

221
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,030
Kang Soo! Did you have any convulsions?

222
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,930
The convulsions... have dissipated after taking meds.

223
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,920
- That's a relief.
- You check up really well.

224
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,350
Are you doing that for other patients as well?

225
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,450
Yes, I'm doing that.

226
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,330
You know that the chief is in the VIP room, right?

227
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,230
Yes. I was the one who gave you the call in the emergency room.

228
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,520
You answer really well every time.

229
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,820
Can the chief really keep being in that position?

230
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,680
He'll probably be fired once the new CEO is appointed. He's like a kite that had the string cut.

231
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,350
What? Did you gossip again? Seeing how it's quiet as soon as I come in, that must be it.

232
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,600
No, we weren't.

233
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,870
- Where is Yeong Gook?
- In the sleeping quarters.

234
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,850
- Yeong Gook.
- Yeah?

235
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,330
I'm hungry.

236
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,050
But why do you come find me? You should go to a restaurant instead.

237
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,940
You're right. Why did I come to you when I'm hungry?

238
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,370
Why?

239
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:23,010
Just stay still. I won't eat you alive.

240
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,990
You can't even eat so why'd you say you were hungry?

241
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,890
Why did you just leave earlier?

242
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,910
It seemed like you and Sunbae Yoon Do had something to talk about.

243
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,780
It's a debt from when I comforted him.

244
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,940
You don't have to explain. Is there anything that I don't know about you?

245
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,230
Let's go.

246
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:11,120
Seo Woo. Just like usual, I'm always by your side, right?

247
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:17,170
You're right. I think you were always by my side.

248
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,980
But what to do? Now, I changed.

249
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:30,710
I think it was since that time. The first time I did something "bad" to you.

250
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,230
Since then, you came into my heart.

251
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,210
I don't know exactly when you came into my heart.

252
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:52,250
But when I heard about my dad, the first thing I thought of was the fact that I wanted to be comforted by you.

253
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,630
Everything will pass.

254
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,220
Its a bit late, but congratulations on returning to the neurosurgery department!

255
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,200
What is this?

256
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,560
I bought this at the hospital mart. Take this with you when you go home.

257
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,330
You know that I used to only focus on one thing at a time.

258
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,340
I decided to change and focus on a lot of different things at the same time.

259
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,750
Is that test subject me?

260
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,290
Yes. Taking care of you, being a surgeon, and being a nice friend to Soon Hee.

261
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,010
Being a nice sunbae to the underclassmen in the hospital.

262
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,190
Can you do all that?

263
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,650
I won't be going into Dr. Jin's surgery.

264
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:09,660
To summarize, you are very bothered by his surgery.

265
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,650
Because you're so focused on it, you want to spread your attention out to a lot of different sectors?

266
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,160
How did you know?

267
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,550
Because I'm your man.

268
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,350
You know just the right words to say.

269
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,030
If you don't go in, I can't do that surgery.

270
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,210
Why?

271
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,180
I'm not confident about it.

272
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,370
You have things you're not confident about?

273
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,920
Yes. The difficulty of this surgery is very high, and the emotional burden is great.

274
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,350
The risk is too great, and I'm afraid the patient might have to carry more of that risk.

275
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,950
I can't forgive him.

276
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,260
That's why I can't.

277
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,230
I need to go to the ICU. I'm sorry.

278
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,810
- How is she?
- The BST (Blood Sugar Test) was 250, so I prescribed insulin.

279
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,500
But, her cortisol level is elevated.

280
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,880
What does the obstetrics department say?

281
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,050
They said that it could be because of her unconsciousness and that we should watch over her.

282
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,670
Alright.

283
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,160
I'm really sorry.

284
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,470
This is a decision that I made is for your sake.

285
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,720
Does saying that you're not going to perform my surgery for my sake make any sense?

286
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,960
Do you think that I accepted you to perform my surgery because I like you?

287
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,000
That's why I'm currently looking for another surgeon.

288
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:02,540
You can't come in within this month? There's nothing beneficial by delaying the procedure.

289
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,660
Okay, then.

290
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,540
Please find out for me when Professor Oh Man Seon gets back from America. Thanks.

291
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,060
Alright.

292
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,910
Professor Lee Seok Min can't do it?

293
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,670
He said he can't. And Professor Oh Man Seon went to a training meeting.

294
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,460
What about Professor Song Hye Jin?

295
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,770
Professor Song Hye Jin fought with Director Jin and left the hospital.

296
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,360
Almost everyone said they can't do it. What are you going to do?

297
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,030
Can't you just do it?

298
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,830
I might have to take care of duties as a president.

299
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,410
And I'm being put in an administrative position, so my hands aren't like before.

300
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,320
Well...

301
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,780
Does it make any sense that he can't perform a surgery without Hye Jeong?

302
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,000
If he doesn't want to do it, he should just say he doesn't want to do it. He sure has a lot of excuses.

303
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,950
That's not it. Those two have hardly had any failures when they've performed surgeries together.

304
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,090
Hye Jeong has skills as a surgeon.

305
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,300
As an assistant, it doesn't matter if she has skills. The important thing is who the surgeon is.

306
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,960
Why isn't the assistant important? In any surgery, a small mistake can cause a problem.

307
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,340
She's very meticulous. And what about Doctor Hong?

308
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,430
Receiving surgery from the two of them is the best choice for you.

309
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,310
Forget it. Kim Tae Ho is looking for other surgeons.

310
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,450
Some other person can do it.

311
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,460
Why are you here at this hour?

312
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,020
I was wondering if we can delay the surgery date.

313
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,210
Of the people that can do the surgery, they can't match their time with your schedule.

314
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,590
Did you even look into it properly?

315
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,840
I understand that you are sensitive, but please don't cross the line.

316
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,690
- You want me to die, don't you?
- Dad!

317
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,510
It's fine. We'll talk later.

318
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,950
Should I prescribe some sleeping pills?

319
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,540
That's fine. I can sleep well on my own.

320
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,430
Aish, it's so aggravating. How did it get like this?

321
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:58,750
Why do all bad things come at once? Father has to go to the police station to be investigated.

322
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,280
Why do you keep talking; it's noisy! If you're not going to be considerate, go home.

323
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,420
Can't I talk? You always get mad when I say anything!

324
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,360
Can't you be quiet?

325
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,870
Does it hurt?

326
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,880
Oh no...

327
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,760
Jin Seo Woo

328
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,700
- Hello?
- Where are you?

329
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,390
Can we meet right now?

330
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,860
- I'm sorry, It's late.
- It's alright.

331
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,490
Sit down.

332
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,620
So this is the house that you live in with Soon Hee. Where is she?

333
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,590
She'll be back soon.

334
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,290
It's herb tea. Is that okay?

335
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,280
Hye Jeong.

336
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:01,370
Can't you... do my dad's surgery?

337
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,280
Because Doc Hong said he won't do it, we're looking for other doctors, but it isn't easy.

338
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,810
He won't like it.

339
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,790
I can persuade my dad.

340
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:20,160
Persuade Doctor Hong. Kyeong Joon or Yeong Gook can be the assistant.

341
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,050
Please do it.

342
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,860
That way I can rest assured.

343
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,690
I'm sorry.

344
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,430
Please.

345
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,580
Why are you alone?

346
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,320
I sent them all away because they were adding to my temper.

347
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,470
Don't be like that.

348
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,660
In times like these, you need family the most.

349
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,880
Why did you come so late?

350
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:17,350
I continually tried to come, but since my heart and mind was downcast, I couldn't come.

351
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,080
My child is in pain; how could a parent stay comfortable?

352
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,860
I couldn't sleep.

353
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,650
Father...

354
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,450
How did this kind of bad thing occur to you?

355
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,870
Even if I get this surgery, I won't be able to live fully.

356
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,490
I might not be able to walk or talk again.

357
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,830
I'm scared to death.

358
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,410
It's fine if you are living.

359
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,650
If there's anything uncomfortable, it'll be okay once you get used to it.

360
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,240
Don't think about useless things!

361
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,320
But, it just seems like I'm going to die. I think I'm going to die during surgery.

362
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,670
I don't want to die, Father!

363
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,230
You're not going to die, Brat!

364
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,070
What are you saying in front of your father!

365
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,660
You won't die.

366
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,300
I'm not going to let you die.

367
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,380
The doctor will do well as usual.

368
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,530
The doctor is good looking and smart. I trust him.

369
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,060
Yes, Kyeong Joon.

370
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,230
Patient Jin Myeong Hoon says he has a headache.

371
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,980
Okay.

372
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,790
I don't think it's because of any specific medication or food that he ate.

373
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,010
Where is the headache and what level of pain is it?

374
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:28,430
Everything is throbbing. It seems like my head is going to crack.

375
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,350
Just in case, we'll take the CT scan again. Hey, hurry up and give him a painkiller.

376
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,020
Oh, okay!

377
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,130
If you're uncomfortable anywhere else, please say so.

378
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,820
Ah, you aren't even my appointed surgeon. Tell Yoon Do...

379
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,460
Tell him to be the appointed doctor until we set a surgery date.

380
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,550
We can't do that as per hospital policy. Until your surgery, I will take responsibility.

381
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:50,000
Until your surgery, I will take responsibility.

382
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,630
Don't be like a cat thinking about a mouse. Just go out... when you are only leaving me to die.

383
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,320
The pretty and respected Doctor Yoo, hello.

384
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,240
Are you coming from somewhere?

385
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,860
An errand. It's something that I have to do as a secretary.

386
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,910
Let's go.

387
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,300
What floor are you going to? The station?

388
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,570
No, to the VIP ward.

389
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,750
Why are you going there?

390
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,190
Do I have to tell you?

391
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,190
No, have a safe trip there.

392
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,440
- Why are you here?
- To see the Director.

393
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,950
If he wants, I want to go into the surgery.

394
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,370
- Why?
- Because I'm a doctor.

395
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,620
If that's what the patient wants, then I have to follow through.

396
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,990
You thought well.

397
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,170
I could be rejected. Even so, I want to do it, Doc.

398
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,560
Director.

399
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,490
Why are you here?

400
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,930
I want to assist in the surgery.

401
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,530
What?

402
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,400
I'm going to go into your surgery and try to do my best.

403
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,680
Leave out the part about doing your best. Don't be sarcastic.

404
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,520
You are planning to cut my vessel during surgery, right?

405
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,680
And then you'll say you tried your best?

406
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,280
Why do you think that way?

407
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,600
I'm going crazy right now.

408
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,560
Now that I'm like this, do you think I got what I deserved?

409
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,660
I do think you got what you deserved.

410
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,910
I didn't do anything wrong.

411
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,680
I checked your MRI and CT results again.

412
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:47,120
Because the tumor is in the spinal cord, we have to open the posterior column and go in from there.

413
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,190
I know that too.

414
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:53,660
When we open up to proceed, I will do my best not to leave any damage.

415
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,020
It seems that you do have some skill.

416
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:01,530
I've done some background checks on you. Like I did on your past.

417
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,920
Do you know what my grandmother's last words were before she went into surgery?

418
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:18,240
"My doctor will take care of things. I trust my doctor."

419
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:27,340
Now that I think about it, at least my grandmother's last moments were peaceful,

420
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,890
because she trusted you.

421
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:38,370
She believed that she would wake up and live a healthy life.

422
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:46,240
Before she got her surgery, as a doctor you gave her faith

423
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,570
and allowed her to be at peace before the operation.

424
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,660
Thank you.

425
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,610
You were originally my patient,

426
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:02,860
and this surgery is one you need. I want to save you.

427
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,790
I'll make sure to save you so that I can hear you say thank you.

428
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,780
Then, I will take my leave.

429
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,590
Tell Professor Hong Ji Hong,

430
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,210
to schedule the surgery for as soon as possible.

431
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:15,430
♫ I can't believe this moment ♫

432
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:32,950
♫  In front of my eyes, your world beckons me ♫

433
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:48,980
♫  Somehow I can't stop ♫

434
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,140
Give me a self (self-retaining retractor).

435
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:59,430
♫  My thoughts stopped, so I can't stop  ♫

436
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,570
♫  Rather than that  ♫

437
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:05,930
For this surgery, the tumor is on the nerve of the spinal cord, so we have to open up the spinal cord.

438
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,180
It's very difficult.

439
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,000
It's dangerous because there can be damage to the nerves of the limbs, right?

440
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,120
Yes, do you understand, Joong Dae?

441
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,000
I will pay attention and study.

442
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,930
♫ I can feel this moment ♫

443
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:32,570
♫ Little by little, we're becoming closer ♫

444
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,130
Give me my gown please.

445
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,920
Give me a rongeur.

446
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,380
Let's start.

447
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,640
Irrigation.

448
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,190
Wash up here, please.

449
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,370
Right now, they've cut out the posterior part of the spinal cord from C2 to C5, right?

450
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,010
Yes.

451
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,570
Don't touch the vertebral artery, okay?

452
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,280
Give me the bipolar.

453
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,810
He's going in well.

454
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,990
As of now, he hasn't touched it yet.

455
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,610
The adhesion is very severe.

456
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,500
I'm watching.

457
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,820
Because the tumor is so close to the spinal cord, if he wants to excise the tumor,

458
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,400
he has no choice but to touch the nerve, right?

459
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,790
I'm not sure. We asked Professor Hong Ji Hong to do the surgery so that wouldn't happen.

460
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,410
We're almost there.

461
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,210
The excision is complete.

462
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:59,400
Yes. It is finished.

463
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,450
There's blood leaking.

464
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:08,150
The adhesion is severe, so there's nothing we can do when removing the tumor.

465
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,960
There's no way he doesn't touch that.

466
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,140
Bring the cottonoid close to me.

467
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,770
Teacher.

468
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,600
I'm watching. I'm just going to finish this up.

469
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,690
Biopsy.

470
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,590
Why won't the bleeding stop?

471
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,430
Cottonoid.

472
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,090
At this rate, even if he wakes up, what if he can't move?

473
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,430
Why isn't the bleeding stopping?

474
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,720
Kids, let's just watch.

475
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,410
Doctor, the signal is strange.

476
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,170
There's nothing we can do. We have to first stop the bleeding.

477
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,170
It's done.

478
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,960
You've worked hard.

479
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,720
He got it.

480
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,060
He finished a difficult surgery.

481
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:36,110
You worked hard, Doctor Yoo.

482
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,760
Yes.

483
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:42,160
The director survived. Let's finish up.

484
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,590
Operating Room

485
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:56,010
The surgery went well. We were able to remove all of the tumor.

486
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:02,420
Because the surgery was done near the nerves, we have to see after he wakes up to know for sure.

487
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,920
We're going to move him to the patient ward.

488
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,210
Thank you. Thank you, Teacher.

489
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,720
Yes, then.

490
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,610
He's alive.

491
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,140
Your father is alive.

492
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,660
Hospital Administration, Operating Rooms

493
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,410
- The coffee has arrived.
- Kang Soo!

494
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,950
Thanks Doctor Choi! I mean, Secretary Choi.

495
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,030
What's the fuss here?

496
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,190
Ah, Doc, have some of this!

497
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,500
- What is it?
- An iced Americano, Kang Soo bought it.

498
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,030
Doc, now that you're back, the neurosurgery department feels like the neurosurgery department.

499
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,180
Since the director's surgery went well, let's have a welcome back party for Professor Hong!

500
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,090
Sounds good!

501
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,590
Hey, it's not like I just came back.

502
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:07,650
Ah, Professor. We've been so depressed lately. Let's just have one beer!

503
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,330
Ah, Doctor Yoo can come too, then!

504
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,700
Yeah! If Doctor Yoo comes along, we can all go, right?

505
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,870
If I go, we're all going? Where?

506
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,760
Let's grab some beers.

507
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,990
- Ah, that's right. Chief, you can't go.
- Why?

508
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,000
- You're on call.
- Ugh.

509
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,200
Then should we go get a drink?

510
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,050
Yes!

511
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,420
Here, a hot Americano, since it's hot.

512
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,080
Thank you.

513
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,860
You are on call.

514
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,390
Since I'm on call, let's do well!

515
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:42,470
Doctor!

516
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:47,530
This is what you call a one-two upper back spin elbow.

517
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:51,910
And this is a high kick.

518
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,610
Yoon Do, Uncle is here!

519
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,490
What are you doing by yourself?

520
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,220
I like being alone.

521
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,050
Are you an outcast?

522
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:22,100
Ji Hong went out to get drinks with your department. They didn't even invite you, did they?

523
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,090
They did. They did, but I just didn't go.

524
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:29,880
How am I supposed to watch her next to Professor Hong? I'm human too.

525
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,490
What do you like about Doctor Yoo?

526
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,000
It's not what I like about her, I just like her.

527
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,780
It's not lonely liking Doctor Yoo by myself.

528
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,380
It's more lonely if I'm meeting other girls but thinking about Doctor Yoo.

529
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,160
What kind of love is one-sided?

530
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,330
Don't disregard one-sided love.

531
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:56,590
It's better to act on all the words in the world that have 'love' in them, then to not love at all.

532
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,420
Let's make a toast.

533
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,410
What should we toast?

534
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:17,880
To the return of Hong Ji Hong?

535
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,250
I like that!

536
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,210
Then after we toast, let's play the truth game.

537
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,870
Dang, you're so old fashioned. How old are you?

538
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,870
Old?

539
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,790
Geez, why would you bring up the truth game...

540
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:32,460
Professor, how long have you been dating Doctor Yoo?

541
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,550
Are you drunk?

542
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,760
I'm sorry.

543
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,100
- Yes.
- Doctor, Lee Hee Yeong's water broke

544
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:46,410
How long has it been? Hurry up and call OB GYN. I'll be right there.

545
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,560
- Patient Lee Hee Yeong?
- Yes.

546
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:53,640
Ah, Doc! What's up with them? Are they leaving?

547
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,870
I guess they are the couple that harmoniously intertwines work and love together.

548
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,040
Our Jin Jin!

549
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,190
Ah, that's right. Our Jin Jin!

550
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:07,790
Stop eating, geez!

551
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,150
How can you just leave?

552
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,810
Aish, Joong Dae, Joong Dae, Ahn Joong Dae!

553
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:16,550
They didn't even pay...

554
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,340
Operating Room

555
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,610
This is Yoo Hye Jeong.

556
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:35,750
Yes, Doctor.

557
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:39,090
Your wife's water broke, so we are starting surgery.

558
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:47,370
Operating Room

559
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,890
Ah, it's our Jin Jin!

560
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:09,330
Ah, he's so cute.

561
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:10,410
Jin Jin!

562
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,290
He's so cute!

563
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,150
Don't you want to have a baby?

564
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,280
You must be crazy.

565
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,830
We have to move the patient to the ICU.

566
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:01,450
Yes.

Yes?

570
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,530
Ah, yes, Doctor. Patient Lee Hee Yeong's vitals are dropping.

571
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,540
Okay.

572
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,570
Kim Woo Jin, there's not much time left.

573
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,300
- Did you contact them?
- Yes.

574
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,910
Why aren't they coming?

575
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:16,820
What if he can't see her last moment?

I love you, Hee Yeong.

Time of death, 02:25.

579

Patient Lee Hee Yeong has died.

580
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:29,660
I think Hee Yeong was able to see the last image of Woo Jin.

581
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,180
It might be a hallucination,

582
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,320
but I saw Hee Yeong's smile.

The 61st Meeting
Guk Il Hospital
Board Member Meeting
4th Director
Kim Tae Ho, Hopsital Director
Inauguration

585
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,460
I am Kim Tae Ho, who was elected as director.

586
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:03,500
I believe that Guk Il Hospital is at a crossroads between either expanding or taking a quick break.

587
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,960
Up to now, we have raced ahead.

588
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,620
However, for now, we must stop briefly to see where we stand

589
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:12,590
and figure out where we must go.

590
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:14,670
Why do we respect the hospital?

591
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,960
For who? With whom will we go?

592
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,950
How will we approach realistic problems?

593
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:27,410
I will become a director who ponders these issues and figures out solutions to these problems with everyone here.

594
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:29,040
Thank you.

595
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,610
Why isn't he waking up?

596
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:53,480
Doctor Jin.

597
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,330
Honey!

598
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:15,360
- Dad!
- Myeong Hoon!

599
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,250
Move your hand.

600
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,350
I think he can start rehabilitation now.

601
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,990
Dear!

602
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:00,100
This week was so long. I'm so tired.

603
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,440
Are you making sure to take your supplements?

604
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,150
I shouldn't have said anything.

605
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:08,320
You can't think of this as nagging. Your health is most important.

606
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,960
What are you doing this weekend?

607
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,850
- It's the same as usual.
- Should we go fishing?

608
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:16,450
Father-in-law would say this: When I asked you to go, you didn't want to.

609
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:19,520
But now that you can't go together you keep saying you want to go.

610
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,350
Father-in-law, Father-in-law.

611
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:25,780
Yes, Father-in-law. I'll catch Father-in-law's share of fish too.

612
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,350
Okay!

613
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,350
Director Jin Myeong Hoon

614
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,620
I'm on my way there.

615
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:20,500
Please go first. I have somewhere to drop by beforehand.

616
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,450
Where?

617
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,120
To see Director Jin Myeong Hoon.

618
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,110
I'll wait.

619
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,930
Take a seat.

620
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:51,850
I'm fine.

621
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:14,940
Are you receiving physical therapy well?

622
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,770
I am.

623
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,760
Thank you.

624
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,570
I'm thankful as well.

625
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:44,110

Will you marry me?

Hey, I'm the one that's supposed to put it on for you.

It's mine, so I should put it on.

646
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,990
That's not romantic.

647
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:23,030
You said to make it romantic. That's why I worked hard to put this all together!

648
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,590
I love you.

649

Really...

650

I wanted to set the mood and make some good memories.

Please call me.

Call you? Right now?

653
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,510
Hong Hong Hong.

654
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,320
Hong, Hong, Hong, is that me?

655
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,660
- Yes.
- Why?

656
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:58,850
Because every time I see you I feel hong hong hong.

657
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:00,680
What is hong hong hong?

658
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,470
Just the way it sounds, hong hong hong!

659
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:04,780
It's weird, hong hong hong.

660
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,740
If you keep saying it, you start to laugh, right?

661
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,300
Yeah.

662
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:25,670
♫ The first time that I saw you ♫

663
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:31,320
♫ You seemed as anxious as a child ♫

664
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:39,510
♫ One day, when you were standing beside me ♫

665
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,570
I'm so embarrassed.
 ♫ You had changed to become so lovely ♫

666
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:49,190
I don't know when I started to love.
♫ Did you know, I never expected we would be in love ♫

667
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:54,630
I don't know when I started to love, but I was continuing to fall in love.
♫ I miss you ♫

668
00:57:54,630 --> 00:58:01,050
This once in a lifetime love, I don't know when it started.
 ♫ I love you ♫

669
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:04,620
♫ You are my entire life ♫
