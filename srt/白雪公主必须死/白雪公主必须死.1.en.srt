00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:15,206
This is fun.

6
00:00:15,206 --> 00:00:16,571
<i>Bo-yeong, where are you?</i>

7
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:18,623
<i>Why aren't you taking my calls?</i>

8
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:22,410
<i>I'll tell you everything,</i>
<i>so answer the phone.</i>

9
00:00:24,698 --> 00:00:26,944
<i>Let's have a talk at home, Bo-yeong.</i>

10
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,279
<i>Oh, what?</i>

11
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,238
I'm going to spend some time
in the warehouse and then go home.

12
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,126
<i>The warehouse?</i>

13
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:32,560
<i>Who are you with?</i>

14
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:36,097
- What do you mean?
<i>- I heard you're dating their son.</i>

15
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:37,434
<i>You can't stay with him this late.</i>

16
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:39,559
All right.
I'll call you when I get home.

17
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:42,377
<i>Da-eun!</i>

18
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:44,072
<i>Hello?</i>

19
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:45,972
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

20
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:47,172
<i>Hello?</i>

00:01:42,427 --> 00:01:43,427
You're here.

24
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:45,493
Hey.

25
00:01:45,747 --> 00:01:47,013
- Section Chief.
- What?

26
00:01:54,994 --> 00:01:57,194
KCSI

27
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:13,573
Chief.

28
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:16,728
A visual analysis on the bloodstains
reveals that...

29
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:19,328
...the locations of the case...

30
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:20,713
...are two in total.

31
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:23,694
And the victim might not be just one,

32
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:25,994
but two or even more.

33
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:29,661
Hey, did missing reports other than
Park Da-eun's come in?

34
00:02:30,194 --> 00:02:31,272
Section Chief!

35
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:33,949
Section Chief, sir!

36
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:35,039
Come this way.

37
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,774
The owner of this car
is also Mr. Goh Chang-su,

38
00:02:39,774 --> 00:02:42,441
but its actual driver
was Goh Jeong-woo.

39
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:43,393
Section Chief.

40
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:44,484
This is...

41
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:45,892
You know?

42
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,632
All right.

43
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:48,694
Okay.

44
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:50,694
Now! Get ready!

45
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:52,861
Goh Jeong-woo will be arrested
without a warrant.

Have the rest of the team
surround the area.

51
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:39,194
Come in.

52
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:40,494
Hurry.

53
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:51,240
Get up! Come out!

54
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:52,761
Mr. Goh Jeong-woo.

55
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:56,649
You are under arrest on suspicion of
murder of Shim Bo-yeong and Park Da-eun...

56
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:58,261
...and abandonment of their dead bodies.

57
00:03:58,628 --> 00:03:59,828
- What?
- Take him away.

58
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:01,079
- Yes, sir.
- Wait a minute.

59
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,467
Let go! Darn it!

60
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:14,162
- Grab hold of him.
- Yes, sir!

61
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:15,251
Uncle!

62
00:04:15,728 --> 00:04:16,761
Uncle!

63
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:18,761
Hey, Jeong-woo. It's all right.

64
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:24,928
Get in.

65
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:26,266
- Uncle.
- Hey, come on.

66
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,761
- Get out of the way.
- Uncle.

67
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:28,829
Darn it!

68
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:30,894
Hey, be gentle.

69
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:31,795
Uncle.

70
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:32,523
It's okay.

71
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,152
I'm here for you,
I'll go see you soon.

72
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:35,389
Stay calm.

73
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:43,738
You all look like you want to...

74
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:47,128
...drink and play hard
now that the CSAT is over.

75
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:48,728
You shouldn't drink and play!

76
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:50,168
- All right!
- All right!

77
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:51,002
Okay.

78
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:52,002
Jeong-woo.

79
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:54,595
Jeong-woo?

80
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,028
Attention.

81
00:04:57,394 --> 00:04:58,728
Bow to the teacher.

82
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:00,661
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

83
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,361
<i>It was the day after the CSAT.</i>

84
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,861
<i>Everyone flunked the test</i>
<i>except me, Geon-oh and Deok-mi,</i>

85
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:10,268
<i>so to console them...</i>

86
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:12,042
<i>Right,</i>

87
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:15,233
<i>my house was empty because</i>
<i>my parents were on a trip to Hawaii.</i>

88
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:19,128
<i>So I told my friends that...</i>

89
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,802
<i>...we should drink at my house.</i>

90
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:26,230
<i>I was supposed to buy groceries</i>
<i>with Da-eun,</i>

91
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,778
<i>but she hadn't come to school that day</i>
<i>and couldn't be reached.</i>

92
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:31,312
GOH JEONG-WOO

93
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:39,987
Da-eun.

00:05:54,628 --> 00:05:56,894
$410

95
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:04,636
Darn it.

96
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:15,720
Give the car key.

97
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:17,377
Give it to me.

98
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:19,319
Oh, hurry up.

99
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,980
Please get out.

100
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:26,487
I just want to be alone, that's all.

101
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:29,861
I also want to be alone right now.

102
00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:31,094
Get out right now.

103
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:32,094
What?

104
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:33,461
You're supposed to be my friend.

105
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:34,928
This is my car!

106
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:36,328
Get out now.

107
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:37,361
Hurry up!

108
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:41,417
You're just doing this
because of Da-eun.

109
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:42,994
What about Da-eun?

110
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:44,161
You're just doing this
because of Da-eun.

111
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:44,961
What about Da-eun?

112
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:46,994
You're just doing this
because of Da-eun!

113
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:48,861
She's...

114
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,926
A slut.

115
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:52,894
What did you just call her?

116
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:56,099
What did you just...
What did you just call her?

117
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:57,779
What did you call her?

118
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:00,520
Hey.

119
00:07:03,761 --> 00:07:05,024
Darn it!

120
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:07,628
Shim Bo-yeong!

121
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,179
Shim Bo-yeong!

122
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,013
<i>I was quite angry then.</i>

123
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:14,128
<i>So I canceled all the plans</i>
<i>I had with my friends...</i>

124
00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:16,517
<i>...and just drank alone at my house.</i>

125
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,193
After loading Shim Bo-yeong
into the trunk of the car...

126
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:20,561
...and abandoning her body,

127
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:24,428
you returned to the warehouse
around 11:30 p.m....

128
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:26,128
and met Park Da-eun, right?

129
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:27,730
It wasn't me.

130
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,184
Exactly, you punk.

131
00:07:29,185 --> 00:07:30,762
It's not that you didn't do it.

132
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:33,397
- Come in here.
- You just don't remember, all right?

133
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,914
Where in the world
did this joker come from?

134
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,194
I said I didn't do it...

135
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:42,961
I didn't.

136
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:45,628
Come to your senses, you bastard!

137
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:50,992
We were supposed to hang out
at Jeong-woo's place after the CSAT,

138
00:07:51,494 --> 00:07:53,328
but Jeong-woo was in a bad mood.

139
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:54,660
Jeong-woo was mad.

140
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:58,396
He couldn't get in touch with Da-eun
after the CSAT.

141
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,247
Bo-yeong?

142
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:03,407
I last saw Jeong-woo
and Bo-yeong...

143
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:05,474
...next to the warehouse.

144
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:07,938
It looked like they had
argued in the car.

145
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:09,367
Yes.

146
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,114
I went to Jeong-woo's house
for a short while.

147
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:18,128
What? You startled me.

148
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:20,619
Did you finish this all by yourself?

149
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:23,428
- This?
<i>- He seemed to be very angry...</i>

150
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:25,594
<i>- ...because of Da-eun.</i>
- Yeah, I did.

151
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:28,128
He seemed a bit drunk,

152
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:30,161
so I just left the house.

153
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:31,694
That's why...

154
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:33,994
We hung out at my house
until late into the night.

155
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:35,798
And after that...

156
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:40,228
I don't know what happened.

157
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:49,928
Gu-tak...

158
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:57,294
This makes no sense at all.

159
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,228
All of you, stay outside.

160
00:09:00,228 --> 00:09:01,331
Gu-tak.

161
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:16,361
Da-eun said that...

162
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:19,628
...She was with her boyfriend.

163
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:20,613
Right.

164
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:22,214
When I called her,

165
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:24,573
I could hear his voice.

166
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:26,227
Detective sir, you know how it is.

167
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:27,794
- Right?
- I do know.

168
00:09:27,794 --> 00:09:29,294
Please find my Bo-yeong.

169
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:31,161
It's freezing right now.

170
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:33,194
How cold she must she be right now?

171
00:09:33,194 --> 00:09:34,461
My Bo-yeong.

172
00:09:34,461 --> 00:09:37,128
Find Bo-yeong! You bastard!

173
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:38,561
But then suddenly,

174
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:41,864
Da-eun's scream was heard.

175
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:44,784
Did you drink alcohol on the evening
of November 19?

176
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:47,329
Yes.

177
00:09:48,307 --> 00:09:51,070
Did you kill Shim Bo-yeong,
your friend, in the warehouse?

178
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,666
No.

179
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:58,028
No, I...

180
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:00,354
No, I didn't!

181
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:04,128
When I got off the bus...

182
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:07,161
SEOCHEON-GU OFFICE, MUCHEON VILLAGE,

00:10:08,828 --> 00:10:10,661
<i>...was headed in the opposite direction.</i>

185
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:14,327
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>it was Goh Jeong-woo's car?</i>

186
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:17,061
I'm sure.

187
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:19,061
Goh Jeong-woo.

188
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:20,994
How was the weather last night?

189
00:10:21,774 --> 00:10:23,101
It rained last night, right?

190
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:25,828
Huh?

191
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,661
You became dead drunk
the night before last...

192
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:33,228
...and went to the warehouse, right?

193
00:10:33,228 --> 00:10:34,428
No.

194
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:35,971
No, I didn't go there.

195
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:42,875
Pantry back there, yes.

196
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,099
Check out the clothes in the washer.

197
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,553
Team Head, sir!

198
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:49,879
We found it.

199
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,293
Hey, what did I tell you!

200
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:54,728
<i>Jeong-woo's shoes smeared with</i>
<i>the girls' blood and mud were found.</i>

201
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:57,928
Do you know what that means?

202
00:10:57,928 --> 00:11:00,449
That's strong evidence...

203
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,893
...that proves he was...

204
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:05,094
...in the same warehouse as Bo-yeong
and Da-eun when they were bleeding.

205
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:08,567
Even if Jeong-woo was drunk...

206
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:13,328
He isn't the type
who would do such a thing.

207
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,189
According to the criminal behavior
analysis team,

208
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,381
<i>when one accidentally kills someone</i>
<i>while extremely intoxicated,</i>

209
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:22,694
<i>a powerful defense mechanism</i>
<i>within them activates...</i>

210
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:26,528
<i>...and one goes through a blackout.</i>

211
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:28,761
<i>And they aren't able</i>
<i>to remember what they did.</i>

212
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:33,661
I went to the warehouse
around 10:30 p.m.

213
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:35,028
Hey!

214
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,136
And then what?

215
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:40,504
<i>You bastard got drunk,</i>
<i>went into the warehouse,</i>

216
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:43,661
and killed Shim Bo-yeong
and Park Da-eun there!

217
00:11:44,728 --> 00:11:46,994
I met with Da-eun at 11:30 p.m.

218
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:47,975
Da-eun.

219
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:49,593
Let go!

220
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:51,361
You're just trash.

221
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:56,106
I told you not to talk to me like that.

222
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,194
Did you kill them?

223
00:12:02,002 --> 00:12:03,802
I didn't kill them, Mom.

224
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:05,528
It was definitely not me.

225
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:07,094
You didn't kill them?

226
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:13,827
Mom.

227
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:15,461
What were you doing...

228
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:17,987
...when the girls were dying?

229
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:20,228
I don't know. I think I was sleeping.

230
00:12:20,228 --> 00:12:21,614
I have absolutely no...

231
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,327
Memory of what happened then.

232
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,861
I don't know, Mom.

233
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:32,061
Did you really...

234
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,261
Kill the girls?

235
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:39,594
I...

236
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:55,148
Mom.

237
00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:57,624
Mom!

238
00:12:58,328 --> 00:12:59,861
Mom!

239
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:02,961
Mom, what do I do?

240
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:04,828
Mom!

241
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:09,328
- Please take a step back.
- Let's get going.

242
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:10,661
- Move back.
- Please.

243
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:13,861
Hey, you should smack the head.

244
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:16,391
You said that's how you killed her.

245
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:17,761
Huh?

246
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,261
MONKEY WRENCH

247
00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:24,166
Dong-min!

248
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,594
- Dong-min.
- Reenact it the way you did it.

249
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:31,889
That's right.

250
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,433
You confessed that you hit her
like this several times.

251
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:38,194
- Bo-yeong...
- No, don't go.

252
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:43,165
You're no better than a dog!

253
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:44,928
- Bo-yeong.
- It wasn't me!

254
00:13:44,928 --> 00:13:47,961
- Where's my Bo-yeong?
- It wasn't me!

255
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,994
- It wasn't me.
- Kill him!

256
00:13:51,994 --> 00:13:53,828
- Out of the way.
- No!

257
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:56,594
- Hey!
- It wasn't me!

258
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:09,687
Have they still not found Bo-yeong?

259
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,128
No.

260
00:14:13,827 --> 00:14:14,961
What about Da-eun?

261
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:20,714
Coming in here...

262
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:24,880
I keep thinking about them.

263
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:30,628
<i>On the morning of the 20th,</i>

264
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:32,894
<i>Mucheon Police arrested</i>
<i>19-year-old Goh without a warrant...</i>

265
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:35,094
<i>...on suspicion of murder</i>
<i>of his two friends.</i>

266
00:14:35,294 --> 00:14:37,519
SUSPECT FOR TWO MURDERS ARRESTED
<i>Over 3 liters of blood...</i>

267
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,777
<i>...were discovered at the site.</i>

268
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:43,659
<i>The police assume that the victims</i>
<i>are most likely dead.</i>

269
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,861
<i>The police are looking...</i>

270
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:47,835
<i>...at the possibility of</i>
<i>the corpses being abandoned.</i>

271
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:50,483
THE DOCK
The accused is sentenced to 10 years.

272
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:52,394
Before the pronouncement
of judgment,

273
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:55,628
76 days of confinement
will be added to the sentence.

274
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:59,094
Considering the fact that the victims'
corpses haven't been discovered yet...

275
00:14:59,094 --> 00:15:02,461
...and that he hasn't been forgiven
by the families of the deceased,

276
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:05,161
it is only appropriate to impose
a severe punishment on the accused...

277
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:07,594
...that corresponds
to the gravity of his actions.

278
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:11,094
However, the accused has
no previous criminal records...

279
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:13,361
...and committed the act by accident...

280
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:15,413
...under the influence of alcohol...

281
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:19,228
I didn't kill them.
Please...

282
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,528
Bo-yeong and Da-eun.

283
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:22,761
Bo-yeong.

284
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:25,028
Da-eun.

285
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:38,594
Are you on a picnic or what,
you punk?

286
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:45,161
It's such a waste.

287
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:47,861
Pick it up and eat it.

288
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:06,761
Jeong-woo.

289
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:08,960
Is Geon-oh here too?

290
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:10,328
Why aren't Byeong-mu
and Min-su coming?

291
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:12,797
They might know that
I wasn't in the warehouse that night.

292
00:16:13,194 --> 00:16:15,494
I can't get in touch with them either,
Jeong-woo.

293
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:23,694
What do I do?

294
00:16:26,747 --> 00:16:28,314
What do I do, Deok-mi?

295
00:16:41,695 --> 00:16:42,961
<i>Goh Jeong-woo.</i>

296
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:46,790
<i>You're the one who killed</i>
<i>Bo-yeong and Da-eun.</i>

297
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:51,319
<i>In order to survive in here,</i>

298
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,622
<i>it has to be you who killed them!</i>

299
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:02,328
Jeong-woo.

300
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:03,703
Did they beat you?

301
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:09,673
It was nothing serious.

302
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:12,328
Jeong-woo...

303
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:17,820
At 11:30 p.m.

304
00:17:21,494 --> 00:17:22,428
Bo-yeong.

305
00:17:22,428 --> 00:17:24,528
Park Da-eun is a slut.
Park Da-eun is a slut!

306
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:25,587
It wasn't me.

307
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:28,487
- Oh, please.
- Park Da-eun is a slut.

308
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:32,359
<i>Jeong-woo.</i>

309
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,694
Please find me.

310
00:17:34,694 --> 00:17:36,228
Please find them.

311
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:38,361
Bo-yeong and Da-eun...

312
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:40,128
Hey, let go!

313
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:42,694
- Please...
- You're just trash!

314
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:45,594
<i>Goh Jeong-woo.</i>

315
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:48,061
Think.

316
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:50,428
Remember!

317
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,061
Remember!

318
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:54,186
Remember!

319
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:57,126
Please don't kill me.

320
00:17:57,594 --> 00:17:58,639
Please don't kill me.

321
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,228
- I told you to listen to me.
- I'm sorry.

322
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:06,064
Your father's funeral went well.

323
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:08,494
He died...

324
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:10,613
In peace.

325
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:13,294
It's all my fault.

326
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,067
Where's Mom?

327
00:18:19,928 --> 00:18:21,294
Right, your mom...

328
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:23,694
She's working.

329
00:18:23,694 --> 00:18:24,961
But you work as well, dad.

330
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,793
- Jeong-woo.
- Her son is a murderer,

331
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:30,928
so she must be terrified.

332
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:33,137
She wouldn't be able
to even look at my face.

333
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:36,794
Just be honest, Dad.

334
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:39,261
No, it's not that.

335
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,894
That's not the kind of person
your mom is.

336
00:18:41,894 --> 00:18:46,300
How can a mother not visit her son
for 6 years?

337
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:49,561
Say something.

338
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,476
Bring Mom here!

339
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:04,698
Hey, run!

340
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,860
<i>But, Uncle.</i>

341
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:13,927
<i>I still don't remember anything.</i>

342
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
<i>Even if you don't remember,</i>

343
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:20,094
<i>that doesn't mean that</i>
<i>what has already happened disappears...</i>

344
00:19:20,094 --> 00:19:21,961
<i>...or that your crime disappears.</i>

345
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:55,132
You harassed him so much that
he slit his wrist.

346
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,593
Are you crazy,
you good-for-nothing?

347
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:08,140
Are you crazy or what, you punk?

348
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,807
Go to hell, you punk.

349
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:14,094
- What are you doing?
- You bastard.

350
00:20:14,094 --> 00:20:15,428
- Just die.
- Come over here.

351
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:16,994
- Get up.
- Move.

352
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:18,361
I said, move!

353
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:19,967
This is one crazy bastard.

354
00:20:20,673 --> 00:20:23,007
You must have a death wish.

355
00:20:25,406 --> 00:20:26,450
You're laughing?

356
00:20:26,694 --> 00:20:27,860
How dare you laugh!

357
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:28,761
You trash.

358
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:29,761
Are you for real, you bastard?

359
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:33,408
This is a crazy bastard.

360
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:36,527
Darn it!

361
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:37,661
You son of a...

362
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,143
- You bastard!
- Let go!

363
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:44,036
Let go!

364
00:20:56,361 --> 00:20:58,103
You need to buy yourself
healthy food...

365
00:20:58,104 --> 00:21:00,037
...that's good for you.

366
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,180
This is the first payment I got.

367
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,493
It was a very important scene.

368
00:21:05,494 --> 00:21:06,794
It was a very emotional scene,

369
00:21:06,794 --> 00:21:08,734
where I was dazed
due to the death of my parents.

370
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,682
- Sure, let's do it.
- Yep, yep.

371
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:11,945
What are we doing?

372
00:21:11,946 --> 00:21:13,152
- I got tense.
- Go!

373
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:14,197
- Hey!
- Darn it.

374
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:15,298
What are we doing?

375
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,127
You are happy every day?

376
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,761
Extremely happy?

377
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:21,989
Just eat.

378
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,952
<i>I heard something.</i>

379
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:29,896
<i>And I was so curious</i>
<i>about who he was.</i>

380
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:31,527
<i>Have you been well?</i>

381
00:21:31,528 --> 00:21:33,494
You were here around Christmas.
You didn't need to come again.

382
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:35,419
The season has changed.

383
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,761
Didn't you say you were
shooting abroad?

384
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:40,066
I stayed abroad for around
a month and came back.

385
00:21:40,628 --> 00:21:44,593
<i>Jeong-woo, there's a street</i>
<i>in Paris called "Saint-Germain."</i>

386
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,877
<i>And the "Cafe de Flore" there</i>
<i>used to be Hemingway's haunt.</i>

387
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,060
<i>Back in 11th grade,</i>
<i>you wrote a book review...</i>

388
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:52,761
<i>...on "The Old Man and the Sea."</i>

389
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:53,902
<i>Do you remember that?</i>

390
00:21:54,894 --> 00:21:55,955
<i>Did I do that?</i>

391
00:21:56,761 --> 00:21:58,194
<i>It's almost the end.</i>

392
00:21:59,173 --> 00:22:00,285
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

393
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:16,834
Cut!

394
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,428
- Okay?
- Okay!

395
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:24,928
Thank you for your hard work.

396
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,994
- Thank you.
- You did a great job.

397
00:22:28,428 --> 00:22:29,494
Choi Na-gyeom.

398
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:31,128
Hand over the car keys.

399
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:32,328
What? The car keys?

400
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:34,460
Why? Where are you going?

401
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:36,493
- I'm taking a 3-day vacation.
- What?

402
00:22:36,494 --> 00:22:39,094
- Thank you!
- Hey, Choi Na-gyeom!

403
00:23:09,128 --> 00:23:11,861
Wow, that viper is getting out.

404
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:49,793
Goh Jeong-woo.

405
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,226
Oh, I'm not late.

406
00:23:59,594 --> 00:24:03,184
It must've been really tough.

407
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:05,637
I can't believe that you're
right in front of me.

408
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:08,961
You look even cooler outside.

409
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:10,394
You're talking nonsense.

410
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:12,528
Deok-mi.

411
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:15,028
Thanks.

412
00:24:15,228 --> 00:24:16,661
- Choi Na-gyeom.
- Oh!

413
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,959
- Sorry.
- I changed my name, remember?

414
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,227
I'm just so used to that name.

415
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,627
Is this what's trendy these days?

416
00:24:27,428 --> 00:24:29,161
I came here right after the shoot.

417
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:32,928
We'll have to go there first, right?

418
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:05,272
Get up.

419
00:25:08,261 --> 00:25:09,361
Get up.

420
00:25:09,361 --> 00:25:11,571
Look at me, you bastard.

421
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:13,328
Look at me, you bastard.

422
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:14,541
Look at me.

423
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:15,576
Look at me.

424
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:17,261
Look at me, you bastard.

425
00:25:17,894 --> 00:25:19,294
Look at me, you bastard.

426
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:24,417
Look at me.

427
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,404
You crazy punks, stop!

428
00:25:25,428 --> 00:25:27,194
- Stop it!
- Sang-cheol!

429
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:29,605
Let go!

430
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,694
Let go!

431
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:32,994
Let go!

432
00:25:32,994 --> 00:25:34,961
Come to your senses!

433
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:37,028
When are you going to stop doing that?

434
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,357
Damn it.

435
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:03,433
The suit fits you well.

436
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:07,661
You came to meet your father.

437
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:09,761
So it's nice to dress up like this.

438
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,255
- Thanks.
- Go and say hello.

439
00:26:20,528 --> 00:26:21,561
Let's go together.

440
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:28,820
Your father...

441
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:33,098
Insisted that his ashes
get scattered here.

442
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:35,237
This was his favorite spot.

443
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,194
We came here often.

444
00:27:11,077 --> 00:27:16,221
BUNGALOW NO. 6

445
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,628
Dad, we've been here
for 2 hours. Let's go home.

446
00:27:21,594 --> 00:27:22,661
Dad?

447
00:27:24,828 --> 00:27:25,847
Dad!

448
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:28,324
Captain!

449
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:29,928
Hey, be quiet.

450
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:31,661
The fish will all run away.

451
00:27:31,661 --> 00:27:33,194
I'm the one who wants to run away.

452
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:40,528
Just wait.

453
00:27:40,894 --> 00:27:42,894
Time will go by, anyway.

454
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,628
And a chance comes at least once.

455
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:52,828
Jeong-woo, it's here! Catch it!

456
00:27:53,194 --> 00:27:54,794
Wow, it's really strong.

457
00:27:57,828 --> 00:27:59,128
Wow, that's huge.

458
00:28:03,894 --> 00:28:05,061
I'm here.

459
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:14,828
I'm sorry.

460
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:18,076
Dad.

461
00:28:40,994 --> 00:28:42,794
NATIONAL TECHNICAL
QUALIFICATION CERTIFICATE

462
00:28:42,794 --> 00:28:44,832
Well done.

463
00:28:45,347 --> 00:28:46,494
Jeong-woo...

464
00:28:58,148 --> 00:29:00,728
CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY

465
00:29:00,728 --> 00:29:02,694
WARNING GIVEN BY MY FUTURE SELF

466
00:29:13,382 --> 00:29:15,215
You didn't have to come.

467
00:29:15,215 --> 00:29:17,815
- Why would you bring that?
- Give it to me.

468
00:29:19,082 --> 00:29:21,700
This is what you gave to me last time.

469
00:29:22,249 --> 00:29:23,882
If you take it easy...

470
00:29:23,882 --> 00:29:25,449
...and try to calm your mind a bit,

471
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:26,749
you'll be able to make a comeback.

472
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:28,449
This is what you call
a waste of manpower.

473
00:29:28,449 --> 00:29:31,649
A suspension of 2 months
would suffice, but you're exiled!

474
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:32,949
I'll get going.

475
00:29:34,282 --> 00:29:34,849
Goodbye.

476
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:35,849
- Bye.
- All right.

477
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:37,677
Stop by when you've got time.

478
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:38,812
- All right.
- I'll get going.

479
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:44,759
Good.

480
00:29:52,962 --> 00:29:57,998
MUCHEON GARDEN

481
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:00,552
You're here.

482
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:07,333
Come here.

483
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:09,771
Right.

484
00:30:10,949 --> 00:30:12,015
Sit down.

485
00:30:24,015 --> 00:30:25,048
My goodness.

486
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:26,449
Oh, dear.

487
00:30:28,082 --> 00:30:29,849
Auntie, here.

488
00:30:30,382 --> 00:30:32,248
Hold on tight.

489
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:52,715
The cut isn't that deep.

490
00:30:54,715 --> 00:30:57,715
You're wasting
your medical school training on me.

491
00:31:00,682 --> 00:31:02,582
Auntie, is something going on today?

492
00:31:03,382 --> 00:31:05,715
You look as if you've seen a ghost.

493
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:08,024
Nothing's going on.

494
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:11,675
You were fidgety all day today.

495
00:31:12,768 --> 00:31:14,314
There is definitely
something going on.

496
00:31:14,315 --> 00:31:15,415
There isn't.

497
00:31:16,548 --> 00:31:17,782
Thanks.

498
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,175
Could you pull over if it's possible?

499
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:54,415
I think I should get changed.

500
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:56,690
That suits you well,
so why would you?

501
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:58,315
I have to go meet Mom.

502
00:31:58,915 --> 00:32:00,509
I'm going to wear something
she bought for me.

503
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:09,348
Did you kill them?

504
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:11,468
Did you really...

505
00:32:14,214 --> 00:32:15,847
Kill the girls?

506
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:20,508
Are you okay?

507
00:32:36,307 --> 00:32:37,573
That bastard.

508
00:32:38,087 --> 00:32:39,320
I have to catch him.

509
00:33:02,306 --> 00:33:03,373
Lower your window.

510
00:33:06,806 --> 00:33:08,273
Lower it further.

511
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,083
A hit-and-run
and no license plate?

512
00:33:13,084 --> 00:33:15,409
Hey. I mean, sir...

513
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:17,706
I'm very sorry about that,
okay?

514
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:18,739
This is the police, get out.

515
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:20,573
- Mister, just let me go this time.
- Get out.

516
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:22,106
- What do you mean, sir?
- Just once... I apologize.

517
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:23,973
- I'm a policeman, not a mister. Hey!
- Just let me go this once.

518
00:33:25,332 --> 00:33:26,720
Hey, hey!

519
00:33:30,096 --> 00:33:31,873
- Darn him...
- I'll go to him.

520
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:34,354
Don't get out.

521
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:39,533
Mr. Soccer Player.

522
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:42,839
Hey, look here.

523
00:33:46,073 --> 00:33:48,006
You just drove into that car
and ran away.

524
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:49,692
No, that's not it.

525
00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:51,738
It was a chain-reaction collision,
so let's catch that car first.

526
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:53,273
You get what I'm saying?

527
00:33:53,673 --> 00:33:55,473
Did you have a pint
after soccer club?

528
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,439
Your car reeks of alcohol.

529
00:33:59,582 --> 00:34:01,206
Oh, I didn't drink that...

530
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,926
Sorry, but I didn't see anything.

531
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:05,106
You can't just crash a car
and run away.

532
00:34:05,106 --> 00:34:06,239
Let's get this taken care of.

533
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:08,893
- Get out.
- This is so frustrating.

534
00:34:11,029 --> 00:34:12,129
Hey.

535
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,073
Look here.

536
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:17,039
I'm not a soccer club member
but a policeman, all right?

537
00:34:23,873 --> 00:34:26,673
I didn't want to say this, but...

538
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,306
Do you know about
the major crime unit?

539
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:30,873
The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency
Major Crime Unit.

540
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:32,139
- So what?
- What...

541
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:35,500
Anyone can drink and drive
and cause a hit-and-run.

542
00:34:37,686 --> 00:34:40,535
Just give me your number.
I'll call the insurance company.

543
00:34:44,552 --> 00:34:45,719
All right, just give it here!

544
00:34:47,473 --> 00:34:49,406
Seriously.

545
00:34:49,406 --> 00:34:50,873
Oh, for real?

546
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:53,573
The police are good-for-nothing
in this country.

547
00:34:53,702 --> 00:34:55,490
Here. You happy now?

548
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:03,739
ASSEMBLYWOMAN OF MUCHEON,
YE YEONG-SIL

549
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:05,774
THE CENTER OF GYEONGGI-DO!
THE CENTER OF THE WORLD!

550
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:36,090
MUCHEON POLICE STATION

551
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,273
Let's go.

552
00:35:55,406 --> 00:35:58,118
Ugh, I should hang in there.

553
00:36:01,032 --> 00:36:02,962
- Hey, Byeong-mu.
- Yes?

554
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:04,858
Did you hear the news?

555
00:36:05,252 --> 00:36:06,905
About the new team head
who's coming tomorrow...

556
00:36:06,906 --> 00:36:07,980
He's coming here
because he caused trouble.

557
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:09,081
What trouble?

558
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:10,958
Assault.

559
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:13,798
Supposedly, he beats people
to a pulp like a gangster would.

560
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:16,374
Oh, come on. Look at the world
we're living in now.

561
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,642
We can't even hit criminals
without a reason.

562
00:36:19,273 --> 00:36:21,073
That's why he was sent to the country.

563
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:22,406
He's skilled, but he's got a bad temper,

564
00:36:22,406 --> 00:36:24,308
so the Major Crime Unit sent him here.

565
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:26,372
That can't be true.

566
00:36:26,373 --> 00:36:27,739
It just might be true.

567
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:31,786
So what's the truth?

568
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,073
- Geez.
- Hello.

569
00:36:34,073 --> 00:36:35,506
Come on in.

570
00:36:42,105 --> 00:36:43,105
Hey.

571
00:36:44,406 --> 00:36:46,006
Now, attention!

572
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:50,939
This is Inspector Noh Sang-cheol from...

573
00:36:50,939 --> 00:36:52,555
...the SMPA Major Crime Unit.

574
00:36:52,556 --> 00:36:54,589
His official first day is tomorrow,

575
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,057
but he's here to say hello
in advance.

576
00:36:58,211 --> 00:36:59,818
I figured it'd be better
to meet my teammates...

577
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:03,347
...than to stay at home,
so I came by to introduce myself.

578
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:07,020
Wow, look at his attitude.

579
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,239
His skills are even better.

580
00:37:09,476 --> 00:37:11,006
He already managed a case.

581
00:37:11,006 --> 00:37:12,586
On the way here...

582
00:37:12,587 --> 00:37:15,072
He caught a hit-and-run driver
without a license...

583
00:37:15,073 --> 00:37:17,573
...and handed him over
to the Traffic Division.

584
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,271
You all know about this.

585
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:23,105
The arrest of all Bulsapa Gang members
in 2012.

586
00:37:23,106 --> 00:37:26,073
The murder case of the elderly couple
in Mawon-gu in 2013.

587
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:28,074
He's the type...

588
00:37:28,075 --> 00:37:31,299
...that just dives in head first.

589
00:37:32,112 --> 00:37:33,878
Oh! Wow.

590
00:37:34,173 --> 00:37:35,506
He's like a stallion.

591
00:37:36,769 --> 00:37:38,839
Anyway, he will be...

592
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,806
...the team head of Team 2 starting today,

593
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:42,938
so be nice to him.

594
00:37:42,939 --> 00:37:44,939
I look forward to working with you.

595
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,307
I'm in your hands!

596
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:47,941
I'm in your hands!

597
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,717
Now, let's go and say hello
to the Police Chief.

598
00:37:52,718 --> 00:37:54,313
Oh, he's out of office right now.

599
00:37:54,726 --> 00:37:56,626
- What?
- Because of Su-oh.

600
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:09,409
Son.

601
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:12,305
What are you doing? Get out.

602
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,986
Well done.

603
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,365
Let's take your medicine
before taking a break.

604
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:21,872
Su-oh.

605
00:38:24,606 --> 00:38:26,399
- This must be taken twice a day.
- Yes, sir.

606
00:38:32,139 --> 00:38:33,573
Good job.

607
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:37,335
This is...

608
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,026
...a present I'm giving you for taking
your medicine well for a month.

609
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:05,011
- Will you go in?
- What?

610
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:07,192
Will you be all right?

611
00:39:13,439 --> 00:39:14,506
I honestly don't understand...

612
00:39:14,506 --> 00:39:17,606
...why you want to come back here.

613
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,005
You know how it is.

614
00:39:20,512 --> 00:39:22,546
You can't live here anymore.

615
00:39:25,306 --> 00:39:26,339
True...

616
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:32,165
Mom might not recognize me.

617
00:39:33,826 --> 00:39:36,093
She didn't visit me once
for the past decade.

618
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:40,439
- Jeong-woo.
- I'm not too sure.

619
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:41,606
I just don't know.

620
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:45,265
But I thought I had to see
Mom's face upon my release.

621
00:39:45,906 --> 00:39:47,393
I will have to see her face to find out...

622
00:39:47,394 --> 00:39:50,473
...how I'll live and what I should do
from now on.

623
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:52,532
No, it's all over.

624
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:57,869
Forget it. Just forget what happened.

625
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,245
Forget it.

626
00:40:11,665 --> 00:40:12,999
Thanks for today.

627
00:40:14,534 --> 00:40:15,600
Oh, right.

628
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:19,626
I'll call you.

629
00:41:14,591 --> 00:41:16,411
MUCHEON GARDEN

630
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,738
Chu-ho, are you nearly finished?

631
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:31,551
Come in here,
we should share a drink.

632
00:41:31,552 --> 00:41:33,552
It's almost finished. Go on in first.

633
00:41:33,553 --> 00:41:34,820
- Come in.
- All right.

634
00:41:36,882 --> 00:41:39,476
CONGRATULATIONS ON JEONG-WOO'S
ACCEPTANCE TO MEDICAL SCHOOL

635
00:41:44,945 --> 00:41:46,283
- Jeong-woo.
- Yes?

636
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:47,884
Congratulations, have a glass.

637
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:49,305
That's okay.

638
00:41:50,206 --> 00:41:51,325
Congratulations.

639
00:41:54,758 --> 00:41:56,925
- That's too much.
- Bottoms up.

640
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:01,341
Wow, he's a good drinker.

641
00:42:02,173 --> 00:42:03,439
You punk.

642
00:42:03,547 --> 00:42:05,173
- You shouldn't drink alcohol.
- He gave it to me.

643
00:42:05,173 --> 00:42:07,306
- Why would you give him alcohol?
- It's fine.

644
00:42:08,252 --> 00:42:10,960
- Did you get the alcohol?
- We'll get caught.

645
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:12,432
Geon-oh.

646
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:14,166
- You'll get the alcohol, right?
- Yeah.

647
00:42:15,425 --> 00:42:18,392
Bring that new student who lives
in the rooftop house as well.

648
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:19,606
Hurry up.

649
00:42:19,606 --> 00:42:21,059
Eat your fill.

650
00:42:27,672 --> 00:42:30,561
Excuse me, my mom says
you should come and eat.

651
00:42:33,286 --> 00:42:34,286
What is it?

652
00:42:46,486 --> 00:42:48,457
My mom says you should
come and eat.

653
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,076
Hello.

654
00:43:03,852 --> 00:43:06,089
Sir, the restaurant is that way.

655
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,496
MUCHEON GARDEN

656
00:43:24,692 --> 00:43:25,792
Hey!

657
00:43:27,325 --> 00:43:28,458
Hey!

658
00:43:34,286 --> 00:43:35,386
Ugh, this is salty!

659
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:37,677
Do you expect me to eat this crap?

660
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,473
You did this on purpose, right?

661
00:43:40,654 --> 00:43:42,273
Why would I do that?

662
00:43:42,273 --> 00:43:44,338
Why are you talking informally
to a customer?

663
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:45,439
Are we close?

664
00:43:49,638 --> 00:43:50,739
Sorry.

665
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:52,263
That must have been a bit bland.

666
00:43:52,264 --> 00:43:55,531
Oh...
You're saying I did this on purpose.

667
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:56,538
Are you messing with me now?

668
00:43:56,539 --> 00:43:58,273
Do you think I did this on purpose?

669
00:44:00,046 --> 00:44:01,343
I'll cook it again and bring it
to you.

670
00:44:01,344 --> 00:44:02,943
You should have done that
in the first place.

671
00:44:09,352 --> 00:44:10,352
Come on.

672
00:44:10,805 --> 00:44:13,238
Watch where you're going.

673
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:14,306
I'll do it.

674
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:18,245
Hey! Who are you to help her?

675
00:44:18,246 --> 00:44:19,712
Why would you clean that up?

676
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:21,275
Get inside.

677
00:44:45,273 --> 00:44:46,350
Mom.

678
00:44:58,039 --> 00:44:59,148
You punk.

679
00:45:01,606 --> 00:45:04,206
How dare you show your face here?

680
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:06,705
You bastard.

681
00:45:06,706 --> 00:45:08,506
How could you do that
to my daughter?

682
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,840
Where did you put my daughter
after killing her?

683
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:20,790
I should give her a funeral,
you bastard.

684
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:24,103
Can't you just tell me
where she is?

685
00:45:27,505 --> 00:45:28,938
Tell me.

686
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:31,372
Tell me where my daughter is!

687
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,032
Think.

688
00:45:36,418 --> 00:45:38,185
Think, you bastard!

689
00:45:39,712 --> 00:45:40,845
You!

690
00:45:41,273 --> 00:45:43,173
You stay out of my sight!

691
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,616
Or else, I'll kill both you
and your mother!

692
00:45:54,406 --> 00:45:55,494
Mom.

693
00:45:59,473 --> 00:46:00,441
I want to live with...

694
00:46:00,442 --> 00:46:02,414
So today was the day of your release.

695
00:46:04,006 --> 00:46:05,706
You can't live here.

696
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,206
Even though you've served your sentence,

697
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:12,070
you can't atone for your crime.

698
00:46:19,306 --> 00:46:20,671
I'm sorry.

699
00:46:21,426 --> 00:46:23,826
Never let that thought leave you
as long as you live.

700
00:46:26,473 --> 00:46:28,919
I'm going to stay here until I die...

701
00:46:31,259 --> 00:46:33,298
Since my son is a criminal.

702
00:46:44,759 --> 00:46:47,448
- Mom.
- The moment you became a murderer,

703
00:46:48,446 --> 00:46:50,712
you stopped being my son.

704
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:12,020
Don't you dare step foot
in this place ever again.

705
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:14,474
Nobody welcomes you here.

706
00:47:37,412 --> 00:47:39,757
MUCHEON BUK-RO 2-GIL,
IGO VEGETABLE BLOOD SAUSAGES

707
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,873
This place will be a bit boring.

708
00:47:43,873 --> 00:47:47,673
Isn't it a good thing
if a detective is bored?

709
00:47:47,673 --> 00:47:49,235
Mucheon, the city without crimes.

710
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:50,372
Seriously!

711
00:47:50,373 --> 00:47:53,106
This is the place of my dreams!

712
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,373
There are petty criminals, though.

713
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,006
Yes, there are a lot.

714
00:47:57,006 --> 00:47:59,573
There are so many thieves
and happy slappers these days.

715
00:47:59,573 --> 00:48:01,929
- They are a pain.
- Right.

716
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:04,575
Geez, that was uncalled for.

717
00:48:04,576 --> 00:48:07,342
Let's keep this vibe
and go for round two.

718
00:48:09,406 --> 00:48:10,831
I got a missed call.

719
00:48:10,832 --> 00:48:12,299
I should go back to the station.

720
00:48:12,672 --> 00:48:13,805
Violent Crime Team 2.

721
00:48:13,806 --> 00:48:15,806
- Go easy.
- Go easy.

722
00:48:15,807 --> 00:48:17,474
- Go easy.
- All right.

723
00:48:31,685 --> 00:48:32,740
Goh Jeong-woo?

724
00:48:33,852 --> 00:48:35,485
Hey, Jeong-woo!

725
00:48:35,486 --> 00:48:36,486
Goh Jeong-woo!

726
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:38,375
Wow, Jeong-woo!

727
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:43,905
Hey, well done.

728
00:48:44,711 --> 00:48:47,278
No, I mean, it's nice to see you.

729
00:48:48,939 --> 00:48:50,239
That came out wrong.

730
00:48:51,418 --> 00:48:53,324
What should I say in a situation
like this?

731
00:48:56,873 --> 00:48:58,039
Have you been well?

732
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:04,205
Hey, is there anything you want to do?

733
00:49:04,206 --> 00:49:06,272
How about we go downtown
and get drinks?

734
00:49:06,273 --> 00:49:07,706
I don't drink.

735
00:49:09,692 --> 00:49:11,553
Oh, I must be crazy.
You got drunk and caused...

736
00:49:12,326 --> 00:49:14,126
Jeong-woo, I must be really insane.

737
00:49:14,308 --> 00:49:16,173
How about you just hit me once?

738
00:49:16,173 --> 00:49:17,606
Come on. Just hit me.

739
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:21,473
COP

740
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:25,811
You just saved me.

741
00:49:26,192 --> 00:49:27,792
Guess who I'm with right now.

742
00:49:28,245 --> 00:49:29,406
Hold on a sec.

743
00:49:30,506 --> 00:49:32,618
Jeong-woo, it's Byeong-mu.

744
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:39,345
- Hey.
- Darn it.

745
00:49:40,585 --> 00:49:42,285
You punk.

746
00:49:43,952 --> 00:49:46,985
Wow, you really are Jeong-woo.

747
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,452
Hey, we should meet.

748
00:49:51,018 --> 00:49:52,452
No. You know...

749
00:49:52,845 --> 00:49:54,645
You should come downtown right now.

750
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,585
Yes, I'll be done with work soon.

751
00:49:58,206 --> 00:49:59,239
All right!

752
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:05,205
I'm sorry.

753
00:50:05,206 --> 00:50:06,833
Byeong-mu says we should
come downtown.

754
00:50:07,506 --> 00:50:08,825
Oh, we can take the bus here.

755
00:50:10,645 --> 00:50:13,845
After your dad passed, your mom
put Mucheon Garden up for sale.

756
00:50:14,192 --> 00:50:16,011
My dad bought it by taking out a loan...

757
00:50:16,373 --> 00:50:19,666
...and your mom begged to let her
keep working in the kitchen.

758
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:22,805
My parents were a bit uncomfortable
with that, of course.

759
00:50:22,806 --> 00:50:25,062
But your mom begged them so much that...

760
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,796
...my father caved in...

761
00:50:30,306 --> 00:50:33,173
Anyway, you haven't changed a bit.

762
00:50:33,173 --> 00:50:34,373
You're exactly the same.

763
00:50:35,326 --> 00:50:36,459
How could you...

764
00:50:37,352 --> 00:50:39,304
...not visit me even once for 10 years?

765
00:50:40,351 --> 00:50:42,524
I had a lot of things to take care of.

766
00:50:42,525 --> 00:50:44,305
After that happened to you,
Byeong-mu and I...

767
00:50:44,306 --> 00:50:46,731
...enlisted in the army together
and served there for 2 years.

768
00:50:46,732 --> 00:50:48,072
After our discharge,
we went to college.

769
00:50:48,073 --> 00:50:50,086
And after our graduation,
we made preparations to get jobs.

770
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:53,931
Hey, I'm an emergency room nurse.

771
00:50:53,932 --> 00:50:56,765
Working three shifts is just too hard.

772
00:50:56,766 --> 00:50:58,064
It's all on me today.

773
00:50:59,739 --> 00:51:01,020
That jerk is at it again.

774
00:51:01,044 --> 00:51:02,144
Darn it!

775
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:04,751
Hey, you crazy?

776
00:51:04,752 --> 00:51:06,285
What are you looking at?
Look down, will you?

777
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:07,427
What are you glaring at?

778
00:51:07,428 --> 00:51:08,772
Oh, we're sorry.

779
00:51:08,773 --> 00:51:09,931
- Sorry.
- Hey.

780
00:51:09,932 --> 00:51:11,362
What are you doing?
Don't waste your energy and go.

781
00:51:11,363 --> 00:51:13,296
- He's snickering.
- Let's go.

782
00:51:13,585 --> 00:51:15,500
- Crazy bastard.
- We apologize.

783
00:51:18,253 --> 00:51:21,319
Just ignore him. It's all on me.

784
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,632
Let's just go.

785
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:24,984
Hey, over there!

786
00:51:33,985 --> 00:51:35,185
Let's go!

787
00:51:44,749 --> 00:51:46,158
Let's wait for the police.

788
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:47,557
Min-su, call the police.

789
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:50,441
Byeong-mu, come here quickly.
There's a fight going on.

790
00:51:52,102 --> 00:51:53,503
What's with you lot?

791
00:51:53,504 --> 00:51:55,661
You're nothing but a bully.

792
00:51:56,036 --> 00:51:57,392
Ugh, darn it!

793
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,414
You bastard!

794
00:52:04,436 --> 00:52:05,736
Stop, you bastard!

795
00:52:05,736 --> 00:52:07,416
Hey! Stop right there!

796
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:08,833
Are you all right?

797
00:52:09,868 --> 00:52:12,209
They went after them,
so they'll get caught soon.

798
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:13,536
Ugh, I'm screwed.

799
00:52:13,536 --> 00:52:16,432
It was really hard to catch
those happy slappers.

800
00:52:16,702 --> 00:52:19,369
- We got them thanks to you, sir.
- Oh, really?

801
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,636
- Yes, thank you.
- All right.

802
00:52:22,269 --> 00:52:23,902
Hey, Jeong-woo!

803
00:52:24,169 --> 00:52:25,261
Hey!

804
00:52:28,136 --> 00:52:30,302
The police chief wants to meet you.

805
00:52:30,302 --> 00:52:31,422
Let's go.

806
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,948
You're a real police officer.

807
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:38,659
I'll see you tomorrow.

808
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,927
All right. Bye.

809
00:52:42,802 --> 00:52:45,035
- How long has it been?
- Is Min-su gone?

810
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,197
That loser ran away.

811
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:50,536
Auntie, is he really your son?

812
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:53,774
Did your son go to prison
and get released today?

813
00:52:53,775 --> 00:52:56,641
Is that why you were
in a daze all day?

814
00:52:57,336 --> 00:52:59,236
You should just say it
if things are hard.

815
00:52:59,236 --> 00:53:00,569
Otherwise, you'll end up
with a heartache.

816
00:53:00,569 --> 00:53:01,902
Why aren't you working?

817
00:53:03,036 --> 00:53:04,136
I'm sorry.

818
00:53:04,896 --> 00:53:07,919
I mean, I was just worried
about you.

819
00:53:10,969 --> 00:53:12,289
So you're leaving tomorrow?

820
00:53:12,864 --> 00:53:13,969
Yeah.

821
00:53:15,188 --> 00:53:16,448
With your mom?

822
00:53:17,422 --> 00:53:18,515
No.

823
00:53:19,668 --> 00:53:21,290
- Jeong-woo.
- Yeah?

824
00:53:21,835 --> 00:53:24,635
Call me whenever
you're having a hard time.

825
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,123
I'll help you in whichever way I can.

826
00:53:29,002 --> 00:53:30,002
Thanks.

827
00:53:31,269 --> 00:53:33,901
Ugh, this feels weird.

828
00:53:33,902 --> 00:53:36,242
You helped me all the time
when we were young.

829
00:53:40,494 --> 00:53:42,374
Come to your senses, you bastard!

830
00:53:43,348 --> 00:53:46,568
You killed Shim Bo-yeong
and Park Da-eun!

831
00:53:46,569 --> 00:53:49,836
The monkey wrench assumed to be
the murder weapon was discovered.

832
00:53:49,836 --> 00:53:52,602
Did you kill Shim Bo-yeong,
your friend, in the warehouse?

833
00:54:01,469 --> 00:54:03,136
- Jeong-woo.
- Yes?

834
00:54:03,136 --> 00:54:05,036
I'm so forgetful these days.

835
00:54:05,036 --> 00:54:06,902
I had forgotten about
your release date.

836
00:54:08,669 --> 00:54:10,572
- Jeong-woo.
- Yes?

837
00:54:10,573 --> 00:54:12,201
Remember what I told you before?

838
00:54:12,202 --> 00:54:13,802
That if anything happens to you,

839
00:54:14,002 --> 00:54:16,339
think of me as your father
and come to me.

840
00:54:20,202 --> 00:54:21,936
Try contacting them.

841
00:54:23,169 --> 00:54:25,660
You need to live a diligent life now,
especially for your mother's sake.

You should go to Seoul.

You should take your mother

Let's start anew in another place,
Mom.

00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:16,421
Let's go together.

871
00:57:16,422 --> 00:57:18,423
I'm going to stay here.

872
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,049
You should leave.

873
00:57:21,764 --> 00:57:22,902
You're still young.

874
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:29,711
I don't know what I should do
from now on...

875
00:57:31,129 --> 00:57:33,362
...and what kind of a life I must lead.

876
00:57:34,709 --> 00:57:37,109
I can't do anything without you, Mom.

877
00:57:38,702 --> 00:57:40,034
That's okay.

878
00:57:40,502 --> 00:57:42,402
What you're experiencing
right now is nothing.

879
00:57:43,275 --> 00:57:45,941
- I'm okay.
- You're not okay.

880
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:48,629
I'm the one who committed
the crime,

881
00:57:48,955 --> 00:57:50,855
so why should you live like this,
Mom?

882
00:57:52,388 --> 00:57:54,155
Dad is not with us anymore.

883
00:58:02,102 --> 00:58:03,736
I missed you so much...

884
00:58:03,736 --> 00:58:06,069
...but you didn't visit me even once
for the past 10 years.

885
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:10,836
Did you stay here like this
because of me?

886
00:58:18,687 --> 00:58:20,164
There are people
who still haven't found...

887
00:58:20,165 --> 00:58:22,598
...their children's bodies
even after 10 years.

888
00:58:24,336 --> 00:58:26,736
They live in hell right now.

889
00:58:29,541 --> 00:58:31,408
You should leave this place.

890
00:58:32,336 --> 00:58:35,373
And don't ever come back here.
That's what you need to do.

- Have you been well?
- Yes.

898
01:00:06,075 --> 01:00:08,056
- Did you come here to give me this?
- Yes.

899
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:12,412
- Have you kept up with your drawing?
- Yes.

900
01:00:16,814 --> 01:00:18,436
You should come in...

901
01:00:18,436 --> 01:00:19,576
Su-oh.

902
01:00:25,069 --> 01:00:26,437
Su-oh, thanks.

903
01:00:28,902 --> 01:00:30,137
This is prime beef brisket.

904
01:01:12,062 --> 01:01:13,402
<i>You're no better than a dog!</i>

905
01:01:13,402 --> 01:01:14,936
<i>Hey, you should smack the head.</i>

906
01:01:14,936 --> 01:01:16,869
<i>You said that's how you killed her.</i>

907
01:01:16,869 --> 01:01:19,736
<i>My daughter! Where's my Bo-yeong?</i>

908
01:01:19,736 --> 01:01:21,919
<i>- Kill him.</i>
<i>- You Bastard!</i>

909
01:02:38,975 --> 01:02:42,624
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

910
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,592
<i>It doesn't seem to be an accident</i>
<i>or a suicide attempt.</i>

911
01:02:44,592 --> 01:02:46,412
<i>Someone could have pushed her...</i>

912
01:02:46,412 --> 01:02:48,468
<i>...or perhaps there was</i>
<i>a physical altercation.</i>

913
01:02:48,468 --> 01:02:51,130
<i>Show me what the Major Crime Unit</i>
<i>can do.</i>

914
01:02:51,926 --> 01:02:53,801
<i>I'm going to find the person...</i>

915
01:02:53,801 --> 01:02:55,476
<i>...who did that to mom.</i>

916
01:02:55,476 --> 01:02:57,348
<i>Isn't everyone here so strange?</i>

917
01:02:57,348 --> 01:02:59,448
<i>Nobody looks concerned.</i>

918
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:01,184
<i>But think about Jeong-woo.</i>

919
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:02,650
<i>No one can't take her side.</i>

920
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:06,589
<i>Why is this person running</i>
<i>when it's raining?</i>

921
01:03:07,745 --> 01:03:09,257
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

922
01:03:09,946 --> 01:03:12,046
<i>You know the person caught on</i>
<i>the security camera, don't you?</i>

923
01:03:13,881 --> 01:03:15,101
<i>You went onto the overpass, right?</i>

924
01:03:15,101 --> 01:03:17,351
<i>Did you push Ms. Jeong Geum-hee</i>
<i>from the overpass?</i>

925
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,852
<i>Mr. Yang, did you</i>
<i>do that to my mom?</i>

926
01:03:20,654 --> 01:03:23,746
<i>You should have pushed me</i>
<i>and not my mom!</i>
