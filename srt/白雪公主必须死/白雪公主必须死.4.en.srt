00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,560
That was fast.

5
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,008
Hey, wait, wait.

6
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:31,308
- Wait, wait.
- Hey, that hurts.

7
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:34,140
Wait a minute.

8
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:35,074
No.

9
00:00:35,074 --> 00:00:36,808
Wait.

10
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:38,834
Bo-yeong, Da-eun.

11
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:43,289
Goh Jeong-woo, it's been a while.

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,856
Jeong-woo...

13
00:00:44,863 --> 00:00:46,660
Does it feel good to be
grown up all by yourself?

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,899
Are you happy?

15
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:54,441
You haven't forgotten about us,
have you?

16
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:56,526
Don't forget about us.

17
00:00:56,527 --> 00:00:58,627
You have to find us.

19
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:23,208
Yes, we'll be right there.

20
00:01:24,674 --> 00:01:26,008
- Hey!
- Yes.

21
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:28,341
Hey, what's going on here?

22
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:29,874
What do you mean
a body was discovered?

23
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:31,808
Sure it's not a prank?

24
00:01:31,808 --> 00:01:34,808
The body had a nametag
with Shim Bo-yeong on it.

25
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:36,973
- What?
- Shim Bo-yeong.

26
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:39,466
We'll need a thorough analysis
to know for sure.

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,485
Shim Bo-yeong?

28
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:45,874
Hey! What are you waiting for?

29
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:49,567
Call everyone here
who can mobilize with Forensics!

30
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,474
They're already ready to go.

31
00:01:51,474 --> 00:01:53,908
Oh... Good job.

32
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:56,541
The chief! Chief!

33
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:04,657
Housekeeper.

34
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,292
Housekeeper, are you awake?

35
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,058
Oh, yes.

36
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:09,792
What's going on so early in the morning?

37
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,625
Right.

38
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,883
Make sure Su-oh takes his medicine
as soon as he wakes up.

39
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,184
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

40
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:21,784
Yeah, I'm almost there. Hurry over here.

41
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:24,563
That sly bastard.

42
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:32,971
Get up.

43
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:37,831
What?

44
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:39,565
They found her.

45
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:41,765
Found who?

46
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:43,585
They found Bo-yeong.

47
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:50,751
Jeong-suk.

48
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,183
What did you just say?

49
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:56,459
They found Bo-yeong.

50
00:02:57,983 --> 00:02:59,366
Bo-yeong?

51
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:02,695
My Bo-yeong?

52
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:07,796
Where is she?

53
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,850
Huh?

54
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:13,189
Where's Bo-yeong?

55
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:28,904
Bo-yeong...

56
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,168
You trying to destroy the evidence?

57
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:34,716
Don't you even dare
lay a finger on that!

58
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:37,288
Hey, look straight into my eyes.

59
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:39,701
<i>Jeong-woo...</i>

60
00:03:42,183 --> 00:03:43,753

<i>Jeong-woo...</i>

62
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,016
Goh Jeong-woo, get a hold of yourself.

63
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:49,116
Get a hold of yourself!

64
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:50,716
Goh Jeong-woo, you bastard!

65
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:52,283
Goh Jeong-woo, get a hold of yourself!

66
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:54,283
She needs to be found!

67
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,100
<i>Thank you for finding me, Jeong-woo.</i>

68
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,616
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,283
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:17,250
I'm sorry...

71
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,983
Can things get resolved
if you just say you're sorry?

72
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:22,350
Can anything get resolved that way?

73
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,003
Huh? Can anything
get resolved that way?

74
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:30,383
Damn it.
She's already dead.

75
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:31,850
She's already dead!

76
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,850
You killed her, you bastard!

77
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,916
You bastard, you!

78
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:38,416
You killed her.

79
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,350
Shoot!

80
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,216
Shoot!

81
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,583
I've begged over and over for 10 years.

82
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,274
To let me find Bo-yeong and Da-eun.

83
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:48,983
You're going to keep this up
to the end...

84
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,445
But it wasn't me.

85
00:04:52,983 --> 00:04:54,446
It wasn't me.

86
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,845
It wasn't me.

87
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:08,278
CHEONSU ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

88
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:19,471
Please catch the killer, please.

89
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:22,114
Please...

90
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:26,003
You bastard.

91
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:29,526
Team Head!

92
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:33,434
Damn it!

93
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,926
Team Head Noh!

94
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:39,484
- Yes, I'm down here.
- Right.

95
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:41,684
Send the Forensics Team first.

96
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:43,317
And search through the whole school.

97
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:44,897
Yes, sir!

98
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:50,417
We only have one body so far.

99
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,206
Search Team!

100
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:54,484
- Are you all right?
- Search Team!

101
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:56,084
Shim Bo-yeong.

102
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:58,484
That's the girl who died
10 years ago, right?

103
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:00,951
Right. Did you see her?

104
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:02,784
I saw the nametag.

105
00:06:02,784 --> 00:06:04,584
Along with her school uniform
and bones.

106
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:06,751
Shim Bo-yeong

107
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:18,226
Get up.

108
00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:19,717
Grab him.

109
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:21,384
Team Head, I...

110
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:27,360
Police Chief,

111
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:30,361
I will personally conduct
a witness interview.

112
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:32,271
Excuse me.

113
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:33,805
Do you agree to a witness interview?

114
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:35,573
Oh... Yes, sure.

115
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:38,740
Then please come to the police station
later with our team.

116
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:40,251
Jeong-woo.

117
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,326
Are you all right?

118
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:45,784
Follow me.

119
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:02,517
SHIM BO-YEONG

120
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:06,717
Where's my daughter?
Where's my daughter?

121
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,217
Bo-yeong!

122
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:10,417
Bo-yeong, it's your mom.

123
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:11,883
- Bo-yeong...
- Ma'am.

124
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:13,600
Let go of me.

125
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,468
I need to check whether
she's my daughter.

126
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,235
Calm down.

127
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:22,349
Bo-yeong, your mom is here.

128
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,683
Calm down, all right?
Bo-yeong's mom.

129
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:26,084
Calm down.

130
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:28,584
They must do an investigation first.

131
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:29,617
So please wait at home.

132
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:33,203
Why was my Bo-yeong abandoned here?

133
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:36,584
Why here of all places?
Bo-yeong, mommy...

134
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,536
Why was she left in a place like this?

135
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:44,812
Bo-yeong's mother.

136
00:07:45,212 --> 00:07:47,372
It took us too long to find Bo-yeong.

137
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:51,358
I apologize as the one in charge
of the investigation back then.

138
00:07:53,797 --> 00:07:56,151
Why was she left here?

139
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:05,732
Bo-yeong!

140
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:08,817
You saw her, didn't you?

141
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:11,484
You saw Bo-yeong, didn't you? Did you?

142
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,415
My daughter would have been...

143
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,211
...as pretty as you, had she lived.

144
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:22,100
I want to see.

145
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,068
I want to see Bo-yeong!

146
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:27,645
- Emergency services!
- Bo-yeong's mom!

147
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:29,113
Out of the way, please.

148
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:46,806
Don't go to the police station,
but to the Mucheon Village warehouse.

149
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:48,504
What? Why?

150
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,728
We have to make him remember.

151
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:02,117
Get out.

152
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:03,281
Be on standby here.

153
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:05,148
You're dead if you follow me inside.

154
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:10,336
Get in.

155
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:15,289
Come here.

156
00:09:23,523 --> 00:09:24,189
Right here!

157
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,023
This is where your friend,
Shim Bo-yeong, died.

158
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:32,123
And right here!

159
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:34,156
This is where your girlfriend,
Park Da-eun,

160
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,123
was struck repeatedly with a spanner
until she died.

161
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:38,924
Do you not remember that, either?

162
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:46,882
I...

163
00:09:51,743 --> 00:09:55,243
...did that to Bo-yeong and Da-eun,
my friends...

164
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:05,962
Here?

165
00:10:08,562 --> 00:10:09,927
Da-eun,

166
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:13,926
I'm going to kill you,
so shut your mouth.

167
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:18,523
Like this, like this, like this.

168
00:10:18,523 --> 00:10:21,511
Like this! Like this!

169
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,989
That's how I killed her, right?

170
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:32,988
But I didn't kill them.

171
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,455
I definitely didn't kill them.

172
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:36,756
What?

173
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:41,356
Have you got no conscience at all?

174
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:45,856
I wasn't here when it happened.

175
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:47,808
You bastard!

176
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:59,776
Please help me.

177
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,989
Please catch the killer.

178
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:03,889
Please save me.

179
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:05,754
Please catch the culprit, help me out.

180
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:07,175
Why you...

181
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:08,728
Hey, you!

182
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,783
You can kill me after...

183
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:12,827
...you find the culprit...

184
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:14,946
...who killed
Bo-yeong and Da-eun.

185
00:11:17,364 --> 00:11:18,944
Damn it.

186
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,412
It wasn't me.

187
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,565
If I was wrongfully accused...

188
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:29,789
That means I'm not the killer, right?

189
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:37,489
What gives you the confidence
to act like this?

190
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:41,754
Do I look like a nice cop
that listens to what criminals say?

191
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:43,155
Huh?

192
00:11:48,184 --> 00:11:50,050
Bo-yeong and I...
We fought in the car.

193
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,384
- In the car... Bo-yeong...
- Stop it!

194
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,575
Damn it.

195
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:02,284
Right here!

196
00:12:02,284 --> 00:12:03,748
It was here.

197
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:08,471
This is where my car was parked.

198
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:10,515
I fought with Bo-yeong here.

199
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:14,025
You didn't fight with her,
you killed her.

200
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,659
Bo-yeong said...

201
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:19,430
...something bad about Da-eun,
so I got mad and shouted at her.

202
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:22,850
But I pulled her so hard
that her bracelet fell on the floor.

203
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,477
You crazy punk!

204
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:27,237
How dare you even
mention Bo-yeong's name?

205
00:12:27,803 --> 00:12:29,196
What's with you?

206
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:30,617
It wasn't me.

207
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:31,917
- Huh?
- Here...

208
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:39,361
MUCHEON POLICE STATION

209
00:12:53,784 --> 00:12:55,117
<i>Where is this place?</i>

210
00:12:55,118 --> 00:12:57,585
CHEONSU ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

211
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,183
Are you feeling better?

212
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,477
Okay. It won't take too long.

213
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:20,264
But Jeong-woo, I'll just pretend
that I didn't see...

214
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:21,632
...what just happened at the warehouse.

215
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,966
- Look, Byeong-mu...
- I am your friend,

216
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25,732
but I'm also Bo-yeong's friend.

217
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:31,522
So please stop doing anything
to hurt Bo-yeong any further.

218
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,557
I was taking photos
while on a hike and

219
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:41,091
I found this in a house
in Cheonsu Village.

220
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:43,969
I brought it here because
it seemed like a human bone.

221
00:13:52,017 --> 00:13:53,384
Look, Byeong-mu.

222
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,917
When we were young,
nobody knew such a place...

223
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,517
...existed in Cheonsu Village.

224
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:01,766
Yeah, I suppose.

225
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,302
I haven't slept for 10 days...

226
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:11,326
You crazy bastard!

227
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,750
Damn it!

228
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,136
Hey, did you find out where
Park Da-eun's body is?

229
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:20,238
Look here, you evil bastard.
Are you playing hard to get?

230
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:22,371
Why are you only telling us
where Shim Bo-yeong is?

231
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:23,420
Park Da-eun?

232
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:26,446
Where is Park Da-eun?
Park Da-eun!

233
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:30,437
You crazy...

234
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:35,184
Hey.

235
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:39,245
How far away did you bury
Park Da-eun, huh?

236
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,213
Did you throw her away
in another village?

237
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,686
Did you throw her away
in another city?

238
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,316
Damn it!

239
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:54,313
"It was a bright day
that wasn't visible."

240
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:58,039
Na-gyeom, Na-gyeom.

241
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,713
Did you hear?

242
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:04,526
They found Bo-yeong.

243
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,886
I can't seem to get
in touch with Jeong-woo...

244
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,526
Where are you going?

245
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:16,446
I have to meet Jeong-woo.

246
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:18,323
Do you even know where he is?

247
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,091
GPS TRACKING

248
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:42,456
YE YEONG-SIL

249
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:45,585
<i>But even if we live long lives</i>
<i>up to 100 years old,</i>

250
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:48,042
<i>what's the point when</i>
<i>we're exposed to all these diseases?</i>

251
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:51,909
<i>What matters is how healthy we are</i>
<i>for those years.</i>

252
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,949
Just wait.

253
00:15:53,609 --> 00:15:55,885
Time will go by, anyway.

254
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:57,629
And a chance comes at least once.

255
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:00,469
<i>Evidence.</i>

256
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,380
<i>If only I can find the evidence.</i>

257
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:05,276
- That's right.
- I expect no less from Ye Yeong-sil.

258
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:08,742
We voted for the right politician.
Don't you agree?

259
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:11,542
<i>There's the significant</i>
<i>added benefit of job creation.</i>

260
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:14,809
If such a benefit
can make our youth happier,

261
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,755
wouldn't that mean
a brighter future for us all?

262
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:22,309
I like to start my day
with a little saying that goes,

263
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:24,618
"Abundance and prosperity
bring greatness and joy".

264
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:26,609
Just as it says,
abundance and prosperity...

265
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:28,869
...will bring greatness and joy
to the people.

266
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:33,342
So that every citizen of Mucheon
can always be happy,

267
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:35,989
I will do my best today, as always.

268
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:39,676
- Thank you.
<i>- Thank you, Congresswoman Ye Yeong-sil.</i>

269
00:16:39,676 --> 00:16:40,976
Ma'am, that was perfect.

270
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:42,776
It's the same thing I always say.

271
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:44,109
How's my schedule for today?

272
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:47,042
You have four senior citizen centers
to visit from 11 a.m.

273
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:49,609
Then the talk with
Mucheon University students.

274
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,742
And after that, the fundraiser
for children in need in the evening.

275
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:54,809
Also, ma'am.

276
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:57,076
Do you remember the murder case
where the bodies weren't found?

277
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:59,442
There aren't too many articles on it yet...

278
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:01,549
...but I thought you should know...

279
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:04,803
REMAINS FOUND FOR THE
MUCHEON MISSING BODY MURDER

280
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:09,140
Oh, no!

281
00:17:11,912 --> 00:17:13,676
What about the victim's parents?

282
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:15,042
Where are they now?

283
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:17,503
Oh, but if you push back the schedule,

284
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:18,986
it'll get too tight...

285
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:22,309
Bo-yeong!

286
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,776
Hey, you bastards, open this door!

287
00:17:25,662 --> 00:17:28,962
Hey, you bastards,
I told you to open this door!

288
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:31,462
Su-oh.

289
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:35,842
Leave.

290
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:40,442
You know Shim Bo-yeong, don't you?

291
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:42,042
They found her.

292
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:44,789
Under the abandoned school
in Cheonsu Village.

293
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:48,069
I found this bone...

294
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:51,109
And Goh Jeong-woo used it
to find the body.

295
00:17:52,242 --> 00:17:55,702
Everyone's telling him to hurry up...

296
00:17:55,703 --> 00:17:57,352
...and find Park Da-eun.

297
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,749
But I feel like Goh Jeong-woo
really doesn't know.

298
00:18:02,142 --> 00:18:02,942
Anyway, Su-oh...

299
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:05,942
No. Leave! Leave!

300
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:08,776
- Su-oh? Su-oh!
- Leave! Leave!

301
00:18:08,776 --> 00:18:11,142
No!

302
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:16,576
Su-oh! Su-oh, what's going on?
What's wrong with you?

303
00:18:17,002 --> 00:18:18,149
Ma'am!

304
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:25,909
Su-oh!

305
00:18:26,176 --> 00:18:27,876
- Su-oh, are you all right?
- Oh, my goodness!

306
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:29,676
- Su-oh! Breathe!
- What's going on?

307
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,742
- What happened?
- Breathe, Su-oh.

308
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:33,476
Please call an ambulance!

309
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:35,863
Su-oh, you're okay. You're all right.

310
00:19:14,495 --> 00:19:15,962
Seol...

311
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:17,869
Yes?

312
00:19:21,969 --> 00:19:23,602
It wasn't Jeong-woo.

313
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,709
MUCHEON MISSING BODY MURDER
INVESTIGATION

314
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,082
It only took 80 days from the start
of the investigation...

315
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,884
...to the sentencing.

316
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:37,482
He pleaded guilty to all charges
and was sent straight to prison.

317
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:40,717
Without even making an appeal.

318
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:45,692
It's going to get noisy for a while.

319
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:49,343
Good work despite the cold.

320
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:51,742
Thank you, sir.

321
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,917
But sir...

322
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:00,376
About Goh Jeong-woo's case.

323
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:02,107
Goh Jeong-woo? What about him?

324
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,909
I'm confused about what happened today.

325
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:09,276
The fact that he claims he can't
remember anything due to a black out...

326
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:12,209
Doesn't it not make sense that
he murdered two people so meticulously...

327
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:15,367
...and yet can't remember a single thing?

328
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:22,288
Gosh,

329
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,752
it feels like
I'm being interrogated.

330
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:27,142
Oh, I apologize.

331
00:20:27,304 --> 00:20:28,942
I never seem to stop working.

332
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:29,989
It's okay.

333
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:32,069
It's just that I find this awkward.

334
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:35,375
I've never been inspected before.

335
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:37,209
I see...

336
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:39,509
What is it you're trying to say?

337
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:46,589
It usually takes at least three months
from arrest to sentencing.

338
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,618
Normally, it's at least six months.

339
00:20:48,642 --> 00:20:51,709
But Goh Jeong-woo's case was over
in a little less than two and a half.

340
00:20:53,314 --> 00:20:55,218
Well, that's up to the prosecution.

341
00:20:55,242 --> 00:20:58,309
All we do is work on the investigation.

342
00:20:58,746 --> 00:21:01,037
Is it wrong to get through
an investigation quickly?

343
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:03,103
Oh, of course not...

344
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:05,927
Why do your words feel so sharp?

345
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:09,460
What is it you really want to say?

346
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:18,427
Sir.

347
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:22,894
You made Goh Jeong-woo confess
to get a reduced sentence, didn't you?

348
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,687
That's why
he didn't appeal his sentence.

349
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:29,003
The maximum sentence was 20 years.

350
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:30,927
But his trial was sped along so that...

351
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:33,427
...he was tried while still a minor,
reducing his sentence to 10 years.

352
00:21:33,427 --> 00:21:34,749
Was that your doing?

353
00:21:49,861 --> 00:21:51,629
What would you have done?

354
00:21:56,794 --> 00:22:00,749
Your best friend's son
commits a crime on impulse.

355
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,469
What advice would you give him
in such a situation?

356
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:10,469
Team Head Noh.

357
00:22:10,553 --> 00:22:11,709
Yes, sir.

358
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,793
If I was influenced by personal feelings
during the investigation,

359
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:18,082
I have no reason to be here.

360
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,409
I'm sorry for taking up
so much of your time.

361
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:27,395
I'll get going.

362
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:40,469
Yes, hello.

363
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:48,794
Right, Section Chief Kim.

364
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:51,294
I need to head out.
Call me if anything happens.

365
00:22:51,294 --> 00:22:53,194
Did something happen?

366
00:22:53,194 --> 00:22:54,894
It's Su-oh.

367
00:22:54,894 --> 00:22:56,467
I need to go to him.

368
00:22:56,694 --> 00:22:58,596
Stay strong, sir!

369
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:03,027
- What?
- Who is it?

370
00:23:04,427 --> 00:23:05,694
The congresswoman?

371
00:23:05,694 --> 00:23:07,981
- Ma'am! What brings you here?
- Goodness.

372
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:09,320
Oh, hello...

373
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:10,485
Gosh...

374
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:12,111
- It's this way.
- This way, ma'am.

375
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,358
Hey, Congresswoman Ye Yeong-sil is here!

376
00:23:15,776 --> 00:23:17,561
Congresswoman Ye Yeong-sil is here!

377
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:20,594
Oh, my goodness! You didn't
have to come all the way here.

378
00:23:20,803 --> 00:23:22,457
You must be in shock.

379
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:24,094
Oh, Congresswoman...

380
00:23:24,094 --> 00:23:27,361
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry
about what happened.

381
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:29,749
- Congresswoman...
- Oh, ma'am.

382
00:23:30,954 --> 00:23:34,384
How could this happen?

383
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:36,429
Is this the law?

384
00:23:38,494 --> 00:23:42,305
It took so long to find
my daughter's remains...

385
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:46,218
And yet the murderer
wanders free on the streets.

386
00:23:46,242 --> 00:23:48,749
How does this make sense?

387
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:51,961
She's right.

388
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:54,715
Goh Jeong-woo, that bastard,
went to prison for murdering two lives.

389
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:57,370
He's served his sentence
and yet only 30 years old.

390
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,589
How is this fair?

391
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,827
I'll help you.

392
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:07,294
I will pass a law that protects
the rights of victims...

393
00:24:07,294 --> 00:24:09,749
...over the rights of criminals.

394
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,037
Congresswoman...

395
00:24:12,061 --> 00:24:14,469
Before you pass that kind of law...

396
00:24:15,585 --> 00:24:17,986
Please get my husband out of prison.

397
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,478
I whole-heartedly understand
what you're going through.

398
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:22,735
I'm so heartbroken.

399
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:28,894
Where is the justice?

400
00:24:28,918 --> 00:24:32,846
Where is the damn justice?

401
00:24:34,122 --> 00:24:35,494
Ma'am...

402
00:24:35,494 --> 00:24:38,155
The congresswoman has to leave
for her next schedule.

403
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:40,530
You'll be late even if you leave now.

404
00:24:42,202 --> 00:24:43,522
Stay strong, ma'am.

405
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:47,309
Good days will surely come
once the pain subsides.

406
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:50,277
Please stay strong.

407
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:51,293
Then I'm...

408
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:52,579
Congresswoman...

409
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,680
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.

410
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:57,309
- Gosh.
- Thank you, ma'am.

411
00:24:58,127 --> 00:24:59,852
My goodness.

412
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:01,894
- Thank you.
- Stay strong.

413
00:25:01,894 --> 00:25:03,220
Please take care.

414
00:25:03,221 --> 00:25:05,373
Thank you.

415
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:13,918
<i>I need to remember</i>
<i>no matter what it takes.</i>

416
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:17,323
CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT,
GOH JEONG-WOO

417
00:25:17,324 --> 00:25:18,624
<i>Please...</i>

418
00:26:17,587 --> 00:26:20,010
Su-oh, what's wrong?
Why are you doing that?

419
00:26:26,746 --> 00:26:28,135
Seol...

420
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:33,909
The painting.

421
00:26:35,222 --> 00:26:37,109
The paintings.

422
00:26:37,354 --> 00:26:39,149
The paintings in the greenhouse?

423
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:42,727
Please bring me my paintings.

424
00:26:43,714 --> 00:26:45,829
But don't tell anyone.

425
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:47,929
It's a secret.

426
00:26:49,451 --> 00:26:50,751
All right.

427
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,872
He murdered two girls
with bright futures ahead of them.

428
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:02,384
And yet he only got 10 years
because he was a minor?

429
00:27:02,385 --> 00:27:03,548
How much harder must I work...

430
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:05,696
...in order to bring down
these kinds of laws?

431
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,925
You just need to do
as much as you're doing now.

432
00:27:15,504 --> 00:27:16,804
Okay.

433
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:19,371
Su-oh.

434
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:21,605
I've administered 10mg of lacosamide.

435
00:27:22,024 --> 00:27:22,891
How is his condition?

436
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:26,305
Doctor, he keeps having
epileptic seizures.

437
00:27:26,397 --> 00:27:28,731
He had a really bad one
about an hour ago.

438
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:31,532
He was convulsing 30 minutes
after he regained consciousness.

439
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:33,633
And he was convulsing again just now.

440
00:27:33,634 --> 00:27:35,450
He's never been like this before.

441
00:27:35,451 --> 00:27:36,768
What could be wrong?

442
00:27:37,284 --> 00:27:40,151
Oh, he'll get better.

443
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:43,536
Sorry, but who are you?

444
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:45,603
Oh, my apologies.

445
00:27:45,603 --> 00:27:47,470
I'm Su-oh's friend.

446
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,234
Oh, I see.

447
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:52,758
Su-oh keeps no secrets from me.

448
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,892
It's surprising to know that
he had such a pretty friend.

449
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:58,853
Restrict all visitations
for the time being...

450
00:27:58,854 --> 00:27:59,970
...and find an available room.

451
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,270
Yes, Doctor.

452
00:28:09,575 --> 00:28:12,923
<i>Sir, Su-oh painted something strange.</i>

453
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,833
<i>I look so happy back then.</i>

454
00:28:34,844 --> 00:28:36,136
What did you just say?

455
00:28:36,136 --> 00:28:37,336
Hey!

456
00:28:37,336 --> 00:28:38,070
Let go!

457
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,703
Hey, Shim Bo-yeong.

458
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:42,270
Hey!

459
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,550
<i>Bo-yeong was crying that day.</i>

460
00:28:46,203 --> 00:28:48,950
<i>She was crying even before</i>
<i>I arrived in the car.</i>

461
00:28:57,329 --> 00:28:59,006
Oh...

462
00:29:00,702 --> 00:29:02,674
<i>After I sent Bo-yeong away</i>
<i>like that...</i>

463
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:05,640
<i>I was angry so I got back in the car.</i>

464
00:29:06,442 --> 00:29:09,289
<i>Then the others approached the car.</i>

465
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,699
<i>Found it.</i>

466
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,652
<i>Mom kept these...</i>

467
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,503
<i>I always bought</i>
<i>exactly $10 worth of gas.</i>

468
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,581
<i>Because I was a student with no money.</i>

469
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,696
<i>And I was almost empty that day.</i>

470
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,979
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

471
00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:53,453
<i>I didn't kill them.</i>

472
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:54,543
What did you see?

473
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:56,502
Like I told you on the phone.

474
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,968
I was shocked while
cleaning the greenhouse.

475
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:01,910
Su-oh painted something so grotesque.

476
00:30:05,624 --> 00:30:07,236
Housekeeper,
take the rest of the day off.

477
00:30:07,236 --> 00:30:08,770
Actually, you know what?

478
00:30:09,143 --> 00:30:13,101
Since Su-oh's in the hospital,
go on leave until I call you.

479
00:30:13,554 --> 00:30:14,869
Thank you, sir.

480
00:30:40,003 --> 00:30:41,423
Su-oh...

481
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:48,106
Get out, you punk! Get out!

482
00:30:49,102 --> 00:30:52,862
You remember I always used to buy
exactly $10 worth of gas, right?

483
00:30:52,863 --> 00:30:55,797
I don't remember anything,
and I don't want to!

484
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:58,454
Do you know how much
I've suffered because of you?

485
00:30:58,455 --> 00:31:00,950
I was summoned to the station
every single day!

486
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,836
You just have to tell me...

487
00:31:02,836 --> 00:31:06,270
...whether someone other than me
filled up my car 10 years ago.

488
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,279
Stop your nonsense!

489
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,993
I don't want to speak with
the likes of you ever again!

490
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:13,249
- Just leave.
- Sir, I beg you...

491
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,728
Get lost!

492
00:31:15,036 --> 00:31:16,428
Get lost...

493
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:19,660
Darn it!

494
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:21,629
Darn!

495
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:29,389
Are you all right?

496
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:35,709
Hey,

497
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:38,269
why do you keep staying here
when you're treated like this?

498
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:40,063
Leave with me.

499
00:31:40,087 --> 00:31:42,939
Let's take your mother
and go somewhere else, all right?

500
00:31:43,086 --> 00:31:44,178
I can't leave.

501
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:45,645
Why?

502
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:47,479
Why can't you leave?

503
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:50,679
I won't leave until I find Da-eun.

504
00:32:14,545 --> 00:32:15,902
It's been 10 years
and no one's found her.

505
00:32:15,903 --> 00:32:17,853
So how will you do it?

506
00:32:18,412 --> 00:32:20,909
And what will change if you find her?

507
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:23,229
It proves I'm not a murderer.

508
00:32:24,212 --> 00:32:24,779
What?

509
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:27,379
All I can do is find my past self.

510
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:28,709
That's why you should...

511
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:30,989
...go back to living your life.

512
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,789
Jeong-woo...

513
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:40,539
Let's go to Seoul with your mother.

514
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:43,079
I can help you out with that much.

515
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,345
Deok-mi.

516
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,312
Did I ever do anything
to make you misunderstand?

517
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,214
I don't think I did.

518
00:32:55,842 --> 00:32:57,541
Drive safe back to Seoul.

519
00:33:12,145 --> 00:33:14,563
Geez, that stinks!

520
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:16,557
Hey, Jeong-woo!

521
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:19,045
Are we in the same class again?

522
00:33:19,045 --> 00:33:20,779
- Su-oh!
- Hey, wake up!

523
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:22,545
Geez! Hey, sit here.

524
00:33:22,545 --> 00:33:24,174
Geez.

525
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,670
Dammit.

526
00:33:30,512 --> 00:33:32,412
Where did Su-oh go? The hospital?

527
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,244
Where did all those paintings go?

528
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,398
Hello...

529
00:34:47,473 --> 00:34:48,483
CONGRESSWOMAN YE YEONG-SIL

530
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:50,477
The porridge is almost ready.

531
00:34:50,477 --> 00:34:51,995
Just wait a bit more.

532
00:34:53,011 --> 00:34:56,281
How can I even eat porridge
in this state?

533
00:34:57,844 --> 00:34:59,361
Please leave.

534
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:01,753
All of you.

535
00:35:01,777 --> 00:35:05,171
Don't be like that. We're just worried.

536
00:35:05,244 --> 00:35:06,677
Worried?

537
00:35:07,544 --> 00:35:09,979
Will worrying change anything?

538
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:13,341
Even the congresswoman
can't do anything about it.

539
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,993
So what can you do?

540
00:35:14,994 --> 00:35:17,528
That's why we should come together.

541
00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:19,882
- Yeah.
- For what?

542
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:22,885
Is there anything we can actually do?

543
00:35:22,909 --> 00:35:24,276
What is wrong with you?

544
00:35:24,277 --> 00:35:25,941
Let's leave.

545
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:30,776
Come on, let's go.

546
00:35:30,776 --> 00:35:32,112
Let's go.

547
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,342
I know it's hard for you...

548
00:35:38,342 --> 00:35:40,589
...but it's wrong to ignore our sincerity.

549
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:03,456
Did I misjudge your character, Seol?

550
00:36:04,155 --> 00:36:06,409
You know better than
to act like this.

551
00:36:07,816 --> 00:36:10,259
How can you sneak into
someone else's house like this?

552
00:36:11,096 --> 00:36:12,471
I'm sorry.

553
00:36:12,495 --> 00:36:14,518
It won't happen again.

554
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:16,541
All right.

555
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,861
So what brings you here
when Su-oh's in the hospital?

556
00:36:22,242 --> 00:36:23,581
Well, the thing is...

557
00:36:25,376 --> 00:36:27,461
But don't tell anyone.

558
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:29,221
It's a secret.

559
00:36:30,642 --> 00:36:32,909
You know how Su-oh's in the hospital?

560
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:35,951
I just thought he might be bored
so I was getting him some books.

561
00:36:35,975 --> 00:36:37,301
Comic books.

562
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,742
And since he likes to paint,

563
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:42,542
I was thinking of taking
his paints and brushes...

564
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:43,542
Miss Ha Seol.

565
00:36:47,201 --> 00:36:50,102
I'm grateful that you
hang around Su-oh...

566
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:52,131
...and take care of him.

567
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:55,244
But he's much worse than you think.

568
00:36:55,268 --> 00:36:58,321
He's not in the state
to be reading comics and painting.

569
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,541
Sorry. I didn't think
this through properly.

570
00:37:04,052 --> 00:37:06,546
It's okay if I visit him, right?

571
00:37:08,584 --> 00:37:11,933
What Su-oh needs right now
is complete rest.

572
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:13,608
I'll call you later on.

573
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:15,738
You know what I mean, right?

574
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:17,901
Yes, sir.

575
00:37:38,942 --> 00:37:42,065
It's an honor to meet you here
in Mucheon, Na-gyeom.

576
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:44,009
This might sound cliche,

577
00:37:44,009 --> 00:37:47,105
but I think the story of a first love
is the purest kind.

578
00:37:47,812 --> 00:37:51,323
I think the cliches in your scenario...

579
00:37:51,324 --> 00:37:53,118
...are what makes it charming.

580
00:37:53,529 --> 00:37:55,071
Eternal love.

581
00:38:10,558 --> 00:38:12,263
That's what everybody wants.

582
00:38:12,287 --> 00:38:14,278
So when was your first love?

583
00:38:14,302 --> 00:38:15,085
Director?

584
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:16,585
Oh, I apologize.

585
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:17,761
No.

586
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:21,201
I think we should talk about me
if we're going to talk about the film.

587
00:38:22,076 --> 00:38:23,535
I...

588
00:38:23,776 --> 00:38:26,028
...have someone I like.

589
00:38:27,176 --> 00:38:28,787
He's my first love.

590
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:31,775
I don't care...

591
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:35,314
...even if he killed someone.

592
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:37,399
I don't care...

593
00:38:38,142 --> 00:38:40,676
...if I can't be an actor anymore...

594
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:43,143
...because of him.

595
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:48,366
It's not your fault, Yeo-jin.

596
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,809
That's true of any human.

597
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:54,538
You didn't do anything wrong, Yeo-jin.

598
00:39:15,276 --> 00:39:16,719
It's okay.

599
00:39:25,976 --> 00:39:27,610
CENTER DIRECTOR'S ROOM

600
00:39:29,748 --> 00:39:31,226
I'll see you next week.

601
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:43,593
PRIVATE NUMBER:
YOU KILLED ME 11 YEARS AGO...

602
00:40:02,709 --> 00:40:04,845
Oh, this is good.

603
00:40:05,276 --> 00:40:07,142
A drink after work.

604
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:10,242
How down to earth is this?

605
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:13,142
But I'm bothered by how...

606
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:15,352
...our investigation is over...

607
00:40:15,376 --> 00:40:17,609
...before we found Park Da-eun's body.

608
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:19,061
That really bothers me.

609
00:40:19,362 --> 00:40:22,802
We should have beaten Goh Jeong-woo
to a bloody pulp.

610
00:40:22,826 --> 00:40:25,075
By the way, I heard Goh Jeong-woo's case
from 10 years ago...

611
00:40:25,076 --> 00:40:28,021
You practically solved the entire thing,
Section Chief.

612
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:30,366
Yeah, we heard the rumors too.

613
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:32,185
You made a huge contribution.

614
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:36,913
Geez, it was hardly a contribution.

615
00:40:36,914 --> 00:40:39,976
That's how all investigations are.

616
00:40:39,976 --> 00:40:42,008
Wow, he's so humble.

617
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:44,943
You really are a true veteran.

618
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:47,574
So how did you catch

619
00:40:48,475 --> 00:40:50,834
Goh Jeong-woo so quickly?

620
00:40:50,858 --> 00:40:52,658
It couldn't have been easy.

621
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:55,184
Well, the thing is...

622
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:58,599
If I had been just a little bit late,
it would've been really difficult.

623
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,892
I caught Goh Jeong-woo
because of one phone call.

624
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:02,579
That was the beginning.

625
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,428
Yes, grandma.

626
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:05,708
<i>Who are you with?</i>

627
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:07,585
What do you mean?

628
00:41:07,586 --> 00:41:09,375
I'm going to spend some time
in the warehouse and then go home.

629
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,142
<i>Go home now.</i>

630
00:41:11,142 --> 00:41:13,409
I'll call you when I get home.

631
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:15,209
- Da-eun...
- Hang up.

632
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:17,609
Why aren't you answering my calls?

633
00:41:18,842 --> 00:41:21,642
You're far too clingy.

634
00:41:21,642 --> 00:41:22,841
Hey.

635
00:41:23,123 --> 00:41:24,576
I'm so sick of you.

636
00:41:24,576 --> 00:41:26,476
You're no fun.

637
00:41:26,476 --> 00:41:27,876
Da-eun...

638
00:41:27,876 --> 00:41:29,218
Damn it.

639
00:41:29,242 --> 00:41:31,441
You dirty loser.

640
00:41:32,009 --> 00:41:33,442
Park Da-eun.

641
00:41:34,262 --> 00:41:36,525
<i>Hello, Da-eun?</i>

642
00:41:36,526 --> 00:41:38,852
How dare you hit me!

643
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:41,037
I'm going to report you
to the police.

644
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:43,295
You're just a high school skank.

645
00:41:43,557 --> 00:41:44,031
What?

646
00:41:44,032 --> 00:41:46,652
I told you not to talk to me
like that.

647
00:41:47,711 --> 00:41:50,350
<i>Oh, isn't anybody there?</i>

648
00:41:50,351 --> 00:41:52,951
I told you not to talk to me
like that!

649
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:57,318
The victim's grandmother
overheard the call and reported it!

650
00:41:57,318 --> 00:42:00,161
That was a godsend.

651
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,151
And on top of that!

652
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,651
You found the conclusive evidence,
didn't you?

653
00:42:03,651 --> 00:42:08,418
Geez, why are you bringing that up?

654
00:42:09,018 --> 00:42:12,651
Wow, so you were the one
who found...

655
00:42:12,651 --> 00:42:14,250
...Goh Jeong-woo's
bloody and muddy sneakers?

656
00:42:14,558 --> 00:42:16,197
How was the site?

657
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:18,871
The photos of the site were gruesome.

658
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:22,861
I've seen the evidence photos as well.

659
00:42:22,861 --> 00:42:25,427
Just the blood splatter alone
showed how brutal the scene was.

660
00:42:25,427 --> 00:42:28,527
But he killed two girls and
even abandoned their bodies...

661
00:42:28,528 --> 00:42:31,001
...in such a short time...

662
00:42:31,861 --> 00:42:34,401
Does Goh Jeong-woo
really have black outs?

663
00:42:35,402 --> 00:42:37,261
Black out...

664
00:42:39,594 --> 00:42:43,227
Goh Jeong-woo, that bastard,
claimed he couldn't remember.

665
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,294
And he kept rambling.

666
00:42:45,594 --> 00:42:49,761
Goh Jeong-woo killed Shim Bo-yeong
and wiped away all her blood.

667
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:51,570
As if nothing had happened.

668
00:42:51,594 --> 00:42:55,321
Then he brought Park Da-eun
to the warehouse and killed her again.

669
00:42:55,494 --> 00:42:59,494
He is totally sub-human.

670
00:43:02,054 --> 00:43:05,687
Can we stop talking about this now?

671
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,500
You were interviewed
as a witness, right?

672
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,927
What did you say?

673
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:15,427
Hey, take it easy.

674
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:18,861
The atmosphere is all tense now.

675
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:22,061
What are you going to do about it?

676
00:43:22,627 --> 00:43:23,661
Cheers to DCF!

677
00:43:23,661 --> 00:43:27,494
Determination, courage and flair!

678
00:43:41,194 --> 00:43:44,739
This isn't my first time,
but it never gets easy.

679
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:48,174
Please have a seat.

680
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:56,894
He hasn't had an epileptic fit
in months.

681
00:43:58,661 --> 00:44:01,794
If his environment changes
or he meets strangers,

682
00:44:01,794 --> 00:44:03,503
it could trigger symptoms.

683
00:44:03,527 --> 00:44:05,501
Has anything like that
happened recently?

684
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:08,461
You need to tell me everything
regardless of how trivial it may seem.

685
00:44:09,321 --> 00:44:12,941
The girl who brought Su-oh to the
hospital today said she was a friend.

686
00:44:13,269 --> 00:44:14,736
But I've never seen her before.

687
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,741
Oh, you mean Ha Seol?

688
00:44:16,903 --> 00:44:20,279
She's a medical student on a leave
who works part-time at Mucheon Garden.

689
00:44:20,303 --> 00:44:21,469
Oh, a student on a leave.

690
00:44:21,469 --> 00:44:25,341
She seems to have gotten close
with Su-oh over the past few months.

691
00:44:27,629 --> 00:44:31,195
By any chance,
do you remember Goh Jeong-woo?

692
00:44:31,536 --> 00:44:33,686
- Who?
- Goh Jeong-woo.

693
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:38,303
He used to volunteer at this hospital
about 10 years ago with Geon-oh.

694
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:39,703
Don't you remember him?

695
00:44:41,252 --> 00:44:42,552
VOLUNTEER

696
00:44:44,669 --> 00:44:46,707
- Jeong-woo.
- Yes?

697
00:44:47,503 --> 00:44:49,141
I hear you're applying
for medical school?

698
00:44:54,762 --> 00:44:56,329
That was a long time ago...

699
00:44:57,464 --> 00:45:00,297
Does the Missing Body Murder...

700
00:45:01,882 --> 00:45:03,282
...ring a bell?

701
00:45:05,921 --> 00:45:07,921
Oh, right... Yes...

702
00:45:09,799 --> 00:45:12,472
You must be tired. There's
no telling when Forensics will call.

703
00:45:12,473 --> 00:45:13,906
No, it's all right.

704
00:45:13,907 --> 00:45:15,407
You should go home,
you worked hard today.

705
00:45:15,408 --> 00:45:16,408
No, I'm fine.

706
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:18,709
Should I let you know
when I get the call...

707
00:45:20,765 --> 00:45:22,169
FORENSICS TEAM HEAD OH
See that?

708
00:45:22,169 --> 00:45:24,736
- Right on time, huh?
- Let's go.

709
00:45:26,368 --> 00:45:29,141
Even if they were close 10 years ago,

710
00:45:29,236 --> 00:45:33,341
it's only natural to feel threatened
by someone who just got out of jail.

711
00:45:33,802 --> 00:45:35,668
In the case of Su-oh,

712
00:45:36,136 --> 00:45:38,981
his body reacts when he sees...

713
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,941
...people or objects he wants to avoid.

714
00:45:41,803 --> 00:45:43,337
Right.

715
00:45:46,088 --> 00:45:49,921
But in any case,
could someone like Su-oh...

716
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:54,688
...paint what he sees
in his imagination or in a dream?

717
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:59,141
It is possible.

718
00:46:02,349 --> 00:46:04,461
We should try changing his medication.

719
00:46:05,216 --> 00:46:06,216
Oh, okay.

720
00:46:07,814 --> 00:46:09,536
I'd like him to stay at the hospital...

721
00:46:09,536 --> 00:46:13,181
...and get a thorough check-up
with his brain waves and such...

722
00:46:15,885 --> 00:46:17,785
PRIVATE NUMBER:
YOU KILLED ME 11 YEARS AGO...

723
00:46:20,315 --> 00:46:21,715
Director?

724
00:46:22,903 --> 00:46:25,636
Are you all right?
You don't seem well.

725
00:46:26,603 --> 00:46:29,403
You must be skipping meals
because you're too busy with patients.

726
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:34,536
Do I look that bad?

727
00:46:37,389 --> 00:46:38,036
YE YEONG-SIL

728
00:46:38,037 --> 00:46:39,441
Wow.

729
00:46:41,353 --> 00:46:43,736
My goodness, ma'am,
you look beautiful today.

730
00:46:43,736 --> 00:46:45,369
- Do I look all right?
- You look elegant.

731
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,236
You're the best.

732
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:49,003
It would be a waste to use this
only for a promotional video.

733
00:46:49,003 --> 00:46:51,903
I can't wait for the scenes
you record with your husband.

734
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,203
Don't expect too much.

735
00:46:53,203 --> 00:46:54,236
Why not?

736
00:46:54,236 --> 00:46:56,269
Because I'll go
beyond your expectations.

737
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,901
Hello.

738
00:47:03,169 --> 00:47:04,736
Here you go, ma'am.

739
00:47:05,402 --> 00:47:06,936
- Ma'am!
- Get something to wipe this!

740
00:47:06,936 --> 00:47:08,036
I'm so sorry!

741
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:09,985
- What on earth are you doing?
- I'm so sorry.

742
00:47:09,986 --> 00:47:11,021
Get some wipes!

743
00:47:11,803 --> 00:47:12,851
I'm all right.

744
00:47:12,852 --> 00:47:14,869
How fortunate that I ordered
iced coffee.

745
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:16,603
It would've been a disaster
if it was hot.

746
00:47:16,603 --> 00:47:18,479
It must be my lucky day.

747
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,685
I'm so sorry, ma'am. I'm so sorry.

748
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:22,021
It's okay.

749
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:23,436
Nobody got hurt.

750
00:47:23,436 --> 00:47:25,101
I can just get changed.

751
00:47:26,703 --> 00:47:29,136
When's my husband getting here?

752
00:47:30,622 --> 00:47:31,336
DNA ANALYSIS REPORT

753
00:47:31,336 --> 00:47:32,692
The DNA from the skeletal remains...

754
00:47:32,693 --> 00:47:34,955
...matches that
of the missing Shim Bo-yeong.

755
00:47:35,682 --> 00:47:39,779
When will the results of the autopsy
and detailed forensics be released?

756
00:47:39,803 --> 00:47:41,669
The skeletal remains, any belongings...

757
00:47:41,669 --> 00:47:44,668
...and all the evidence were transferred
to the National Forensic Service.

758
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:45,996
It shouldn't take too long.

759
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:47,297
How do we get rid of him?

760
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:50,436
You think an evil punk like him
will leave just because we ask him to?

761
00:47:50,436 --> 00:47:51,869
We'll have to beat him up
and make him leave.

762
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,103
No, we should use our words.

763
00:47:54,103 --> 00:47:56,003
We can say that we're too afraid
with him around.

764
00:47:56,003 --> 00:47:59,408
You never know what Jeong-woo will do.

765
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,935
Can't you tell by the way
we only found Bo-yeong now?

766
00:48:01,936 --> 00:48:03,836
I think he found her by accident.

767
00:48:03,836 --> 00:48:05,003
What?

768
00:48:05,003 --> 00:48:06,269
I mean, Goh Jeong-woo.

769
00:48:06,269 --> 00:48:09,603
He already served his full sentence.
There was no reason for him to find her.

770
00:48:09,603 --> 00:48:11,703
He was bound to get cursed
if he found the body.

771
00:48:11,703 --> 00:48:13,246
So why would he look for it?

772
00:48:13,247 --> 00:48:14,646
That is true...

773
00:48:14,647 --> 00:48:17,135
Jeong-woo gains nothing
by finding the culprit.

774
00:48:17,136 --> 00:48:19,980
What do you know, you rude girl?

775
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,168
The adults are talking here,
don't butt in.

776
00:48:22,169 --> 00:48:24,936
Ha Seol, please get us more kimchi.

777
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:26,703
All right.

778
00:48:30,536 --> 00:48:33,293
That vermin is...

779
00:48:33,294 --> 00:48:36,669
...messing up
our quiet village.

780
00:48:36,669 --> 00:48:38,603
What if rumors get out?

781
00:48:38,603 --> 00:48:41,303
What will you do about the land value
that's gone up all these years?

782
00:48:41,303 --> 00:48:43,269
If word gets around
that a murderer lives here,

783
00:48:43,269 --> 00:48:45,369
it'll all be over.

784
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:46,336
Don't you agree?

785
00:48:46,336 --> 00:48:47,469
Exactly.

786
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:50,336
We cannot live together
with the likes of Jeong-woo.

787
00:48:50,336 --> 00:48:52,603
We all need to join forces...

788
00:48:52,603 --> 00:48:54,769
...and just force what we want
as a majority.

789
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:56,469
All right, let's try it then.

790
00:48:56,469 --> 00:48:58,203
Let's drive him out for good.

791
00:48:58,203 --> 00:49:00,469
So just say we can't live
with a murderer?

792
00:49:00,469 --> 00:49:01,932
Excuse me...

793
00:49:03,356 --> 00:49:03,902
What?

794
00:49:03,903 --> 00:49:07,486
That warehouse near
the police chief's house.

795
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:09,769
Why are you bringing up
that hideous place?

796
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:11,603
Why hasn't it been demolished?

797
00:49:11,603 --> 00:49:14,748
People died there.
And it's not even used for storage.

798
00:49:14,772 --> 00:49:16,921
That belongs to Jeong-woo's family.

799
00:49:17,007 --> 00:49:19,290
So Jeong-woo's mom wouldn't
let us demolish it.

800
00:49:20,528 --> 00:49:21,307
Why?

801
00:49:21,308 --> 00:49:22,808
She wouldn't say why.

802
00:49:22,808 --> 00:49:26,175
I guess she wanted to remember
her son's crimes.

803
00:49:26,175 --> 00:49:28,941
That couldn't have been easy.

804
00:49:29,574 --> 00:49:30,861
Tell me about it.

805
00:49:31,342 --> 00:49:34,814
How did such a monster
come from such good parents?

806
00:49:34,815 --> 00:49:35,815
Geez.

807
00:49:36,872 --> 00:49:39,475
That warehouse looked really big.

808
00:49:39,475 --> 00:49:41,461
Was there a tractor in there too?

809
00:49:41,642 --> 00:49:45,642
Of course. The kids used to stack hay...

810
00:49:45,642 --> 00:49:48,141
...on that big tractor and
play there all the time.

811
00:49:48,608 --> 00:49:50,381
That's all in the past.

812
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:51,675
- Su-oh.
- What's happening?

813
00:49:51,675 --> 00:49:54,375
- Su-oh, breathe.
- My goodness, what happened?

814
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:02,121
Hurry up and serve this.

815
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,861
<i>Since he's made a confession,</i>

816
00:50:10,056 --> 00:50:12,242
<i>the best thing now is</i>
<i>to reduce his sentence.</i>

817
00:50:12,707 --> 00:50:15,474
<i>And you must settle</i>
<i>with the victim's family.</i>

818
00:50:21,408 --> 00:50:23,329
You're so sharp!

819
00:50:23,695 --> 00:50:25,422
How did you know I just got off work?

820
00:50:25,423 --> 00:50:26,696
<i>Can we meet up and talk?</i>

821
00:50:26,697 --> 00:50:29,076
Sure. Let's meet up then.

822
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,533
Hey, you've got instant noodles
at your house, right?

823
00:50:43,443 --> 00:50:45,176
PRIVATE NUMBER:
YOU KILLED ME 11 YEARS AGO...

824
00:50:45,828 --> 00:50:47,561
Who could it be?

825
00:50:47,955 --> 00:50:49,001
Who are you?

826
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:51,224
Oh, I'm sorry.

827
00:50:51,225 --> 00:50:53,156
I'm Su-oh's friend.

828
00:50:55,564 --> 00:50:57,097
Or could it be...

829
00:50:58,464 --> 00:50:59,982
...Goh Jeong-Woo.

830
00:51:01,428 --> 00:51:02,495
MY LOVE YEONG-SIL

831
00:51:05,831 --> 00:51:07,061
Oh, honey.

832
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,431
Yes, I'm heading there now.

833
00:51:10,431 --> 00:51:11,731
I'll be arriving soon.

834
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:24,110
The victim was a 19-year-old
student at the time.

835
00:51:24,111 --> 00:51:27,111
So didn't she have any accessories
or a backpack?

836
00:51:27,112 --> 00:51:28,531
No, she didn't.

837
00:51:29,597 --> 00:51:33,263
Oh, right...
She was missing underwear.

838
00:51:33,264 --> 00:51:34,396
Excuse me?

839
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:38,158
She was wearing a bra,
but no panties.

840
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:41,359
She had everything else on
except her panties?

841
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:45,526
That's right. A long time has passed
so her clothes had deteriorated.

842
00:51:45,526 --> 00:51:47,392
But her panties were missing completely.

843
00:51:47,392 --> 00:51:51,726
That means we can't rule out
sexual assault, right?

844
00:51:52,226 --> 00:51:53,226
Isn't that right?

845
00:51:54,092 --> 00:51:55,426
Yes, I guess.

846
00:51:55,426 --> 00:51:58,092
What are the odds that only
the panties get lost...

847
00:51:58,092 --> 00:52:00,992
...from skeletal remains?

848
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,459
I'm not sure.

849
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:07,326
Please tell us as soon as
results come from the NFS.

850
00:52:07,326 --> 00:52:08,679
Yes, I will.

851
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:10,459
Thank you.

852
00:52:12,278 --> 00:52:15,045
So you're saying
he's here right now, right?

853
00:52:15,046 --> 00:52:16,846
Hey, murderer! Come out here!

854
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:19,180
- Hey, Goh Jeong-woo! Get out!
- Do you take us for fools?

855
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:20,214
Get out!

856
00:52:20,215 --> 00:52:21,115
Get out now!

857
00:52:21,116 --> 00:52:22,416
- Get out here!
- Get out!

858
00:52:22,417 --> 00:52:23,084
Get out here!

859
00:52:23,085 --> 00:52:24,718
He must still be at the hospital.

860
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:25,653
No, he's inside.

861
00:52:25,654 --> 00:52:27,354
Let's just come back tomorrow.

862
00:52:27,355 --> 00:52:28,055
Get out here!

863
00:52:28,056 --> 00:52:29,722
Stop talking nonsense.

864
00:52:29,723 --> 00:52:30,723
Hey! Goh Jeong-woo!

865
00:52:30,724 --> 00:52:31,958
- Hey! Goh Jeong-woo!
- Get out!

866
00:52:31,959 --> 00:52:33,525
- Get out! Hey, can't you hear me?
- Get out, you!

867
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:35,193
- Get out!
- He's coming.

868
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:36,234
There he is.

869
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:42,586
Why are you here at this hour?

870
00:52:42,587 --> 00:52:45,758
I'll get straight to the point.

871
00:52:45,759 --> 00:52:47,839
Take your mom and move away.

872
00:52:52,392 --> 00:52:53,592
Jeong-woo...

873
00:52:53,592 --> 00:52:56,026
Can't you just leave first?

874
00:52:56,026 --> 00:52:58,784
It's too hard for us to see you.

875
00:53:01,259 --> 00:53:02,990
I have something to do.

876
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:06,291
Once that's taken care of,
I'll leave quietly.

877
00:53:06,292 --> 00:53:07,759
- You punk.
- What are you all doing?

878
00:53:07,759 --> 00:53:09,759
- Dad! What are you doing here?
- Oh, Min-su.

879
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,627
Hey, why are you here, you punk?

880
00:53:11,628 --> 00:53:13,291
I'm here to meet Jeong-woo.

881
00:53:13,292 --> 00:53:15,919
Why would you meet that murderer?

882
00:53:16,232 --> 00:53:19,003
Hey, are you trying to ruin
my son's life too?

883
00:53:20,246 --> 00:53:22,246
I don't think today's the right time.

884
00:53:22,247 --> 00:53:23,580
- Let's go, Dad.
- Go, go, go.

885
00:53:23,581 --> 00:53:25,314
- Geez, you punk.
- Go, go, go.

886
00:53:25,315 --> 00:53:26,449
Let's go.

887
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:28,383
Can we just go like this?

888
00:53:28,384 --> 00:53:30,084
Why are you saying we should go?

889
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:33,252
- Hurry, let's go.
- We'll leave for now...

890
00:53:43,366 --> 00:53:44,652
What's with your face?

891
00:53:45,379 --> 00:53:46,462
Is something going on?

892
00:53:47,192 --> 00:53:49,637
No, it's just... I'm tired.

893
00:53:52,059 --> 00:53:53,373
I think you got a text.

894
00:53:55,726 --> 00:53:57,709
- I'll check later...
- Read it now.

895
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,636
I won't do anything...

896
00:54:31,273 --> 00:54:32,436
...to upset you.

897
00:54:34,106 --> 00:54:35,796
Of course not.

898
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:37,409
You're my husband.

899
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:41,620
$50,000 DONATION FOR
CHILDREN IN NEED IN MUCHEON

900
00:54:48,906 --> 00:54:50,740
How about we stop taking photos now?

901
00:54:51,373 --> 00:54:54,640
It's not like we did anything special.
It's embarrassing.

902
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:57,973
Thank you so much for today.

903
00:54:57,973 --> 00:54:59,406
Thank you.

904
00:54:59,406 --> 00:55:00,758
Goodbye.

905
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,236
Well done today.

906
00:55:05,665 --> 00:55:06,836
Na-gyeom.

907
00:55:08,706 --> 00:55:10,276
What are you doing right now?

908
00:55:13,379 --> 00:55:15,711
I'll go get something to drink.

909
00:55:22,759 --> 00:55:25,316
Is this because of that man...

910
00:55:25,494 --> 00:55:26,916
...you saw at the hospital?

911
00:55:28,906 --> 00:55:30,156
CEO,

912
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:33,678
do you know why
I became an actress?

913
00:55:35,213 --> 00:55:37,536
I thought if everyone
would look upon me...

914
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,973
...he might look upon me, as well.

915
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,406
Does that mean...

916
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:50,456
But he still won't look at me.

917
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,940
Jeong-woo, are you going
to the warehouse?

918
00:55:57,406 --> 00:55:58,773
Hey, why would you even
want to come here?

919
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:01,040
It'll only take a minute.
I have to ask you something too.

920
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,440
Hey, I snuck out without my dad knowing.
Let me buy you something good.

921
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,573
Let's go and eat.

922
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:06,006
Min-su.

923
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,306
It'll only be a few minutes.

924
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,100
Min-su.

925
00:56:33,873 --> 00:56:36,145
Have you ever seen Bo-yeong cry?

926
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:37,640
Huh?

927
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,555
Even on the day
we drank the distilled liquor...

928
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,152
...Bo-yeong didn't cry.

929
00:56:42,906 --> 00:56:45,573
Hey, you guys are so cheap!

930
00:56:45,573 --> 00:56:46,973
Give us some too!

931
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,973
- Hey, drink up!
- What is this?

932
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,406
- Drink this.
- Drink up.

933
00:56:51,406 --> 00:56:53,206
- Hey, wake up.
- Here.

934
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:55,856
Bo-yeong.

935
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,340
What happened here?

936
00:56:59,306 --> 00:57:01,642
I got beat up by my dad.

937
00:57:04,773 --> 00:57:07,055
Geez, I could've avoided it.

938
00:57:08,406 --> 00:57:10,556
Bo-yeong never cries,
even when life is hard for her.

939
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:12,065
You know that.

940
00:57:12,591 --> 00:57:13,440
And you saw that.

941
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,540
- But on that day...
- Yes, I saw her.

942
00:57:15,876 --> 00:57:17,540
I don't know what happened but

943
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:20,085
Bo-yeong was crying
when she got out of your car.

944
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:22,142
And then she started
running toward something.

945
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,406
Bo-yeong was crying in my car.

946
00:57:26,406 --> 00:57:27,973
There must've been a reason for that...

947
00:57:27,973 --> 00:57:30,795
How would I know that, Jeong-woo?

948
00:57:31,113 --> 00:57:33,779
What happened between you
and Bo-yeong in that car?

949
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,836
And why was Bo-yeong
crying so hard as she ran off?

950
00:57:37,332 --> 00:57:39,165
How would I know that?

951
00:57:41,379 --> 00:57:45,116
Where do you think Bo-yeong went
after crying alone like that?

952
00:57:45,214 --> 00:57:47,476
Why could nobody find her?

953
00:57:47,781 --> 00:57:50,215
Why was Bo-yeong found
in an abandoned school?

954
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:53,396
I'm curious about what happened
prior to that.

955
00:57:53,773 --> 00:57:56,440
The day I suggested we drink
at my house but canceled.

956
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,406
Didn't you guys come to the warehouse?

957
00:57:58,406 --> 00:58:00,340
You could've met up without me.

958
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:03,276
- Didn't you see Bo-yeong that day?
- What kind of crap is this?

959
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,749
I was at Geon-oh's house with Byeong-mu.
It was the three of us.

960
00:58:06,773 --> 00:58:09,436
And why on earth would we
come here without you?

961
00:58:11,073 --> 00:58:12,406
Are you sure?

962
00:58:15,817 --> 00:58:17,156
Jeong-woo,

963
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:21,116
to be honest,
I work at the hospital.

964
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:23,156
And if I continue to
hang out with an ex-con...

965
00:58:24,763 --> 00:58:26,714
People might talk.

966
00:58:27,656 --> 00:58:28,756
Oh, right.

967
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:30,132
Besides everything else,

968
00:58:30,156 --> 00:58:32,076
you are my friend.

969
00:58:32,256 --> 00:58:35,066
And you must have had a hard time
in prison for 10 years.

970
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:37,690
That's why I welcomed you
and acted like...

971
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:40,256
...we could go back to
how things used to be.

972
00:58:40,256 --> 00:58:42,523
- Min-su, what I'm trying to say...
- No.

973
00:58:44,423 --> 00:58:46,723
If you keep acting like this,

974
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:48,276
I can't do this.

975
00:58:49,456 --> 00:58:50,856
I'll get going.

976
00:59:12,343 --> 00:59:14,741
<i>Bo-yeong died in the warehouse.</i>

977
00:59:15,356 --> 00:59:17,295
<i>She was abandoned using my car.</i>

978
00:59:19,183 --> 00:59:22,311
<i>But then why did she end up</i>
<i>at the abandoned school?</i>

979
00:59:34,323 --> 00:59:35,918
<i>Anyone who could drive,</i>

980
00:59:36,729 --> 00:59:39,162
<i>could take my car.</i>

981
00:59:40,323 --> 00:59:41,623
<i>The car keys...</i>

982
00:59:42,023 --> 00:59:44,038
<i>...were always in the toolbox.</i>

983
00:59:52,656 --> 00:59:54,056
Hey, Gu-tak.

984
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:56,916
Have you had dinner?

985
00:59:58,756 --> 01:00:00,876
I worked in this house for 10 years.

986
01:00:02,123 --> 01:00:04,796
I even know how many spoons you have.

987
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:12,076
Your housekeeper must be lazy.

988
01:00:12,616 --> 01:00:14,276
Nothing has changed.

989
01:00:16,849 --> 01:00:18,116
Jae-hee.

990
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,358
It's been a while.

991
01:00:27,222 --> 01:00:28,996
Since you last called me by name.

992
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:34,436
What are you playing at?

993
01:00:35,823 --> 01:00:38,304
Why are you pretending like
you can't remember?

994
01:00:40,556 --> 01:00:42,676
You saw Bo-yeong...

995
01:00:43,236 --> 01:00:45,496
...for the last time in this house.

996
01:01:15,243 --> 01:01:16,543
Gu-tak.

997
01:01:18,563 --> 01:01:20,233
What's wrong?

998
01:01:22,742 --> 01:01:24,167
Bo-yeong...

999
01:01:26,589 --> 01:01:28,440
...was killed by us.

1000
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:22,404
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

1001
01:02:22,759 --> 01:02:25,059
<i>That doesn't make sense.</i>

1002
01:02:27,131 --> 01:02:29,103
<i>Su-oh?</i>

1003
01:02:29,182 --> 01:02:31,958
<i>Bo-yeong... Who could've killed her?</i>

1004
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:34,247
<i>I think I saw something.</i>

1005
01:02:34,271 --> 01:02:35,908
<i>What did you see?</i>

1006
01:02:36,102 --> 01:02:38,402
<i>Can they reopen the case?</i>

1007
01:02:38,432 --> 01:02:40,087
<i>Please reopen the case.</i>

1008
01:02:40,087 --> 01:02:41,981
<i>You know it's impossible</i>
<i>to reopen the case.</i>

1009
01:02:41,981 --> 01:02:43,889
<i>Will you be held responsible?</i>

1010
01:02:44,404 --> 01:02:47,092
<i>I finally found a clue...</i>

1011
01:02:47,207 --> 01:02:50,957
<i>Bo-yeong would've resented us</i>
<i>as she died.</i>

1012
01:02:50,957 --> 01:02:53,594
<i>Why are you bringing this up</i>
<i>all of a sudden?</i>

1013
01:02:53,594 --> 01:02:54,859
<i>I'm going to kill him.</i>

1014
01:02:54,859 --> 01:02:57,816
<i>I won't let my daughter's killer</i>
<i>get away with it!</i>

1015
01:02:57,872 --> 01:02:59,880
<i>I think there's a witness.</i>

1016
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:02,690
<i>I'm going all the way to the end.</i>

1017
01:03:02,811 --> 01:03:04,950
<i>Are you saying I made you into a criminal?</i>

1018
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,464
<i>It's all in the past now.</i>

1019
01:03:06,464 --> 01:03:08,764
<i>Where were you 10 years ago?</i>
