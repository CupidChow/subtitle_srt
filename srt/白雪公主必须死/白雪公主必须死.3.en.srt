1
00:00:33,552 --> 00:00:34,604
Go!

2
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>It was the day after the CSAT.</i>

3
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:38,514
<i>So I told my friends that</i>

4
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,142
<i>we should drink at my house.</i>

5
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,463
<i>I was supposed to buy groceries
with Da-eun,</i>

6
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:45,138
<i>but she hadn't come to school that day
and couldn't be reached.</i>

7
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:47,178
You're just doing this
because of Da-eun.

8
00:00:47,202 --> 00:00:48,603
She's...

9
00:00:49,164 --> 00:00:50,486
A slut.

10
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,600
<i>So I canceled all the plans
I had with my friends...</i>

11
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:53,404
<i>...and just drank alone at my house.</i>

12
00:00:56,134 --> 00:00:57,575
Bo-yeong...

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,702
And the victim might not be just one,

14
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,354
but two or even more.

15
00:01:00,378 --> 00:01:01,600
Mr. Goh Jeong-woo.

16
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:03,491
You are under arrest on suspicion of
murder of Shim Bo-yeong and Park Da-eun...

17
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:05,900
...and abandonment of their dead bodies.

18
00:01:05,924 --> 00:01:08,707
You became dead drunk
the night before last...

19
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:10,156
...and went to the warehouse, right?

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,039
No.

21
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:12,996
Please find my Bo-yeong.

22
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,906
Find Bo-yeong! You bastard!

23
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:17,997
And killed Shim Bo-yeong
and Park Da-eun there!

24
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,129
Gu-tak.

25
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:19,755
THE DOCK

26
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,609
The accused is sentenced to 10 years.

27
00:01:24,662 --> 00:01:27,781
It must've been really tough.

28
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:29,620
About the new team head
who's coming tomorrow...

29
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:30,292
He's coming here
because he caused trouble.

30
00:01:30,316 --> 00:01:32,566
Supposedly, he beats people
to a pulp like a gangster would.

31
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,999
Oh, come on. Look at the world
we're living in now.

32
00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:36,820
We can't even hit criminals
without a reason.

33
00:01:36,844 --> 00:01:38,860
You can't just crash a car
and run away.

34
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:40,426
Hey.

35
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,417
Look here.

36
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:42,349
Do you know about
the major crime unit?

37
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:43,578
So what?

38
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,538
You bastard.

39
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:47,384
How could you do that
to my daughter?

40
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:50,048
Where did you put my daughter
after killing her?

41
00:01:50,072 --> 00:01:52,052
The moment you became a murderer,

42
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:54,076
you stopped being my son.

43
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:56,414
Don't you dare step foot
in this place ever again.

44
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:57,754
Nobody welcomes you here.

45
00:01:57,778 --> 00:01:58,774
Hey, Jeong-woo!

46
00:01:58,798 --> 00:02:00,118
Goh Jeong-woo!

47
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:01,007
Have you been well?

48
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:02,584
Hey, Jeong-woo!

49
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,084
Jeong-woo, remember
what I told you before?

50
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:07,807
That if anything happens to you,

51
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:10,129
think of me as your father
and come to me.

52
00:02:10,153 --> 00:02:11,329
Uncle.

53
00:02:11,353 --> 00:02:12,934
Is Su-oh doing well?

54
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:15,849
What kind of a person
was Goh Jeong-woo?

55
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:18,983
He seems too confident for a murderer.

56
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,289
Jeong-woo's mom got into
an accident.

57
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:23,045
What accident?

58
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:25,560
She fell from the overpass,
and is unconscious.

59
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:29,387
Show me what the Major Crime Unit
can do.

60
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:31,203
I don't think it was an accident.

61
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,257
I'm going to find the person...

62
00:02:33,282 --> 00:02:34,432
...who did that to mom.

63
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,363
Where were you this morning?

64
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:42,425
Let's go.

65
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:46,171
Let's go.

66
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:02,243
This is amazing!

67
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,199
Let's go!

68
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:19,676
Wait a minute!

69
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:26,340
Let's go! Let's go!

70
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:27,773
Faster!

71
00:03:27,797 --> 00:03:31,101
Hey, we're out of gas.
Let's go back.

72
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:38,428
Min-su.

73
00:03:46,097 --> 00:03:47,230
Byeong-mu...

74
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,733
Jeong-woo.

75
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:16,285
Bo-yeong.

76
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,255
Jeong-woo.

77
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:24,364
Bo-yeong!

78
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:33,361
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

79
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:34,598
EPISODE 3

80
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:37,449
{\an8}If you don't want to get stabbed,
don't say a word and just leave.

81
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:39,639
{\an8}- Let me just ask a few questions.
- Get out.

82
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:41,011
{\an8}Get out, get out.

83
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:43,533
{\an8}How dare a murderer
go around here? Darn.

84
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:45,228
{\an8}He killed two people.

85
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,340
{\an8}Remember that murder case?

86
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:50,130
{\an8}The one they couldn't find the bodies.
He's the murderer.

87
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:53,073
{\an8}You vermin!
You're not even human!

88
00:04:53,097 --> 00:04:54,188
{\an8}How scary.

89
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:56,703
{\an8}Do you remember who bought this?

90
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:00,702
{\an8}Oh, on the pedestrian overpass.

91
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:03,407
{\an8}But who might you be?

92
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:06,500
{\an8}I'm her son.

93
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,645
{\an8}I remember.

94
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,625
{\an8}She was very particular about
choosing the clothes.

95
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:15,189
{\an8}It almost took her 30 minutes
to pick a single shirt.

96
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:18,298
{\an8}May I see...

97
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,468
...the security camera footage
from around here?

98
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:26,678
The police took all of it away.

99
00:06:26,963 --> 00:06:29,451
- Why are you following me?
- Oh, wait, wait.

100
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,291
It's me.

101
00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:33,315
The detective.

102
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:36,885
Are you all right?

103
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:38,623
Oh.

104
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,900
These are the last things
my mom purchased.

105
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,300
Meat and a shirt.

106
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:47,258
It can't be suicide.
Please take a look.

107
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:51,887
So this is how you choose
to threaten me?

108
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:55,193
I know you have your doubts...

109
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,828
Why are you following me?

110
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:01,073
It seems like you have a lot
to say to me.

111
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:02,619
Well, how about we get some drinks?

112
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:05,249
Why?

113
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:08,105
Is that because you
go through a black out?

114
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,077
Yes, that's why I quit drinking
10 years ago.

115
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:11,664
Still!

116
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,447
You have to remember.

117
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:16,039
You need to find your friends.

118
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:20,898
All criminal scum are the same.

119
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:23,500
All they do is scheme
how to get away.

120
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:25,640
They always say they have no memory,
or they don't know...

121
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:27,664
They always make up excuses
or plead the Fifth.

122
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:29,040
You're no different.

123
00:07:29,837 --> 00:07:31,914
I've been curious about this
since last time.

124
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:35,175
Why do you keep
talking down to me, punk?

125
00:07:37,768 --> 00:07:39,773
That's how I speak
to all criminal scum.

126
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:45,093
I'll find the culprit who hurt my mom.

127
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,369
No.

128
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:48,914
That's not who you have to find.

129
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:51,383
You just find your dead friends.

130
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:54,422
You murderer scum.

131
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,764
NA-GYEOM

132
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:07,567
Hello?

133
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:10,359
I'll go there now.

134
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:18,093
Don't you follow me.

135
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,528
Damn, this is making me mad.

136
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:30,696
How the hell did he know
I was following him?

137
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:39,623
<i>It was raining, but he ran
without using his umbrella?</i>

138
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:41,609
<i>Why?</i>

139
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,566
BIG CLOTHES FASHION

140
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,714
<i>Byeong-mu's father
might know something.</i>

141
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,658
<i>Everyone in this village seems
to despise Goh Jeong-woo.</i>

142
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:09,602
<i>And...</i>

143
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:10,627
Jeong-woo...

144
00:09:11,414 --> 00:09:12,806
...isn't a victim.

145
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,740
<i>Goh Jeong-woo who
just got out of prison...</i>

146
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:16,540
<i>...must have been the trigger.</i>

147
00:09:16,564 --> 00:09:18,006
He's a murderer.

148
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,421
<i>Everyone is a suspect.</i>

149
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,596
<i>Everyone in this village.</i>

150
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,974
<i>This is getting interesting.</i>

151
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:52,757
CEO, I've decided.

152
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:56,304
"Snow White".

153
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,030
I've read it and it's interesting.

154
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:00,457
Okay.

155
00:11:27,056 --> 00:11:29,753
CHUNGJU WEEDAHM INTEGRATIVE HOSPITAL

156
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:34,932
Excuse me. Where is the patient
who was staying here?

157
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,115
Did she die, by any chance?

158
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:40,404
Did she?

159
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,155
No, she was transferred.

160
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,649
How did she get so bad?

161
00:11:57,664 --> 00:11:59,331
I was thoughtless.

162
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:02,317
I should've looked out
for your mother sooner.

163
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:05,740
You should have contacted me
right away.

164
00:12:05,764 --> 00:12:07,373
What is wrong with you?

165
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:08,397
I'm sorry...

166
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:12,473
What about the thing I requested?

167
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:13,753
- Hanguk University Hospital?
- Yes.

168
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:14,952
It shouldn't be too long.

169
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:17,476
I made some calls on my way here.

170
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,409
Thank you, CEO.

171
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:23,549
You're here.

172
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,412
What happened?

173
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,444
Oh, I'll go and buy more beverages.

174
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:31,402
There isn't any coffee...

175
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:35,340
I thought it'd be better for her
to receive intensive treatment here...

176
00:12:35,364 --> 00:12:37,042
...rather than being in the ICU.

177
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:38,069
Who's this?

178
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:42,127
My CEO helped out a lot.

179
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,240
Thank you.

180
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,527
Then...

181
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:50,678
Is that his mother?

182
00:12:51,497 --> 00:12:53,771
And how do you two know each other?

183
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:56,472
We're friends.

184
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:04,223
Let's step out for a chat, Na-gyeom.

185
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:09,159
I'm screwed.

186
00:13:10,142 --> 00:13:11,440
Should I change jobs?

187
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:18,379
Hmm, let's go over each point
one by one.

188
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,465
This isn't the right time
for you to be in an independent film.

189
00:13:24,643 --> 00:13:27,707
Sure you didn't choose that script
because the location's near here?

190
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:29,996
The person lying down on the bed...

191
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,832
...isn't your mother,

192
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,676
but that boy's mother.

193
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:36,822
Well, now.

194
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:40,910
How should I interpret this situation?

195
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,340
CEO...

196
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:49,520
My friend's mother is in
critical condition.

197
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:52,748
I need to help him.

198
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,045
Right?

199
00:13:57,653 --> 00:13:58,889
That's what this is, right?

200
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:01,645
You're helping out a friend, right?

201
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:09,465
Su-oh.

202
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:11,746
Su-oh?

203
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:17,910
Do you want ice cream?

204
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,025
What is it that you're drawing?

205
00:14:27,455 --> 00:14:29,622
Geez. I won't look.

206
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:35,304
Su-oh.

207
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:37,079
Do you want to go hiking with me?

208
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:39,244
The kitchen lady got into an accident,

209
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:41,268
so we're closing for a day or two.

210
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:45,246
We could go look at flowers.

211
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,612
We could enjoy the sky.

212
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,112
You can take your things
and paint as well.

213
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:51,046
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

214
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,346
We'll visit the kitchen lady
in the hospital on our way back.

215
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,246
- Jeong-woo's mom?
- Yes.

216
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,312
The fact that she hasn't gained
consciousness yet...

217
00:14:59,336 --> 00:15:01,203
...means she must be in a bad condition.

218
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:04,979
I'm busy, you should go there alone.

219
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:08,158
- It's because of this painting, right?
- Stop that.

220
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:09,146
Show me what it is.

221
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:11,049
- Give that back to me then.
- Stop.

222
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:15,215
Gosh, why are you acting so cheap?

223
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,831
I'm cheap.

224
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:37,468
When's Professor Yun getting here?

225
00:15:39,414 --> 00:15:41,614
I said when's
Professor Yun getting here!

226
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:46,492
Geez.

227
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:49,299
You moron!

228
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,840
You said she had an aortic rupture?

229
00:15:55,865 --> 00:15:56,870
Sorry?

230
00:15:57,402 --> 00:15:58,980
Yes, sir...

231
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,215
This isn't an easy operation.

232
00:16:01,803 --> 00:16:03,946
- Make sure you explain properly.
- Sorry?

233
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,189
Wait...

234
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,203
Wasn't this an appendectomy?

235
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,027
Can't you do anything right?

236
00:16:13,303 --> 00:16:14,340
I'm sorry, sir.

237
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,570
Just wrap this up and
you take a few days off.

238
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,747
04:20 p.m.

239
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,778
Mr. Ju Won has passed away.

240
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,545
You dare let those med student scrubs
question the professor's surgery?

241
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,212
And if that's not bad enough, what?

242
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:33,287
Victim?

243
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,902
They say he's a victim.

244
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,312
A victim?

245
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:40,479
They say he's a victim!

246
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:42,367
That we need to apologize!

247
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:46,246
Damn it!

248
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:54,793
It's so peaceful.

249
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,983
JEONG GEUM-HEE

250
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:31,753
MUCHEON SARANG HOSPITAL

251
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:45,707
Mr. Yang.

252
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:50,746
You're here because of my mom, right?

253
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,803
I'm cleaning.

254
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,836
You're a witness.

255
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:57,950
Please be truthful about...

256
00:17:57,975 --> 00:17:59,509
...what you saw that day.

257
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,859
Mr. Yang, there must be a reason
why you came here.

258
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:04,877
Why are you lying?

259
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,387
Why are you doing this? Darn it!

260
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:11,149
Mr. Yang.

261
00:18:11,236 --> 00:18:13,570
MEN'S TOILET

262
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,970
Why are you hiding it?

263
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,629
The chief and Byeong-mu
are both cops, so why?

264
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:28,445
What has Byeong-mu got to do with this?

265
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,856
My mom didn't do anything wrong.

266
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:35,512
How dare you mention my son's name?

267
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:40,371
Please, I'm begging you.

268
00:18:40,677 --> 00:18:43,877
Please, just disappear.

269
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,817
You don't belong here!

270
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:50,994
If you just disappear,

271
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,258
nothing will go wrong!

272
00:18:54,103 --> 00:18:55,270
Tell me...

273
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:02,739
Oh, how cute.

274
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:05,902
Doggy.

275
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:07,875
Hi.

276
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,299
- Isn't she cute?
- Yes!

277
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:10,623
Her name's Bok-sun.

278
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:13,137
Bok-sun, she's taking a photo.
Say cheese!

279
00:19:14,411 --> 00:19:15,584
Look here.

280
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:29,390
Excuse me, sir.
But where did you get that bone?

281
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:32,429
It's a pork hock
from the drain over there.

282
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:36,730
Bok-sun has such a great sense of smell.

283
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,612
Don't you, now?

284
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:47,782
No.

285
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,940
Not at Mucheon Garden.

286
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:52,837
I'll see you at home.

287
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:55,824
I'll see you at your home.

288
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:12,460
<i>Let's retrace the steps of
Jeong Geum-hee on that day.</i>

289
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,641
<i>Jeong Geum-hee
went to the clothing store.</i>

290
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:22,403
<i>Then at what point did
the culprit start following her?</i>

291
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,397
Hello.

292
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:54,620
I'm here from the
Mucheon Police Station.

293
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:26,976
Just this, please.

294
00:21:43,946 --> 00:21:46,411
MUCHEON POLICE STATION

295
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:49,003
Oh, this is Bo-yeong's mom.

296
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:51,890
Yes.

297
00:21:53,036 --> 00:21:54,048
Yes.

298
00:22:05,036 --> 00:22:07,488
Why isn't anyone home?

299
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:08,613
Huh?

300
00:22:08,637 --> 00:22:12,186
It's dinnertime, where is everyone?

301
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:13,949
Hey, Bo-yeong!

302
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,714
Bo-yeong's mom!

303
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:18,210
Geez. I'm dying of starvation,
where is she?

304
00:22:18,234 --> 00:22:20,667
- Bo-yeong, my mom says...
- Hey, Bo-yeong!

305
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:23,505
That you can come over
with your mom for steamed crab.

306
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:24,930
I totally forgot about it.

307
00:22:26,943 --> 00:22:29,101
I'll call your mom. Let's go, okay?

308
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:31,554
Let's go.

309
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,476
Come on.

310
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,997
- Heung-su.
- Yes.

311
00:22:47,536 --> 00:22:48,902
What brings you here?

312
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:51,545
Chu-ho's here as well.

313
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,612
Is that right?

314
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:54,767
Are we having a
neighborhood meeting or something?

315
00:22:57,921 --> 00:22:58,813
Where were you off to?

316
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,591
I should at least do some work.

317
00:23:01,203 --> 00:23:03,582
I'm the only one earning a living
in this house.

318
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:06,079
I have to send Hye-yeong money
for her overseas study.

319
00:23:06,103 --> 00:23:08,152
Right, you're doing a great job.

320
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:10,246
I'll let you go.

321
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:12,012
- All right, have fun.
- Yeah.

322
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:13,103
Bye.

323
00:23:15,634 --> 00:23:17,525
<i>So that's Bo-yeong's house now.</i>

324
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:21,676
<i>But why did Byeong-mu's dad come here?</i>

325
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:24,679
Have a drink.

326
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,279
I need to drive.

327
00:23:26,303 --> 00:23:27,369
Oh, you're here.

328
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:28,610
Sit down.

329
00:23:38,154 --> 00:23:40,512
- Byeong-mu!
- Hello.

330
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:43,312
- Hello, Detective!
- Oh, hello.

331
00:23:43,336 --> 00:23:44,512
- It's nice to meet you.
- Same.

332
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:46,406
Even if you don't take out
any other policy,

333
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,412
you must take out this one.

334
00:23:48,436 --> 00:23:50,612
This is a comprehensive package
that includes medical expenses.

335
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:52,279
And it guarantees up to 90%!

336
00:23:52,303 --> 00:23:54,599
You'd be a fool not to take it.

337
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,579
Wow.

338
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,760
You're so good at explaining this!

339
00:24:00,101 --> 00:24:02,910
Has anybody told you that
you resemble Kim Hee-sun?

340
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,191
About three times?

341
00:24:09,443 --> 00:24:12,046
I'll have a think about this
and give you a call.

342
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,712
Can I have your phone?
I'll put my number in.

343
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:14,846
I can give you my business card.

344
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,346
Hey, come now.

345
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,867
No one exchanges business cards
in this day and age.

346
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:22,042
We're like family,
we can just exchange numbers.

347
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:23,896
Everyone does that these days.

348
00:24:25,326 --> 00:24:26,773
Is that right?

349
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,257
- Here.
- Thank you.

350
00:24:29,062 --> 00:24:32,086
Oh, how do you open this?

351
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,743
- Oh, like this.
- Right.

352
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:38,933
Mrs. Lee, would you like some cake?

353
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:40,764
This place has the best cake.

354
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:41,722
Is that right?

355
00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:44,047
All this talk is giving me
a sugar craving.

356
00:24:44,072 --> 00:24:45,438
- I'll go buy some cake.
- Sure.

357
00:24:45,463 --> 00:24:46,729
- We'll be right back.
- Okay.

358
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:51,294
RECENT

359
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:56,500
Why did you do that
to Jeong-woo's mom?

360
00:25:00,636 --> 00:25:02,691
What, what do you mean?

361
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:04,309
I saw you.

362
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:06,996
I saw you push her over.

363
00:25:09,003 --> 00:25:10,003
What?

364
00:25:11,222 --> 00:25:12,222
Is that true?

365
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:14,711
No.

366
00:25:14,736 --> 00:25:16,946
Jeong-woo said he would leave!

367
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,903
You could have waited
just one more day! Why...

368
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,093
Hey, what are you talking about?

369
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,167
Are you saying this because
I harassed Jeong-woo's mom?

370
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:30,779
Geez, if you're feeling that upset
about this,

371
00:25:30,803 --> 00:25:34,179
you should go and clean her stool
and take care of her.

372
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:35,047
Damn it!

373
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:36,812
Hey, come on.

374
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,145
If you suspect me that much...

375
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,256
Then fine.

376
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,446
Just report me to the police. Go on.

377
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,746
Do it.

378
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,089
- What are you waiting for? Do it!
- I'm...

379
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:48,974
...holding back because of Bo-yeong.

380
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:51,302
Damn it.

381
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:54,449
Just throw that away.

382
00:25:57,503 --> 00:25:59,112
What?

383
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:00,693
Hey, come on.

384
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,120
Geez!

385
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,170
Hey, what's going on here? Huh?

386
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:12,114
Are you certain?
Are you certain about this?

387
00:26:15,012 --> 00:26:17,317
I'm sure he'll take care of it
after what I just said.

388
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,444
That punk.

389
00:26:21,069 --> 00:26:24,846
Darn it, you're on his side,
and yet he's flipping out.

390
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,379
You shouldn't have helped him out.

391
00:26:26,403 --> 00:26:28,099
Just report him now, it's not too late.

392
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:29,679
You can just call Byeong-mu.

393
00:26:29,703 --> 00:26:31,012
No.

394
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:32,279
Don't you get it?

395
00:26:32,303 --> 00:26:35,246
What? Stop beating around the bush.

396
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,636
Just tell it to me straight.

397
00:26:38,203 --> 00:26:41,714
If Dong-min gets arrested,
Jeong-woo will...

398
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,996
...try to settle down here
with his mom.

399
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,670
No way, we can't have that.

400
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:50,956
I cannot live with that murderer.

401
00:26:54,303 --> 00:26:55,303
<i>Husband?</i>

402
00:26:55,936 --> 00:26:58,303
This one's good. So is the tiramisu.

403
00:26:59,146 --> 00:27:00,478
I should get the tiramisu.

404
00:27:00,503 --> 00:27:01,247
- Tiramisu?
- Yes.

405
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:02,379
- Should we do that?
- Yes.

406
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:03,455
Ma'am.

407
00:27:04,112 --> 00:27:05,811
I've just been called to duty.

408
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:07,379
But what about the insurance?

409
00:27:07,403 --> 00:27:09,679
Oh, I'll sleep on it and call you.

410
00:27:09,703 --> 00:27:10,846
Oh, right.

411
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,012
- Sorry about this.
- It's okay.

412
00:27:12,036 --> 00:27:12,747
Let's go.

413
00:27:12,771 --> 00:27:13,912
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

414
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:15,379
- Sorry.
- Give me a call.

415
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:16,662
- I will.
- Bye.

416
00:27:17,562 --> 00:27:20,628
Are you really going to reinvestigate
the overpass case?

417
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,746
Yeah.

418
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:27,246
It doesn't feel right to ignore it
when we have a suspect.

419
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,197
- Don't you all agree?
- Yes.

420
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:29,212
That's true but...

421
00:27:29,236 --> 00:27:32,401
Can we really do this without
reporting to the section chief?

422
00:27:32,803 --> 00:27:34,945
It's clearly possible if we
base it on conviction.

423
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,903
Yeah, it feels dirty to ignore,
after everything we've seen.

424
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,066
That's what I'm saying.

425
00:27:40,794 --> 00:27:43,917
We just need to find
one more clue from now on.

426
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:46,069
Shall we begin?

427
00:27:46,094 --> 00:27:47,094
Yes, sir.

428
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:48,736
Let's go.

429
00:27:56,464 --> 00:27:58,264
Huh? I've found it.

430
00:27:59,603 --> 00:28:00,479
I've found it, I've found it!

431
00:28:00,503 --> 00:28:01,480
- You found it?
- Yes.

432
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:03,212
- Here, here.
- Did you find it?

433
00:28:03,236 --> 00:28:04,912
- Here, here.
- Let me take a look.

434
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:06,065
Here.

435
00:28:06,636 --> 00:28:08,512
It's Bo-yeong's dad!
It's definitely him!

436
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:09,413
- Good job.
- Thank you.

437
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,041
Okay. We're going to check
all the security cameras...

438
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,812
...in the shops and on the roads
along the route the suspect took.

439
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:16,846
You and I will scan
all the nearby shops.

440
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,870
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

441
00:28:25,254 --> 00:28:29,220
HANAREUM MART

442
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,170
Geez.

443
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:52,103
Damn it.

444
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,954
Hey, you punk. Give that back.

445
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:12,726
This is what you wore that day, right?

446
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:14,841
Hand it over, you rude bastard...

447
00:30:14,865 --> 00:30:16,220
Why did you do that to my mom?

448
00:30:18,896 --> 00:30:19,896
What?

449
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:21,765
Then what about you?

450
00:30:21,804 --> 00:30:23,441
Why did you do that to my Bo-yeong?

451
00:30:24,036 --> 00:30:26,513
When I think of Bo-yeong,
I feel so sorry...

452
00:30:26,537 --> 00:30:28,617
...that I can't even swallow any food.

453
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:29,846
But you...

454
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,246
How can you be
so calm and collected?

455
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,146
Then slit my throat,

456
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:37,046
smash my head in,

457
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,046
or stab me in the gut and kill me.

458
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,736
You should've done it to me.

459
00:30:41,822 --> 00:30:43,622
Why would you harm my innocent mom?

460
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:48,212
You can't do that to my mom...
Why did you do that to my mom?

461
00:30:48,236 --> 00:30:49,236
Yes.

462
00:30:50,003 --> 00:30:52,646
It should be you
in the hospital right now,

463
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,346
not your mom.

464
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,479
It should be you!

465
00:30:55,503 --> 00:30:57,474
You bastard!

466
00:30:57,976 --> 00:31:00,243
Hand it over, hand it over.

467
00:31:01,731 --> 00:31:03,646
Hand it over, you bastard!

468
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,980
Hand it over...

469
00:31:05,004 --> 00:31:06,004
Hand it...

470
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,530
You...

471
00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:15,279
You...

472
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:16,536
Yeah.

473
00:31:21,648 --> 00:31:22,701
Kill me.

474
00:31:23,162 --> 00:31:24,495
Kill you?

475
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,686
All right, I'll kill you...

476
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,120
You're dead today.

477
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,433
You bastard!

478
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:34,576
Shim Dong-min!

479
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,544
Calm down and drop your weapon.

480
00:31:35,568 --> 00:31:37,176
- Grab him.
- What's this?

481
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,015
- Who is it?
- Mr. Shim.

482
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:40,413
- Mr. Shim.
- Let go!

483
00:31:40,438 --> 00:31:42,605
You're under arrest for the
attempted murder of Jeong Geum-hee.

484
00:31:42,629 --> 00:31:44,361
What are you talking about, you jerk?

485
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,344
Just go quietly.

486
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:46,609
Byeong-mu,
what are you doing right now?

487
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:48,546
- Just go quietly.
- Don't you know who I am?

488
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:50,321
- Go quietly.
- Jeong-woo, you bastard!

489
00:31:50,345 --> 00:31:51,889
I told you already!

490
00:31:51,913 --> 00:31:53,590
They're clothes, shoes and a hat.

491
00:31:53,614 --> 00:31:55,114
Right, collect all of that.

492
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:56,395
Hey!

493
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,259
Let go of me, you punks!

494
00:32:09,186 --> 00:32:10,555
Look.

495
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,337
Look how much the people here hate you.

496
00:32:15,873 --> 00:32:17,377
Your mom, Ms. Jeong Geum-hee...

497
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:19,755
Right.

498
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,387
It was because of you.

499
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:25,141
Everything happened because of you.

500
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,883
You...

501
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:29,313
...have no right to blame anyone.

502
00:32:56,991 --> 00:32:58,055
YANG BYEONG-MU

503
00:33:00,922 --> 00:33:02,430
Chief! Chief!

504
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:03,455
What is it?

505
00:33:03,487 --> 00:33:05,994
We got the real culprit
behind the overpass case.

506
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:11,160
- What?
- You'll be shocked to hear this...

507
00:33:11,968 --> 00:33:15,172
But it's Shim Bo-yeong's father.
The girl that Goh Jeong-woo killed.

508
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,576
Shim Dong-min?

509
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Yes.

510
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:21,777
Are you sure?

511
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:25,719
Well, I mean, he did hold a grudge
against him so...

512
00:33:25,744 --> 00:33:27,681
It could've been revenge...

513
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:30,358
The Major Crime Unit...

514
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,103
Gosh, he truly is talented.

515
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:38,743
Hey, go home and get some rest,
will you?

516
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,596
You look terrible right now.

517
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,686
Byeong-mu.

518
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:43,773
About Bo-yeong's father...

519
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:46,035
They began investigating him, right?

520
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:47,903
I'll call you, okay? Please go home.

521
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:49,516
Byeong-mu.

522
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,776
Right, did you bring it?

523
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,083
This is a human bone, right?

524
00:33:56,107 --> 00:33:59,117
Well, I showed that photo
of yours to Forensics,

525
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:00,807
and they told me to bring it in.

526
00:34:01,214 --> 00:34:03,290
I think the heavy rain must've
brought it down from somewhere.

527
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:05,423
I did hear that a few
of the unmarked graves...

528
00:34:05,447 --> 00:34:07,081
...up on the mountain were damaged.

529
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,057
But why did you go to Cheonsu Village?

530
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,247
I just went to visit a sacred place.

531
00:34:14,414 --> 00:34:16,690
Let's get lunch together next time.

532
00:34:16,714 --> 00:34:17,714
Sure.

533
00:34:18,647 --> 00:34:19,823
Jeong-woo, go on.

534
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:20,864
Yeah.

535
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:23,703
Excuse me.

536
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:29,291
I overheard your conversation
with Byeong-mu.

537
00:34:29,315 --> 00:34:30,411
That bone...

538
00:34:34,423 --> 00:34:35,656
I'm sorry.

539
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:38,234
Let me just ask you one thing.

540
00:34:39,105 --> 00:34:40,305
That bone...

541
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:43,405
Where did you find it?

542
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,173
Oh, wait.
There are several drains there.

543
00:34:54,314 --> 00:34:55,423
Oh, whatever.

544
00:34:55,447 --> 00:34:57,357
It's none of my business.

545
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:06,081
MUCHEON POLICE STATION

546
00:35:40,437 --> 00:35:42,084
As I explained,

547
00:35:42,332 --> 00:35:46,255
all the evidence and circumstances
point toward you, sir.

548
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:48,827
It wasn't me.

549
00:35:50,135 --> 00:35:51,634
Bring Goh Jeong-woo here.

550
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:53,619
Bring the bastard
who killed my daughter.

551
00:35:54,525 --> 00:35:56,221
Did you do it because of Goh Jeong-woo?

552
00:35:57,638 --> 00:35:59,279
It obviously wasn't me.

553
00:36:06,383 --> 00:36:08,513
Doing this will only
put you at a disadvantage.

554
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:12,881
Sir, you got out of a taxi
at 10 a.m. yesterday and...

555
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:16,334
...followed Ms. Jeong Geum-hee
up the overpass, right?

556
00:36:16,747 --> 00:36:17,927
Where's the police chief?

557
00:36:18,881 --> 00:36:20,457
Where's Gu-tak?

558
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,610
Gu-tak!

559
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:29,839
Gu-tak.

560
00:36:30,847 --> 00:36:32,061
Gu-tak.

561
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:34,709
Gu-tak! Gu-tak!

562
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:36,890
Geez.

563
00:36:36,914 --> 00:36:38,009
Gu-tak!

564
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:39,943
I guess he's trying to
grasp at straws...

565
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:43,865
Do I look like straw to you?

566
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:47,041
Oh, no, sir. I didn't mean that.

567
00:36:47,388 --> 00:36:48,350
I mean...

568
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:51,173
It's just that you two are very close...

569
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:56,193
- Section Chief Kim.
- Yes, sir.

570
00:36:56,369 --> 00:36:58,636
If you prioritize connection and
school ties in this tiny village,

571
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,030
you'll get nowhere.

572
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:01,793
Yes, sir.

573
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,107
I'm not like that.

574
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,381
No, of course not.

575
00:37:07,803 --> 00:37:09,068
Do you all understand?

576
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:10,094
Yes, sir.

577
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,498
Police Chief!

578
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:17,060
Where's our police chief? Huh?

579
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:18,414
Gu-tak!

580
00:37:19,014 --> 00:37:20,014
Mr. Shim Dong-min.

581
00:37:20,954 --> 00:37:22,881
The chief's already gone home.

582
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:24,500
He's not here.

583
00:37:30,343 --> 00:37:31,835
He's telling me to go home, right?

584
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:36,145
Gosh.

585
00:37:38,814 --> 00:37:41,490
Oh.

586
00:37:41,523 --> 00:37:43,833
It'd look strange if the
Muncheon Police chief...

587
00:37:43,857 --> 00:37:47,162
...steps in because
it involves the locals.

588
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,780
Isn't that right?

589
00:37:48,805 --> 00:37:51,412
Our police chief
is a morally upright person.

590
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,557
We don't want strange rumors
spreading about him because of you.

591
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,647
Right?

592
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:01,769
Let's go home.

593
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:03,256
Keep up the good work.

594
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:05,072
Yes, sir.

595
00:38:05,097 --> 00:38:06,830
Pay attention.

596
00:38:17,114 --> 00:38:18,906
Hey, Mr. Goh Jeong-woo.

597
00:38:19,914 --> 00:38:23,603
I was told the bone was found
under the drain here.

598
00:38:57,493 --> 00:38:58,716
There's nothing there.

599
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:02,349
I think the water's flowing.

600
00:39:04,225 --> 00:39:05,758
You don't think...

601
00:39:06,438 --> 00:39:09,669
...that bone belongs
to the victim, do you?

602
00:39:13,177 --> 00:39:14,810
Have you been here before?

603
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,236
This is my first time here.

604
00:39:17,009 --> 00:39:18,653
I found this place by asking you.

605
00:39:19,612 --> 00:39:20,624
Oh, right.

606
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:24,334
I'm strange and scary, right?

607
00:39:25,302 --> 00:39:27,268
I'd be lying if I said no.

608
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:29,136
You should get going.

609
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:30,428
Oh, I...

610
00:39:33,562 --> 00:39:34,785
Here.

611
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,959
Take this just in case.

612
00:39:41,886 --> 00:39:43,142
Thank you.

613
00:39:50,379 --> 00:39:52,710
Geez, you can't see in here.

614
00:39:57,664 --> 00:40:00,096
Oh, gosh.

615
00:40:00,121 --> 00:40:02,093
I guess I won't be going home.

616
00:40:02,118 --> 00:40:04,901
So this is the best solution
for a day like today.

617
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,257
You'll get arrested
and indicted, either way.

618
00:40:11,281 --> 00:40:13,341
So just talk to me
when you feel like it.

619
00:40:15,823 --> 00:40:17,378
Is that allowed?

620
00:40:17,403 --> 00:40:19,129
He's completely insane.

621
00:40:21,347 --> 00:40:23,920
What are you playing at now?

622
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,775
I'm just offering you a drink.

623
00:40:30,898 --> 00:40:32,514
What did we do wrong?

624
00:40:33,057 --> 00:40:35,856
Where is my husband?
Where is he?

625
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:37,423
I know Shim Dong-min is in
the interrogation room.

626
00:40:37,447 --> 00:40:38,957
Let us just see him.

627
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:41,037
Visiting hours are over. Please leave.

628
00:40:41,067 --> 00:40:42,932
What are you all doing here?

629
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:48,685
How could you do this to us?

630
00:40:49,148 --> 00:40:52,623
Just seeing that murderer wander
around freely makes my blood boil.

631
00:40:53,341 --> 00:40:54,685
How could you arrest my husband?

632
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:56,959
How can you do this?

633
00:40:57,068 --> 00:40:58,974
Please leave. Everyone, please leave.

634
00:40:59,114 --> 00:41:00,690
It's not like we're strangers.

635
00:41:00,714 --> 00:41:02,923
Just let us see him once.
Why are you being so...

636
00:41:02,947 --> 00:41:03,957
Chu-ho!

637
00:41:03,981 --> 00:41:05,498
We're at the police station.

638
00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:07,912
What you're doing right now
is an obstruction of justice.

639
00:41:09,044 --> 00:41:11,387
We're currently investigating.

640
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:12,723
So please leave for now.

641
00:41:12,747 --> 00:41:15,490
It's late. Come back tomorrow.

642
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,701
We'll conduct the investigation
according to the law...

643
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:19,051
...and proper procedures.

644
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,063
You're not helping by being here.

645
00:41:21,747 --> 00:41:23,170
I won't say this again.

646
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:24,241
Please leave.

647
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:55,102
I would've done the same thing.

648
00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:58,192
As soon as I laid eyes on
Goh Jeong-woo, that jerk's face,

649
00:41:58,217 --> 00:42:00,909
I would've twisted his neck!

650
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:02,552
Geez.

651
00:42:18,243 --> 00:42:20,235
- Hey, Detective.
- Yes, sir.

652
00:42:24,015 --> 00:42:25,342
In the past...

653
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,846
I used to send Bo-yeong
on errands to buy drinks.

654
00:42:33,947 --> 00:42:35,955
<i>I have a younger daughter
named Hye-yeong.</i>

655
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:39,151
<i>She would never go on my drink errands.</i>

656
00:42:40,847 --> 00:42:43,209
<i>- My eldest daughter...</i>
- How many hours has it been?

657
00:42:43,481 --> 00:42:44,965
We can't get a confession today.

658
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,666
She complained about it.

659
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:48,459
But she always did it.

660
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:50,717
She was kind.

661
00:42:51,418 --> 00:42:52,431
She was so...

662
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:54,740
Kind.

663
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:04,623
Gosh, this won't do.

664
00:43:04,647 --> 00:43:06,912
Hey, let's step outside.

665
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:16,951
You don't even smoke,
so why did you follow us out?

666
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:21,333
I know important info
is exchanged on cigarette breaks.

667
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:23,258
You're clever, aren't you?

668
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:26,006
- Want me to tell you a story I heard?
- What is it?

669
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:27,551
Why the team head is still single?

670
00:43:27,575 --> 00:43:29,692
He probably hasn't found
the right person.

671
00:43:30,153 --> 00:43:31,717
He must have high standards, right?

672
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:34,865
His fiancee ran away
on their wedding day.

673
00:43:35,142 --> 00:43:36,384
- For real?
- Wow, that's something else.

674
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:38,275
- She broke it off.
- That's astounding.

675
00:43:40,205 --> 00:43:42,739
If you're hungry,
would you like some rice soup?

676
00:43:43,368 --> 00:43:44,568
Forget it.

677
00:43:45,197 --> 00:43:48,634
Geez, you must be so upset.

678
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:51,263
I can understand how
you wouldn't want to eat.

679
00:43:52,604 --> 00:43:53,725
Gosh.

680
00:43:55,957 --> 00:43:59,021
Hey, hey, you're going to
drink yourself to death.

681
00:43:59,275 --> 00:44:01,408
At least eat something as you drink.

682
00:44:02,732 --> 00:44:03,965
I want to die.

683
00:44:05,196 --> 00:44:06,318
Give it to me.

684
00:44:07,985 --> 00:44:09,088
Give it.

685
00:44:13,075 --> 00:44:15,251
Sure. Let's just all die together.

686
00:44:15,275 --> 00:44:17,342
Alcohol won't solve our problems.

687
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:19,875
Jeong-suk.

688
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:23,721
What can I do?

689
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:25,785
Chu-ho.

690
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,007
What can I do?

691
00:44:42,195 --> 00:44:43,695
You knew about it, right?

692
00:44:44,356 --> 00:44:46,168
That your husband did it.

693
00:44:50,112 --> 00:44:51,709
What does it matter?

694
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,737
The important thing is that
Bo-yeong's dad is under arrest.

695
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:00,918
Yeah, well...

696
00:45:00,942 --> 00:45:03,698
Who cares if you knew or not?

697
00:45:03,946 --> 00:45:05,513
The important thing is getting him out.

698
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:06,746
Aren't I right?

699
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:13,773
Should we ask Gu-tak again?

700
00:45:14,215 --> 00:45:15,327
Forget it!

701
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:32,323
What's up with that Goh Jeong-woo jerk?

702
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:34,344
Just what kind of person...

703
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:35,836
You saw Jeong-woo's face, right?

704
00:45:38,096 --> 00:45:39,914
He looks completely normal.

705
00:45:39,939 --> 00:45:41,000
He was smart too.

706
00:45:41,025 --> 00:45:42,631
He was the top ranked student
in Gyeonggi-do.

707
00:45:42,655 --> 00:45:43,991
He got admitted to Hanguk University
Medical School.

708
00:45:44,015 --> 00:45:45,592
He was the son of the richest family
in our neighborhood.

709
00:45:45,616 --> 00:45:46,862
You know Mucheon Garden, right?

710
00:45:46,887 --> 00:45:48,331
That belonged to his family.

711
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,811
He had nothing to lose.
That's how he ended up like that.

712
00:45:50,836 --> 00:45:52,170
He, he's a...

713
00:45:53,608 --> 00:45:54,841
Psychopath.

714
00:46:13,914 --> 00:46:16,345
That psychopath freak
killed my daughter!

715
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:03,661
Let me have a smoke.

716
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:09,990
Here you all are.
Give me all the smokes you've got.

717
00:47:10,015 --> 00:47:11,138
- Hurry, hurry.
- I don't smoke...

718
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,306
Oh, this one.
Bo-yeong's father smokes this.

719
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,083
- This one here?
- Yes.

720
00:47:14,107 --> 00:47:15,018
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

721
00:47:15,042 --> 00:47:16,421
- Thanks!
- But...

722
00:47:18,553 --> 00:47:21,051
If the accused asks for a smoke,
doesn't it mean he's taken the bait?

723
00:47:21,075 --> 00:47:22,019
Okay!

724
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:24,108
That means he's ready
to confess, right?

725
00:47:34,594 --> 00:47:35,933
What's going on?

726
00:47:36,675 --> 00:47:40,104
But I thought
he served his full sentence.

727
00:47:40,617 --> 00:47:42,395
So why would he now...

728
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,952
I didn't kill them.

729
00:47:44,954 --> 00:47:46,521
I didn't kill them.

730
00:47:47,315 --> 00:47:48,524
I didn't.

731
00:47:48,548 --> 00:47:49,858
That bone...

732
00:47:49,882 --> 00:47:51,336
Where did you find it?

733
00:47:52,548 --> 00:47:55,170
It didn't seem like he was lying...

734
00:47:56,982 --> 00:47:59,698
I'm so curious it's driving me insane.

735
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:21,924
Why did you come back?

736
00:48:21,948 --> 00:48:24,200
Oh, well...

737
00:48:27,887 --> 00:48:30,654
I'm genuinely curious about this.

738
00:48:31,782 --> 00:48:32,927
So...

739
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:35,194
Can you really not remember...

740
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:37,360
...or are you pretending not to?

741
00:48:37,385 --> 00:48:38,572
Or...

742
00:48:39,023 --> 00:48:41,022
Was it not you who did it?

743
00:48:46,615 --> 00:48:48,283
Your name is Ha Seol, right?

744
00:48:48,987 --> 00:48:50,869
What do you think?

745
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:53,248
Me?

746
00:48:53,396 --> 00:48:54,589
Well...

747
00:48:55,948 --> 00:48:58,170
Isn't the case over already?

748
00:48:58,482 --> 00:49:00,295
It isn't over yet for me.

749
00:49:02,248 --> 00:49:03,524
I was so scared,

750
00:49:03,548 --> 00:49:05,108
and so sleepy and hungry,

751
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:07,842
that I said yes to everything
because I wanted to see my parents.

752
00:49:08,967 --> 00:49:10,530
I thought if I did that...

753
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:14,311
...then everything would be okay.
But that wasn't the case.

754
00:49:15,942 --> 00:49:19,011
I'm going to do everything I can
to find out and uncover it.

755
00:49:19,978 --> 00:49:21,292
That is my duty.

756
00:49:22,487 --> 00:49:24,655
And that's the only right
that I have left.

757
00:49:26,845 --> 00:49:29,537
If I did commit the crime,
I'm going to get punished again.

758
00:49:37,405 --> 00:49:39,077
Oh... So...

759
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:41,801
I saw this a while ago.

760
00:49:41,826 --> 00:49:43,858
There's another manhole over there.

761
00:49:45,453 --> 00:49:46,811
Would you like to see it?

762
00:49:57,368 --> 00:49:59,069
Over there.

763
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:55,602
Is that why you followed
Goh Jeong-woo's mother?

764
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:01,190
Seeing how she bought meat
and clothing...

765
00:51:01,215 --> 00:51:03,444
...for that sorry excuse of a son,

766
00:51:03,468 --> 00:51:06,274
I just felt so enraged.

767
00:51:06,299 --> 00:51:08,456
That's why you followed her
to the overpass.

768
00:51:19,228 --> 00:51:20,228
Huh?

769
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:24,009
Jeong-woo's mom! Geum-hee!

770
00:51:25,044 --> 00:51:26,344
Oh...

771
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,810
You bought clothes
for that bastard, Jeong-woo?

772
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,991
You're really despicable.

773
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,491
You acted like you weren't
his mother anymore...

774
00:51:52,515 --> 00:51:55,075
...but now that Jeong-woo is back,
are you all excited and giddy?

775
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,704
So did Jeong-woo confess?

776
00:51:58,544 --> 00:52:01,212
Did he tell you where
he tossed aside my Bo-yeong?

777
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,137
I'm really sorry.

778
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,470
Kick him out right now.

779
00:52:05,495 --> 00:52:07,304
If I lay eyes on him,
I will seriously kill him.

780
00:52:07,328 --> 00:52:09,171
I'll tear him apart
right in front of your eyes...

781
00:52:09,195 --> 00:52:11,618
...and ditch him in the sewer!

782
00:52:16,657 --> 00:52:18,511
I beg you.

783
00:52:19,648 --> 00:52:22,548
Please let me feed him
just one meal.

784
00:52:23,694 --> 00:52:26,344
I couldn't cook for Bo-yeong
or buy her clothes...

785
00:52:26,628 --> 00:52:29,028
...for the past 10 years!

786
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:42,714
And I'll never get to!

787
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,018
What happened?

788
00:52:57,547 --> 00:52:59,504
I couldn't hold back.

789
00:53:02,177 --> 00:53:04,619
It was a mistake.

790
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:09,049
You pushed her from the overpass
by mistake.

791
00:53:50,584 --> 00:53:53,494
How about we hit the rice soup place
near here and then the sauna?

792
00:53:53,518 --> 00:53:54,595
Oh, that sounds great.

793
00:53:54,619 --> 00:53:56,129
- All right.
- A full course.

794
00:53:56,153 --> 00:53:57,630
That sounds great.

795
00:53:57,654 --> 00:54:00,698
- You managed to complete a case.
- You did it, sir.

796
00:54:00,722 --> 00:54:03,072
I didn't think we'd get a confession.

797
00:54:03,096 --> 00:54:04,306
But you got it out of him.

798
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:06,739
No, don't worry about it. It's okay.

799
00:54:06,763 --> 00:54:09,039
- He seemed a bit unsettled...
- No, no.

800
00:54:09,063 --> 00:54:12,798
It's just after being in prison
for 10 years,

801
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,008
he's become a bit weird.

802
00:54:15,165 --> 00:54:16,907
He's changed a lot.

803
00:54:17,097 --> 00:54:17,907
I see.

804
00:54:17,931 --> 00:54:19,163
<i>Oh, yeah, by the way...</i>

805
00:54:21,263 --> 00:54:22,805
Next week,

806
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,360
can you free up some time for dinner?

807
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:29,462
Oh... Well... I'll call you back later.

808
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,326
- Byeong-mu.
- Yes?

809
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:38,618
Was that about Goh Jeong-woo?

810
00:54:38,643 --> 00:54:40,104
Oh, no, it's just...

811
00:54:40,768 --> 00:54:42,188
There's a girl I know
in the neighborhood.

812
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:45,266
She found a humerus bone
that floated down from the rain...

813
00:54:45,299 --> 00:54:46,338
...and reported it.

814
00:54:46,363 --> 00:54:49,540
And apparently Goh Jeong-woo
asked her where she found it.

815
00:54:49,918 --> 00:54:52,860
Is she with him right now?

816
00:54:53,735 --> 00:54:54,802
What?

817
00:54:56,652 --> 00:54:58,477
All of you wait here on standby.

818
00:54:58,673 --> 00:55:00,473
I'll go and get the equipment
and head out first.

819
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:01,107
Wait, Team Head!

820
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,739
What if Goh Jeong-woo
is trying to get rid of evidence...

821
00:55:03,763 --> 00:55:05,639
...in case we find out
where he hid the remains?

822
00:55:05,663 --> 00:55:08,446
And your friend could be in danger.

823
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,819
So stay in touch with her.

824
00:55:09,852 --> 00:55:11,818
Update me as soon as
you find out anything.

825
00:55:11,843 --> 00:55:14,607
Team Head, the bone was found...

826
00:55:15,055 --> 00:55:16,657
...in Cheonsu Village.

827
00:55:16,795 --> 00:55:18,294
That's our neighboring village.

828
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:21,057
We searched through it 10 years ago,
and nothing was found.

829
00:55:21,097 --> 00:55:23,688
That's why I'm saying I'll go first.

830
00:55:24,139 --> 00:55:25,572
Wait, but it's right next door...

831
00:55:25,644 --> 00:55:27,050
Wait...

832
00:55:49,063 --> 00:55:52,563
SHIM BO-YEONG

833
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:06,750
Bo-yeong!

834
00:56:16,201 --> 00:56:20,368
Why... Why are you...

835
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:22,885
Why?

836
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:27,900
I've missed you so much.

837
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,351
I'm sorry.

838
00:56:34,763 --> 00:56:37,801
How could I...

839
00:56:41,837 --> 00:56:45,183
Let you go like that?

840
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:49,175
Sorry.

841
00:56:51,406 --> 00:56:54,751
But you shouldn't be here!

842
00:56:54,776 --> 00:56:56,094
Bo-yeong...

843
00:56:56,118 --> 00:56:59,084
You shouldn't be here!

844
00:57:00,244 --> 00:57:01,244
Excuse me.

845
00:57:01,814 --> 00:57:04,289
- Mr. Goh Jeong-woo.
- Bo-yeong...

846
00:57:05,774 --> 00:57:07,312
Mr. Goh Jeong-woo!

847
00:57:14,716 --> 00:57:17,083
Bo-yeong.

848
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:27,575
Bo-yeong.

849
00:57:29,734 --> 00:57:31,600
SHIM BO-YEONG

850
00:57:36,322 --> 00:57:37,926
Shim Bo-yeong...

851
00:57:51,753 --> 00:57:53,773
Yes, we'll be right there.

852
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:56,681
- Hey!
- Yes.

853
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:59,049
Hey, what's going on here?

854
00:57:59,073 --> 00:58:00,550
What do you mean
a body was discovered?

855
00:58:00,574 --> 00:58:02,485
Sure it's not a prank?

856
00:58:02,509 --> 00:58:05,323
The body had a nametag
with Shim Bo-yeong on it.

857
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:07,590
- What?
- Shim Bo-yeong.

858
00:58:07,615 --> 00:58:09,692
We'll need a thorough analysis
to know for sure.

859
00:58:12,347 --> 00:58:13,695
Shim Bo-yeong?

860
00:58:15,189 --> 00:58:16,589
Hey! What are you waiting for?

861
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:20,239
Call everyone here
who can mobilize with Forensics!

862
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:21,838
They're already ready to go.

863
00:58:22,192 --> 00:58:23,726
Oh... Good job.

864
00:58:25,314 --> 00:58:27,273
The chief! Chief!

865
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:34,766
Housekeeper.

866
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,894
Housekeeper, are you awake?

867
00:58:36,919 --> 00:58:38,718
Oh, yes.

868
00:58:38,743 --> 00:58:40,492
What's going on so early in the morning?

869
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,351
Right.

870
00:58:41,382 --> 00:58:44,582
Make sure Su-oh takes his medicine
as soon as he wakes up.

871
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,773
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

872
00:59:01,476 --> 00:59:03,023
Where are you?

873
00:59:03,048 --> 00:59:05,781
You didn't even put away the board.

874
00:59:05,806 --> 00:59:06,939
Ma'am,

875
00:59:06,964 --> 00:59:09,508
I'm calling from Cheonsu Village.

876
00:59:14,937 --> 00:59:16,170
What?

877
00:59:16,704 --> 00:59:18,444
Yeah, I'm almost there. Hurry over here.

878
00:59:19,176 --> 00:59:21,352
That sly bastard.

879
00:59:28,403 --> 00:59:29,863
Get up.

880
00:59:31,503 --> 00:59:32,503
Huh?

881
00:59:33,697 --> 00:59:35,029
What?

882
00:59:35,054 --> 00:59:36,527
They found her.

883
00:59:37,287 --> 00:59:38,653
Found who?

884
00:59:39,227 --> 00:59:40,528
They found Bo-yeong.

885
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:47,518
Jeong-suk.

886
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:51,312
What did you just say?

887
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,237
They found Bo-yeong.

888
00:59:55,163 --> 00:59:56,442
Bo-yeong?

889
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:59,706
My Bo-yeong?

890
01:00:02,696 --> 01:00:04,626
Where is she?

891
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:06,690
Huh?

892
01:00:08,276 --> 01:00:09,810
Where's Bo-yeong?

893
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:27,339
Where's Goh Jeong-woo?

894
01:00:27,363 --> 01:00:29,678
Yes, he's down below there.

895
01:00:29,884 --> 01:00:31,473
That bastard.

896
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:33,339
But he didn't know where...

897
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,996
It's dangerous, so take a step back.

898
01:00:35,021 --> 01:00:36,456
The police will be arriving soon.

899
01:00:40,857 --> 01:00:42,029
Just stand back.

900
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,645
Bo-yeong...

901
01:00:49,863 --> 01:00:51,101
Bo-yeong...

902
01:01:00,997 --> 01:01:03,097
SHIM BO-YEONG

903
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:06,490
Bo-yeong...

904
01:01:07,556 --> 01:01:09,078
You trying to destroy the evidence?

905
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:12,663
Don't you even dare
lay a finger on that!

906
01:01:12,688 --> 01:01:15,076
Hey, look straight into my eyes.

907
01:01:16,242 --> 01:01:17,664
<i>Jeong-woo...</i>

908
01:01:20,362 --> 01:01:21,700
<i>Jeong-woo...</i>

909
01:01:23,797 --> 01:01:24,707
<i>Jeong-woo...</i>

910
01:01:24,731 --> 01:01:26,239
Goh Jeong-woo, get a hold of yourself.

911
01:01:26,263 --> 01:01:27,240
Get a hold of yourself!

912
01:01:27,264 --> 01:01:28,839
Goh Jeong-woo, you bastard!

913
01:01:28,863 --> 01:01:30,406
Goh Jeong-woo,
get a hold of yourself!

914
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:32,130
She needs to be found!

915
01:01:42,661 --> 01:01:45,813
<i>Thank you for finding me, Jeong-woo.</i>

916
01:01:48,115 --> 01:01:49,233
I'm sorry.

917
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:51,750
I'm sorry.

918
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,227
I'm sorry...

919
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:58,094
You think saying sorry
solves everything?

920
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:00,002
Does that change anything?

921
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,530
Huh?
Is saying sorry all it takes?

922
01:02:07,163 --> 01:02:08,506
She's already dead.

923
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:09,996
She's already dead!

924
01:02:10,021 --> 01:02:13,654
You killed her, you bastard!

925
01:02:14,463 --> 01:02:16,439
You killed her.

926
01:02:16,463 --> 01:02:17,863
Shoot!

927
01:02:18,497 --> 01:02:19,688
Shoot!

928
01:03:04,632 --> 01:03:07,379
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

929
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:11,781
<i>I want to see Bo-yeong!</i>

930
01:03:11,806 --> 01:03:13,564
<i>Bo-yeong.</i>

931
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:16,098
<i>Please catch the killer.</i>

932
01:03:16,123 --> 01:03:17,668
<i>So please stop doing anything
to hurt Bo-yeong...</i>

933
01:03:17,692 --> 01:03:18,764
<i>...any further.</i>

934
01:03:18,789 --> 01:03:20,396
<i>Why are you only telling us
where Shim Bo-yeong is?</i>

935
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,152
<i>Where is Park Da-eun?
Park Da-eun!</i>

936
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:24,824
<i>Goh Jeong-woo!
Take your mom and move away.</i>

937
01:03:24,848 --> 01:03:25,806
<i>Leave with me.</i>

938
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:27,565
<i>I won't leave until I find Da-eun.</i>

939
01:03:27,589 --> 01:03:30,239
<i>And what will change if you find her?</i>

940
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,264
<i>It proves I'm not a murderer.</i>

941
01:03:32,382 --> 01:03:33,503
<i>Evidence.</i>

942
01:03:33,535 --> 01:03:35,500
<i>If only I can find the evidence.</i>

943
01:03:35,525 --> 01:03:38,184
<i>About Goh Jeong-woo's case.
Doesn't it not make sense.</i>

944
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:40,404
<i>It wasn't Jeong-woo.</i>

945
01:03:41,562 --> 01:03:43,562
<i>If I was wrongfully accused...</i>

946
01:03:44,899 --> 01:03:47,501
<i>That means I'm not the killer, right?</i>
