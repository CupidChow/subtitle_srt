00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,593
BYUN YO-HAN

2
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:08,998
GO JOON

00:00:09,493 --> 00:00:12,428
{\an8}KO BO-GYEOL
KIM BO-RA

{\an8}BAE JONG-OK
KWON HAE-HYO

5
00:00:24,134 --> 00:00:26,880
BLACK OUT

6
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:31,500
SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

7
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:34,977
<i>- Chief.
- What is it?</i>

8
00:00:34,978 --> 00:00:37,364
<i>We got the real culprit
behind the overpass case.</i>

9
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:37,877
<i>What?</i>

10
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:40,997
<i>It's Shim Bo-yeong's father.
The girl that Goh Jeong-woo killed.</i>

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,149
<i>Why did you do that to my mom?</i>

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,990
<i>Then what about you?</i>

13
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:44,453
<i>Why did you do
that to my Bo-yeong?</i>

14
00:00:44,454 --> 00:00:47,646
<i>If Dong-min gets
arrested, Jeong-woo will...</i>

15
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:51,102
<i>...try to settle down
here with his mom.</i>

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,271
<i>It wasn't me who killed her.</i>

17
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:54,564
<i>I cannot live with
that murderer.</i>

18
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:56,844
<i>Excuse me, sir.
But where did you get that bone?</i>

19
00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:57,914
<i>They found Bo-yeong.</i>

20
00:00:57,994 --> 00:01:00,034
<i>Where's my daughter?</i>

21
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:03,326
<i>Bo-yeong, it's your mom.</i>

22
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:05,914
<i>Thank you for finding
me, Jeong-woo.</i>

23
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:10,244
<i>You made Goh Jeong-woo confess
to get a reduced sentence, didn't you?</i>

24
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:12,431
<i>Why do your words feel so sharp?</i>

25
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:13,817
<i>What's with your face?</i>

26
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:14,330
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO KILLED ME 11 YEARS AGO

27
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:15,556
<i>Is something going on?</i>

28
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,402
<i>Su-oh painted
something so grotesque.</i>

29
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:19,941
<i>Leave.</i>

30
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:22,555
<i>Su-oh! Su-oh, what's going on?</i>

31
00:01:25,396 --> 00:01:26,442
<i>It was here.</i>

32
00:01:27,282 --> 00:01:28,909
<i>This is where my car was parked.</i>

33
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,436
<i>- I fought with Bo-yeong here.
- Hey, you!</i>

34
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,614
<i>The victim was a
19-year-old student at the time.</i>

35
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,480
<i>So didn't she have any
accessories or a backpack?</i>

36
00:01:36,548 --> 00:01:38,867
<i>Oh, right...
She was missing underwear.</i>

37
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:40,014
<i>Park Da-eun.</i>

38
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:41,835
<i>Well, how about
we get some drinks?</i>

39
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:43,990
<i>Is that because you
go through a black out?</i>

40
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:45,426
<i>Why do you keep
talking down to me, punk?</i>

41
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,190
<i>That's how I speak
to all criminal scum.</i>

42
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:47,937
<i>Get lost!</i>

43
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:49,422
<i>Why do you keep staying here
when you're treated like this?</i>

44
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:50,936
<i>You vermin!
You're not even human!</i>

45
00:01:50,937 --> 00:01:51,815
<i>Leave with me.</i>

46
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:53,796
<i>- I can't leave.</i>
- Why?

47
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:55,896
<i>I won't leave
until I find Da-eun.</i>

48
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:58,998
<i>How far away
did you bury Park Da-eun, huh?</i>

49
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:00,910
<i>Did you throw her
away in another village?</i>

50
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:02,716
<i>Can you really not remember...</i>

51
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:04,913
<i>...or are you pretending not to?</i>

52
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:05,560
<i>Or...</i>

53
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:06,718
<i>I definitely didn't kill them.</i>

54
00:02:06,742 --> 00:02:08,307
<i>It wasn't Jeong-woo.</i>

55
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,658
<i>Does Goh Jeong-woo
really have black outs?</i>

56
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:12,559
<i>I wasn't here when it happened.</i>

57
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:16,108
Jeong-woo, come and eat.

58
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:17,276
I'm not hungry.

59
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:20,109
Come and eat.

60
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,183
I'm not hungry.

61
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,140
Fine then.

62
00:02:24,342 --> 00:02:27,041
But I did make your favorite
seaweed soup and rib patties.

63
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:28,575
I guess I'll just
have to throw it out.

64
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:31,876
Come on, Mom. That's cheating.

65
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:33,354
Get up.

66
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:39,740
Why did your dad have
to buy you a car already?

67
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:42,045
I won't drive it anywhere,
I'm just going to look at it.

68
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:44,141
It's parked right in front
of the warehouse there.

69
00:02:44,142 --> 00:02:45,496
Go and look at it all you like.

70
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:49,541
Mom, cars need to be
driven to be looked at.

71
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:50,620
No.

72
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:52,375
They must be
driven to be looked at.

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,551
No, you can't drive it.

74
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:56,808
- I'm not hungry.
- Huh?

75
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,775
- Seriously.
- Hey.

76
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:03,575
- Hey, hey.
- What's your weak point?

77
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:04,775
- Mom, I apologize.
- Hey, stop.

78
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:05,993
- No, no.
- Mom.

79
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:07,151
Hey, hey, you.

80
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:09,076
I really won't drive
it, I won't drive it.

81
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:13,334
Jeong-woo, promise me you'll
only look at it! You shouldn't drive it.

82
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:58,884
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

83
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:03,688
What are you playing at?

84
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,840
{\an8}Why are you pretending
like you can't remember?

85
00:04:10,262 --> 00:04:12,600
{\an8}You saw Bo-yeong...

86
00:04:12,938 --> 00:04:14,887
{\an8}...for the last
time in this house.

87
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,340
{\an8}Just lie down.

88
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:23,341
{\an8}- I told you to lie down...
- Geon-oh, Su-oh.

89
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:25,809
{\an8}I don't know if it's okay
for me to be this happy.

90
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,340
{\an8}Mom?

91
00:04:32,768 --> 00:04:33,768
{\an8}Um...

92
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:39,287
{\an8}Disgusting.

93
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:41,283
{\an8}Bo-yeong!

94
00:04:48,106 --> 00:04:49,140
Gu-tak.

95
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:52,740
What's wrong?

96
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:55,997
Bo-yeong...

97
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,137
...was killed by us.

98
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:02,940
On that day.

99
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:06,066
She said she was going to play
with the kids at Jeong-woo's house.

100
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:08,345
Had she done that...

101
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:11,520
We wouldn't have gotten
caught, isn't that right?

102
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,985
What would have happened
if I had run after Bo-yeong?

103
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:36,070
It's all in the past now.

104
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,951
It's not for me.

105
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:41,051
Jae-hee.

106
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,419
Why did you barge in here?

107
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,204
Why are you bringing
this up all of a sudden?

108
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:50,580
Bo-yeong's dad.

109
00:05:53,204 --> 00:05:54,204
Release him.

110
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:04,856
I can't do that.

111
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:07,460
Even if I am the police chief,

112
00:06:07,489 --> 00:06:10,056
I can't release someone
when they've already confessed.

113
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:12,700
I can't.

114
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:13,837
Get going.

115
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:21,881
If you don't release
my husband...

116
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,617
...you'll find out
what I'm capable of.

117
00:06:27,706 --> 00:06:32,354
I'll show you just how fast
word can spread in our village.

118
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:53,932
Anyone who could drive...

119
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:56,744
...could take my
car at any time.

120
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:59,500
The car keys...

121
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,588
...were always in the toolbox.

122
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:05,419
Gosh.

123
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,960
Now that the body has
been identified as your friend,

124
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:10,985
you must be quite upset.

125
00:07:11,523 --> 00:07:12,523
Isn't that right?

126
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:15,540
It's in times like these
that you must focus harder.

127
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,340
We have to find Park Da-eun.

128
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:18,535
Right.

129
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:21,940
<i>Da-eun...</i>

130
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:26,479
...I'm going to kill you,
so shut your mouth.

131
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:31,151
Like this, like this, like this.

132
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:33,987
Like this! Like this!

133
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:36,943
That's how I killed her, right?

134
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,100
But I didn't kill them.

135
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:42,905
I definitely didn't kill them.

136
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:47,062
You've lived in Mucheon
a long time, right?

137
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:49,789
Yes, I was born here.

138
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,958
Then how long would it take...

139
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,775
...to drive from
Mucheon to Cheonsu?

140
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,922
I'm not sure. How
long would it take?

141
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:02,235
There aren't any detours
and it's a rural road.

142
00:08:02,236 --> 00:08:04,610
So you could only
go at 20 to 30km/hr...

143
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:06,118
So maybe 15 minutes?

144
00:08:08,223 --> 00:08:10,100
Early this morning,

145
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:12,607
you drove your car
to the warehouse.

146
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:14,989
Oh, yes. That's right.

147
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,780
I drove, didn't I?

148
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:18,340
Gosh.

149
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,630
I drank on an empty
stomach so I'm really out of it.

150
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:24,544
Gosh.

151
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:31,860
Right, you couldn't be
in your right mind now.

152
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,212
I'm sorry, Byeong-mu.

153
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:34,695
Not at all, sir.

154
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,428
I'll help in whichever way
I can. Please just tell me.

155
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:40,926
- All right.
- Yes.

156
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:11,768
<i>The farthest it could go
was the abandoned school.</i>

157
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:23,574
So many weird things
are happening these days.

158
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,803
And what's up with Su-oh?

159
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:44,378
What are you painting?

160
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:48,017
Bring me the paintings.

161
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:50,989
The kids used to stack
hay on the big tractor...

162
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,157
...and play on it all the time.

163
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:58,076
Su-oh saw everything.

164
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:03,874
It wasn't Jeong-woo.

165
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:07,779
Su-oh is the witness.

166
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:22,380
VACANT

167
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,707
Cheonsu Village, please.

168
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,905
Sir.

169
00:11:32,944 --> 00:11:34,805
Oh, thank you, thank you.

170
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:35,645
What are you doing?

171
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:39,103
I made a copy of the
witness statement file.

172
00:11:39,128 --> 00:11:40,179
Oh.

173
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,026
<i>I think it was just
before 11 p.m.</i>

174
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:47,745
<i>Anyway, it was around then.</i>

175
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:51,261
I was getting off the bus...

176
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:55,659
- Is this the last bus?
- Yes.

177
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,479
<i>Jeong-woo's car was headed
in the opposite direction.</i>

178
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:08,059
But why...

179
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:11,078
<i>Are you sure that the car
belonged to Goh Jeong-woo?</i>

180
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:13,299
<i>I'm sure.</i>

181
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:18,607
<i>I've seen the car parked in front
of the warehouse all the time.</i>

182
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,037
My son was so
jealous of that car.

183
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:30,552
<i>Goh Jeong-woo's car was seen...</i>

184
00:12:30,553 --> 00:12:31,969
SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS

185
00:12:31,994 --> 00:12:33,994
<i>...at around 10:58 p.m.</i>

186
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:41,634
<i>From the bus stop to
the abandoned school...</i>

187
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,801
CHEONSU ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

188
00:12:42,802 --> 00:12:44,161
<i>...is around 15 minutes.</i>

189
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:57,262
<i>He would've arrived at Cheonsu
Village at around 11:13 p.m.</i>

190
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,139
It was 11:13 p.m.

191
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:24,220
<i>No matter how fast Goh
Jeong-woo hid the body...</i>

192
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:30,868
<i>It would have taken
at least 10 minutes...</i>

193
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:33,473
<i>...to carry a body
over 50kg by himself...</i>

194
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:36,748
<i>...from the car trunk
to the manhole.</i>

195
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,695
<i>The body was left in the manhole
between 11:20 and 11:30 p.m.</i>

196
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:48,568
HE RETURNED TO THE
WAREHOUSE AROUND 11:30 P.M.

197
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:51,635
HE ASSAULTED PARK DA-EUN AT
AROUND 11:35 P.M. AND KILLED HER

198
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:02,962
<i>Da-eun said that she
was with her boyfriend.</i>

199
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:04,869
<i>When I called her,</i>

200
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,537
<i>I could hear his voice.</i>

201
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:09,538
<i>I thought the call had ended...</i>

202
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:11,494
But then suddenly,

203
00:14:13,482 --> 00:14:16,282
<i>I heard Da-eun screaming.</i>

204
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:20,183
<i>Park Da-eun's grandmother's
call record shows it was 11:30 p.m.</i>

205
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:25,437
<i>Goh Jeong-woo could not have
returned to the warehouse by then...</i>

206
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:28,432
<i>Yet she heard his voice?</i>

207
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:35,614
<i>That doesn't make sense.</i>

208
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:50,513
I went to the
warehouse around 10:30.

209
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:51,561
And?

210
00:14:52,313 --> 00:14:54,956
I met with Da-eun at 11:30.

211
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:09,115
<i>No matter how fast Goh Jeong-woo
got back to the warehouse,</i>

212
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:13,218
<i>it had to have been
around 11:50 p.m.</i>

213
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:20,383
<i>Park Da-eun was
already dead by then.</i>

214
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,014
PARK DA-EUN'S CORPSE
DISPOSED OF IN THE MUCHEON AREA

215
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:30,544
<i>That's it!</i>

216
00:15:31,627 --> 00:15:33,492
<i>The two murders could not
have occurred at the same time!</i>

217
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:34,725
Where are you going?

218
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,997
Darn it, this case
is over already!

219
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,079
What are you doing here? Huh?

220
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:17,239
Why did you come here?

221
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:26,791
Did you find anything?

222
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,090
Bo-yeong...

223
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,142
Who could've killed her?

224
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,868
Da-eun died at the same time
Bo-yeong's body was hidden.

225
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:45,099
Unless I have two bodies,
this is physically impossible.

226
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:48,426
I put gas in my car
a total of five times.

227
00:17:48,427 --> 00:17:49,827
Every time it was
exactly $10 worth.

228
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:52,460
Bo-yeong's killer knew...

229
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:54,061
...that the abandoned
school could be reached...

230
00:17:54,062 --> 00:17:56,026
...without refueling the car.

231
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:57,726
They must be around the village.

232
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:58,739
Stop.

233
00:18:01,932 --> 00:18:04,461
You're severely
misunderstanding something.

234
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:08,099
Just because
there are two killers...

235
00:18:08,162 --> 00:18:10,376
...doesn't exempt you
from being one of them.

236
00:18:11,194 --> 00:18:12,627
Accomplice!

237
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:15,009
You're right.

238
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:18,509
Maybe I did kill her.

239
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:24,643
So I tried to kill myself.

240
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,451
But it's not that easy.

241
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:31,421
That's why I reflected
on myself for 10 years...

242
00:18:31,454 --> 00:18:34,902
...and did everything I could to
try and recall at least a trace...

243
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:37,311
...of a memory that
proved I didn't do it.

244
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:40,126
That's how I persevered.

245
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:41,318
However...

246
00:18:41,794 --> 00:18:44,356
I told you I don't trust
the words of criminals.

247
00:18:48,992 --> 00:18:50,203
I don't believe them either.

248
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:54,560
Shameless bastards who only give excuses
in the face of their heinous crimes.

249
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:57,568
They always say it wasn't them.
They always say they didn't kill anyone.

250
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,905
Even in your eyes...

251
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:05,260
You must see me as
vermin just like them.

252
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:06,541
That's right. You're
vermin to me.

253
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:09,075
- I didn't kill them!
- Wait a minute!

254
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:14,979
Oh... So... You were here...

255
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:19,519
The thing is... I've got
something to tell you.

256
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:22,649
- Me?
- Yes.

257
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:25,671
I think I saw something.

258
00:19:59,594 --> 00:20:00,761
What did you see?

259
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:04,893
Well, I think someone saw
everything that happened that day.

260
00:20:04,894 --> 00:20:06,561
I think there's a witness.

261
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:08,819
A witness?

262
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:12,999
Well...

263
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:15,309
The thing is...

264
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:20,027
I saw a painting with a
person bleeding out here.

265
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,206
A painting?

266
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:24,726
By any chance,
did Su-oh paint it?

267
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:25,730
Su-oh?

268
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:28,419
Do you mean Hyeon Su-oh?

269
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:30,664
Yes.

270
00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:33,461
Su-oh made a painting...

271
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:36,193
...that seemed like he
was here that day.

272
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,712
Wait, you do know
Hyeon Su-oh suffers...

273
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:41,126
...from a neurological
disorder, right?

274
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:44,055
He's the only one
that wasn't interviewed...

275
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:46,360
...because his testimony
wasn't credible.

276
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:48,293
But a painting?

277
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:49,760
It's not even a photo or video?

278
00:20:49,761 --> 00:20:52,249
How can a painting be evidence?

279
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,987
It could obviously
be his imagination.

280
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:56,160
And isn't he in the
hospital as we speak?

281
00:20:56,161 --> 00:20:58,266
But just in case.

282
00:20:58,267 --> 00:20:59,334
Forget it.

283
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:01,432
Let's just go.
Where do you live?

284
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:02,693
I'll take you home.

285
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,999
I can make my own way, thanks.

286
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,533
Just get out of here.

287
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,341
How'd he ever become a detective
when he doesn't hear anyone out?

288
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:24,182
You'll never catch a
cab all the way out here.

289
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:27,452
I'll go and get Su-oh's
painting, so just stay put.

290
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:42,129
Su-oh...

291
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,919
Yes, I brought him here myself,
so you needn't worry too much.

292
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,701
He'll get better soon.

293
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:51,977
Okay, thank you.

294
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:54,911
Yes, I'll leave it
to you, Director.

295
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:56,182
Yes, thank you.

296
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:19,727
<i>Just because
there are two killers...</i>

297
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:22,227
<i>...doesn't exempt you
from being one of them.</i>

298
00:22:23,086 --> 00:22:25,707
<i>I finally found a clue...</i>

299
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:26,813
<i>Accomplice?</i>

300
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:29,238
<i>An accomplice?</i>

301
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:33,631
<i>Goh Jeong-woo, you are under arrest
for the murder and unlawful disposal...</i>

302
00:22:33,632 --> 00:22:35,177
<i>...of Shim Bo-yeong
and Park Da-eun.</i>

303
00:22:35,178 --> 00:22:37,183
<i>The accused is
sentenced to 10 years.</i>

304
00:22:37,184 --> 00:22:39,120
Please say something!

305
00:22:39,121 --> 00:22:40,754
Bring Mom here!

306
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:04,586
The moment you became a killer,

307
00:23:04,587 --> 00:23:06,587
you stopped being my son.

308
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:10,864
Your mom, Jeong Geum-hee...

309
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:12,444
It was because of you.

310
00:23:12,469 --> 00:23:15,026
You have no right
to blame anyone.

311
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,000
What is it that you want?

312
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:18,098
What do you want?

313
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:20,746
I want you to die
like my daughter!

314
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:24,250
If you just disappear,
nothing will go wrong.

315
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:29,827
Shoot!

316
00:23:30,882 --> 00:23:32,594
Shoot me!

317
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:35,117
I've been begging for 10 years...

318
00:23:35,118 --> 00:23:37,416
<i>...to let me find
Bo-yeong and Da-eun.</i>

319
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,307
If you keep waiting, you'll
get at least one chance.

320
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:42,844
And when you do, you
go all the way to the end.

321
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:54,263
Mom.

322
00:23:56,894 --> 00:24:00,072
Do you remember
what Dad used to say?

323
00:24:06,754 --> 00:24:08,347
To go all the way to the end.

324
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,453
No matter what happens...

325
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,291
To go all the way.

326
00:24:35,414 --> 00:24:37,276
I'm going all the
way to the end.

327
00:24:41,294 --> 00:24:43,812
{\an8}CHUNGJU WEEDAHM
INTEGRATIVE HOSPITAL

328
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,904
Sorry.

329
00:25:16,874 --> 00:25:18,041
Mom...

330
00:25:19,361 --> 00:25:22,240
She went for a check-up.

331
00:25:22,241 --> 00:25:24,077
They said it'll take
around 3 hours.

332
00:25:25,501 --> 00:25:27,025
You didn't go back to Seoul?

333
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,833
I'm okay. You can leave.

334
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,932
I need to wash.

335
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:15,060
MUCHEON POLICE STATION

336
00:26:15,061 --> 00:26:18,218
Thank you for taking part
in the witness interviews.

337
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:21,700
It was nothing.

338
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:23,381
Bo-yeong's dad is
the one that's suffering.

339
00:26:24,161 --> 00:26:27,297
I heard you were the one who
told him of the news about Bo-yeong.

340
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:29,560
And you even organized
this meeting for us.

341
00:26:29,561 --> 00:26:31,260
Thank you for everything.

342
00:26:31,261 --> 00:26:33,026
I only did what I should.

343
00:26:35,082 --> 00:26:36,762
You raised your son really well.

344
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,363
Gosh.

345
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,407
Dong-min.

346
00:26:46,294 --> 00:26:48,360
Hey, what happened to you?

347
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,660
I'll give you some privacy.

348
00:26:49,661 --> 00:26:51,193
Thanks, Byeong-mu.

349
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:53,127
You've become so
haggard after just one day.

350
00:26:53,994 --> 00:26:57,661
Geez, what is going on?

351
00:26:58,627 --> 00:27:02,294
Even I'm feeling like this,
so how bad must it be for you.

352
00:27:03,294 --> 00:27:04,542
I'm rotting on the inside.

353
00:27:05,261 --> 00:27:06,527
Rotting to the core.

354
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:10,261
I won't let that Jeong-woo
bastard get away with this.

355
00:27:12,261 --> 00:27:14,820
The thing is...

356
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:17,073
...we have to hold the funeral.

357
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:18,561
Yes, we must.

358
00:27:19,427 --> 00:27:22,673
They have to do
more investigations...

359
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,574
...but we can hold the
funeral after the autopsy.

360
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,966
I'll get you released
no matter what today.

361
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:32,214
So don't worry.

362
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:34,388
And how will you do that?

363
00:27:34,894 --> 00:27:37,960
Even the congresswoman
couldn't do it. So how could you?

364
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:39,726
She's not just my daughter,
she's my late daughter.

365
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:41,405
So what couldn't I do?

366
00:27:41,406 --> 00:27:42,466
Damn it.

367
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:44,426
Did you go and
cause trouble again?

368
00:27:44,427 --> 00:27:46,395
You're the one
who caused trouble!

369
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,818
This isn't the time to
be locked up in here!

370
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:51,444
Are you really going to
face Bo-yeong in that state?

371
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,193
What?

372
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:55,194
You going to hit me?

373
00:27:56,094 --> 00:28:00,326
Are you trembling all over from
holding it in for the past 10 years?

374
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:01,693
Just try and hit me.

375
00:28:01,694 --> 00:28:04,126
You will never see me
or Hye-yeong ever again!

376
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:05,994
Why are you two being like this?

377
00:28:07,795 --> 00:28:09,528
This is for Bo-yeong.

378
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:11,990
Just think about
our late Bo-yeong!

379
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:19,691
Try doing as much as I do!

380
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:23,461
I won't let my daughter's
killer get away with it!

381
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,988
Hey, darn it!

382
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,096
Jeong-woo...

383
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,218
Where were you yesterday?

384
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:42,844
Did something come up?

385
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,220
If you're having a hard
time, you can tell me.

386
00:28:57,498 --> 00:29:00,576
We're friends.

387
00:29:01,397 --> 00:29:03,077
I want to be friends with you.

388
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:06,578
I thought about it and I
think that's much better.

389
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,458
Let's just...

390
00:29:11,327 --> 00:29:14,986
...be friends for life.

391
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,315
Yes? Yes, thank you.

392
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:45,590
Yes, I'll be right there. Bye.

393
00:29:57,694 --> 00:30:00,654
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS, WE'RE CLOSED
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE - MUCHEON GARDEN

394
00:30:05,827 --> 00:30:06,827
Hello.

395
00:30:21,394 --> 00:30:24,093
I know, right? The
neighborhood is in a sorry state.

396
00:30:24,094 --> 00:30:26,461
- It's a terrible time.
- I'm here.

397
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:28,361
Oh, have a seat.

398
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,926
Do you want some coffee?

399
00:30:30,927 --> 00:30:32,361
No, no. I'm all right.

400
00:30:35,848 --> 00:30:37,990
Where Bo-yeong was found...

401
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,774
...wasn't even that far away.

402
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:46,740
And yet we couldn't find it.

403
00:30:47,996 --> 00:30:48,996
Geez.

404
00:30:51,257 --> 00:30:53,148
We haven't slept at all...

405
00:30:53,211 --> 00:30:56,489
...since Bo-yeong's
remains were found.

406
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:59,502
Bo-yeong's family
is going through a lot.

407
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:02,060
When can we hold the funeral?

408
00:31:03,636 --> 00:31:05,660
You can do it as soon as
we get the autopsy report...

409
00:31:05,661 --> 00:31:08,222
...from the NFS, so
don't worry too much.

410
00:31:08,223 --> 00:31:09,762
How can we not worry?

411
00:31:09,763 --> 00:31:11,106
It's not like this is
about some strangers.

412
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,591
This is Bo-yeong's
family we're talking about.

413
00:31:12,615 --> 00:31:13,961
We should do what we can.

414
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:17,891
I stormed into
Jeong-woo's house...

415
00:31:17,946 --> 00:31:19,872
...with the locals yesterday.

416
00:31:19,873 --> 00:31:23,296
That bastard is so shameless.

417
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:24,329
Geez.

418
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,061
You wasted your time.

419
00:31:29,724 --> 00:31:31,596
Please stop taking
matters into your own hands.

420
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:33,000
Okay.

421
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:33,960
Okay?

422
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Okay.

423
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:40,545
I'll deal with
Jeong-woo as well,

424
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,394
so just don't do
anything from now on.

425
00:31:43,062 --> 00:31:44,620
Okay, okay.

426
00:31:44,645 --> 00:31:45,745
Okay.

427
00:31:46,658 --> 00:31:49,626
Oh, and about your part-timer...

428
00:31:50,694 --> 00:31:51,705
PRIVATE NUMBER:

429
00:31:51,729 --> 00:31:53,694
YOU KILLED ME 11 YEARS AGO...

430
00:31:57,762 --> 00:31:58,762
Yes.

431
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:01,727
Hello.

432
00:32:03,156 --> 00:32:04,660
Oh, welcome.

433
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:06,639
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

434
00:32:08,413 --> 00:32:11,747
Thank you for
making time like this.

435
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,377
You're a friend of Su-oh.
Of course I'll make time.

436
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:20,328
He did get transferred
to another hospital, right?

437
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,983
Well...

438
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:28,807
Su-oh's not in the
best state right now.

439
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:31,910
He's continuing to have anxiety
attacks so it's a bit dangerous.

440
00:32:31,935 --> 00:32:32,776
We decided it'd
be best for him...

441
00:32:32,777 --> 00:32:34,795
...to get intensive treatment
at a specialist hospital.

442
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:37,718
Can I visit him?

443
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:39,451
There's something I
need to speak to him about.

444
00:32:39,452 --> 00:32:41,665
I can't allow that without
permission from his father.

445
00:32:42,191 --> 00:32:43,220
However,

446
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:45,266
I can relay anything
you want to say to him.

447
00:32:45,607 --> 00:32:47,305
Oh, the thing is...

448
00:32:47,344 --> 00:32:50,780
I have to ask him myself.

449
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:52,499
Oh, is that so?

450
00:32:54,332 --> 00:32:57,865
Once his condition becomes more
stable, I'll tell him to contact you.

451
00:32:58,467 --> 00:33:00,287
Okay. Thank you.

452
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:02,390
Yes. Take care.

453
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:15,519
MUCHEON SARANG HOSPITAL

454
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:36,622
Min-su said he doesn't
know when he can make it.

455
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,878
So let's start without him.

456
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:40,286
This looks good.

457
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:49,790
Jeong-woo.

458
00:33:51,473 --> 00:33:52,684
I trust you.

459
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:55,328
I trust everything you say.

460
00:33:57,654 --> 00:34:01,143
I think I understand why
you want to clear your name.

461
00:34:02,072 --> 00:34:03,493
I would feel the same way.

462
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:08,167
I just want you
to be at peace...

463
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,451
...and enjoy your life with your
mother. That's all I wanted.

464
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,016
I'm sorry.

465
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,520
Let me help.

466
00:34:18,691 --> 00:34:20,931
Bo-yeong and Da-eun
were my friends too.

467
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:24,814
I got close to you
and the other guys...

468
00:34:24,853 --> 00:34:26,731
...all thanks to Da-eun.

469
00:34:28,654 --> 00:34:29,969
Let me help.

470
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:33,505
Thanks.

471
00:34:33,746 --> 00:34:35,746
Once you clear your name...

472
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:39,680
Once you catch the real killer,

473
00:34:39,862 --> 00:34:41,465
let's take mother...

474
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:44,073
...and move to Seoul.

475
00:34:44,922 --> 00:34:46,123
Once it's all over.

476
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:50,457
Once Mom wakes back up.

477
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,715
I never planned
to stay in Mucheon.

478
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:56,936
Also, Deok-mi...

479
00:34:58,286 --> 00:35:00,031
...I went back to the
abandoned school.

480
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:05,252
Bo-yeong was left at
the abandoned school...

481
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:07,550
...at the same time Da-eun was
murdered at the warehouse.

482
00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:09,064
They occurred at the same time.

483
00:35:10,454 --> 00:35:11,354
That means...

484
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:13,619
Even if I did commit
all those acts,

485
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,467
the investigation was wrong.

486
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:20,675
Can they reopen the case?

487
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,940
I'll ask at the police station.

488
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,300
Then let me come with you.

489
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:25,616
I'll drive you there.

490
00:35:25,686 --> 00:35:27,653
No. I prefer to go by myself.

491
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:30,470
Let's eat.

492
00:35:59,646 --> 00:36:00,982
Su-oh?

493
00:36:01,986 --> 00:36:03,928
I thought he was at
a different hospital.

494
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:21,781
It takes about 15 minutes
traveling at 20km/hr.

495
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,227
It's estimated that
Shim Bo-yeong's body...

496
00:37:24,228 --> 00:37:26,996
...was disposed of at 11:28 p.m.

497
00:37:27,021 --> 00:37:31,488
And it's estimated that Park
Da-eun was murdered at 11:30 p.m.

498
00:37:31,513 --> 00:37:35,146
Which means there's
an error in the timeline...

499
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:37,268
Hey! Turn the lights on!

500
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,137
Are you freaking
out of your mind?

501
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:43,938
An error in the timeline?

502
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:46,989
Is this the first time you've heard a
witness statement that's not perfect?

503
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:50,056
Then what about the suspect
armed with a knife a few days ago?

504
00:37:50,057 --> 00:37:53,189
Some said he was wearing
white, some said grey or black.

505
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,689
They mentioned
every possible color!

506
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,522
- Well...
- Then in that case,

507
00:37:57,523 --> 00:37:59,489
was that an error
in their vision?

508
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,422
How do you not know this?

509
00:38:01,423 --> 00:38:04,589
You can't trust everything
that witnesses say!

510
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,789
Yes, Section Chief.

511
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,640
I know exactly
what you mean, sir.

512
00:38:08,723 --> 00:38:11,600
But it seems like
this case is different.

513
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:15,502
As you know, the time of
the last bus wouldn't change.

514
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:18,993
And we have a clear record
of Park Da-eun's call time.

515
00:38:19,023 --> 00:38:19,790
This...

516
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:22,488
Yes, you've got a point there.

517
00:38:24,538 --> 00:38:27,505
We could have missed
something. Right?

518
00:38:28,293 --> 00:38:31,540
But the thing is,
it's not enough.

519
00:38:31,817 --> 00:38:33,678
Unless there's new evidence...

520
00:38:33,703 --> 00:38:35,875
You know it's impossible
to reopen the case.

521
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:39,456
Yes, sir.

522
00:38:39,457 --> 00:38:43,256
It seems impossible
that Goh Jeong-woo...

523
00:38:43,257 --> 00:38:44,994
...committed the
murders all on his own.

524
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:48,920
So I think this might prove...

525
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,955
...that he had an accomplice...

526
00:38:52,257 --> 00:38:53,357
An accomplice?

527
00:38:53,843 --> 00:38:55,443
Okay, so let's say
there's an accomplice.

528
00:38:56,243 --> 00:38:57,443
How will you find them?

529
00:38:58,223 --> 00:38:59,822
How am I supposed
to support you...

530
00:38:59,823 --> 00:39:02,479
...when you have no
conclusive evidence?

531
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:04,105
Do I just trust you...

532
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,280
...and put the entire Violent
Crimes 2nd unit on it?

533
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:08,242
Then what about costs for
the investigation and vehicles?

534
00:39:08,266 --> 00:39:09,999
What about our backlogged cases?

535
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,643
But still...

536
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:17,158
I thought the most important thing
was to find Park Da-eun's body.

537
00:39:17,183 --> 00:39:18,935
- Team Head Noh.
- Yes, sir.

538
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,508
We searched for 10 years
because it was important.

539
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:23,593
Huh?

540
00:39:24,184 --> 00:39:25,310
What if we can't find it?

541
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:27,850
Will you be held responsible?

542
00:39:30,983 --> 00:39:31,983
Well...

543
00:39:32,808 --> 00:39:33,808
Sir.

544
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,899
I can't let my team waste
its time on a closed case.

545
00:39:37,932 --> 00:39:39,532
All right.

546
00:39:39,557 --> 00:39:40,856
Get out, all of you!

547
00:39:40,857 --> 00:39:42,814
Why are you wasting
your time on this?

548
00:39:57,092 --> 00:39:58,565
Timeline error?

549
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,992
What a load of nonsense.

550
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:03,640
But isn't Team Head
Noh really strange?

551
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,398
Even if the remains were found,

552
00:40:05,423 --> 00:40:07,256
why bring back a case
that's been solved?

553
00:40:07,257 --> 00:40:09,889
And why did the police
chief get involved?

554
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,557
He was in charge of
the case back then.

555
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:15,942
He even got a special promotion
for solving it. Why would he reopen it?

556
00:40:16,557 --> 00:40:18,490
There's no way
they'll reopen the case.

557
00:40:20,957 --> 00:40:22,656
Sir, please reconsider...

558
00:40:22,657 --> 00:40:23,822
Look, that's enough.

559
00:40:23,823 --> 00:40:26,522
- I just need the minimum manpower...
- That's enough!

560
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:27,614
Uncle.

561
00:40:28,535 --> 00:40:29,535
Goh Jeong-woo!

562
00:40:30,051 --> 00:40:32,456
How dare you come
in here, you punk!

563
00:40:32,457 --> 00:40:34,277
There's proof I
wasn't at the scene.

564
00:40:34,509 --> 00:40:37,070
There's an error with my alibi.

565
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,119
So you should reopen the case.

566
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,889
- How dare you order me around!
- Stop, Jeong-woo.

567
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,322
Jeong-woo!

568
00:40:44,924 --> 00:40:46,744
Go home. I'll call you.

569
00:40:47,256 --> 00:40:48,479
Uncle.

570
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:52,316
For the sake of
Da-eun and Bo-yeong...

571
00:40:53,775 --> 00:40:55,720
...please reopen the case.

572
00:41:00,029 --> 00:41:01,162
Come to my office.

573
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:07,575
Wait...

574
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:10,157
Damn!

575
00:41:14,879 --> 00:41:16,979
What is wrong with you? Huh?

576
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:21,278
I've been living like an empty
husk for the past 10 years.

577
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,844
I received death
threats every single day.

578
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,778
I was condemned for
killing my friends, killing girls,

579
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:29,544
killing my girlfriend.

580
00:41:29,545 --> 00:41:32,311
I was beaten like a dog, and
yet I persevered. But Uncle...

581
00:41:32,312 --> 00:41:35,540
That's why I told you that
this time is very important.

582
00:41:35,712 --> 00:41:38,929
- If you live an honest life...
- For me to live an honest life, Uncle!

583
00:41:43,505 --> 00:41:44,996
When Mom wakes up

584
00:41:46,198 --> 00:41:47,880
I want to greet
her with a smile.

585
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:49,790
In order to do
that, I must know.

586
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:51,135
What?

587
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,607
Why they killed
Bo-yeong and Da-eun.

588
00:41:53,608 --> 00:41:54,995
Who killed them.

589
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,920
- And how they killed them...
- Jeong-woo!

590
00:41:58,076 --> 00:41:59,681
What are you even talking about?

591
00:41:59,938 --> 00:42:01,486
Are you saying I
made you into a criminal...

592
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:02,603
...because I didn't
investigate properly?

593
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:03,558
Uncle, 10 years ago...

594
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:06,040
Are you saying the police
conspired to make you a criminal?

595
00:42:11,244 --> 00:42:12,244
Right.

596
00:42:12,347 --> 00:42:14,738
The fact that you served
your sentence and got released...

597
00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:19,237
...means that you have already
been punished for your crimes,

598
00:42:19,238 --> 00:42:21,693
but that doesn't mean
the case has disappeared.

599
00:42:22,338 --> 00:42:25,204
It doesn't mean that
your crime is erased.

600
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,506
Where were you 10 years
ago during my interrogation?

601
00:42:30,938 --> 00:42:32,537
Even when for the
scene inspection...

602
00:42:32,538 --> 00:42:33,818
Jeong-woo!

603
00:42:35,418 --> 00:42:36,818
I'm your uncle...

604
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:38,660
No...

605
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:41,602
I'm your father's best friend.

606
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:45,663
So I will do whatever
I can to help you.

607
00:42:46,104 --> 00:42:49,538
But I can't erase the
crime that you committed.

608
00:43:02,471 --> 00:43:03,555
Jeong-woo...

609
00:43:22,263 --> 00:43:24,063
<i>Release Bo-yeong's dad.</i>

610
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:26,484
<i>This is your last warning.</i>

611
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,318
Isn't it so strange?

612
00:43:29,404 --> 00:43:32,403
You should never
touch a closed case.

613
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:34,420
An error is just an error.

614
00:43:34,638 --> 00:43:38,904
I don't want to get involved in
something the police chief is against.

615
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:40,579
FATHER-IN-LAW

616
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:41,971
Huh?

617
00:43:47,932 --> 00:43:49,783
- Give me a minute.
- Yes, sir.

618
00:43:54,985 --> 00:43:56,018
Hello?

619
00:43:56,043 --> 00:43:57,743
That's his father-in-law.

620
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,102
Our team head is married?

621
00:43:59,138 --> 00:44:00,245
I thought his
wedding got canceled.

622
00:44:00,246 --> 00:44:01,446
Yes, I understand.

623
00:44:10,844 --> 00:44:12,644
Sir, are you married?

624
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:15,869
I thought you were a bachelor
because you look so young.

625
00:44:24,341 --> 00:44:25,534
Actually...

626
00:44:26,657 --> 00:44:29,137
The day after tomorrow is the
anniversary of my wife's passing.

627
00:44:29,836 --> 00:44:31,079
My father-in-law said...

628
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:33,270
...not to come by anymore.

629
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:34,405
Oh...

630
00:44:40,164 --> 00:44:41,864
I'm heading home.

631
00:44:45,348 --> 00:44:47,429
- Oh, Jeong-woo.
- Wait.

632
00:44:48,303 --> 00:44:49,737
There's something
I must tell you.

633
00:45:12,828 --> 00:45:13,980
Is this alcohol?

634
00:45:14,419 --> 00:45:15,140
Yes.

635
00:45:15,426 --> 00:45:19,027
Just like we used
in the old times.

636
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:20,052
Right.

637
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:23,657
And smoking too,
right? Like old times?

638
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:27,843
What do you even do?

639
00:45:28,671 --> 00:45:31,037
I'm the section chief.

640
00:45:31,038 --> 00:45:32,670
Right, you're the section chief.

641
00:45:32,671 --> 00:45:35,470
What were you doing while they
were serving drinks and smoking...

642
00:45:35,471 --> 00:45:36,631
...in the interrogation room?

643
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:38,271
Well, the thing is...

644
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:40,204
Don't you know
how the world works?

645
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:42,904
Think about the
times we're living in.

646
00:45:43,746 --> 00:45:45,371
Are you really going to pass
this on to the prosecutors?

647
00:45:45,395 --> 00:45:47,995
Well, the thing is...

648
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:51,796
He made a confession and an
application was made for a warrant.

649
00:45:51,797 --> 00:45:52,797
Hee-do!

650
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,310
So?

651
00:45:55,578 --> 00:45:56,911
Should I call the
prosecutor myself?

652
00:45:56,912 --> 00:45:58,983
Oh, no, no.

653
00:45:58,984 --> 00:46:00,684
I will. I'll do it.

654
00:46:02,004 --> 00:46:03,571
Geez.

655
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:17,471
HYEON GU-TAK

656
00:46:23,538 --> 00:46:24,582
Hello?

657
00:46:28,471 --> 00:46:30,255
You called, so speak.

658
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:36,139
I can't believe the
lengths I'll go to for you.

659
00:46:38,721 --> 00:46:40,875
He's been released,
so don't worry.

660
00:46:41,713 --> 00:46:42,713
Jae-hee.

661
00:46:43,784 --> 00:46:44,817
Hang up.

662
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,489
Dad's coming.

663
00:47:02,664 --> 00:47:03,830
Just wait a little longer.

664
00:47:07,782 --> 00:47:09,682
Jeong-woo that bastard.

665
00:47:14,426 --> 00:47:15,993
Chu-ho, where are you?

666
00:47:16,018 --> 00:47:17,415
I just got released.

667
00:47:17,718 --> 00:47:19,818
No, no. I'll go
to the restaurant.

668
00:47:20,492 --> 00:47:22,492
Wait, Chu-ho.

669
00:47:22,517 --> 00:47:25,117
You know that guy.

670
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,875
The one who catches pheasants.

671
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,377
Do you know if
he still hunts them?

672
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:34,844
Yes, sure. Let's
go hunt a pheasant.

673
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:36,002
Pheasant?

674
00:47:36,027 --> 00:47:37,827
This is no time to
go pheasant hunting!

675
00:47:38,553 --> 00:47:40,046
What will you do about Ha Seol?

676
00:47:40,071 --> 00:47:41,338
Must you fire her?

677
00:47:41,363 --> 00:47:43,563
Do I really have
to repeat myself?

678
00:47:43,638 --> 00:47:46,669
We don't even have enough customers.
What's the point in having a part-timer?

679
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,370
Will she work for free?

680
00:47:48,371 --> 00:47:51,138
And that's what
Gu-tak said to do.

681
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:54,558
Fine. There's no
need to get worked up.

682
00:47:57,224 --> 00:47:58,510
How strange.

683
00:47:59,283 --> 00:48:01,101
Why is the chief of police...

684
00:48:01,102 --> 00:48:02,836
...getting involved in
something so trivial?

685
00:48:03,274 --> 00:48:04,593
Oh, my legs.

686
00:48:04,994 --> 00:48:06,862
How much did we walk today?

687
00:48:06,918 --> 00:48:08,956
It was around 12,000 steps.

688
00:48:08,957 --> 00:48:12,289
Wow. I won't need to
exercise today, right?

689
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,589
Yes, ma'am.

690
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,122
Did you book the restaurant?

691
00:48:15,123 --> 00:48:18,089
Yes. I booked
your preferred table.

692
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,257
Okay.

693
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:23,134
I wonder where my
director is about now.

694
00:48:30,925 --> 00:48:32,789
Oh, hello.

695
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,090
- Can I take a selfie with you?
- Sure.

696
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:39,222
- Thank you. You're so pretty.
- Enjoy your meal.

697
00:48:39,223 --> 00:48:40,822
Can I please shake your hand?

698
00:48:40,823 --> 00:48:41,657
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

699
00:48:41,658 --> 00:48:43,656
- Enjoy your meal. Thank you.
- You're so beautiful.

700
00:48:43,657 --> 00:48:46,773
I hope you have
a lovely evening.

701
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:52,204
The director will
be arriving soon.

702
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,997
I'll be in the car. Please
call me if you need anything.

703
00:48:54,021 --> 00:48:55,197
Okay. Thanks.

704
00:48:59,823 --> 00:49:01,005
Hello.

705
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:02,441
All the best!

706
00:49:09,158 --> 00:49:11,025
There's a window table
that's become available.

707
00:49:11,057 --> 00:49:12,293
Should I move her to that table?

708
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:14,084
No, she prefers that one.

709
00:49:14,186 --> 00:49:15,719
That attracts more attention.

710
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:16,877
Sorry?

711
00:49:16,902 --> 00:49:18,401
Nothing. Take care.

712
00:49:26,683 --> 00:49:28,345
I can't think straight.

713
00:49:29,486 --> 00:49:30,500
Chu-ho,

714
00:49:30,957 --> 00:49:33,022
don't just stand there and call him
again to see when he's getting here.

715
00:49:33,023 --> 00:49:34,489
I must have it.

716
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,989
Hey. I called him
five minutes ago.

717
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,523
I'll call again in five.

718
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:45,630
Let's not do this.

719
00:49:45,655 --> 00:49:48,221
We shouldn't do this.

720
00:49:48,782 --> 00:49:49,782
Stay out of it.

721
00:49:50,749 --> 00:49:51,883
Yeah, you stay out.

722
00:49:53,229 --> 00:49:56,263
Jeong-woo, that bastard.
I'm going to kill him.

723
00:49:57,156 --> 00:49:59,429
How dare he abandon
Bo-yeong in a place like that?

724
00:50:05,296 --> 00:50:08,639
We'll take care of
this, so just go home.

725
00:50:20,623 --> 00:50:23,489
Come on, Jeong-woo.
Why are you being like this?

726
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:26,889
- I need to tell him something.
- Like what? Just tell me.

727
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,192
Can you...

728
00:50:28,857 --> 00:50:30,000
...help reopen the case?

729
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,163
Of course I can help. Of course.

730
00:50:32,757 --> 00:50:36,890
But neither the section chief
nor the police chief wants to do it.

731
00:50:39,784 --> 00:50:41,218
Geez. Give me a minute.

732
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:45,389
Yeah, Dad. Why
do you keep calling?

733
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:47,004
Huh?

734
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:49,080
Okay.

735
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,090
Hey, I'm sorry.

736
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:52,589
My dad seems to be unwell.

737
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:53,740
I have to go home.

738
00:50:55,082 --> 00:50:58,282
You've got this to figure out
and you've got your mom as well.

739
00:50:58,815 --> 00:51:00,282
So just go home
and get some rest.

740
00:51:01,118 --> 00:51:03,102
Get some sleep, okay?

741
00:51:23,472 --> 00:51:24,905
Do you like me?

742
00:51:25,864 --> 00:51:27,564
Why do you keep
following me around?

743
00:51:28,357 --> 00:51:30,624
You agree that the case
needs to be reopened, right?

744
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:32,404
Reopened?

745
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,030
Yeah, we should.

746
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:38,661
Right.

747
00:51:39,484 --> 00:51:42,217
Let's go over everything
from the beginning.

748
00:51:43,284 --> 00:51:45,231
You say you never went
to the abandoned school.

749
00:51:45,831 --> 00:51:48,103
You just happened to go because
she happened to tell you about it,

750
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,671
and you happened
to find the body.

751
00:51:50,436 --> 00:51:51,856
As for the proof you
weren't at the scene...

752
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,346
Fine, I accept that.

753
00:51:53,437 --> 00:51:57,318
But even if I accept
and believe all of that,

754
00:51:57,319 --> 00:52:01,207
it only shows you didn't
dispose of Shim Bo-yeong's body.

755
00:52:01,232 --> 00:52:03,360
It's not proof that
you didn't kill her.

756
00:52:03,385 --> 00:52:04,385
Isn't that right?

757
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,879
I only want to reopen the case...

758
00:52:06,904 --> 00:52:09,571
...to catch your accomplice who

759
00:52:10,492 --> 00:52:12,979
disposed of Shim Bo-yeong's body...

760
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,150
...while you were
killing Park Da-eun.

761
00:52:15,175 --> 00:52:18,642
So don't act all innocent
and think I'm on your side.

762
00:52:19,117 --> 00:52:20,484
I can't stand it!

763
00:52:20,509 --> 00:52:22,375
I don't want anything else.

764
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,667
You just have to
catch that accomplice.

765
00:52:24,704 --> 00:52:27,340
The accomplice
must know everything.

766
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:28,913
Da-eun wasn't at the
abandoned school.

767
00:52:29,457 --> 00:52:31,424
Just as you say, we
must find Da-eun as well.

768
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:32,515
Yes, we must.

769
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:36,317
Let's be honest with each other.

770
00:52:45,577 --> 00:52:46,900
Goh Jeong-woo,

771
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:50,463
when did you last
see Park Da-eun?

772
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:54,839
Why?

773
00:52:55,482 --> 00:52:58,357
You think you might
kill again if you drink?

774
00:52:58,382 --> 00:52:59,635
And forget everything again?

775
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:01,974
You scumbag who
selectively blacks out.

776
00:53:04,215 --> 00:53:06,182
On my way home on
the bus after school,

777
00:53:06,786 --> 00:53:08,686
I saw Da-eun out the window.

778
00:53:09,971 --> 00:53:12,504
I was so happy to see
her that I called her.

779
00:53:12,529 --> 00:53:15,362
But she didn't pick up
and just kept walking.

780
00:53:16,158 --> 00:53:18,592
I called her all day long but...

781
00:53:20,184 --> 00:53:21,464
I couldn't get in
touch with her.

782
00:53:22,304 --> 00:53:24,536
I drove the car to the
warehouse to find her.

783
00:53:24,537 --> 00:53:25,737
Yes, to be honest...

784
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:29,893
I was so angry.

785
00:53:31,071 --> 00:53:33,770
At the time, there was a rumor going
around the school and my friends...

786
00:53:33,771 --> 00:53:36,404
...was that Da-eun was
meeting someone else.

787
00:53:37,938 --> 00:53:39,138
And that day,

788
00:53:41,773 --> 00:53:44,240
Bo-yeong and
Deok-mi told me as well.

789
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:49,970
That time on the bus was
the last time I ever saw Da-eun.

790
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:58,519
Whether we reopen the case
or not, that's not up to you.

791
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:00,491
So just leave.

792
00:54:01,243 --> 00:54:02,243
Okay?

793
00:54:05,991 --> 00:54:07,324
You're ruining the mood.

794
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,593
I'm not asking
for anything more.

795
00:54:43,618 --> 00:54:46,352
I just need to find the
accomplice that you mentioned.

796
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:59,727
Why does my honey
look so down today?

797
00:55:01,825 --> 00:55:03,291
It's because of Su-oh, right?

798
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,060
Oh...

799
00:55:07,324 --> 00:55:10,441
It upsets me whenever
I think of Su-oh.

800
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,288
I don't know what happened...

801
00:55:12,572 --> 00:55:13,938
...but he's gotten so much worse.

802
00:55:14,804 --> 00:55:17,739
He even acts hostile
towards me at times.

803
00:55:17,764 --> 00:55:18,879
What'll we do?

804
00:55:20,787 --> 00:55:22,587
But then...

805
00:55:22,626 --> 00:55:24,593
...seeing you makes
me feel much better.

806
00:55:27,461 --> 00:55:28,861
I need to use the restroom.

807
00:55:36,768 --> 00:55:37,997
Director!

808
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,117
Oh, Yeo-jin.

809
00:55:41,026 --> 00:55:43,240
- Did you come here for dinner?
- Yes.

810
00:55:43,699 --> 00:55:44,885
How are you feeling?

811
00:55:44,886 --> 00:55:46,386
I'm much better now.

812
00:55:46,387 --> 00:55:47,611
Oh.

813
00:55:52,407 --> 00:55:54,373
Where have you
been all this time?

814
00:55:55,626 --> 00:55:57,158
Are you feeling sick?

815
00:55:57,159 --> 00:55:58,959
Why did you keep calling me?

816
00:56:02,669 --> 00:56:05,202
Wait, what? What are you doing?

817
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:06,905
Do you...

818
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,593
...have a gun?

819
00:56:11,787 --> 00:56:14,087
Guns aren't toys, Dad.

820
00:56:14,126 --> 00:56:16,740
We can't just carry them
around because we're cops.

821
00:56:16,938 --> 00:56:18,921
Seriously, why are
you being like this?

822
00:56:20,587 --> 00:56:21,587
I'm scared.

823
00:56:24,146 --> 00:56:25,779
I'm just scared.

824
00:56:25,826 --> 00:56:27,458
Scared of what?

825
00:56:27,459 --> 00:56:28,859
What's scaring you?

826
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,846
- Jeong-woo.
- What about Jeong-woo?

827
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:35,458
He's going to die.

828
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,258
What are you talking about?

829
00:56:41,259 --> 00:56:43,512
Gosh. Just get some rest.

830
00:56:43,513 --> 00:56:46,237
You got me worried for nothing.

831
00:56:55,575 --> 00:56:57,108
Who could it be at this hour?

832
00:57:00,193 --> 00:57:01,341
YOU KILLED ME 11 YEARS AGO...

833
00:57:01,365 --> 00:57:02,673
WHY DID YOU KILL ME 11 YEARS AGO?

834
00:57:50,603 --> 00:57:52,473
I'm sure it was Su-oh.

835
00:58:01,538 --> 00:58:02,559
Dong-min...

836
00:58:07,614 --> 00:58:08,707
Chu-ho,

837
00:58:09,959 --> 00:58:12,664
I haven't done
anything for Bo-yeong.

838
00:58:22,912 --> 00:58:26,603
He says this gun
isn't even registered.

839
00:58:27,417 --> 00:58:30,073
- It might be old, but it's clean...
- All right, darn it.

840
00:58:30,261 --> 00:58:31,743
How many times
are you telling me?

841
00:58:34,193 --> 00:58:35,925
I don't even know if
this is the right thing.

842
00:58:35,926 --> 00:58:38,158
Dong-min, think it
through one more time.

843
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:39,173
Chu-ho...

844
00:58:39,865 --> 00:58:41,775
Just make a good
alibi for me later.

845
00:58:45,212 --> 00:58:47,212
- Dong-min...
- What?

846
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:49,452
Be careful.

847
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:51,913
Just keep watch.

848
00:59:09,534 --> 00:59:12,028
What? He really
did get discharged.

849
00:59:19,951 --> 00:59:21,538
What are you doing here?

850
00:59:21,563 --> 00:59:23,526
I'm sorry for
coming over so late.

851
00:59:23,551 --> 00:59:25,218
But I just came to see Su-oh.

852
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:29,615
You already know
Su-oh's in the hospital.

853
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,006
I think I saw Su-oh in town.

854
00:59:34,448 --> 00:59:35,715
You saw Su-oh?

855
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,706
And his room light is on.

856
00:59:40,746 --> 00:59:43,666
What? It was on
just a second ago.

857
00:59:53,311 --> 00:59:54,442
There.

858
00:59:58,005 --> 00:59:59,100
Will that do?

859
00:59:59,477 --> 01:00:00,710
I'm sorry.

860
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:06,236
You have quite the personality.

861
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,685
Let's go.

862
01:00:23,865 --> 01:00:24,998
Father.

863
01:01:52,325 --> 01:01:53,950
How did you get released?

864
01:02:06,459 --> 01:02:09,792
Even a killer like you was
released after just 10 years.

865
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,658
So why would I get locked
up when there's no evidence?

866
01:02:14,659 --> 01:02:15,892
Are you even human?

867
01:02:15,893 --> 01:02:19,368
How could you toss your
friend into a ditch like that?

868
01:02:24,739 --> 01:02:26,439
I didn't kill Bo-yeong.

869
01:03:20,902 --> 01:03:24,139
BLACK OUT
SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

870
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:25,971
<i>Nobody can know you were here.</i>

871
01:03:25,972 --> 01:03:27,160
<i>Don't even think
about meeting anyone.</i>

872
01:03:27,161 --> 01:03:28,967
<i>And just how will you do that?</i>

873
01:03:28,968 --> 01:03:30,986
<i>Did the police chief
tell you to fire me?</i>

874
01:03:30,987 --> 01:03:33,276
<i>There are several suspicious
things about this case.</i>

875
01:03:34,216 --> 01:03:35,557
<i>Su-oh!</i>

876
01:03:35,582 --> 01:03:38,511
<i>Just tell me what I have to do.</i>

877
01:03:38,536 --> 01:03:41,044
<i>We haven't found any
personal belongings yet.</i>

878
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:44,829
<i>For us, it's the same
back then as it is now.</i>

879
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,820
