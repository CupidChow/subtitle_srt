BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

00:00:06,486 --> 00:00:08,709
(A Good Friend to Meet)

00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:12,517
"MUCHEON MURDER CASE," WHERE ARE
THE BODIES OF 2 HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS?

4
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:17,726
"MUCHEON MURDER CASE," WHERE ARE
THE BODIES OF 2 HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS?

5
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,560
He killed two people.

6
00:00:28,603 --> 00:00:30,199
Oh, you scared me!

7
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:33,119
Make some noise when you move around!

8
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,093
I'll take this to him.

9
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:36,610
Su-oh is in the greenhouse, right?

10
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:45,899
Oh, did you spend
the whole day drawing this?

11
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,049
Yes.

12
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:49,078
The colors are pretty.

13
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:55,707
Look, Su-oh.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,793
Something shocking happened today.

15
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:00,599
I saw a murderer for the
first time in my life today.

16
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:03,610
What's even more shocking is
that he's the kitchen lady's son.

17
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,651
He must have killed the
daughter of that alcoholic man.

18
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:11,376
I didn't understand why he
kept harassing the kitchen lady.

19
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:13,128
But there was a reason for that.

20
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,940
What's wrong?

21
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:24,793
Su-oh, what's wrong?
Where are you going?

22
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:47,076
There are people
who still haven't found...

23
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:49,644
...their children's bodies
even after 10 years.

24
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:53,279
They live in hell right now.

25
00:01:54,943 --> 00:01:56,909
You should leave this place.

26
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,269
And don't ever come back here.
That's what you need to do.

27
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:03,952
Even if I die, don't come back.

28
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,677
<i>Aren't you going to visit Jeong-woo?</i>

29
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,304
<i>Jeong-woo really wants to see you.</i>

30
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:29,422
You'll be going.

31
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:32,893
I can't go.

32
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,821
I mustn't go.

33
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:39,193
Let's move.

34
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:43,781
We have the restaurant up for sale.

35
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:46,288
And if the house doesn't get sold,

36
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:48,823
let's just leave it like this for now.

37
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,457
We can't live here.

38
00:02:54,176 --> 00:02:55,389
Let's leave.

39
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,716
Let's go somewhere quiet.

40
00:02:57,716 --> 00:02:58,960
I can't do that.

41
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:01,470
If we leave...

42
00:03:03,122 --> 00:03:05,839
...it'll be like admitting that
Jeong-woo really did it.

43
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:10,326
That Jeong-woo was
indeed the murderer...

44
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:12,805
...so I can't leave.

45
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:19,034
Let's just hang in there like this.

46
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:22,541
Living as sinners,

47
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:25,915
getting sworn at and
pelted with stones...

48
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,288
Let's hang in there.

49
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:13,396
Su-oh.

50
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:15,373
Jeong-woo.

51
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:22,755
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

52
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:26,335
- Did you come here to give me this?
- Yes.

53
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:30,672
- Have you kept up with your drawing?
- Yes.

54
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,060
You should come in...

55
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,709
Su-oh.

56
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:44,694
Su-oh, thanks.

57
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:48,299
This is prime beef brisket.

58
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:25,209
Welcome.

59
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:28,310
We're offering a 50%
discount on last year's items.

60
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:32,512
This section has new products.

61
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:34,756
You must be looking for
something for your son.

62
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,743
How about this one?

63
00:05:39,743 --> 00:05:41,909
This is the style that young
people are into these days.

64
00:05:46,976 --> 00:05:48,643
Oh, that one's also popular.

65
00:05:49,243 --> 00:05:51,926
It makes you look bright and stylish.

66
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:14,593
<i>Jeong-woo, Jeong-woo.</i>

67
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:15,922
<i>- Goh Jeong-woo!</i>
<i>- Jeong-woo!</i>

68
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:17,611
<i>Jeong-woo, hurry up.</i>

69
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:19,783
<i>We got this now, hurry up!</i>

70
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:21,410
<i>He's here! Hurry up!</i>

71
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,776
<i>Hurry up and come here!</i>

72
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,060
<i>Hey, hurry up!</i>

73
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:52,796
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

74
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,109
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

75
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,244
I'm so sorry.

76
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:11,843
Hello?

77
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:13,886
This is Mucheon Central Market.

78
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,319
A person fell here!

79
00:08:16,343 --> 00:08:18,143
Do you hear me? Somebody fell!

80
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:19,775
I didn't kill them!

81
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,061
I didn't kill them!

82
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:27,426
I didn't kill them!

83
00:08:28,376 --> 00:08:33,307
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE
EPISODE 2

84
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:42,645
Hello?

85
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,310
The patient is currently unconscious
and in critical condition.

86
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,843
She must be taken
to the hospital immediately.

87
00:08:48,843 --> 00:08:50,401
Oh, right. Please go.

88
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,516
Oh, you're here.

89
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,543
Did you see someone fall
from the overpass earlier?

90
00:08:56,543 --> 00:08:57,643
I didn't see anything.

91
00:08:57,643 --> 00:09:00,019
The rain is falling so heavily.

92
00:09:00,043 --> 00:09:03,876
I also came out here after
hearing the loud crash of a car.

93
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,252
Get in, all right?
You might catch a cold.

94
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:07,738
Chief, sir.

95
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:09,592
Where's Team Head Noh?

96
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:16,950
- Byeong-mu!
- Yes.

97
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:20,476
Come up here, take some photos first,
and then collect the belongings.

98
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,854
Yes, sir.

99
00:09:23,969 --> 00:09:26,800
Show me what the
Major Crime Unit can do.

100
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:29,424
Let's see if you're an exceptional
talent as it says on paper,

101
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:32,326
or a wacko as the rumors say.

102
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:41,560
Dad gave me a smack.

103
00:09:54,743 --> 00:09:56,079
I didn't kill them.

104
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:58,223
I didn't kill them.

105
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:10,586
MOU SIGNING CEREMONY

106
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:33,846
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

107
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:36,210
It was a fall.

108
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,643
Her breathing and pulse are both weak,

109
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:38,810
and she is currently unconscious.

110
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,850
Understood.

111
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:43,889
Mrs. Goh!

112
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,143
Do you know her?

113
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:47,176
Yes, she's my friend's mom.

114
00:10:47,176 --> 00:10:48,873
You should call her guardian right now.

115
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,176
Mrs. Goh...

116
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:02,826
Oh, no. This is bad.

117
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,221
OPERATING CENTER

118
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:12,610
Fruits were on the ground
at the spot of the fall.

119
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,610
Yes, she bought them from here.

120
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,434
She asked for this.

121
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,776
So you didn't see her fall, did you?

122
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:19,810
I didn't.

123
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,543
It was raining and
there were no customers,

124
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:24,776
so I went over there
to organize some things.

125
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:28,810
But suddenly, there was a loud thud,
followed by a beeping sound.

126
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,676
Gosh, I'm already
struggling with poor sales,

127
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:34,693
so why did she have to commit
suicide here, of all places?

128
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:35,926
Pardon?

129
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:39,561
I mean, I'm pretty sure it was suicide.

130
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:46,826
Hello?

131
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,460
Yes, okay.

132
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,076
I've checked the dashcam footage
from cars near the accident car.

133
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:59,043
But it was raining heavily
and the angles were poor,

134
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:01,578
so we can't see what happened
right before the accident.

135
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:06,276
The ground is wet and slippery.

136
00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:07,755
Could this be just an accident?

137
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:12,043
She slipped because the
railing is low and it was raining?

138
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:12,943
Yes.

139
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:15,135
You've grown a lot, rookie.

140
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,280
It doesn't seem to be an
accident or a suicide attempt.

141
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:22,476
- What?
- She had bought a gift and beef,

142
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,743
and even fruit right
before the accident.

143
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,176
I think it's quite far from a suicide.

144
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:28,943
Besides, no suicide note was found.

145
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:30,732
If it's not an accident,

146
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:32,779
are there any witnesses?

147
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,978
There were almost no people on
the overpass because of the downpour.

148
00:12:37,978 --> 00:12:41,303
And the people on the street
had umbrellas blocking their vision.

149
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,922
Also...

150
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:46,819
...the direction of the fall is unusual...

151
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,548
...to see it as a simple slip.

152
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:52,343
Someone could have pushed her...

153
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:55,694
...or perhaps there was
a physical altercation.

154
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,476
Have you identified the victim?

155
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,626
Yes.

156
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:01,643
Her name is Jeong Geum-hee.

157
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:03,760
She's a 57-year-old woman.

158
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:05,476
Is that so?

159
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:07,771
Then we only need to
catch the culprit now.

160
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:09,667
You take care of it.

161
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:12,043
And do it with him.

162
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:13,610
Let's see how good you are.

163
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,945
Okay, sir.

164
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:20,643
Umm...

165
00:13:20,643 --> 00:13:21,962
Team Head sir.

166
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:24,550
It seems that the person
who fell is my friend's mother.

167
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,210
- Is that so?
- Yes.

168
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,425
If somebody pushed
her or something...

169
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,710
We must catch the culprit.

170
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,776
I'll catch them myself
and put them behind bars.

171
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:35,376
First, collect the security
camera footage from this area.

172
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:36,143
Yes, sir.

173
00:13:36,143 --> 00:13:37,793
And get the victim's
call history as well.

174
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:40,566
You can place that here.

175
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:41,717
Okay.

176
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:43,710
Thank you so much.

177
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,326
I just couldn't do it by myself.

178
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,834
But shouldn't you tell the CEO?

179
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:52,560
Tell him about what?

180
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:54,910
Oh, about my boyfriend
coming to Seoul?

181
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,910
Yes.

182
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,226
Of course.

183
00:13:57,743 --> 00:13:59,210
This is yours.

184
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,420
What?

185
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:03,837
You didn't have to buy mine.

186
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:08,674
You're going to tell him, right?

187
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,592
Of course.

188
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,124
Hey, Min-su.

189
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:21,018
What?

190
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:24,510
- Oh, what in the world...
- What do we do?

191
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,577
- My goodness.
- What's going on?

192
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:29,443
The kitchen lady was in an accident.

193
00:14:29,443 --> 00:14:30,910
We don't know if she'll survive.

194
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,314
How badly was she hurt? I'm going too.

195
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:34,567
You just stay here.
You need to take care of the restaurant.

196
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:36,576
Should we just close
the restaurant today?

197
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,160
What are you doing? Get in now.

198
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,610
Close the restaurant for now
and do some cleanup.

199
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,710
Hurry up and get in!

200
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm coming!

201
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:48,656
They can't reach Jeong-woo.
Do you know anything?

202
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:52,051
What would you know?

203
00:14:52,843 --> 00:14:53,876
Geez.

204
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,526
I'm coming!

205
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,159
Let's go find Jeong-woo.

206
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:16,176
I searched up Goh Jeong-woo,
and he seems like a real scary person.

207
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:19,576
Shouldn't he at least tell the families
where he abandoned the bodies?

208
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:20,935
He's truly despicable.

209
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:23,792
You should stop being
friends with him, Su-oh.

210
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,753
Watch what you say.

211
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,043
Su-oh.

212
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:34,075
Su-oh, where are you going?

213
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:43,093
The door is open.

214
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,907
Is anybody here?

215
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,869
Excuse me...

216
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,207
Is anybody here?

217
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:56,626
Mr. Goh Jeong-woo.

218
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:14,523
Su-oh, isn't this Mr. Goh Jeong-woo's?

219
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,852
I don't know.

220
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,709
It seems he has already
gone to the hospital.

221
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,105
Let's stop now.

222
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,051
I didn't kill them.

223
00:16:57,744 --> 00:16:59,564
I didn't. I didn't kill them.

224
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:01,076
I didn't kill them.

225
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:02,893
I didn't kill them.

226
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,439
Su-oh.

227
00:17:13,643 --> 00:17:15,110
I didn't kill them.

228
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:18,026
I didn't...

229
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:23,126
...kill them.

230
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:37,476
This is ambiguous. Looks like
we'll have to go through all of them.

231
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:39,860
What? All of these?

232
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:41,726
Yeah.

233
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:44,792
We'd lose our eyeballs if we
watched all of this by ourselves.

234
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,226
My fellow officers.

235
00:17:48,476 --> 00:17:51,810
We won't be able to finish watching
these even if we spend days on them.

236
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,543
Let's help each other a little, all right?

237
00:17:54,543 --> 00:17:56,676
- Detective Seo, you check this.
- What is this?

238
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,743
- Now, Detective Yoo.
- Why should I?

239
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:00,826
We're on the same team, aren't we?

240
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:03,293
Let's do this quickly and
then get some soju, all right?

241
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,611
Grilled pork belly.

242
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,493
- Grilled skin-on pork belly.
- No.

243
00:18:06,643 --> 00:18:08,052
- Grilled short ribs.
- Deal.

244
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:09,510
- Deal.
- Deal.

245
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,276
Okay, okay.

246
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:11,660
Let's go.

247
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:13,183
One more...

248
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:16,820
Mr. CEO, sir.

249
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,693
Please look into a hospital for me.

250
00:18:20,443 --> 00:18:21,895
My mother is hurt.

251
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,026
Jeong-woo.

252
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:29,860
Seol, you help him out. You're quick.

253
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,260
You have a license, right?

254
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,022
Where is your mind at?

255
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,526
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,493
I... I'm sorry.

257
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:00,011
Thank you.

258
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,910
What happened?

259
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,676
She fell from the overpass,
so the fracture is severe.

260
00:19:06,676 --> 00:19:09,660
Many of her bones are broken,
and there are some internal ruptures.

261
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,830
Was the surgery successful?

262
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,510
Yes, but she still hasn't
regained consciousness.

263
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,510
Min-su, I can't let Mom die like this.

264
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,276
She's lived her whole life
suffering because of me.

265
00:19:18,276 --> 00:19:19,426
Jeong-woo.

266
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,976
Your mother is a good person,

267
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:24,391
so she won't be taken
to heaven just yet.

268
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,043
It looks like she could
die at any moment.

269
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,493
Tell me about it.

270
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,789
Jeong-woo isn't even human.

271
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:37,186
His mother is lying like that,
and yet he's wandering around.

272
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,810
Maybe he ran away.

273
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,960
I thought he'd come to his senses
after serving his time in prison.

274
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,145
But his gaze became
even more frightening.

275
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,176
You bastard. Where were...

276
00:19:49,176 --> 00:19:51,210
What were you up to that
you're only arriving now?

277
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,843
Hey, don't provoke him!

278
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:54,376
What's wrong with you two?

279
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:56,276
Don't do this in the hospital.
Leave now.

280
00:19:56,276 --> 00:19:57,476
Get out now. Get out.

281
00:19:57,476 --> 00:19:59,004
Get out now.

282
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:04,776
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

283
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:06,143
What brings you here?

284
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:07,643
I was worried about the kitchen lady.

285
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:08,810
Was the surgery successful?

286
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,576
Why are you here?
What about the restaurant?

287
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,943
Well, she told me to close it for now...

288
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:14,243
What do you mean close it?

289
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:15,426
Go back now.

290
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,018
The surgery went well.
Take them with you.

291
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,860
Go now.

292
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:23,090
Bye.

293
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,293
Mom.

294
00:20:37,443 --> 00:20:39,183
<i>You can't live here.</i>

295
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,705
Even though you've served your sentence,

296
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,493
you can't atone for your crime.

297
00:20:46,543 --> 00:20:49,127
<i>I'm going to stay here until I die...</i>

298
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,873
...since my son is a criminal.

299
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:57,950
I've got so much to tell you.

300
00:20:59,776 --> 00:21:01,628
You have to wake up, Mom.

301
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,048
You have to wake up and
listen to what I have to say.

302
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,493
Okay?

303
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:13,443
A total of three patients moved
from the ER to the ICU, right?

304
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:14,739
Yes, that's right.

305
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:17,526
Min-su.

306
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,683
Could you give me a moment?

307
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:22,393
Right now?

308
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:23,826
Come over here.

309
00:21:26,943 --> 00:21:29,473
Why is this person
running when it's raining?

310
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:32,103
BIG CLOTHES FASHION

311
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:38,943
To not get wet?

312
00:21:38,943 --> 00:21:41,826
But he's holding an umbrella.

313
00:21:42,543 --> 00:21:43,576
That's true.

314
00:21:43,576 --> 00:21:44,910
He's wearing a cap.

315
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,526
A black cap.

316
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,926
Do you know this person?

317
00:21:52,476 --> 00:21:53,410
No.

318
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,407
This is too blurry, so I can't see.

319
00:21:57,176 --> 00:21:59,397
Wait a sec.

320
00:21:59,743 --> 00:22:02,540
What does it say on the cap?

321
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,976
"Mu..."

322
00:22:03,976 --> 00:22:05,526
Oh, "Mucheon."

323
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,426
"Mucheon."

324
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,351
Oh, then we just need to find
a person who has this cap.

325
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:15,210
What?

326
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,126
Everyone in this neighborhood has this.

327
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:22,102
Oh.

328
00:22:22,103 --> 00:22:25,126
That means he's not an outsider, right?

329
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:28,310
Gosh, it's already way past lunchtime.

330
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,376
You should go and eat first.

331
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:31,410
All right, let's eat first.

332
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,976
After all, we're doing this
to put food in our mouths.

333
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,176
- Right.
- Let's eat first.

334
00:22:34,176 --> 00:22:35,977
- Should we? All right, then.
- I'll be checking this.

335
00:22:35,978 --> 00:22:38,141
Yes, we should eat.

336
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:44,976
BIG CLOTHES FASHION

337
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:53,702
What do you think you're doing?

338
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,310
Traumatic subdural hemorrhage.

339
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,291
How should I explain this to you?

340
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:04,982
What does that mean?

341
00:23:05,243 --> 00:23:06,976
To put it simply,

342
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:09,576
Inside a human head,
there's the brain.

343
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:12,038
The brain blood vessels in the
dura mater surrounding the brain...

344
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:15,068
...burst open and this
space gets filled with blood.

345
00:23:17,243 --> 00:23:18,943
There aren't any other injuries, are there?

346
00:23:18,943 --> 00:23:22,176
Well, there aren't any big injuries.

347
00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:25,476
Oh, her occipital region
was ruptured by the fall.

348
00:23:25,476 --> 00:23:27,310
It means she fell like this.

349
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,613
Like this, since this part was ruptured.

350
00:23:37,276 --> 00:23:39,400
Hey, why would you
clean that up? Hey!

351
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,926
Why would you clean that up?

352
00:23:43,243 --> 00:23:44,676
- Min-su.
- Yes?

353
00:23:44,676 --> 00:23:46,743
How is Bo-yeong's father these days?

354
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:48,876
Hey, don't even start.

355
00:23:48,876 --> 00:23:51,243
He's always drinking like he always did.

356
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:52,710
He just drinks every day.

357
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,815
I'm pretty sure he's drinking
at our place right now.

358
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:57,243
It's like he drinks alcohol
as if it were a meal.

359
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:02,876
<i>You!</i>

360
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:04,779
You stay out of my sight!

361
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:08,398
Or else, I'll kill both you
and your mother!

362
00:24:13,496 --> 00:24:14,652
Jeong-woo.

363
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,823
As for your mother,

364
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:19,510
I'll try to check on her frequently.

365
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,443
Visiting hours are over now, anyway.

366
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:22,876
You should go home and rest.

367
00:24:22,876 --> 00:24:24,028
Thanks.

368
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,310
Call me if something comes up.

369
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,478
Okay.

370
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:33,890
Hello, I'm Park Hyeong-sik.

371
00:24:33,943 --> 00:24:35,850
Thank you so much for coming.

372
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:38,643
This sexual violence counseling center...

373
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,847
...was one of my life's wishes.

374
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:45,343
For those unable to escape from
sexual and domestic violence...

375
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:47,243
His wife is so lucky.

376
00:24:47,243 --> 00:24:49,110
Imagine getting a husband like that.

377
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,643
He's good-looking, smart
and he's got a good figure.

378
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:52,943
His personality is even better.

379
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:54,293
And he's 10 years
younger than her to boot.

380
00:24:54,443 --> 00:24:57,710
I was able to come this far...

381
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,910
...thanks to my wife Ye Yeong-sil,

382
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,476
who has supported me and
has been my life companion.

383
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:05,343
Due to her National Assembly schedule,

384
00:25:05,343 --> 00:25:07,443
- she couldn't join us today.
- Where is a younger guy like him?

385
00:25:07,443 --> 00:25:08,776
Why would you search far and wide?

386
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,676
Shin Min-su, are you crazy?

387
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,676
You're just younger.

388
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,210
I'm usually too shy
to say things like this,

389
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:16,819
but I think can say it
since she's not here now.

390
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:19,620
Honey, thank you.

391
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:23,943
- I am classmates with Choi Na-gyeom.
- There are so many I'd like to thank.

392
00:25:23,943 --> 00:25:25,510
So is everyone from the
54th class of Mucheon High.

393
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,276
She's right.

394
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:29,819
If it hadn't been for him, establishing
this center would have been impossible.

395
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:33,486
It's Police Chief Hyeon Gu-tak
from Mucheon Police Station.

396
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,060
Please give him a big hand.

397
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:42,354
MOU SIGNING CEREMONY

398
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:49,975
I'm not sure if I deserve
that grandiose introduction.

399
00:25:52,776 --> 00:25:54,910
Hello. How do you do, everyone?

400
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,510
I'm Police Chief Hyeon Gu-tak
from Mucheon Police Station.

401
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,834
You know the person caught on
the security camera, don't you?

402
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,776
That's why you were shocked
as soon as you saw him.

403
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:04,243
You reassured me saying everyone
has that cap, and then stayed behind...

404
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:05,976
...to erase the security camera footage.
Am I right?

405
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:07,863
No, that's not true.

406
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,110
I would never do something like that.

407
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,910
Then why can't you say who it is?

408
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:12,947
You definitely know this person.

409
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:18,310
Prepare yourself.

410
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,460
Destruction of evidence,
and harboring of a criminal.

411
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,643
Where did the suspect go in?

412
00:26:23,643 --> 00:26:26,495
I kept following the man in the cap
who was getting rained on,

413
00:26:26,843 --> 00:26:27,993
and he went in here.

414
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,910
We should obtain the hospital
security camera footage, then.

415
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,926
- Let's go to the hospital first.
- Team Head, sir.

416
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:34,376
I'm also a detective.

417
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:36,408
I wasn't trying to hide it.
I was trying to find solid evidence...

418
00:26:36,408 --> 00:26:38,214
Who is it, then?

419
00:26:39,076 --> 00:26:40,276
My father.

420
00:26:40,276 --> 00:26:41,744
It seems it's my father.

421
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:51,359
You should've said it the moment
you saw him on the footage.

422
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:54,126
- Geez, let's go.
- Team Head sir.

423
00:26:54,276 --> 00:26:57,076
My father would never hurt her.

424
00:26:57,076 --> 00:26:58,410
He was very fond of her.

425
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,943
Then why did he push her?

426
00:26:59,943 --> 00:27:01,199
Huh?

427
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:03,198
I should go and ask him myself.

428
00:27:05,043 --> 00:27:06,543
Sir, take me as well.

429
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:07,510
Let go.

430
00:27:07,511 --> 00:27:09,047
I'll just stand by watching.

431
00:27:09,443 --> 00:27:10,593
Hey.

432
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:13,043
You know the exclusion policy, right?

433
00:27:13,176 --> 00:27:15,066
You wait here, all right?

434
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,310
Aren't you open today?

435
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,210
It was closed when I came earlier today.

436
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,575
Where have you been?

437
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,286
What do you want to eat?

438
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,486
Just give me anything.

439
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,988
I just need soju.

440
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,860
Hey.

441
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:49,959
Jeong-woo's mom got into an accident.

442
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,210
What accident?

443
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,976
She fell from the overpass,
and is unconscious.

444
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,360
She just got punished.

445
00:27:56,443 --> 00:27:58,760
What time is Heung-su leaving work?

446
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,603
Tell him to come,
so we can have some soju.

447
00:28:00,627 --> 00:28:02,859
He must be busy.
He's not picking up.

448
00:28:09,343 --> 00:28:11,243
Does Yang Heung-su work here?

449
00:28:11,243 --> 00:28:12,526
Wait a minute.

450
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:15,812
Okay.

451
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:19,076
So?

452
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:20,993
Yang Heung-su took
a half-day off today.

453
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:26,510
MUCHEON

454
00:28:39,862 --> 00:28:41,578
Stop, stop, stop.

455
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:50,137
Mister.

456
00:28:55,143 --> 00:28:56,477
Are you getting off work?

457
00:28:57,382 --> 00:28:58,532
Yeah.

458
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,752
Thank you for looking after
my mom for so long.

459
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,449
I've been to the hospital,
and she's unconscious.

460
00:29:11,476 --> 00:29:13,244
I don't think it was an accident.

461
00:29:14,543 --> 00:29:16,443
I'm going to find the person...

462
00:29:16,443 --> 00:29:17,874
...who did that to mom.

463
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:24,593
I'll get going.

464
00:29:49,643 --> 00:29:51,347
Wow, I love the aroma.

465
00:29:51,543 --> 00:29:52,893
Oh, yes.

466
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:57,476
Do you personally conduct
consultations here in this room, then?

467
00:29:57,476 --> 00:29:58,481
Yes, of course.

468
00:29:58,482 --> 00:30:00,193
It's cozy and nice.

469
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:02,543
But I think there's one thing missing.

470
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:05,276
Shouldn't there be a photo of you
and Assemblywoman Ye?

471
00:30:05,276 --> 00:30:06,786
Oh, well...

472
00:30:06,943 --> 00:30:10,710
I try not to keep personal items
that could potentially provoke...

473
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,421
...the patient in the room.

474
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,143
It interferes with the consultation.

475
00:30:14,143 --> 00:30:15,795
Oh, I didn't consider that.

476
00:30:17,043 --> 00:30:18,768
- Enjoy.
- Yes, thank you.

477
00:30:21,476 --> 00:30:23,356
- Oh, excuse me.
- It's fine.

478
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,260
Yes.

479
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:32,824
All right. Okay.

480
00:30:35,443 --> 00:30:36,443
My, this is bad news.

481
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:38,643
I have some business
at the police station.

482
00:30:38,643 --> 00:30:39,578
I'm sorry.

483
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:42,476
In that case, we should
have dinner some other time.

484
00:30:42,476 --> 00:30:43,626
Yes.

485
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:47,218
I'll treat you and Assemblywoman
Ye to a great meal next time.

486
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:57,159
MUCHEON GARDEN

487
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,560
Heung-su!

488
00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:06,993
Jae-hee.

489
00:31:08,143 --> 00:31:10,793
Oh, my goodness.

490
00:31:16,743 --> 00:31:17,843
How shocking.

491
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,976
Listen, Heung-su just got out of a taxi!

492
00:31:19,976 --> 00:31:24,060
Wow, I've never seen
him take a taxi before.

493
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:26,243
Don't talk nonsense.

494
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:28,357
It'd be more believable
to call this water.

495
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,276
I just took a cab because I was tired.

496
00:31:31,276 --> 00:31:32,510
I told you, right?

497
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:35,343
He actually took a taxi.

498
00:31:35,343 --> 00:31:38,443
I rubbed my eyes,
thinking I was seeing things.

499
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:39,710
I want beer.

500
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,367
Aren't you going to drive?

501
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:42,517
Then...

502
00:31:43,849 --> 00:31:45,831
- I'll get a soda.
- Okay.

503
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,002
The insurance lady and
Byeong-mu's father are here.

504
00:31:57,043 --> 00:31:59,052
I should make more food.

505
00:31:59,076 --> 00:32:00,926
Should I make a rolled omelet?

506
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,186
Ma'am.

507
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,976
Is it just me who finds this strange?

508
00:32:09,976 --> 00:32:10,810
What?

509
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,543
Isn't everyone here so strange?

510
00:32:12,543 --> 00:32:14,076
What do you mean strange?

511
00:32:14,076 --> 00:32:16,643
Everything is strange
and novel to you, isn't it?

512
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,164
I find you to be the
strangest and the most novel.

513
00:32:19,928 --> 00:32:23,776
I mean, the kitchen
lady is unconscious.

514
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,804
Nobody looks concerned.

515
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:28,936
I feel bad for the kitchen lady.

516
00:32:29,743 --> 00:32:31,426
I'm also heartbroken.

517
00:32:31,643 --> 00:32:34,910
But think about Jeong-woo.

518
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,740
No one can't take her side.

519
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,451
I didn't kill them.

520
00:32:46,272 --> 00:32:50,743
We traced the culprit caught
on the security camera...

521
00:32:50,743 --> 00:32:53,760
...and confirmed him to
be Byeong-mu's father.

522
00:32:54,643 --> 00:32:58,341
It's raining,
and he runs with an umbrella.

523
00:32:58,365 --> 00:32:59,743
BIG CLOTHES FASHION
Geez, he almost fell.

524
00:32:59,743 --> 00:33:02,026
He's definitely the culprit.

525
00:33:02,508 --> 00:33:03,658
Chief, sir.

526
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,360
No, Mr. Hyeon.

527
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,076
You know my father very well.

528
00:33:09,076 --> 00:33:10,443
He would never do something like that.

529
00:33:10,444 --> 00:33:12,638
You saw the security
camera footage yourself.

530
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,810
Is this all?

531
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,960
Pardon?

532
00:33:17,743 --> 00:33:19,310
You said he's definitely the culprit.

533
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,004
Is this all the evidence there is?

534
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,260
Yes.

535
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,662
This isn't direct evidence.

536
00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:30,923
Call him in for a
witness interview for now.

537
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,460
Both of you, listen.

538
00:33:33,843 --> 00:33:35,843
Investigations must be
conducted according to principles.

539
00:33:35,843 --> 00:33:38,476
Relying solely on suspicions or
emotions can lead to misjudgments.

540
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:39,626
Do you understand?

541
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,656
Yes, sir.

542
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,460
Corporal Yang.

543
00:33:44,676 --> 00:33:45,675
Yes, sir.

544
00:33:45,676 --> 00:33:47,626
He's still a witness.

545
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:50,730
You should stay by your
father's side at times like these.

546
00:33:51,043 --> 00:33:52,301
Oh, yes.

547
00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:54,026
Thank you.

548
00:34:00,376 --> 00:34:02,860
Na-gyeom! Na-gyeom!

549
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,410
I'm sorry.

550
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,976
I've been so busy.

551
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,243
How is Jeong-woo's mother?

552
00:34:08,243 --> 00:34:09,560
When can I visit her?

553
00:34:09,776 --> 00:34:12,043
We've talked about this on the phone.

554
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,326
Things don't look good.

555
00:34:13,776 --> 00:34:16,276
She's in the ICU,
so you can't visit her anyway.

556
00:34:16,276 --> 00:34:19,426
Where's Jeong-woo?
I can't reach him.

557
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,710
He must have gone home.

558
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,399
I told him to go home.

559
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,760
Good job.

560
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,710
Min-su.

561
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,710
I'll help you in whichever way I can,

562
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,645
so find the best option.

563
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,079
His phone is off,
so where can we find him?

564
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,618
Why is he here?

565
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,626
He must be curious
since this involves his father.

566
00:34:44,029 --> 00:34:47,412
If he's not at home,
he must be at Mucheon Garden.

567
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,010
Didn't I say that you were
excluded from this investigation?

568
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,829
He's still a witness,
and not a suspect.

569
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,004
I want to help with the investigation.

570
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:05,076
Darn it, you scared me! What is it?

571
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:06,355
What's with you?

572
00:35:10,923 --> 00:35:12,199
Why are you here?

573
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,490
I need to ask you something.

574
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,857
Why is he here right now?

575
00:35:14,857 --> 00:35:17,335
I came to ask you just one question.

576
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,603
I assume you would know.

577
00:35:23,076 --> 00:35:24,659
My mom.

578
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:27,649
Did she do something to make
someone hold a grudge against her?

579
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:31,471
You bastard.

580
00:35:32,461 --> 00:35:33,611
You darn bastard.

581
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,566
How dare you come here
and cause a ruckus?

582
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,223
Where were you this morning?

583
00:35:43,223 --> 00:35:45,110
What are you yapping about, you bastard?

584
00:35:46,857 --> 00:35:48,357
You darn bastard.

585
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:50,957
You killed two people and won't
even say where you buried them.

586
00:35:50,957 --> 00:35:53,123
And now that your mom is hurt,
does your heart ache? Huh?

587
00:35:53,123 --> 00:35:55,605
Yes, it hurts. I'm heartbroken.

588
00:35:55,657 --> 00:35:57,857
It hurts so much that I want to die,
but I can't even do that.

589
00:35:57,857 --> 00:36:01,233
No matter how much of a bastard I am
and how much I deserve to die,

590
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:02,533
my mom doesn't deserve this.

591
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:05,657
You know better than I do
that she doesn't deserve this.

592
00:36:05,657 --> 00:36:07,890
Right.
Your mom is human.

593
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,705
Not a bastard like you, but a human!

594
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:12,590
Your mom fell because of you, you bastard!

595
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,479
- Do you know that?
- That's right!

596
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,490
Then you should have pushed me!

597
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,523
What?

598
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:32,157
You should have pushed
me and not my mom!

599
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,073
How dare you!

600
00:36:35,157 --> 00:36:37,157
What is it that you want, Mr. Shim?

601
00:36:37,157 --> 00:36:38,457
What is it that you want?

602
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:40,054
Your death!

603
00:36:40,357 --> 00:36:44,457
I want you to die just like
my daughter, you darn bastard!

604
00:36:44,457 --> 00:36:45,943
- Hit me.
- What?

605
00:36:45,944 --> 00:36:49,357
If that can put you at ease,
hit me until I die.

606
00:36:49,357 --> 00:36:51,707
Instead, just tell me...

607
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,023
...where you were this morning.

608
00:36:54,023 --> 00:36:55,173
What?

609
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,824
You bastard!

610
00:37:07,757 --> 00:37:09,857
Now, tell me where you were.

611
00:37:09,857 --> 00:37:12,145
No one will help you...

612
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:15,051
...even if you're dying.

613
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,638
You crazy bastard!

614
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,870
Let's go.

615
00:37:30,576 --> 00:37:33,557
- That is a crazy bastard.
- Just get in the car.

616
00:37:33,557 --> 00:37:35,059
Ugh, seriously.

617
00:37:38,057 --> 00:37:39,872
Why call the police in
this tiny neighborhood?

618
00:38:02,057 --> 00:38:04,033
Look at this mess!

619
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:05,507
Give it to me.

620
00:38:06,257 --> 00:38:08,107
Did something happen here?

621
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:10,123
It was nothing.

622
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:12,035
We're from Mucheon Police Station.

623
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:13,497
Hey, son.

624
00:38:13,521 --> 00:38:14,730
It's nothing serious.

625
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:15,861
Don't worry.

626
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:18,040
What did you do at 10:20 a.m. today?

627
00:38:19,595 --> 00:38:21,912
- What?
- Were you near the pedestrian overpass?

628
00:38:26,907 --> 00:38:28,690
It wasn't me.

629
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,365
Were you near the pedestrian overpass?

630
00:38:31,658 --> 00:38:33,606
It wasn't me, all right?

631
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,618
Look straight into my eyes.

632
00:38:36,957 --> 00:38:39,337
Did you push Jeong-woo's
mom off the overpass?

633
00:38:42,762 --> 00:38:43,862
No.

634
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,840
Let's talk at the station.

635
00:38:47,257 --> 00:38:48,407
Hey.

636
00:38:49,236 --> 00:38:50,419
Hold on.

637
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,595
Mr. Yang.

638
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:56,665
Mr. Yang, did you...

639
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:58,582
Do that to my mom?

640
00:38:58,742 --> 00:39:00,273
- Jeong-woo.
- Wait.

641
00:39:00,274 --> 00:39:01,511
You didn't, did you?

642
00:39:02,157 --> 00:39:03,357
We'll investigate, okay?

643
00:39:03,357 --> 00:39:05,840
We'll do a thorough investigation
and keep you informed, trust me.

644
00:39:19,402 --> 00:39:21,786
- Are you all right?
- No.

645
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:25,577
This must be hard on your part,
but I'll do my best to investigate.

646
00:39:27,423 --> 00:39:28,523
I'll go with you.

647
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:31,757
We're just doing a witness
interview at the moment.

648
00:39:31,757 --> 00:39:33,798
So stay by your mother's side, okay?

649
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:47,973
Hold on.

650
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:52,120
The police couldn't have come that quickly.

651
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:53,328
Why were they there?

652
00:39:54,532 --> 00:39:55,855
Isn't it strange?

653
00:40:00,385 --> 00:40:01,525
Hey.

654
00:40:04,523 --> 00:40:05,457
I should have come
and said hello sooner.

655
00:40:05,457 --> 00:40:08,586
I'm Inspector Noh Sang-cheol.
I'm newly appointed here.

656
00:40:08,857 --> 00:40:10,208
Welcome.

657
00:40:10,757 --> 00:40:13,957
Gosh, it's really hard to meet you,
Team Head Noh.

658
00:40:13,957 --> 00:40:15,197
Sit down.

659
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:18,923
I've been preoccupied with
so many official events as well.

660
00:40:18,923 --> 00:40:20,423
I hear that you've been
busy since your arrival.

661
00:40:20,423 --> 00:40:21,856
Oh, that's all right.

662
00:40:21,857 --> 00:40:23,023
I've heard everything.

663
00:40:23,023 --> 00:40:25,095
I've heard that you got
rid of the happy-slappers...

664
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:26,890
...and got a lead on the
overpass case, isn't that right?

665
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,257
Oh, it's nothing much, sir.

666
00:40:29,257 --> 00:40:30,472
Anyway...

667
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,290
How do you plan to handle
the overpass case?

668
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,840
I'll do my best.

669
00:40:37,357 --> 00:40:39,394
You're planning to
get a confession, right?

670
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,963
But can you do that with
just security camera footage?

671
00:40:42,457 --> 00:40:44,777
It won't act as conclusive evidence.

672
00:40:44,857 --> 00:40:45,957
Don't you worry.

673
00:40:45,957 --> 00:40:48,318
I'll get the confession,
no matter what.

674
00:40:49,057 --> 00:40:51,087
Just one thing.

675
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:51,990
Yes?

676
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,432
Stick to the principles.

677
00:40:53,823 --> 00:40:56,757
Don't push ahead without
conclusive evidence.

678
00:40:56,757 --> 00:40:59,290
Above all, violence and verbal
abuse are absolutely unacceptable.

679
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,511
Yes, understood.

680
00:41:00,728 --> 00:41:01,940
The principles.

681
00:41:02,457 --> 00:41:03,607
Drink.

682
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,470
INNOCENT AND PURE

683
00:41:07,471 --> 00:41:09,789
MUCHEON POLICE OFFICE

684
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,118
Please...

685
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,983
Sir.

686
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,297
I used to work at...

687
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:32,179
...the Major Crime Unit.

688
00:41:32,606 --> 00:41:35,581
I've seen a lot of younger detectives,

689
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:37,189
and Detective Yang...

690
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,480
He will do very well as a detective.

691
00:41:39,604 --> 00:41:41,154
I can sense that in him.

692
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,334
Right...

693
00:41:45,557 --> 00:41:49,340
So for the sake of your son,

694
00:41:50,123 --> 00:41:51,900
you must speak the truth, okay?

695
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,107
Yeah.

696
00:41:56,057 --> 00:41:58,657
Where were you
around 10:20 a.m. today?

697
00:41:58,657 --> 00:42:00,041
I went to work.

698
00:42:01,957 --> 00:42:03,778
I looked at the security camera footage,

699
00:42:04,257 --> 00:42:06,223
and you were near the overpass.

700
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,799
And you were wearing a cap
with "Mucheon" on it.

701
00:42:09,002 --> 00:42:12,000
It was raining but you were just
running without using your umbrella.

702
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:14,400
Did something urgent come up?

703
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,890
I didn't want to be late.

704
00:42:20,857 --> 00:42:22,488
That could happen, yes.

705
00:42:30,536 --> 00:42:32,532
What's your relationship
with Ms. Jeong Geum-hee?

706
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:36,379
You are close since you live
in the same village, right?

707
00:42:36,823 --> 00:42:38,996
You're both single.

708
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:40,923
Did you have romantic
feelings for her?

709
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:43,125
No, it's not like that.

710
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:51,960
The last person she talked to
on her phone was you.

711
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:53,109
All right?

712
00:42:53,768 --> 00:42:55,564
When did you last see her?

713
00:42:58,674 --> 00:43:00,214
Hey, Jeong-woo's mom!

714
00:43:00,462 --> 00:43:01,767
Geum-hee!

715
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,236
You saw her on the
overpass, didn't you?

716
00:43:10,657 --> 00:43:11,807
I...

717
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,090
I don't know anything.

718
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,494
- You went onto the overpass, right?
- I don't know anything.

719
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,787
Did you push Ms. Jeong
Geum-hee from the overpass?

720
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:29,890
Yes, Chief.

721
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,690
<i>Wrap up the interview for today.</i>
<i>He's just here as a witness.</i>

722
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,336
Just give me 5 more minutes.

723
00:43:35,068 --> 00:43:36,204
Yes.

724
00:43:48,323 --> 00:43:49,441
Sir.

725
00:43:49,557 --> 00:43:51,118
Detective Yang...

726
00:43:51,623 --> 00:43:53,790
...is also friends with the victim's son.

727
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,757
For the victim and her
family's sake, speak the truth...

728
00:43:56,757 --> 00:43:59,277
Jeong-woo isn't a victim.

729
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,657
- Excuse me?
- He's a murderer.

730
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:09,105
What kind of a person
was Goh Jeong-woo?

731
00:44:10,323 --> 00:44:13,728
He seems too confident for a murderer.

732
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:17,652
After seeing him cry in the warehouse,
something feels strange.

733
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:20,657
Things he said in the warehouse
this morning. What could they mean?

734
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:22,475
He said he didn't kill them.

735
00:44:22,723 --> 00:44:26,038
He kept saying that as if
he had just remembered it.

736
00:44:26,423 --> 00:44:28,572
So what does that mean?

737
00:44:28,623 --> 00:44:31,859
Does he mean he doesn't remember
where he abandoned the bodies?

738
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,912
Or, did he really not kill them?

739
00:44:37,657 --> 00:44:39,133
You should go home.

740
00:44:39,157 --> 00:44:40,307
Huh?

741
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:43,646
What's with you these days?

742
00:44:43,646 --> 00:44:45,723
Why do you always get angry
whenever Goh Jeong-woo is mentioned?

743
00:44:45,723 --> 00:44:46,873
Go!

744
00:44:50,843 --> 00:44:52,793
All right, I'll get going.

745
00:44:59,957 --> 00:45:02,397
Gosh, everyone's weird these days.

746
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:19,207
Anyone can drink and drive
and cause a hit-and-run.

747
00:45:26,296 --> 00:45:28,046
You're a real police officer.

748
00:45:30,731 --> 00:45:32,881
Was I always such a
poor judge of character?

749
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:38,090
I shouldn't just trust people like that.

750
00:45:43,938 --> 00:45:46,238
INVESTIGATION REPORT ON THE
MUCHEON MURDER CASE WITHOUT BODIES

751
00:45:48,317 --> 00:45:51,591
INVESTIGATION
CHIEF HYEON GU-TAK

752
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:09,614
MUCHEON GARDEN

753
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:17,918
<i>What did you do at 10:20 a.m. today?</i>

754
00:46:18,538 --> 00:46:20,138
It wasn't me.

755
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:21,827
Were you near the pedestrian overpass?

756
00:46:23,038 --> 00:46:23,904
It wasn't me.

757
00:46:23,904 --> 00:46:25,754
Did you...

758
00:46:26,104 --> 00:46:27,811
Do that to my mother?

759
00:46:42,204 --> 00:46:43,521
Mr. Goh Jeong-woo.

760
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:47,581
It turns out that...

761
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:49,917
...you killed someone.

762
00:46:51,204 --> 00:46:52,753
And not just one, but two.

763
00:46:59,771 --> 00:47:00,921
Hey.

764
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:05,104
Even if you've served out
your sentence in prison...

765
00:47:05,104 --> 00:47:08,238
...and a decade has passed, don't act up.

766
00:47:08,238 --> 00:47:09,471
You got that?

767
00:47:10,904 --> 00:47:12,357
Do you know where you are?

768
00:47:13,538 --> 00:47:14,688
Go.

769
00:47:15,238 --> 00:47:17,903
Is the investigation on
Byeong-mu's father over?

770
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:20,938
What did Byeong-mu's father say?

771
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:21,738
What?

772
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:23,450
Hey. Hey!

773
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:27,138
You think the police are a joke?
Damn it.

774
00:47:27,138 --> 00:47:29,540
Team Head Noh. Jeong-woo.

775
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:32,804
What are you two doing?

776
00:47:32,804 --> 00:47:34,728
I've got something to tell you, Uncle.

777
00:47:35,404 --> 00:47:37,454
- Come in.
- Okay.

778
00:47:47,571 --> 00:47:49,306
Why are you here?

779
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:56,054
Answer me, why are you here?

780
00:48:15,696 --> 00:48:18,129
I've said my part, so I should leave.

781
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:19,680
Heung-su, wait.

782
00:48:21,396 --> 00:48:23,899
Byeong-mu's father,
you should say it again.

783
00:48:23,923 --> 00:48:26,045
Team Head Noh and
Jeong-woo should know as well.

784
00:48:37,863 --> 00:48:39,350
She fell on her own.

785
00:48:40,596 --> 00:48:41,996
That's all I managed to see.

786
00:48:41,996 --> 00:48:44,730
Mom fell off the overpass on her own?

787
00:48:45,029 --> 00:48:46,905
Then why didn't you
report it right away?

788
00:48:47,563 --> 00:48:49,729
Jeong-woo, he's a witness.

789
00:48:49,729 --> 00:48:51,429
It wasn't just anyone. It was my mom.

790
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,948
So why didn't you report it right away?

791
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,494
- I've said everything.
- Mr. Yang!

792
00:49:02,722 --> 00:49:04,722
- Mr. Yang!
- Stop it.

793
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:19,519
Team Head Noh,
what brings you here?

794
00:49:20,229 --> 00:49:22,796
I wanted to discuss the
overpass case with you.

795
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:25,196
Uncle, if Byeong-mu's father
was just a witness...

796
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:28,318
Byeong-mu's father
always helped your mother.

797
00:49:28,929 --> 00:49:31,129
There's no reason for him to lie, is there?

798
00:49:31,129 --> 00:49:31,696
But...

799
00:49:31,696 --> 00:49:35,746
Just wait a bit more
until your mom wakes up.

800
00:49:37,663 --> 00:49:40,563
Your mom fell because of you,
you bastard!

801
00:49:40,563 --> 00:49:42,666
- Do you know that?
- That's right!

802
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:49,181
Uncle, it was because of me.

803
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:51,944
It must be related to me.

804
00:49:57,923 --> 00:50:00,908
JEONG-WOO

805
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:26,792
It hasn't changed.

806
00:50:49,955 --> 00:50:52,233
Detective, sir.

807
00:50:55,463 --> 00:50:58,713
Will you just let Byeong-mu's
father off the hook like this?

808
00:50:59,563 --> 00:51:01,372
The investigation has been postponed.

809
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:04,036
So just come pick up your
mother's belongings tomorrow.

810
00:51:11,296 --> 00:51:14,096
<i>Due to heavy rainfall exceeding</i>

00:51:36,296 --> 00:51:38,078
Is there anything you haven't told me?

819
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:40,329
You've told me everything, right?

820
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:41,629
Turn off the lights and go to bed.

821
00:51:45,229 --> 00:51:46,537
Good night.

<i>Oh, another one! My goodness.</i>

00:52:22,153 --> 00:52:24,163
Oh, no. My Jeong-woo...

826
00:52:24,163 --> 00:52:26,996
He won't get a car this year.

827
00:52:26,996 --> 00:52:29,196
Not just this year, but also next year.

828
00:52:29,196 --> 00:52:32,324
Actually, not for the next 9 years, huh?

829
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:36,654
Did you two plan this ahead?

830
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,129

- We're not that close.

- You did, didn't you?
- My goodness!

832
00:52:42,229 --> 00:52:44,596
- That's ridiculous.
- Forget it.

833

- You punk!
- Hey, you!

834
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:49,313

What?

00:53:49,068 --> 00:53:50,669
Right, I'll call you back.

839
00:53:50,896 --> 00:53:52,425
Hey! Bok-sun!

840
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:54,174
Bok-sun, where are you going?

841
00:53:57,551 --> 00:53:58,736
Hey, you mutt!

842
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,229
What's wrong with you?
I give you food and snacks!

843

Come here, let's go.

844
00:54:31,508 --> 00:54:32,875
You're on the way to the hospital, right?

845
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:34,296
Get in. I've got something
to tell you on the way.

846
00:54:34,296 --> 00:54:36,046
No, I'm going to the police station.

847
00:54:36,828 --> 00:54:37,796
Why are you going there?

848
00:54:37,796 --> 00:54:39,418
To get Mom's belongings.

849
00:54:40,423 --> 00:54:41,673
Get in, anyway.

850
00:54:45,313 --> 00:54:46,497
Jeong-woo.

851
00:54:46,896 --> 00:54:48,427
You're upset, aren't you?

852
00:54:51,164 --> 00:54:52,306
Right.

853
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:55,768
I think of you as my son,

854
00:54:55,769 --> 00:54:57,519
but I'm also a policeman.

855
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:59,866
Do you know what I'm saying?

856
00:55:00,406 --> 00:55:02,191
You're right.

857
00:55:02,996 --> 00:55:06,420
I shouldn't suspect
anyone without evidence.

858
00:55:10,047 --> 00:55:11,996
Your mother will definitely wake up.

859
00:55:11,996 --> 00:55:14,329
Just focus on her until then.

860
00:55:15,063 --> 00:55:16,629
I want to ask you something.

861
00:55:16,629 --> 00:55:18,481
Sure. What is it?

862
00:55:19,629 --> 00:55:22,503
How far have you gone with
the search for their bodies?

863
00:55:37,346 --> 00:55:38,496
What does that mean?

864
00:55:38,496 --> 00:55:40,801
Can you do another search?

865
00:55:43,555 --> 00:55:45,844
Do you know how many policemen
were involved in the search back then?

866
00:55:46,529 --> 00:55:49,989
I understand how you feel,
but it's difficult at this point.

867
00:55:51,258 --> 00:55:52,196
Let's go.

868
00:55:52,196 --> 00:55:53,296
- Uncle.
- Yeah?

869
00:55:53,296 --> 00:55:55,496
- I should get off here.
- Why?

870
00:55:55,496 --> 00:55:58,430
People might misunderstand if
we go to the police station together.

871
00:55:58,953 --> 00:56:00,416
I just want to walk for a bit.

872
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:03,325
All right.

873
00:56:03,523 --> 00:56:04,829
Thank you.

874
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:06,113
Oh, Jeong-woo.

875
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:11,260
Take it. It's my gift.

INVESTIGATION REPORT ON THE
MUCHEON MURDER CASE WITHOUT BODIES

877
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:38,263
Look, Team Head.

878
00:56:38,263 --> 00:56:40,096
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I wasn't able to thank you.

879
00:56:40,097 --> 00:56:43,204
Your father told the chief himself,
so everything's good.

880
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:47,329
Wow, this was a sensational case.

881
00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:49,548
And you're friends with
this piece of trash?

882
00:56:49,729 --> 00:56:51,663
We've been friends since we were young.

883
00:56:51,663 --> 00:56:53,494
You should have cut ties.

884
00:56:53,494 --> 00:56:55,387
Not just you, but the chief as well.

885
00:56:55,929 --> 00:56:56,796
Geez.

886
00:56:56,796 --> 00:56:59,593
Jeong-woo's father was
best friends with the chief.

887
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:01,721
And Jeong-woo and I
are close childhood friends too.

888
00:57:02,312 --> 00:57:05,129
So when I see Jeong-woo,
I feel a bit sorry for him.

889
00:57:05,129 --> 00:57:06,523
Ugh.

890
00:57:07,063 --> 00:57:10,694
Well, the section chief wants
to have lunch together.

891
00:57:11,063 --> 00:57:13,024
Goh Jeong-woo said...

892
00:57:13,025 --> 00:57:15,863
...it was because of him.
What does that mean?

893
00:57:15,863 --> 00:57:17,146
Well...

894
00:57:17,363 --> 00:57:19,337
That's because...

895
00:57:19,797 --> 00:57:23,129
The victims' parents live
in the same neighborhood.

896
00:57:23,129 --> 00:57:24,163
What?

897
00:57:24,163 --> 00:57:26,263
Oh, but they won't do
something like that.

898
00:57:26,263 --> 00:57:29,396
Bo-yeong's mother works
hard as an insurance agent.

899
00:57:29,396 --> 00:57:31,896
Bo-yeong's father does enjoy drinking,

900
00:57:31,896 --> 00:57:34,163
but he doesn't drink
as much as he used to.

901
00:57:34,163 --> 00:57:35,594
Anyway, they wouldn't do that.

902
00:57:36,963 --> 00:57:39,429
The team head wants a hamburger.

903
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:41,976
- Would that be enough?
- I know.

904
00:57:46,263 --> 00:57:47,429
<i>Mr. Goh Jeong-woo.</i>

905
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:50,263
You are under arrest
on suspicion of murder...

906
00:57:50,263 --> 00:57:51,863
Come to your senses, you bastard!

907
00:57:51,863 --> 00:57:54,329
Is this your father's
or yours, you bastard?

908
00:57:54,329 --> 00:57:56,012
You don't remember?

909
00:58:00,468 --> 00:58:01,893
I was wondering who you were.

910
00:58:02,463 --> 00:58:05,063
Goh Jeong-woo, what brings you here?

911
00:58:05,063 --> 00:58:08,363
Oh, he must have come
to get his mother's belongings.

912
00:58:08,363 --> 00:58:09,586
Right?

913
00:58:12,136 --> 00:58:14,569
10 years ago and even now,

914
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:17,720
I feel so offended whenever I see you.

915
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:20,808
Ugh, I'm hungry, sir.

916
00:58:20,809 --> 00:58:22,441
Let's go and eat.

917
00:58:24,156 --> 00:58:27,295
Live an honest life, all right?

918
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:29,606
Justice lives.

919
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:35,329
We should go eat.

920
00:58:35,329 --> 00:58:37,896
Don't hang out with a bastard like him!

921
00:58:37,897 --> 00:58:39,547
All right, sir.

922
00:58:39,779 --> 00:58:41,168
- Let's go.
- Yes.

923
00:58:43,681 --> 00:58:48,056
<i>The victim's family and the murderer's</i>
<i>family live in the same village.</i>

924
00:58:48,882 --> 00:58:49,981
<i>Why?</i>

925
00:58:54,135 --> 00:58:55,381
Geez.

926
00:58:57,596 --> 00:58:59,324
These were on the overpass, right?

927
00:59:38,263 --> 00:59:40,636
You'll continue with
the investigation, right?

928
00:59:44,186 --> 00:59:45,682
Please do so.

929
00:59:59,122 --> 01:00:01,085
TRANQUILIZER

930
01:00:28,255 --> 01:00:31,991
MALE OXFORD SHIRT

931
01:00:34,258 --> 01:00:37,077
MALE OXFORD SHIRT

932
01:00:37,077 --> 01:00:40,111
If you don't want to get stabbed,
don't say a word and just leave.

933
01:00:40,329 --> 01:00:42,396
- Let me just ask a few questions.
- Get out.

934
01:00:42,396 --> 01:00:43,938
Get out, get out.

935
01:00:44,576 --> 01:00:46,263
How dare a murderer
go around here? Darn.

936
01:00:46,263 --> 01:00:47,993
He killed two people.

937
01:00:47,994 --> 01:00:49,996
Remember that murder case?

938
01:00:49,996 --> 01:00:53,083
The one they couldn't find the bodies.
He's the murderer.

939
01:00:53,308 --> 01:00:55,909
You vermin!
You're not even human!

940
01:01:09,096 --> 01:01:13,013
<i>It was raining, but he ran</i>
<i>without using his umbrella?</i>

941
01:01:13,763 --> 01:01:14,926
<i>Why?</i>

942
01:01:20,996 --> 01:01:23,779
<i>Byeong-mu's father</i>
<i>might know something.</i>

943
01:01:38,463 --> 01:01:41,513
<i>Everyone in this village seemed</i>
<i>to despise Goh Jeong-woo.</i>

944
01:01:41,763 --> 01:01:42,696
<i>And...</i>

945
01:01:42,696 --> 01:01:45,438
Jeong-woo isn't a victim.

946
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,694
<i>Goh Jeong-woo who</i>
<i>just got out of prison...</i>

947
01:01:47,694 --> 01:01:49,443
<i>...must have been the trigger.</i>

948
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:51,064
He's a murderer.

949
01:01:51,065 --> 01:01:52,528
<i>Everyone is a suspect.</i>

950
01:01:52,948 --> 01:01:54,814
<i>Everyone in this village.</i>

951
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:58,315
<i>This is getting interesting.</i>

952
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:49,270
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

953
01:02:49,965 --> 01:02:53,036
<i>Please be truthful about</i>
<i>what you saw that day.</i>

954
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:56,183
<i>Just get lost.</i>

955
01:02:56,184 --> 01:02:58,279
<i>Can I see the security camera footage?</i>

956
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:00,873
<i>The police took all of it away.</i>

957
01:03:02,134 --> 01:03:04,511
<i>I'll find the overpass culprit first.</i>

958
01:03:04,512 --> 01:03:06,511
<i>That's not who you have to find.</i>

959
01:03:06,511 --> 01:03:08,490
<i>It's your dead friends.</i>

960
01:03:08,491 --> 01:03:09,977
<i>Why did you do that</i>
<i>to my Bo-yeong?</i>

961
01:03:09,977 --> 01:03:11,927
<i>How can you be</i>
<i>so calm and collected?</i>

962
01:03:11,928 --> 01:03:14,984
<i>You have no right to blame anyone.</i>

963
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,398
<i>Where did you find that bone?</i>

964
01:03:19,701 --> 01:03:22,023
<i>Was it not you who did it?</i>

965
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:27,904
<i>I'll dig up whatever I can,</i>
<i>no matter what it takes.</i>
