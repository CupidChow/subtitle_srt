00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:05,005
<i>Traveling with Snow Man.</i>

2
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,345
It's moving.

3
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:17,951
I see someone waving.

4
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,462
Good morning.

5
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,931
Watanabe.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,368
Together again today.

7
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:38,705
What?

8
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,007
Are you okay? Tired?

9
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,675
I'm not tired.

10
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,545
We're in a tunnel now.

11
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:45,612
Cool.

12
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:49,983
Cool. This is exciting.

13
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,963
Awesome. This is cool.

14
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,601
Pretty.

15
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,971
It's beautiful.

16
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,841
Cool. We're going over a bridge.

17
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,649
- I've never done this before.
- This is refreshing.

18
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,052
This might be what I needed.

19
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,090
We should go over here.

20
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,225
It's on this side now.

21
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,297
- Thank you for riding.
- Thanks.

22
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:39,333
- We'd like to take a photo.
- All right.

23
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,368
- Thank you.
- Go ahead.

24
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,170
- Ready?
- Go ahead.

25
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:46,940
One more. Pose. Checking.

26
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,575
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

27
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,676
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

28
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,044
We'll bring it to you.

29
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,846
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,349
- They're waving.
- Yeah, they are.

31
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,790
- Nice.
- Yeah.

32
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,760
Excuse me.

33
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,528
Your photo is ready.

34
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,630
Thank you.

35
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,398
- Have a look.
- Thank you.

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,802
If you're happy with it...

37
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:16,970
Awesome.

38
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,706
It captured
the Hozu River boat too.

39
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,109
- You're right. Cool.
- It did. Awesome.

40
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,044
- Good photo.
- Good timing.

41
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,881
You can purchase it for 1,500 yen
only while you are in the train.

42
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,916
So, Watanabe...

43
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,085
Well... I'll pay, then.

44
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,822
- Yes, please. Thank you.
- Thank you.

45
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,125
- Nice.
- This is good.

46
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,426
TABI...

47
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,829
- TABI is out of service.
- True.

48
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,368
Looking at this photo closely
makes me feel like crying.

49
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,836
How come?

50
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,173
Does it resonate with you?

51
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,775
It's pretty emotional.

52
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,678
It'll make you cry. Watch out.

53
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,614
- Seeing ourselves back then?
Yeah.

54
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,949
<i>Thank you for riding</i>

55
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,384
<i>with Sagano Romantic Train.</i>

56
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,953
<i>We are arriving at our final stop.</i>

57
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,660
Doesn't the breeze
feel better here?

58
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,196
Yeah. Very nice.

59
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,298
- It's the smell.
- I get you.

60
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,200
- You know?
- The air feels light.

61
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,301
And this...

62
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,437
- The scent of the greenery.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,640
- It's nice.
- This feels really good.

64
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:31,211
Being with Shoppi made me
feel comfortable.

65
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,279
KAMEOKA STATION

66
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,649
So I think I was able to get into
a space for just us two.

67
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,085
Lately, I haven't really had

68
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,855
a chance to hang out one-on-one

69
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:45,192
with another member.

70
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,593
And the trolley

71
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:52,866
was a really lovely one,
the type you don't get to ride often.

72
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:56,470
And we got to start our trip
by soaking in the natural scenery.

73
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,272
So it was a lot of fun.

74
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,875
Awesome. Look.

75
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,977
- Suddenly the speed...
For real?

76
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,879
We're going here?

77
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,047


78
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,782
This is exciting.

79
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,051
- Awesome!
- Cool!

80
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,355
- Isn't it awesome he can control it?
- Cool.

81
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,292
This feels good.

82
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,894
The sounds are nice too.

83
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,263
- Yeah. The sound of water.
- The water sounds.

84
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,999
It's nice. It's soothing.

85
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,235
It really is soothing.

86
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,238
This isn't the kind of sound

87
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,974
- you can hear in Tokyo.
- Exactly.

88
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,778
I know maybe we shouldn't be
the ones to say this,

89
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,214
but we don't always have
enough time in the day, right?

90
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,482
It's a good thing for us.

91
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,984
But just for today,

92
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,788
let's not worry about time at all.

93
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:48,855
You're right.

94
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,558
- I want to just enjoy a leisurely time.
- Leisurely.

95
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,696
This is really cool.

96
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,065
Why doesn't it bump into rocks?

97
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,101
- I steer around them.
- Wow.

98
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,702
- That's amazing.
- So it's all...

99
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,472
- I'm steering from behind.
- I'm impressed.

100
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:08,275
- Thank you.
- Everyone's appropriate use of force...

101
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,843
Look, look!

102
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,745
It's a white heron.

103
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,114
- A white heron? Pretty.
- A white heron.

104
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,049
Look. What's that?

105
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,452
- What?
- That's a cormorant.

106
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,054
A cormorant.

107
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,789
- Black.
- I saw its face.

108
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,057
- Come up!
- It's swimming.

109
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,792
It's chasing a fish.

110
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,295
I saw it for a second.

111
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,599
We're entering the rapids.

112
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,236
- This feels good too.
- Amazing.

113
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,637
- All right.
- Awesome.

114
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,409
All right.

115
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,279
- Cool.
- This is the best.

116
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,381
Very nice.

117
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,618
Next up,

118
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:54,087
we'll pass by the Koayu Waterfall.

119
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,790
It has a drop of about 20 meters...

120
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,458
Sorry, two meters.

121
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,127
That was a huge lie.

122
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,496
I really believed it was 20 meters.

123
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,698
That's a lot.

124
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,366
- We'll believe anything.
- Right.

125
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,468
- Yes.
- Twenty meters is too much.

126
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,003
- Awesome.
- Is that it?

127
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,138
This is crazy.

128
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,574
- So exciting.
- Awesome.

129
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,109
This is awesome!

130
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,644
- Here we go.
- Awesome!

131
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,215
Here we go!

132
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,750
- Cool!
- Awesome!

133
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,855
- Amazing.
- So cool.

134
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,057
This is fun.

135
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,359
It is fun.

136
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,530
There are slow, relaxing places,
and there are thrilling places too.

137
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,698
I get you.

138
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:39,900
Both are fun.

139
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,869
- Boating down Hozu River...
- Yes.

140
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,938
Out of
all river cruises in Japan,

141
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,574
this has the longest history.

142
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,176
- It does?
- How many years?

143
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,878
Since Keicho 11.

144
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,546
- Keicho?
- Keicho.

145
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,116
- How long ago is that?
- Over 400 years ago.

146
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,184
It's 1606.

147
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,120
- So...
- Really?

148
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,221
Yes, really.

149
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,956
- You lied before.
- True.

150
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,724
I don't know what's real anymore.

151
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,160
- I think that'd be the Edo era.
- Edo?

152
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,196
- Since the Edo era.
- Yes.

153
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,132
Long rapids coming up.

154
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,469
Awesome. Here we go.

155
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,205
Wow!

156
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,341
Awesome.

157
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,543
Cool.

158
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,211
Awesome.

159
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:33,153
- Look at that majestic heron.
- A bridge?

160
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,220
It's flying.

161
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,756
I wish I could be a heron.

162
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,362
They said Meme.

163
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,631
No way!

164
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,001
- They said, "Is that Meme?"
- Wow.

165
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,705
Bye-bye.

166
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,606
Awesome.

167
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,944
Kyoto is totally the right choice.

168
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,680
Yeah. Why Kyoto, though?

169
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,082
Did you say something?

170
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,651
I was just curious about Kyoto.

171
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:08,054
I had the impression
time moves slower here.

172
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,490
So it was your idea, Shoppi.

173
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:11,758
Thanks.

174
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,437
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

175
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,906
It was a valuable experience.

176
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,076
- I'm glad.
- It was great.

177
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:37,584
<i>I would like</i>
<i>to see you two in kimonos.</i>

178
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,390
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

179
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,657
You look good.

180
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,192
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

181
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,862
Thank you for choosing kimonos for us.

182
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:49,929
Yes, of course.

183
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,632
What do you do here?

184
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,834
We specialize in Nishijin-ori.

185
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,169
HATTORI ORIMONO

186
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,838
Does this say it was founded in... Ten...

187
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,875
- Yes, Tenmei Eight.
- Tenmei Eight?

188
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,478
That's 1788 in the Western calendar.

189
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,715
- We mainly make obi.
- Obi.

190
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:12,285
So the obi you're wearing now
were made by us.

191
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,486
They are?

192
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,289
This is so pretty.

193
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,658
- We handweaved this.
- By hand?

194
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,126
- Yes, by hand.
- I see.

195
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:23,830
Handweaving is less common
in Nishijin these days.

196
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:24,898
- So it's by hand.
- Yes.

197
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,067
- They make these by hand.
- By hand.

198
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,202
If you take a look at the back,

199
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,539
you'll see how many different shades
of green are used.

200
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,040
That's so cool.

201
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,744
<i>Now it's time for us to watch</i>

202
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,346
<i>the creation process.</i>

203
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,581
Okay, go ahead.

204
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,349
Sorry. TABI is being unreasonable.

205
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,451
True. Sorry.

206
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,319
- Sorry.
- His request, so please.

207
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,189
Excuse me.

208
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,792
- Cool.
- This is the machine...

209
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,130
...for handweaving. The handloom.

210
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,265
Wow, it's so elaborate!

211
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,401
It's made of wood.

212
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,237
They don't make wooden looms anymore,

213
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:08,374
so we're still using an older one.

214
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,978
So this form itself is really valuable.

215
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,980
- Yes. It's very old.
- Yeah.

216
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,016
Hello.

217
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,452
Wow!

218
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,860
Interesting!

219
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,763
Like this.

220
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,931
Amazing.

221
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,268
- We use something called <i>hikibaku...</i>
- Yes.

222
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,769
...and tie it

223
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,172
with the weft.

224
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,774
- It goes in here?
- Yes.

225
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,177
This is amazing.

226
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:49,115
It's a long process,
so it takes a lot of patience.

227
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,620
So all
of these individual threads...

228
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,255
- Are layered together.
- Yes.

229
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,158
- To make this obi.
- Yes.

230
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:04,964
I forgot him.

231
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,234
TABI was there the whole time?

232
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,435
We forgot him.

233
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,306
- In the middle, between the obi.
<i>You forgot me.</i>

234
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,607
He's mad at us.

235
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,076
- "You forgot me."
- "You forgot me."

236
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,679
The obi is impressive, of course, but...

237
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:23,416
- Some people have done this for 50 years.
- Fifty years?

238
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:27,086
Being able to meet the weavers

239
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,254
might be the best part.

240
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:33,059
Those women gave me
so much energy and power.

241
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,361
- Made me straighten up.
- Yes. Thank you.

242
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,729
- No, thank you.
- Thank you.

243
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,767
- <i>Let's go get food.</i>
Okay.

244
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,037
<i>The perfect summer food in Kyoto</i>
<i>is pike conger.</i>

245
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,439
<i>- It's very good right now.</i>
Pike conger?

246
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,076
- Pike conger is good.
<i>How about a pike conger dish?</i>

247
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,011
- Pike conger.
Awesome.

248
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,781
- Thank you. Excuse us.
- Thank you.

249
00:11:55,949 --> 00:12:00,320
I've never gotten to enjoy
Kyoto like this.

250
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,589
I'd like some <i>warabimochi</i> too.

251
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,324
Yeah, some Japanese sweets.

252
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,959
And the classic.

253
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,994
- The Kyoto thing.
- You know...

254
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,730
A wooden... Wooden sword.

255
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,799
A wooden sword.

256
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,200
From field trips.

257
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,036
The classic field trip souvenir.

258
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,772
- Did you do that?
- I bought a wooden sword.

259
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,308
I remember people doing that.

260
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,645
What's up with that?

261
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:29,182
I got both a long one and a short one.

262
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,019
A wooden sword in Kyoto is nice for sure.

263
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,021
"Watanabe buys a wooden sword."

264
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,023
Nice. I'd like to do that.

265
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,292
- And swing it in this kimono.
- Good idea.

266
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,194
Do some swings every morning.

267
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,396
- Film myself doing that.
- Nice.

268
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,132
Where was your field trip?

269
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,867
- To Kyoto.
- Kyoto, I see.

270
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,069
- And Kinkaku-ji, Ginkaku-ji...
- You went?

271
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,571
- I did.
- You've been?

272
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,773
We had to choose among several places.

273
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,175
So I couldn't go to Kinkaku-ji.

274
00:12:56,242 --> 00:13:00,680
There were so many choices,
and you chose a wooden sword.

275
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,181
I decided even before leaving.

276
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,417
- To buy a sword?
- I'll get a sword.

277
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,687
It was a must.

278
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,622
That's really like you, Meme.

279
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,224
It was a must.

280
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,194
- Something is happening.
- We're here.

281
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:20,266
Wow, this is exciting.

282
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,169
Isn't this awesome?

283
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,372
It feels so traditional.

284
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,443
<i>This is Shimogamosaryo.</i>

285
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,012
<i>- It was founded in 1856.</i>
1856.

286
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,080
Awesome.

287
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,216
The driver said
it's a well-established place.

288
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,318
Let's go in.

289
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,585
SHIMOGAMOSARYO
KAISEKI

290
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,920
- Welcome.
- Wow.

291
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,322
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

292
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,891
- Thank you. Wow.
- It's so fancy.

293
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,993
The folding screens.

294
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,128
- Right this way.
- Excuse me.

295
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,363
Here you go.

296
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,199
Isn't this a really high-end place?

297
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,201
Excuse me. Welcome.

298
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,669
- Thank you.
- On this hot day.

299
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:57,737
The pleasure is ours.

300
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,672
It is indeed hot today.

301
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,375
- We've created for you...
- Yes.

302
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:06,279
...a menu centered around pike conger
to showcase Kyoto cuisine.

303
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:10,817
And there is also uncooked pike conger
waiting for you, so if you'd like...

304
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:11,984
- Can I see?
- Yes.

305
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,253
- I want to see that.
- Thank you.

306
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,621
Thank you.

307
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,459
- Wow. Huge.
- This is a pike conger.

308
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,261
Wow!

309
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,698
- I know they have many bones.
- They do.

310
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:30,002
Cutting pike conger bones
is where chefs can show off their skills.

311
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,604
- Is that so?
- Yes.

312
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:34,607
When cutting bones,
you must not cut the meat through.

313
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,342
- Right.
- Keep it connected.

314
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,643
- Or they'll break.
- Hard.

315
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,180
- That's a pro technique.
- So professional.

316
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,283
- Listen. That sound.
- Awesome.

317
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,553
- The bones being cut.
- Yeah.

318
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,988
Awesome.

319
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,694
How does he do it so fast?
That speed and rhythm.

320
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,866
- Awesome.
- Amazing.

321
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,367
Here.

322
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,669
That's art.

323
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,939
Would you like to try it?

324
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,708
I can? Awesome.

325
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,510
- I'm interested.
- Go for it, Meme.

326
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,414
Can I watch from above?
How thin do you slice it?

327
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,488
It's rare you get to watch
from this angle.

328
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,426
It's rare I get watched
from this angle too.

329
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,860
I imagine.

330
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,462
I'll try.

331
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,531
One millimeter at a time.

332
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,099
- Go for one millimeter.
- One.

333
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,467
Show me one, Meguro.

334
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,102
- Watch your hands.
- Okay.

335
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,804
- Go.
- A Meguro millimeter.

336
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,006
It's crackling.

337
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,708
Should I go further?

338
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,278
It went enough.

339
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,819
- Good sound.
- Yeah, I hear the bones.

340
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,388
You're not cutting the skin, right?

341
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,423
Is it okay? I hope so.

342
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,267
Should I go back to Tokyo
while you're cutting the bones?

343
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,203
This will never end.

344
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,004
You're gonna be cutting forever.

345
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,173
That looks good.

346
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,075
I pulled it just now.

347
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,911
It's not cut through. It's all connected.

348
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,582
- Amazing.
- Impressive for your first try.

349
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:28,454
Today, not only seeing craftsmen at work

350
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:33,025
but also seeing them
spending a long time making one thing,

351
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,527
seeing how careful they are,

352
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:39,232
made me realize there's human emotion
in that care they put in.

353
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,534
I don't want to let that go.

354
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,640
It made me want to take care in creating

355
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:52,111
every single piece of work

356
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:59,118
no matter how busy we get.

357
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,755
Shall we say cheers?

358
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,331
<i>May I ask a few questions?</i>

359
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,670
<i>How long have you two been friends?</i>

360
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:19,939


361
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,574
Since before joining Snow Man.

362
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,110
When we were in different groups.

363
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,513
- But we performed at the same events.
- Right.

364
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,651
- And when we stayed at a hotel...
- Yeah.

365
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,185
- We had separate rooms.
- Yeah.

366
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,520
- But he came over.
- Yeah.

367
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,088
Pretty often.

368
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,823
- I remember one image.
- Yeah.

369
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,726
Shoppi in bed in a bathrobe,

370
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:46,499
and the futon up to about here,

371
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,935
had this backrest.

372
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,103
The TV was in the center,
and Shoppi was watching.

373
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,372
And I...

374
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,975
- You know the table and chairs at the end?
- Yes.

375
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,643
I was sitting there.

376
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,447
That brings me back.

377
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:06,786
<i>Do you still go out to eat often?</i>

378
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,388
- A while ago.
- He used to come over...

379
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,623
- Yeah.
- ...to hang out.

380
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,794
We do it every so often,
but it's been a while.

381
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,696
- New Year's too.
- Yeah.

382
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,799
- Once our livestream was over...
- Right.

383
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,601
...I went to Meme's house.

384
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,202
- New Year's meal.
- Yeah.

385
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,805
- We got seafood delivered.
- Lots of seafood.

386
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,473
- On the first day.
- Yeah.

387
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,543
- Several years ago...
- Mount Fuji.

388
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,980
- Mount Fuji, yes.
- We went to Mount Fuji.

389
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,982
- We went on drives too.
- Yeah.

390
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,216
Excuse me.

391
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,751
- Thank you for waiting.
- Here!

392
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,553
- It's here.
- Yes.

393
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,755
- Here is your soup.
- I've been looking forward.

394
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:43,823
Thank you.

395
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,293
It has pike conger
and matsutake mushrooms.

396
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,496
So luxurious.

397
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,198
Let's eat.

398
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:00,539
I can't believe it.

399
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,609
That hits the spot.

400
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,111
This is tasty.

401
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,813
I'll start with the conger.

402
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,382
Here I go.

403
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:19,158
Try this. It's so fluffy.

404
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,831
This is great.

405
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,935
How is it so good?

406
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:35,574
- It's creamier than I expected.
- For sure.

407
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:39,178
It's fluffy and springy
with a little creaminess.

408
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,846
So good.

409
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,885
This'll be gone right away.

410
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,520
This is too delicious.

411
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,422
- Please get across.
- Yeah.

412
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,692
It's already gone.
This is the last pike conger.

413
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,326
I'll pamper myself today.

414
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,266
It's good.

415
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,705
- This is...
- Yes.

416
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:09,208
The piece
Mr. Meguro prepared earlier.

417
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,611
Let's taste.

418
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:20,786
It's good.

419
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,256
Yum.

420
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,495
It's gonna be gone right away again.

421
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,599
This is <i>hari-hari nabe</i> made with
pike conger and matsutake mushrooms.

422
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,934
HARI-HARI NABE

423
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,669
That looks good.

424
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,170
It already tastes good.

425
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,639
The scent is amazing.

426
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,275
- I'll portion it out for you.
Thank you.

427
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,010
Thank you for waiting.

428
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:49,348
- How is it?
- This is shocking.

429
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,352
- Lastly, this is the hot pot.
- This is it.

430
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,154
With pike conger and mushrooms.

431
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,625
You started with the broth.
I'll go for the conger.

432
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,160
Yum.

433
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:06,132
The variety of ingredients
makes it savory.

434
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,334
Good soup.

435
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,403
And tofu skin for a Kyoto flavor.

436
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,706
Totally different taste.

437
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,007
And Kyoto scallions.

438
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,375
What bliss.

439
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,245
This is amazing.

440
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,047
- Can I go for it?
- Yeah. Do this.

441
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,349
I'm going for it.

442
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,184
Let's go.

443
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,466
Finally, here is the rice dish.

444
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,567
Awesome.

445
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,002
- We get rice too?
- Yes.

446
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,339
We've prepared it with corn, edamame,

447
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,941
- and beltfish.
- Beltfish.

448
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:51,877
So pretty.

449
00:21:58,851 --> 00:21:59,919
Yeah.

450
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,153
- Isn't it mellow?
- Mmm.

451
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,194
Isn't this great?

452
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,497
- I won't be able to forget this in Tokyo.
- Yeah.

453
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,468
<i>Are your stomachs full?</i>

454
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,839
Almost.

455
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,710
You want us to go somewhere else,
don't you, TABI?

456
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,946
We have more to eat, TABI.

457
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:34,386
<i>Let's go on a walk</i>
<i>when you're done eating.</i>

458
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,689
- Yeah.
Let's.

459
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,059
- Let's go.
Let's go.

460
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,861
- Thank you.
Can we leave TABI?

461
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,464
- <i>Please take me with you.</i>

462
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,337
- Well...
- I'm full now.

463
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,705
Shall we walk?

464
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,806
Wanna take a walk?

465
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,307
This is the best!

466
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,112
- That was so good.
- It was great.

467
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,818
- Nice.
- Awesome.

468
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:06,886
A river.

469
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:09,955
- Look.
- What?

470
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,324
- In front of you.
- The big "dai"?

471
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,261
- You can see the "dai" there.
- You're right.

472
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:19,031
- Right there.
- Amazing.

473
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,901
This is so nice.

474
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,837
Places like this are nice.

475
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,538
- Walking by the river.
- Awesome.

476
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:28,741
- So peaceful.
- Yeah.

477
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:31,911
Wonderful.

478
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,081
- This feels good.
- It really does.

479
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,383
Let him pass.

480
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,584
A boy.

481
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:41,787
Hello.

482
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,890
Cute.

483
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,725
- This is great.
- Nice.

484
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,596
We don't often walk like this.

485
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,900
It's really nice.

486
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,572
I wish I could walk
this path every day.

487
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,676
Yeah. It would feel so nice
to walk here every day.

488
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,112
This feels so out of the ordinary.

489
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,882
Is something there?

490
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,117
I hear splashing.

491
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,219
There are dragonflies.

492
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,889
Wanna go further?

493
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,557
Let's keep going.

494
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,528
There's a bench there.

495
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,230
Let's sit down.

496
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,632
It's made of stone.

497
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,534
Let's get some sun.

498
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,440
This is the best.

499
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,075
This is great.

500
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,344
I can't believe it.

501
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:47,252
We never have time like this. For real.

502
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,725
Hello.

503
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,326
- Hello.
- Hello.

504
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,563
Naturally.

505
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:01,834
- Us two without a camera nearby.
- Right.

506
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,203
She was hesitant.

507
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,005
It looks like
we're just hanging out.

508
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:16,548
It's hard to find words,
for better or for worse.

509
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,752
If you can't find words,
you don't have to.

510
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:24,390
But the comfort of this place...

511
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,862
- We don't have time like this often.
- Exactly.

512
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:36,268
We should enjoy times like this
when we have the chance.

513
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:37,770
For sure.

514
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,340
The atmosphere is so nice.

515
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:45,844
It really is.

516
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,217
And the sun

517
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:56,021
- is gradually setting.
- Setting.

518
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:01,460
- Thank you for waiting.
- Thank you. What is this?

519
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:06,198
These are iced coffee
and our special matcha terrines.

520
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,433
- Terrines?
- Yes.

521
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,102
A mixture of matcha and white chocolate.

522
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:12,104
- Thank you.
- Yes, of course.

523
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,539
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

524
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,050
It has gold leaf.

525
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,118
You're right.

526
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:28,821
Terrines.

527
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,293
Yeah.

528
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:39,398
- Yum.
- The matcha is so rich.

529
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,534
Too luxurious.

530
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,537
Do we really deserve this?

531
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:49,641
Apparently, Koji was having
a back-and-forth with TABI.

532
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,310
I bet.

533
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:56,081
Knowing Koji, he can't sit still for long.

534
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,485
He's a comedian.

535
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,553
You know...

536
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,490
This is really nice.

537
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,728
My wish for Snow Man

538
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:14,066
is that each one of us can lead

539
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:19,037
an enjoyable life of his own.

540
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:20,772
Also,

541
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:24,243
however our relationships may change,

542
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:29,681
whatever paths we go down,
however old we get,

543
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:37,156
wherever we may be,
I want us to have a good relationship

544
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:43,128
and to enjoy each of our individual lives.

545
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,598
That's what I want for Snow Man.

546
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:53,172
<i>Now let's go see</i>
<i>the best evening view in Kyoto.</i>

547
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,577
- Let's go.
- Amazing.

548
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,381
Coming through.

549
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:04,950
- Awesome.
- That's awesome.

550
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,387
So cool.

551
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:10,989
So pure!

552
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,225
- Pure.
- Pure!

553
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,459
Pure?

554
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,527
Awesome.

555
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,462
Excuse us.

556
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,964
- Coming through.
- Hello.

557
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,934
Thank you for visiting
on a hot day such as this.

558
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,035
The pleasure is ours.

559
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,870
I am Mori of Kiyomizu-dera Temple.

560
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:27,506
- I'm Ren Meguro from Snow Man.
- I'm Watanabe.

561
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:28,974
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

562
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,042
Thank you.

563
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,077
- Now, allow me to lead you in.
- Thanks.

564
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,178
Go ahead.

565
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,747
- This is a rare opportunity.
- Cool.

566
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,650
I haven't been here since the field trip.

567
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,751
- Me neither.
- Really?

568
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,420
- So...
- Oh my.

569
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,189
- Over 15 years.
- Is that so?

570
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:47,192
Maybe we were still
under construction then?

571
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,194
- Perhaps.
- Was it?

572
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,797
- It was under construction.
- Yes, right.

573
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,865
I'd like to show you first

574
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,667
- to the west gate.
- Okay.

575
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,469
- Thank you.
- Yes.

576
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,137
- This way.
- Thank you.

577
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,206
Wait, this is awesome.

578
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,941
- Yeah.
- Cool.

579
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:07,279
The sun
is just about to set right now.

580
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:08,447
Go on in.

581
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,282
- This is amazing.
- So impressive.

582
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,683
- Yes.
- Can we go in?

583
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,818
Yes, go ahead.

584
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,420
- May I? Thank you. Excuse me.
- Thank you.

585
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:16,521
Yes.

586
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,624
- Cool!
- Wow.

587
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,693
It's going down.

588
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,929
This is called the west gate.

589
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,797
- It's facing west.
- Yes.

590
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,433
This view you're seeing here...

591
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,937
In Buddhism, it's said that
Amitabha's Pure Land lies to the west

592
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:34,573
beyond the setting sun.

593
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,441
- It's starting to set now.
- Oh no.

594
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:37,809
- Don't.
- It's going away!

595
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,845
- Wow!
- Yes.

596
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:44,016
It's just about to disappear.

597
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,351
At the moment it goes below the horizon,

598
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,920
the edge of the mountain turns red.

599
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:49,988
- Okay.
- Yes.

600
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:54,192
It makes it appear
as if there's a red glowing world

601
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,794
- beyond the mountain.
- It does.

602
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:59,197
So it's said
that's where the Pure Land is,

603
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,134
where people go after they die.

604
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,437
So people came to this gate to pray.

605
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,575
Really, this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to witness

606
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,445
a scene like this.

607
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:18,016
And the beautiful Kyoto skyline
is right in front of it.

608
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,885
This is amazing.

609
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,554
Thank you for showing us.

610
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,556
- Of course.
- It's wonderful.

611
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:26,124
- So valuable.
- Of course.

612
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:31,129
You're rewarded for your daily effort
with the timing to see this sunset.

613
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:35,033
It's like nature is celebrating
Snow Man's fifth anniversary.

614
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,401
You're right.

615
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:38,970
- Wow, this is...
- I'm glad we came to Kyoto.

616
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,038
Me too.

617
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:48,513
This reminds me how many places
I have yet to see in the world.

618
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:52,050
I want to lead a life
that allows me to see many things.

619
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:53,385
For sure.

620
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,391
- Amazing.
- Yeah.

621
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,928
It's beautiful.

622
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,130
IMPORTANT CULTURAL PROPERTY
TODOROKI-MON

623
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,765
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

624
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,266
- Yes.
- Wow.

625
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,872
- It's summer.
- Amazing.

626
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:15,540
It's summer for sure.

627
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:16,842
Nice sound.

628
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:19,344
You can proceed to the main hall.

629
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:20,479
WIND CHIME CELEBRATION

630
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:23,849
Amazing!

631
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,352
I keep reading the tags.

632
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:28,820
- Me too.
- I understand.

633
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,925
Amazing.

634
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:40,832
So impressive.

635
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,936
Right this way.

636
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:48,173
Kannon is in the back here.

637
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,142
The principal image.

638
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,211
Okay... Hands.

639
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,487
The Stage of Kiyomizu.

640
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:03,555
Yes.

641
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:08,326
I hear that phrase a lot.

642
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:11,763
- Leaping off the stage of Kiyomizu.
- Taking the plunge.

643
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,100
It's because of the height
of this here.

644
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:23,108
This is my first time
seeing this view as a grown-up.

645
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,510
It's about 13 meters high.

646
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:28,447
I saw this from over there
when I came on the field trip.

647
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,916
It was under construction,
there was scaffolding...

648
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:34,686
I see.
The roof here and the stage boards...

649
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:36,655
The stage is made of hinoki cypress.

650
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,790
It's completely hinoki.

651
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:41,693
There's a saying
"standing on a hinoki stage."

652
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,362
Some say it may have originated
from this very stage.

653
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,131
- That's amazing.
- Wow.

654
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,366
- This has been valuable.
- Yes.

655
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,101
- Any time.
- Thank you.

656
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,270
- Thank you.
- Welcome. Thank you.

657
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,707
That golden hour was awesome.

658
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:57,609
The sunset was so cool.

659
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:00,912
Wow.

660
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,750
It'll be amazing here too.

661
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,487
The scenery.

662
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:12,157
- Yeah, this image right here.
- This is exactly it!

663
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:16,862
- Beautiful!
- We were there.

664
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,464
Amazing.

665
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:25,437
What did you think
of our trip to Kyoto, Shoppi?

666
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,538
Well...

667
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,141
I felt like...

668
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,579
I spoke fewer words than usual.

669
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:38,583
- But...
- Simple. Yes.

670
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:43,188
- That's because I was enjoying it.
- Yes.

671
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:47,559
- This is just something I imagine.
- Okay.

672
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,996
- When it's just us two in Tokyo...
- Yeah.

673
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:55,300
- ...we talk about work a lot.
- Yeah. True.

674
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,168
So I thought maybe

675
00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:00,539
- we'd end up talking work here too.
- Yeah.

676
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:04,876
- But we didn't. Not even once.
- Right.

677
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,845
But I felt it rather genuine.

678
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:10,949
I was actually glad
that work didn't come up at all.

679
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:12,017
Right.

680
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:19,291
That being said, it wasn't
uncomfortable or anything.

681
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,358
I get it.

682
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:26,565
- It was just us enjoying a trip as is.
- Right. Yeah.

683
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,634
- Not getting worked up.
- Totally. I get you.

684
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:35,106
- I felt like we could just be ourselves.
- Yeah.

685
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:41,246
So work may not have come up,
but with this Kyoto scenery,

686
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:45,350
it was like "there's so much
we haven't seen,"

687
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,186
or "we could show this to our fans."

688
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,421
- Yeah.
- It's like...

689
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:54,059
we learned through scenery,
not conversation.

690
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,126
Yeah.

691
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:57,062
- That's my feeling.
- Yeah.

692
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,365
- It was a good trip.
- It really was a good trip.

693
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:06,204
I haven't had many trips
this satisfying and rich.

694
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,740
It's been really nice.

695
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:15,480
Although we have forgotten
about TABI sometimes.

696
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,315
We forgot TABI a lot today.

697
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:19,050
Sorry, TABI.

698
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:23,121
Sorry, TABI.
We left you behind a few times today.

699
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,957
- <i>It's okay.</i>

700
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:28,827
<i>Let's travel together again.</i>

701
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,197
- Let's.
- Yeah, let's travel again.

702
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,065
- The three of us.
- For sure.

703
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:35,934
Us three.

704
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,692
Traveling with Snow Man!

705
