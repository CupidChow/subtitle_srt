1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:04,671
Cute... So cute.

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,673
Nice weather too. Feels good.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,642
Pretty.

4
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:13,914
<i>We've finally made it
to Hokkaido from Okinawa.</i>

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:17,784
- We're here. Finally.
- Finally here.

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,253
We're in Hokkaido.

7
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,356
Oh, TABI... Many horses!

8
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,490
Gorgeous.

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,926
Northern Farm is the best.

10
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,795
- This place is great!
- Awesome!

11
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,163
It's Deep Impact.

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,466
- Look at the horses.
- No rock-paper-scissors.

13
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,767
- Awesome.
- What is this?

14
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,235
- What's this?
- A monument.

15
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:38,739
Maybe it's to commemorate
Deep Impact's accomplishments.

16
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,607
It's kind of like <i>Stand By Me.</i>

17
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,210
- Four people.
- Yeah.

18
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:44,878
- Four of us, like this.
- Four.

19
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:48,482
I wanted to come to Northern Farm
at least once in my life.

20
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,616
Hey!

21
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,218
Exactly. It's that great.

22
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,854
- Let's go!
- The horses.

23
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,188
- Not horses.
- Wrong.

24
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,190
- Stop galloping.
- Gallop, gallop.

25
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,259
Shota and Raul
at the same time...

26
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:00,861
They were dashing.

27
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,431
And not like horses.
Like the ones riding them.

28
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,199
- All here?
- Gathered.

29
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,268
- All together.
- Together at last.

30
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,770
- It's vast.
- Amazing.

31
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,438
- Isn't it cool?
- Hokkaido.

32
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,674
- TABI!
- <i>We're finally in Hokkaido.</i>

33
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,409
You know, TABI...

34
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:16,743
- It's Hokkaido.
- Hokkaido!

35
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,078
- There's enmity.
- Right.

36
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,446
- There is?
- TABI and Mukai.

37
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:20,914
- Right...
- Me and TABI...

38
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,749
You two had a fight, right?

39
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,519
- <i>Let's enjoy our last trip.</i>
- Over already?

40
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,054
- Right.
- Hokkaido.

41
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,555
It's like it was yesterday.

42
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,024
- What was?
- Okinawa.

43
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,092
Not quite.

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,094
- Not yesterday.
- That's exaggerated.

45
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,631
- I was drenched in sweat back then.
- Right.

46
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,300
- The season has changed.
- <i>How nostalgic.</i>

47
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,269
We're talking right now.

48
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:43,370
- Stop it.
- Koji.

49
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,638
- Don't interrupt.
- Stop.

50
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,940
- Be nice, Koji. It's the last trip.
- Yeah.

51
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,442
Sorry, NABI.

52
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,677
- Not NABI.
- TABI.

53
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:51,912
- <i>I am TABI.</i>
- Okay.

54
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,214
- What now?
- What will we do?

55
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,784
<i>I think we should head to
a hot spring inn near Lake Poroto.</i>

56
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,052
Hot springs?

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,654
- Sounds good!
- Great.

58
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,322
- Is it far, TABI?
- How far?

59
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:06,193
<i>Approximately 30 minutes from here.</i>

60
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,894
- I see.
- That's pretty close.

61
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:12,499
<i>Since we're at Northern Horse Park,
let's enjoy it a little more.</i>

62
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,934
Of course.

63
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,068
Okay. Let's go.

64
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,770
It's cool to see them up close.

65
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,172
- Look at those muscles.
- So powerful.

66
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,307
Awesome.

67
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,608
- I'm pumped.
- Yeah.

68
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,844
This is awesome.

69
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,180
Cool.

70
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,448
Yes!

71
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,617
This is getting me pumped.

72
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,119
So cute.

73
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,787
- That one's little.
- Tiny.

74
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,322
- The tiny one's cute.
- So tiny.

75
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,024
Over there too.

76
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,259
- So tiny.
- It's walking.

77
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,061
- Can we go up?
- I think so.

78
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,162
- Can we go?
- We can.

79
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,031
- Hey, this feels nice.
- Cool.

80
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,600
Look. That horse is so cute.

81
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,335
Nice.

82
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,437
True. We can't do this very often.

83
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,805
Feels good!

84
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,407
This is the best.

85
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,643
Ah...

86
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,813
It's great.
Never thought I'd be here.

87
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,982
- For real.
- The last episode came fast.

88
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,817
This is once in a lifetime.

89
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:05,185
- It is.
- It's sad.

90
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,822
- Impossible in Tokyo.
- It's impossible.

91
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,991
- Picture together?
- Sounds nice.

92
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,726
Okay. Three, two, one.

93
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,629
- Okay.
- Thanks!

94
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,497
I'm happy about this.

95
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,700
They're catching up.
They're closing in.

96
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,101
- Pass!
- Pass him!

97
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,070
- Pass, pass, pass!
- He passed!

98
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,772
- Oh no! He took the lead!
- Passed ahead.

99
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,974
- Pass, pass!
- You're too hyper.

100
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,643
There's a gap of two lengths.

101
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,746
- Pass him.
- You can do it! Dang it!

102
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,981
Why that way?

103
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,817
- Hey, Abe.
- Dang it.

104
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,585
- If you missed...
- Pass! Pass!

105
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,154
Pass, pass! Pass! Pass!

106
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,594
- He did it.
- It's scary when Abe does it.

107
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,763
- Scary wins.
- Abe's scary.

108
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,031
- Abe.
- Scary.

109
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,999
Don't call me scary.

110
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,969
Wait. Horses are so up close.

111
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,071
- Cool.
- It's eating so much.

112
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,041
We can get up close.

113
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,409
Isn't this cool?

114
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,078
- Cute.
- Hello.

115
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,714
- Cute.
- Hello.

116
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,850
Going up high like this...

117
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,785
Awesome. It feels so Hokkaido.

118
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,520
Reminds me of Okinawa.

119
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,989
When we did the barbecue in Okinawa.

120
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,224
I remember.

121
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,093
Awesome.

122
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,328
This place is nice.

123
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,596
So vast.

124
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,164
- This is cool.
- Nice.

125
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,899
- So vast.
- Cool.

126
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,535
- This feels nice.
- Makes me want to just stare.

127
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,036
Wow!

128
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,007
The white horse is cute.

129
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,075
I see it.

130
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,144
I was surprised.

131
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,747
Where to next, TABI?

132
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,549
TABI?

133
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,618
<i>Let's go to our destination.</i>

134
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,987
- The one you said before?
- Let's go.

135
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,089
Let's go.

136
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:52,259
Coming to Hokkaido is healing in itself.

137
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,427
- Yeah.
- The sky is so wide.

138
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,363
And the air is so pleasant.

139
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,665
- It feels good.
- Huge difference.

140
00:04:58,732 --> 00:04:59,933
Cows!

141
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,202
- You're right.
- Wow, wow.

142
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,037
Holy cow, am I right?

143
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,139
Good one, man.

144
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,908
- Man.
- Man.

145
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,510
Look at this straight road.

146
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,078
- Nice.
- It's amazing.

147
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,816
- Amazing.
- Surrounded by green all around.

148
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:16,883
Thank you.

149
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,518
- There's sheep.
- Wow.

150
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:19,653
Lots of sheep.

151
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,021
- Cute.
- They're cute.

152
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,190
- Baa.
- Baa.

153
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,393
Low-quality sheep.

154
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,994
Baa.

155
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:32,132
Can we compare images of Hokkaido?
Can I share?

156
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,567
Sure. Go ahead.

157
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,636
When I think of Hokkaido cuisine...

158
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,138
I think of seafood first.

159
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,073
- Right. That kinda thing.
- Like crab.

160
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,441
Seafood versus what?

161
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,109
Maybe miso butter ramen?

162
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,511
I see.

163
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,379
- I don't know. Which?
- That's it.

164
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,515
- Let's ask which one.
- Yeah.

165
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,150
What do you think?

166
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,785
Seafood or ramen.

167
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:56,923
We started in Okinawa.

168
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,658
- Who was first?
- Okinawa was everyone.

169
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,461
Then episode two was me. Me and Teru-nii.

170
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,630
That hotel called NOT A HOTEL was good.

171
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,498
- Wow.
- But you've said that many times.

172
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,867
So much. I loved it.

173
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,435
- All the time.
- Yeah.

174
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,570
There was a sauna in the room.

175
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:11,671
That's nice.

176
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,974
Teru-nii and I had a lot to drink.

177
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,775
We drank beer and sake.

178
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,812
The sake was so good,
I bought some online.

179
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:19,913
Wow.

180
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,715
- Koji seemed to be having fun.
- Yes.

181
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:25,252
I saw someone wrote
"Looks like Koji's having fun" on X.

182
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,486
- No way.
- You did?

183
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,054
I found everyone's.

184
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,257
- The Fukuoka episode?
- Yeah.

185
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,093
My friend said to me too,
"Koji seemed to be having fun."

186
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,794
- That's nice.
- On X.

187
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:38,064
I went to Kochi with Sakuma
and to Takasaki with Date.

188
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,634
In Kochi, I had straw-grilled bonito.

189
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,269
Oh.

190
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,837
- It sounds great.
- Yeah.

191
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,073
- It was ultimate deliciousness.
- Wow.

192
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,976
- We put the bonito on a net...
- I want to eat it.

193
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:53,146
- ...and filled the pit with straw.
- Yeah.

194
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,181
We grilled them and charred them.

195
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,417
It was so good.

196
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,653
- Sounds good.
- It was really good with salt.

197
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,289
In Tottori, I had mackerel shabu-shabu.

198
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,924
Wow. That sounds good.

199
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,191
It was really good.

200
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,061
Mackerel shabu-shabu in Tottori.

201
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,296
Sounds good.

202
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,064
- Was it good?
- It was good.

203
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,166
- That's nice.
- It made me think differently.

204
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,468
- Nice.
- That sounds too good.

205
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,603
Sounds too good?

206
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,673
Kyoto was really nice.

207
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,574
We rented out Kiyomizu-dera Temple.

208
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,676
Huh?

209
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,312
- Nobody but us was there.
- In the morning?

210
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,380
Evening. So we saw the golden hour.

211
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,349
- That place? The wide place?
- Pretty.

212
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,117
Meme, you went to Kyoto, right?

213
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,386
Pike conger? Pike conger.

214
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,854
- Kyoto's best.
- That's good.

215
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,222
That's the best.

216
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,392
- The hot pot was really good.
- Nice.

217
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,660
What about you, Raul?

218
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,829
- In Sendai...
- Yeah.

219
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,899
- ...I had luxury shaved ice.
- What's that?

220
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,436
- One serving was 4,000 yen.
- That's a lot!

221
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,938
How much longer, TABI?

222
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,375
- TABI, how much longer...
- <i>Thirty-eight more minutes.</i>

223
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,509
Huh?

224
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,679
Thirty-eight... Thirty-eight minutes?

225
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,747
Mister?

226
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,882
That's not what you've told us.

227
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,218
- It should be about 20.
- Thirty-six minutes.

228
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,786
- More?
- He lied.

229
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,655
- Pretty far.
- TABI, you lied.

230
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,223
Liar!

231
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,926
That's mean.

232
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,395

234
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,466
Here we go.

235
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:23,670
"The city of Yubari
has a character called Melon Dog."

236
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:24,904
True or false?

237
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,273
- Melon Dog?
- Melon Dog.

238
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,908
No such thing. False.

239
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,177
True.

240
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,512
The answer is...

241
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,913
- False.
- Thank you.

242
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,448
It's actually Melon Bear.

243
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,417
- There's a Melon Bear?
- There is.

244
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:38,785
I'm hungry.

245
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:39,953

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,654

00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:49,736
I'll turn you off.

356
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,337
Jealous of the Daruma.

357
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,007
- <i>Isn't it about time for food?</i>
- Right.

358
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,643
- I am hungry.
- I'm really hungry.

359
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:01,447
<i>Let's enjoy a special course
of Hokkaido foods.</i>

360
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,515
- A course.
- Cool.

361
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,083
- Great. Let's go!
- Let's go!

362
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,752
- We can leave these?
- No.

363
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,354
Take them with you. Don't leave them.

364
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,124
- <i>Nice.</i>
- <i>What's this? A sauna?</i>

365
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,193
- <i>These seats are ready for you.</i>
- <i>Really? Thank you.</i>

366
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,962
Thank you.

367
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,630
- Just us?
- All of you.

368
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,065
It's all written down.

369
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,134
Hokkaido seafood...

370
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,236
Hokkaido Daigo Nabe Kaiseki.

371
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,605
- Daigo... nabe kaiseki.
- Which seat?

372
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,109
Cheers to the last episode
of <i>Traveling with Snow Man!</i>

373
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,178
Cheers!

374
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,180
- What'd you say?
- What was that?

375
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,582
Cheers to the last episode.

376
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,284
Cheers.

377
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,485
Dun-dun, cheers.

378
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:43,523
If you wrote that down,
would that be all in symbols?

379
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:44,891
- Tasty. Yum.
- Yum!

380
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,959
- Good cheers.
- Isn't this good?

381
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,462
- Hokkaido flower soda is good.
- Nice.

382
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,197
- Flower soda?
- It's good.

383
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,965
- Floral.
- Tastes like flowers.

384
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,934
- It reminds me of middle school.
- Tasty.

385
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,570
- The flowers growing by the road.
- The pink ones.

386
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,172
- Picked and sucked on them.
- Yeah.

387
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,239
Same taste.

388
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,308
I did that so much, I was late to school.

389
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,111
- Too slow?
- Took too long.

390
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,279
- Too many.
- Kept picking.

391
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,714
There were so many.

392
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,382
The teacher would forgive you.

393
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,318
"I was late because
I was sucking on flowers."

394
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,853
Aren't you excited for food?

395
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,221
I am. It'll be great.

396
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,289
It's seafood.

397
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,623
This will be great.

398
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,758
A full course.

399
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:22,395
The food is ready.
Please allow us to set it out.

400
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:23,730
Cute.

401
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,264
- It's a bear.
- TABI?

402
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,366
Not TABI.

403
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,000
- TABI evolved?
- Not TABI.

404
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,335
Can we take this?

405
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,636
- This is...
- Okay.

406
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,205
- Sorry.
- Too big to take.

407
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,272
Special for today?

408
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,340
We can eat it.

409
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,075
- We can?
- It's not chocolate.

410
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,311
- It's a potato seafood dish.
- Potato seafood?

411
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,546
- A smooth potato paste...
- Hokkaido potatoes.

412
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,348
- With salmon roe.
- Squid?

413
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,616
- Salmon roe.
- Squid?

414
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,051
Listen closely!

415
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,154
Guys like this
can't eat this kind of food.

416
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,224
Shut up.

417
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,960
Your talk isn't classy enough.

418
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,195
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

419
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,231
- Fancy.
- Yum.

420
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,465
Good. Yum.

421
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,234
Very good.

422
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,835
Yum.

423
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,504
- Tasty.
- Hard to pick them up.

424
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,006
The salmon roe is so plump.

425
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,074
Strong flavor.

426
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,809
- It bursts.
- It does.

427
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,779
It isn't really meant to be eaten
with this kind of tone.

428
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,114
Should we try being refined for a second?

429
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,351
How delicious.

430
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,921
- Utterly lovely.
- That's Kyoto speak.

431
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,558
- Your next dish is <i>dobin mushi.</i>
- <i>Dobin mushi.</i>

432
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,726
I love <i>dobin mushi.</i>

433
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,695
I have more chances
to eat it as a grown-up.

434
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,666
Please use the sake cup
and enjoy it while it's warm.

435
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,868
It looks so good.

436
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,970
That's all. Looks good.

437
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,238
- Let's try it.
- Cheers.

438
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,473
Cheers.

439
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,841
This is great.

440
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,643
- This is so good.
- Wow!

441
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,144
Wow!

442
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,212
I wanna bathe in it.

443
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,014
- Mushroom.
- Soak in it?

444
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,749
Wanna open it?

445
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,384
- Inside...
- There it is.

446
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,985
It's there.

447
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,221
- Nice.
- A mound of mushrooms.

448
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,956
- Wow!
- Let's eat.

449
00:15:57,023 --> 00:16:00,092
- It's really good.
- This is so good. What is it?

450
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,761
Tasty.

451
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,130
- The tilefish is so good.
- Yum!

452
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,532
It's good. It's really good.

453
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:11,471
Excuse me.
Your next dish is ready.

454
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,273
- Cool.
- This looks good.

455
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,708
This is awesome.

456
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,044
Great sashimi.

457
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,180
- You have gourmet taste.
- Fall salmon.

458
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,250
Excellent. So seasonal.

459
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,785
The duck is good.

460
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,054
- Taste of autumn.
- Really good.

461
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,156
- It's too good.
- The shellfish is good.

462
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,091
- Yum.
- This is good.

463
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,327
- Really good.
- Seriously.

464
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:38,931
- Wow. This is real dining.
- Dining.

465
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,066
Excuse me.

466
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,634
The sashimi platter is so good.

467
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,169
I'm not going to talk.

468
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:44,770
- A reward.
- Yum.

469
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,972
Awesome.

470
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,408
Excuse me. Here is the fried dish.

471
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,910
- I'll set it here.
- Octopus.

472
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,547
My second favorite vegetable is here.

473
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:55,648
- Lotus root?
- Yes.

474
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,750
- What's your favorite?
- Onion.

475
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,218
Ooh.

476
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,187
- I never knew.
- I get it.

477
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,955
It's really good.

478
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,125
- Uncommon.
- Spear squid.

479
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,728
- The spear squid looks good.
- I'm going for it.

480
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:09,996
Good squid.

481
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,799
Isn't it so peaceful?

482
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,302
So nice.

483
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:21,607
- This is happiness.
- Yeah.

484
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,044
- Now hot pot?
- Hot pot.

485
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:29,015
- It's kind of...
- My stomach is at a 15 out of 10 now.

486
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,585
- Over 100%.
- That's no good.

487
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:33,786
It won't fit.

488
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,488
Thank you for waiting.

489
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,190
- Wow!
- For real?

490
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,425
HOKKAIDO DAIGO NABE

491
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:42,328
A daigo nabe with shrimp, crab,
and scallop. Pardon me.

492
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,496
Amazing.

493
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,797
What's the broth?

494
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:48,801
The broth has
two types of miso and seafood broth.

495
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,370
- Miso?
- Yes.

496
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,806
What's this?

497
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,575
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

498
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,810
Yum!

499
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,479
- This is good.
- Taste of the sea.

500
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,749
I'm drinking the sea.

501
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,485
How much broth
do you have to extract

502
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:07,954
- to get to this point?
- Great.

503
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,656
It's good.

504
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,792
Where are you at out of 10 now, Fukka?

505
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,427
Twenty-eight.

506
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,795
Don't exceed Shota.

507
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,065
How about after eating that, Shota?

508
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,869
This is so good with the broth,
I'm actually at a nine.

509
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:26,939
It went backwards.

510
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,442
How'd you calculate?

511
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,677
Just right
A 10 after the rice porridge.

512
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,779
Just right.

513
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,147
I'll make rice porridge.

514
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,216
- Over here this time?
- Wow.

515
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,485
Wow!

516
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,520
This is cheese.

517
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,622
Yes.

518
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,824
Is the cheese from Hokkaido too?

519
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,692
Tokachi parmesan
is what we use here.

520
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,963
Tokachi parmesan?

521
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,465
You just want to say it.

522
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,533
That's how...

523
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,069
- For real?
- Tasty.

524
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,805
You ate it already?
That was fast.

525
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,073
The taste leaped at me.

526
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,642
Yum!

527
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,012
- Awesome.
- Big swallow.

528
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,018
- Wow!
- This is awesome.

529
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,419
Luxurious.

530
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,421
- It's like...
- This is awesome.

531
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,090
...if I got this
after having some drinks...

532
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,592
This is number one.

533
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,193
- Number one?
- Number one.

534
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,196
Seriously good.

535
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,669
- This is northern blancmange.
- Northern blancmange?

536
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,938
A pudding-like dessert
made with milk and cream.

537
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,040
Wow!

538
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:38,678
Paired with lavender
and <i>haskap</i> sauce.

539
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,212
- <i>Haskap?</i>
- From Hokkaido?

540
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,315
Yes, the <i>haskap</i>
is grown in Tomakomai.

541
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,051
- It's really good.
- Tasty.

542
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,485
- It's good.
- Good.

543
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,020
- Time to try it.
- This is good.

544
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,289
It goes well with iced coffee.

545
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,658
- It's really sweet.
- Yeah, sweet.

546
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,995
<i>Are your stomachs full now?</i>

547
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,297
- Sorry, still eating.
- Eating.

548
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,665
- Hold on.
- Sorry, sorry.

549
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,766
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

550
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,202
<i>Sounds like you're full now.</i>

551
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,537
Still eating!

552
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,539
- He went on!
- He's trying to move on.

553
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,207
Bossy TABI, bossy TABI.

554
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:14,180
<i>Would you like to split into
two groups to enjoy the hotel after this?</i>

555
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,783
<i>One group
can go to the hot springs,</i>

556
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,788
<i>and one team can enjoy
the local activities.</i>

557
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,291
- Sounds good.
- Nice.

558
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,759
<i>Hot springs team.</i>

559
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:27,860
- Okay.
- Hot springs?

560
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,295
- Hot springs.
- I wanna go.

561
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,629
<i>Sakuma...</i>

562
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:31,897
Oh.

563
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,132
<i>...Fukazawa,</i>

564
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:35,668
<i>Watanabe...</i>

565
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,437
<i>...Mukai.</i>

566
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,274
- <i>The four of you.</i>
- I see.

567
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,243
Four of us.

568
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,545
Right, those whose appeal is his body.

569
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,047
- Our selling...
- Right.

570
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,015
- The buff guys.
- The four ripped ones.

571
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,817
- Yes.
- That's right.

572
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:52,918
The hot bod four.

573
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,354
- Hence Teru-nii not being a part.
- Exactly.

574
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,024
- <i>So skinny.</i>
- <i>Thin.</i>

575
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,627
<i>This way.</i>

576
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:02,762
The manager.

577
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:03,929
You know this place?

578
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,165
- It feels nice.
- It's my first time.

579
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,267
This temperature is nice.

580
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,102
- The best.
- Here's the hot spring.

581
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,771
- Yes.
- There's lodging above.

582
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,206
- Here, everyone.
- Huh?

583
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,075
<i>Fancy.</i>

584
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:19,311
<i>The shape of the building
is unique.</i>

585
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,413
<i>It's based on a triangle.</i>

586
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,716
- <i>That's why?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

587
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,186
<i>First, we'll just wash our bodies.</i>

588
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,420
<i>Once.</i>

589
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,857
- Oh!
- Ah, feels nice!

590
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,826
- This is crazy.
- Not good.

591
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:34,927
Isn't this amazing?

592
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,396
- It's see-through.
- An open-air bath!

593
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,498
- Wow!
- It must be.

594
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,633
Wow!

595
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,568
- Crazy!
- This is wild!

596
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,705
- It's crazy.
- It is.

597
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:47,807
This...

598
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,075
- Huh? Isn't it crazy?
- Too outdoors!

599
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,912
- Feels nice.
- I'm knocked out.

600
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,548
So smooth.

601
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,849
It's amazing.

602
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,684
They call it
"natural skin lotion."

603
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,152
- Nice.
- This is wild.

604
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,087
It's crazy. It feels so smooth.

605
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,190
This is amazing. Really.

606
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,291
It's okay to touch.

607
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,826
I won't.

608
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:10,262
You know, in documentaries...

609
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,565
When you get in a hot spring...

610
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:15,267
- That thing you do.
- Like this.

611
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,802
I'll act like we're alone.

612
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,139
It'd be weird
if you did that with just us.

613
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:22,708
I'd move away from you.

614
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:23,976
In the open-air bath.

615
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,144
I don't like it.

616
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,046
Not needed.

617
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,315
I wonder what the other team is up to?

618
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,283
Some sort of experience, right?

619
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,119
- Oh.
- This place?

620
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,056
I've been wanting to sit here.

621
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,358
There's something
on the table for us.

622
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,559
Hmm?

623
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,194
<i>See, it's warm.</i>

624
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,996
<i>I might fall asleep.</i>

625
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,664
- <i>Nap?</i>
- <i>This is cool.</i>

626
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,267
- Nice.
- Nice.

627
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:53,606
Here is what I will have you all make.

628
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,608
It's also hung in front of the fire.

629
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,176
- This?
- Yes.

630
00:22:57,243 --> 00:23:00,746
This is called a sachet amulet.

631
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:05,217
It contains cornflower,
mugwort, and calendula.

632
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:07,119
- The quantities?
- Totally different.

633
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:11,423
Yes, please keep it flat.

634
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:16,328
About this much?

635
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:23,068
<i>What kind of power would you say
is contained within these?</i>

636
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,570
- Yes.
- I wanna know.

637
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:28,707
What's in front of the fire here
is called swallowwort.

638
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,543
It's the root of a plant.

639
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,214
Due to its unique scent when dug up,

640
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:39,752
it's considered to ward off evil
and cherished.

641
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:45,291
Your wooden boxes
contain pieces of swallowwort too.

642
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:49,161
Once you've put in the herbs,
take the swallowwort pieces...

643
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,997
- Swallowwort...
- ...and place it in the middle.

644
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,399
The middle.

645
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:58,404
Is it done now?

646
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,406
- Yes.
- Nice.

647
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,542
It's done.

648
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,412
- This one is finished.
- Finished.

649
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,847
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

650
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,183
- Really nice.
- It's like "I am lord."

651
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,920
Not good.
You've got lordly ambitions.

652
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:18,557
I could stay in here for a long time.

653
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,292
Do this if you get too hot.

654
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,593
Nice.

655
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,296
Turn your body. The other way.

656
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:25,965
Ah!

657
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,766
Like that. Nice.

658
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:31,036
- Ah, relaxing.
- Not really.

659
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,439
- I'm hot too.
- Don't.

660
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,376
- You...
- You want to show off.

661
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:38,444
Enough, guys.

662
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,646
- One more...
- Yes.

663
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:43,415
- If you'd like.
- We can make another?

664
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,017
The group in the bath...

665
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,852
It's okay.

666
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,053
Make it.

667
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,457
It'll protect us.

668
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,993
This is very Abe.

669
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,194
Abe!

670
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,528
Really?

671
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,230
- Yeah.
- A second one?

672
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:01,133
- This was so fun.
- Can we ride those?

673
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,335
We can't allow you
to ride in them.

674
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:04,837
- You can't?
- No.

675
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:09,708
<i>Would you like to head outside
for a little bit?</i>

676
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:10,776
Sounds good.

677
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,645
You shouldn't, Raul.

678
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,715
It's kind of like a runway.

679
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,717
- True.
- There are lots of little fish.

680
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,386
- Yes.
- Cool.

681
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:22,688
So many.

682
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:27,059
<i>Large koi fish
swim in at times too.</i>

683
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:29,395
The air smells so different here.

684
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,264
It's nice.

685
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:33,732
<i>- Lake view.</i>
- <i>I see.</i>

686
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,833
- <i>Lovely.</i>
- <i>Now...</i>

687
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,704
<i>Shall we relax in our rooms?</i>

688
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:40,939
- Can we?
- Is it okay?

689
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,007
Let's do it.

690
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,978
You can go in.

691
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:49,281
- Wow!
- Awesome.

692
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,716
Pretty.

693
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:53,886
- An unbroken view.
- White birch is in the rooms too.

694
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,522
- Right. Like he said.
- Yeah.

695
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,791
Sweeping view here.

696
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,727
An unbroken view. Cool!

697
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,064
- All right!
- Long day today.

698
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,231
It was the best.

699
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,134
Who had the best body?

700
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,936
- Me.
- It was a competition?

701
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,105
- Honestly, me for sure.
- Me for sure. Me.

702
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:14,706
Call Prince Shotoku.

703
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,075
So who was it?

704
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,077
- Well...
- No, me. Absolutely.

705
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:19,945
I beg to disagree.

706
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:23,048
I'm actually glad you didn't come.

707
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:26,085
- I'd lose confidence.
- I'd lose confidence.

708
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,087
Your team had an experience?

709
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,688
- We did.
- What was it?

710
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,156
- What?
- What was it?

711
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:32,825
Amulets. Like good luck charms.

712
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,226
Good luck charms?

713
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:36,428
Lots of good luck charms on this show.

714
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,030
- Okinawa...
- We got these first.

715
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,498
- Daruma.
- From Hikaru.

716
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,433
- We each made two.
- We made two.

717
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,135
- Yes.
- Different meaning?

718
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:45,003
Ten altogether.

719
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,972
Who will you give them to?

720
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,974
- Well, that's...
- Make it clear.

721
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,877
I was kind of picturing Sakuma.

722
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,812
- Oh my!
- You're the luckiest.

723
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:56,281
- What's the scent?
- My bath buddy.

724
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,349
We are bath buddies.

725
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,051
- Rau said so.
- Smells like Ren.

726
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,452
- Uncle.
- Uncle!

727
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,920
Uncle!

728
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,622
- Uncle!
- Thanks.

729
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,491
Thanks, kid.

730
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,426
- Here, Fukka.
- That...

731
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:10,229
Are you really sure?

732
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,363
Mine is for Fukka too.

733
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,532
- It is?
- Really?

734
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,601
- Right, so...
- Really?

735
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:20,139
- I added a lot of purple flowers.
- Really?

736
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,240
For real?

737
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,341
That's so nice.

738
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,009
Super good luck charm.

739
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,544
- I'm so protected.
- Very nice.

740
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:28,347
- There really are purple flowers.
- I added extra.

741
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,349
- How about you, Iwamoto?
- Who is it for?

742
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,351
I knew from the start.

743
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,886
You knew?

744
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,655
- I knew who I'd make it for.
- Thanks.

745
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,090
TABI.

746
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,725
- TABI?
- Here.

747
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,593
TABI?

748
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,129
- Clever! Clever!
- Clever.

749
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:46,331
Iwamoto was the first one
who met him.

750
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,666
- TABI.
- That's right.

751
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,002
- Nice.
- I'm happy.

752
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,937
Hold up!

753
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,138
What?

754
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,041
The variety show tone. "Hold up!"

755
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,176
The studio tone.

756
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,344
I didn't get one.

757
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,481
- I'm the only one unable to ward off evil.
- Huh?

758
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:04,249
Maybe the amulets ward you off.

759
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,851
<i>Huh?</i>

760
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,119
He said, "Huh?"

761
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,122
"Huh?"

762
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,357
We can make more if we go again.

763
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,861
- Make your own.
- Wait, it's the last episode.

764
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:21,133
We can't have an imbalance in the group
in the last episode.

765
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,101
An imbalance.

766
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,603
Can we end like this?

767
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,671
You're right.

768
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:30,709
That'll be tough, so this watch instead.

769
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,178
- For real?
- Don't imbalance it.

770
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,279
It's imbalanced.

771
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,380
More and more.

772
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,316
- He's already imbalanced.
- Weird guy.

773
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,917
Really? Thanks, seriously.

774
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,053
- He won't give it back.
- I'm glad.

775
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:49,061
<i>It was fun
traveling across Japan with all of you.</i>

776
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,129
- Thanks.
- Us too.

777
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:55,767
<i>I have videos I want all of us
to watch together.</i>

778
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:56,835
What?

779
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,972
<i>Please watch.</i>

780
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,139
Oh!

781
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,542
- Hello.
- Why there?

782
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:04,610
<i>Nostalgic.</i>

783
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,345
OKINAWA

784
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,747
The sea is beautiful!

785
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:10,482
- It's amazing.
- <i>TABI's videos?</i>

786
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,550
Squatting feels good.

787
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,586
- Okay!
- <i>Yakisoba</i> is ready!

788
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:15,654
- <i>It was good.</i>
- Okay!

789
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:16,722
Very good!

790
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,857
- This is it, right?
- So loud.

791
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:19,925
- <i>Fukuoka.</i>
- Watch out!

792
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,727
<i>This place!</i>

793
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:22,861
FUKUOKA

794
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,429
I'm just sweating. Stop it.

795
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:26,965
Lewd!

796
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:28,267
First time in Kochi?

797
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,668
- I caught one!
- <i>Ayu fishing.</i>

798
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:30,802
- Yay! Cheers!
- Yay!

799
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,237
KOCHI

800
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:33,438
- <i>That was good.</i>
- Cool.

801
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,440
- <i>Straw-grilled bonito.</i>
- This feels good.

802
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,109
- <i>Bath again.</i>
- <i>Lots of baths.</i>

803
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,644
<i>It's Tottori!</i>

804
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,711
TOTTORI
OKAYAMA

805
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,413
- <i>Dunes!</i>
- It's what you do on dunes.

806
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,148
- NABI!
- It's TABI.

807
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,019
- Whoo!
- Yay!

808
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,287
KYOTO

809
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,354
<i>Kyoto.</i>

810
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:50,689
- Go ahead.
- Pose.

811
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,025
- <i>Where is this in Kyoto?</i>
- <i>Cool.</i>

812
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,459
This feels good.

813
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,028
- This was nice.
- Emotional.

814
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,163
- Cool!
- Golden hour was the best here.

815
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,231
SHIZUOKA

816
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,066
<i>-My canker sore hurts!</i>
- <i>Canker sore.</i>

817
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,267
A canker sore?

818
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:04,303
Yum!

819
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,438
<i>-Gyoza.</i>
- It's hot!

820
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:08,273
<i>Nice.</i>

821
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,075
So adolescent.

822
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,209
GUNMA

823
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,477
...to come to Gunma...

824
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,912
<i>To be young.</i>

825
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,314
I bet we'll feel energy here.

826
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:16,682
Stop the TABI impression.

827
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,951
- <i>Darumas!</i>
- <i>The darumas!</i>

828
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,887
- That's how they did it.
- Awesome.

829
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,789
- <i>There!</i>
- Spreads out...

830
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,024
<i>-World Heritage.</i>
- A sunken fireplace.

831
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,092
Excuse us.

832
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,427
GIFU
ISHIKAWA

833
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:31,596
MIYAGI

834
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,165
Awesome.

835
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,599
A national treasure.

836
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,368
<i>Amazing!</i>

837
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:37,669
Date Masamune...

838
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:40,105
- A little embarrassing.
- Right.

839
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,074
I'll announce the theme for this show.

840
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,208
Here it is.

841
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:50,949
This is Hikaru Iwamoto from Okinawa.

842
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,352
The time we spent laughing and barbecuing,

843
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:56,822
it was a lot of fun.

844
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:03,161
I imagine we'll continue to travel
as Snow Man in the future.

845
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,664
So I want us to appreciate
our time laughing together

846
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:10,035
and have gratitude
for those supporting Snow Man.

847
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:14,606
Please work together toward our next trip.

848
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:19,277
What can I do for Snow Man? That's...

849
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:25,717
I want to raise the publicity
of Snow Man in Thailand and across Asia.

850
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:29,721
I'm confident nobody can say
they love this group more than me.

851
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:33,392
And I guess I'm the cute one
in Snow Man too.

852
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,360
Thanks for everything.

853
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:38,597
On <i>Traveling with Snow Man,</i>

854
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:42,534
we see many different sides of everyone.

855
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:47,572
I think all I need
is to see Snow Man smiling.

856
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:51,810
Have Snow Man enjoy ourselves, that's all.

857
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:57,282
I'll make you all smile.
Look forward to it.

858
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:00,585
While on this trip, I thought,

859
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,123
our time with all nine of us...

860
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,226
I really like it.

861
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:12,798
It's valuable to me.
That's what I thought.

862
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,800
I want to make everyone smile.

863
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,938
And those smiles will fuel me.

864
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,506
Thanks for everything.

865
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:26,044
I'm in Kyoto right now.

866
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:30,749
However our environment changes
in the future,

867
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,953
I want our relationships to remain close.

868
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:41,126
That's my wish
from the bottom of my heart.

869
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:45,831
Today, I've eaten so much
delicious food in Kyoto.

870
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:50,168
I'll never be able to forget this day.

871
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:52,370
This has been Ren Meguro.

872
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:58,009
What I want to do for Snow Man...

873
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,481
is to...

874
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:08,854
be someone who excites everyone

875
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:13,325
so they don't get bored
with Snow Man as a group.

876
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:17,729
Okay. Next person.

877
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:24,769
I want to keep doing my best as an MC.

878
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,707
I may not be the eldest member
who can lead,

879
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,944
but if anyone is stressed out
or having a hard time,

880
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,314
I think I'm able to be by their side
and support them.

881
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,149
Thanks for everything.

882
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,388
Ryohei Abe here.

883
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:47,259
There's something I look forward to
when I'm on <i>ZIP!</i>

884
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:50,195
When I handle Snow Man's news.

885
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,797
It happens pretty often.

886
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,034
Let me report more news of us.
I'm excited.

887
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:59,404
Everyone abuses their bodies too much.

888
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:02,574
I say it like a joke, but really, guys...

889
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:06,845
Take care of your health.
Your body is your capital.

890
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:11,116
Do you remember our leader's words
when we started in Okinawa?

891
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:15,687
I want to ask if you're accomplishing it.
Am I accomplishing it?

892
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,925
<i>I think you all accomplished it.</i>

893
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:25,630
<i>One for Snow Man,
Snow Man for One.</i>

894
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,569
<i>It was a wonderful trip!</i>

895
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:33,672
Ready, and...

896
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,473
Let's eat.

897
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,942
We're eating, TABI.

898
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,545
- Yum!
- Good miso.

899
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,715
- It's really good!
- Yum.

900
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,284
- This is good.
- Here!

901
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:48,386
- I get it.
- Nice.

902
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,289
This is sinful.

903
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,192
Anyone want water?

904
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,760
- You don't mind?
- Sure.

905
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,462
- I'll help.
- It's self-serve.

906
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:00,532
The miso ramen is so good.

907
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,434
Oh man.

908
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:04,970
It's really good.

909
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,038
- It's so good.
- Anyone want fried rice?

910
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,540
- Sounds good.
- Yay.

911
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,908
I see.

912
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:14,279
You know, in my mind,

913
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:18,049
there's one thing that I think
would make ramen taste good.

914
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,453
- Fukka has views on ramen.
- Yes, I do.

915
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,589
I get blown away
when the pork belly is good.

916
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:25,890
Oh.

917
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,627
This pork belly is great.
I realized. Pork belly ramen...

918
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,595
- Has no contents.
- No insides.

919
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,263
You know...

920
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,432
Nice insight, but it's shallow.

921
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,533
- Shallow.
- Well...

922
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,003
"The pork belly is good."

923
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,271
- See, you know...
- You're a ramen critic.

924
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,373
Thanks. Thanks.

925
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,474
- Impressive.
- Thanks.

926
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,842
- I'm stunned.
- Thanks.

927
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,010
It's good, TABI.

928
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:46,878
<i>I'm glad.</i>

929
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,416
It's good.

930
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,519
This arrangement is a first.

931
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:55,787
- First time.
- In a row.

932
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:58,023
It's my first time eating in one long row.

933
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,257
It's my first too.

934
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,860
Saying it again?

935
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:03,995
- Being here...
- Luxury.

936
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:06,665
That feels strange.

937
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,133
That's interesting.

938
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,403
Look! The sky is beautiful.

939
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,537
Where'd that come from?

940
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,572
<i>-So sudden.</i>
- Funny.

941
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,641
- TABI.
- TABI.

942
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,977
- Memories with TABI.
- <i>Is that max already, Raul?</i>

943
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:20,311
I could go one more level.

944
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,946
That's crazy, man.

945
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,948
<i>Oh no...</i>

946
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:26,785
Thank you.

947
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,086
- Dummy.
- I remember.

948
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:30,055
- Like a music video.
- What's here?

949
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,556
<i>Is this the final boss?</i>

950
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:36,494
Cheers!

951
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,263
You'd better get in.

952
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:41,833
Nice.

953
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:53,344
<i>Let's go on another trip sometime.</i>

954
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,949
Traveling with Snow Man.
