1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,005
<i>Traveling with Snow Man.</i>

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:12,179
I was really excited for the beginning
of a new namesake program.

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:19,186
But more so, I think just showing Snow Man
as we are away from the stage is nice.

4
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:21,255
It'll be the highlight.

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,027
Really, when you're traveling,
you have a lot of new encounters.

6
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,597
New sceneries, new foods.

7
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,401
And the fact that

8
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:39,840
all we have to do here is
just to share our feelings about them

9
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,876
could be a big relief.

10
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:49,683
Come on!

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,085
- Awesome!
- Cool!

12
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,588
Cool!

13
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,958
Look, Sakuma.

14
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:01,728
- It's TABI.
- You... You were here, TABI?

15
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,197
That's a precarious place to be.

16
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:07,701
Cool. So this is Shirakawa-go.

17
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:09,736
I've always wanted to come here.

18
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,238
Isn't it cool?

19
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:13,373
It is cool.
It's a World Heritage site.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,942
You wanted to come too, right?

21
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,476
I really wanted to come here.

22
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,146
Since you have a certification
in World Heritage studies.

23
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,583
- Yeah. I wanted to see it at least once.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,151
You wanted to come here too?

25
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,519
Yeah, I really wanted to.

26
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:29,323
An anime I watched as a kid was set here.

27
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,424
- Here?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,858
It's called <i>When They Cry.</i>

29
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,193
- That's here?
- It is!

30
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,294
Awesome.

31
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,564
So I always wanted to see it
at least once in my life.

32
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:41,401
Good place you've brought us to, TABI.

33
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,736
What's his face look like?

34
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,239
- Like normal.
- Normal. Of course.

35
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:50,510
<i>I'm glad you could come to a place
you've been yearning to go to.</i>

36
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:52,779
- Thank you.
- I'm glad.

37
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,314
This is awesome.

38
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,515
All white in winter.

39
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,619
Winter... It's more well-known
for winter, right?

40
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,320
- True.
- The blanket of snow.

41
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,690
- It's one of the snowiest places in Japan.
- Right.

42
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,559
- It gets a ton of snow.
- Yeah.

43
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,429
<i>Let's go see
this village's characteristic</i>

44
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:13,500
<i>traditional thatched-roof houses.</i>

45
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,235
We can go inside?

46
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,638
- We can enter?
- Don't people live here?

47
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,640
Well, people live
in some of the houses.

48
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,108
But some are preserved.

49
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,209
I see.

50
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,511
- Let's get a pic.
- All right.

51
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,686
- Awesome.
- Cool.

52
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,023
Wanna go check it out?

53
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,491
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

54
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,427
- Can you walk, TABI?
- I'll carry you.

55
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,304
I love going on walks.

56
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,342
In the past, I would go back to Saga...

57
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,244
- Yeah.
- ...to see my grandparents.

58
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,080
I'd go to mountains like this
a lot. It brings me back.

59
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,615
This is the best.

60
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,453
I never go camping or anything.

61
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,321
I'd like to,

62
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,991
but it would be hard
without any knowledge.

63
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,993
So you have a desire to try.

64
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,194
- I do.
- For real?

65
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,229
That was close.

66
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,330
I'd really like to.

67
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,599
- But you know, Sakuma...
- Yeah.

68
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,203
...I can't picture you
carrying camping gear.

69
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,073
You have a point.

70
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,809
- I'd take it in a car and pitch a tent.
- True.

71
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,411
- The car solves everything.
- Yeah.

72
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:36,183
On our right,
the beautiful Shirakawa-go scenery...

73
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,452
- Cool.
- ...spreads out.

74
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,421
Isn't it amazing?

75
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,859
What's this?
It feels so removed from reality.

76
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:48,862
Impressive!

77
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,032
So cool.

78
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,668
It's not very fire-resistant.

79
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,005
It's snow-resistant, right?

80
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,674
That's right.

81
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,709
- To make it resist snow...
- Yeah.

82
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,045
...no nails are used in the building.

83
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,546
- No nails at all?
- Right.

84
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,051
- There are nails in the door.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:15,055
But the building itself doesn't have
any nails in it so it's more flexible.

86
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,290
It can withstand wind and snow.

87
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,959
Look! There's a door there.

88
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,660
- There is.
- So high!

89
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,764
Only Raul could get in there.

90
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:25,565
Amazing.

91
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,234
- The top part is breezy...
- Yeah.

92
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,803
So it's good for growing silkworms.

93
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,472
- So they can make silk.
- That's right.

94
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,510
Nice. Look here, Abe.

95
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,448
Cool. We're really in Shirakawa-go.

96
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,216
We're in Shirakawa-go!

97
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,892
So many good places
for pictures.

98
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,894
- Photogenic.
- It is.

99
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,929
What's this here, TABI?

100
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,968
<i>This is the Kanda House
where you will be staying.</i>

101
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,037
This is the Kanda House.

102
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,442
- Awesome.
- It's a sunken fireplace.

103
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,544
Excuse us.

104
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,582
A sunken fireplace!

105
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,653
Apparently,
the village chief's second son lives here.

106
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:23,523
It's been over 150 years.

107
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,624
Since it was built?

108
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,959
Their mortgage's paid off.

109
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,395
I don't know if it had a mortgage.

110
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:31,765
Cool.

111
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,302
<i>This house has four stories.</i>

112
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,603
Four stories?

113
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,005
<i>Want to go upstairs?</i>

114
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,740
- Let's go!
- Yes!

115
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,475
Can we go all the way up?

116
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,081
This is...

117
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,218
Cool.

118
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,320
- The beam is bent.
- It's so curved.

119
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,421
- This?
- Yeah.

120
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,089
- Cool.
- Impressive.

121
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,091
How do they bend it?

122
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,292
I know, right?

123
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,229
I see,
they can watch fires from up here.

124
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,998
A fire-watching window.

125
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,900
I see it.

126
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,603
- It's in just the right place.
- Yeah.

127
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,741
So you can watch the fire
without going to the ground floor.

128
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,143
This has a charm to it.

129
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,982
- Cool. Another cool place.
- Up we go.

130
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,584
- It's the third floor.
- Okay.

131
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:28,755
Awesome.
There's still so much more.

132
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,559
Look. The silkworm thing.

133
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,828
- You're right.
- A silkworm net.

134
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,163
So they grew them here.

135
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,036
- Above here...
- Up to three people only.

136
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,406
Cool.

137
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,375
So cool.

138
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,643
We're at the top.

139
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,048
It's the roof.

140
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,020
Why is the inside
of the roof so black?

141
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:04,157
Find out after the commercial break.

142
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,861
Why? Did they make it black on purpose?

143
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,096
There's a fire below, right?

144
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,666
- What? No way.
- The smoke stained it black.

145
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:13,733
This?

146
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:15,402
You're right.

147
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:19,806
Omitting a chimney and using smoke
to oxidize it makes the roof stronger.

148
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,276
- It makes it stronger?
- Yeah.

149
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:31,484
You know where
we're going next, right, TABI?

150
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:38,091
<i>We will go to nearby Kanazawa next.</i>

151
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,127
What? We're done at Shirakawa-go?

152
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,596
We're not waiting until it snows?

153
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,333
That's six months away.

154
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,934
We'll enjoy the next place too.

155
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,302
Yeah. It'll be fun.

156
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,503
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

157
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,041
SHIRAKAWA-GO
KANDA HOUSE

158
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,511
<i>Let's drive there safely.</i>

159
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,918
I haven't had you
drive me in a while, Abe.

160
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,353
It's been a while.

161
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,790
I changed now that
we're done in Shirakawa-go.

162
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,625
You're right!

163
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,927
Yeah, I changed clothes.

164
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,061
No longer sleeveless?

165
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,731
When I wear a sleeveless top...

166
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,000
...my skin gets too sun-damaged.

167
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,101
That's true.

168
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,403
- I get sunburned.
- Sunburned, yeah.

169
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,443
There are so many places
that've been featured in many things.

170
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,413
- There are tourist attractions all over.
- Yeah.

171
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,616
It was already kind of like
a pop-culture pilgrimage to me.

172
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,684
How so?

173
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:41,588
I saw the same scenes that I saw
in the World Heritage textbook.

174
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,890
That's interesting.

175
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,559
- Like checking my work.
- Seeing everything from the book?

176
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,994
Yeah, kind of like that.

177
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,030
That's cool!

178
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:55,869
<i>Do you study your
travel destinations before going, Abe?</i>

179
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,172
I do when I can.

180
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:00,774
- Just a bit.
- Me too.

181
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:05,979
Researching what I should see
before going there

182
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,248
is part of the fun of travel.

183
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,418
Whenever we go to a new location
for work or something,

184
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,788
Abe looks up the nearby heritage sites.

185
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,224
- Like shrines.
- You mean...

186
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,226
When we went to Hiroshima?

187
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,861
You got it.

188
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,866
You were up early in the morning
and making noises.

189
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,468
Around four or five.

190
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,570
We were in the same room.

191
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,505
I asked what you were doing.

192
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,507
You said,
"I'm going to Itsukushima Shrine."

193
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,578
So I said, "I'll go with you."

194
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,647
- We took the train, right?
- We did.

195
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,782
We took
the local Hiroshima train.

196
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,956
<i>Since we're next to the Sea of Japan,</i>

197
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,725
<i>the seafood is good here.</i>

198
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,793
<i>The seafood?</i>

199
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,062
- I want some of those snow crabs.
- Ah!

200
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,064
- You know those? The little...
- I know.

201
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,366
- I got some as a hometown tax gift.
- Cool.

202
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,169
- I love crab dipping sauce.
- Me too.

203
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,637
Why does it taste so good?

204
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,106
It's really good.

205
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,977
<i>I see you two like crab.</i>

206
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,879
- I do!
- I love it.

207
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,153
<i>There is crab waiting for you
at TSUBAJIN, where we are going.</i>

208
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,988
- Really?
- Crab!

209
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,423
Yay.

210
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,725
I'm so happy.

211
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,801
They're waving. They're waving.

212
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,737
- Waving.
- Waving.

213
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,478
That sounded like Def Tech.

214
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,815
Waving, waving.

215
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,027
All right.

216
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,630
- Excuse me.
- Welcome.

217
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:04,764
So pretty.

218
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,567
- I'll show you to your room.
- Okay.

219
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,705
- This is your room.
- Cool.

220
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:13,806
- Pretty.
- Go ahead.

221
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,476
- Excuse me.
- Cool. Excuse me.

222
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,144
Huh?

223
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,714
What is this place?

224
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,683
It's beautiful.

225
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,652
Amazing.

226
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:30,490
One famous example of someone
who has used this room

227
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:33,826
is the first Prime Minister, Hirobumi Ito.

228
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:37,830
He sat in this very seat.

229
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:42,468
We have calligraphy that he left here.

230
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,437
- In the front.
- What?

231
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:49,976
It reads
"Premier Scenic Beauty Lookout."

232
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,780
It means this is the best building
to enjoy beautiful scenery.

233
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,082
- Yes.
- Amazing.

234
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,517
The ultimate praise.

235
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:01,020
It is. I completely agree.

236
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,357
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

237
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,559
Yeah.

238
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,794
TABI's hungry too.

239
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,529
Something's here.

240
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,931
What?

241
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,901
- What? Tofu?
- It's jiggly.

242
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,238
- Jiggly.
- Yeah.

243
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,806
It looks so good.

244
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:23,476
- This is our first set meal.
- Okay.

245
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,012
First is our <i>dashimaki tamago.</i>

246
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,384
It has the mark of a katana handguard,
which is TSUBAJIN's symbol.

247
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,652
- I see it.
- You're right.

248
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:36,422
We began as makers of katana handguards.

249
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,490
Then 350 years ago,

250
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:42,128
we transitioned
into the restaurant business.

251
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:46,499
The brand is of one of the handguards
we originally made.

252
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,501
Let's eat.

253
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,170
What is this?

254
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,472
It's so soft.

255
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,707
So much filling.

256
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,743
Yes! Time to eat.

257
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,848
That's good.

258
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,716
- It's mellow.
- It is.

259
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,122
I'm going for the tofu.

260
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,356
Go for it.

261
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,830
It smells like yuzu.

262
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,065
- Citrus?
- Yes.

263
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,567
It's sprinkled with yuzu zest.

264
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,036
This is good.

265
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,176
A burner!

266
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:33,079
That's not the focal point!
It's the hotpot.

267
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,581
That's the fun part.

268
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,749
Sorry.

269
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,752
CRAB PORRIDGE

270
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,524
So much crab!

271
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,794
- There's so much more than I expected.
- Yeah.

272
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,629
Very luxurious!

273
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,098
Is it red snow crab
this time of year?

274
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,033
Yes, depending on the season,

275
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,836
we may serve large male snow crabs
or small female crabs.

276
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,171
Are the females in winter?

277
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,073
Yes, from autumn to winter.

278
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,908
That's what I thought.

279
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,777
- Let's open it.
- Ready, go!

280
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,550
It's crab!

281
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,018
So much crab.

282
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,723
My tongue is sensitive to heat.

283
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,660
- Time to eat.
- Go ahead.

284
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,134
<i>Hani...</i>

285
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,970
You were so stunned by the crab,
you said <i>"hani."</i>

286
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,473
You said <i>"hani."</i>

287
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,241
Amazing.

288
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,577
It's so good.

289
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,613
They called it porridge,
but all I taste is crab.

290
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,851
It has such a strong crab flavor,
but it's also mellow.

291
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,452
- Yum.
- So good.

292
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,957
The crab has a chew at first,
but then it melts in your mouth.

293
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,625
Yeah.

294
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,796
I think of porridge as a good food

295
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,766
- for when you're under the weather.
- Yes.

296
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,568
- Good for when you don't have an appetite.
- Yes.

297
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,072
- Do you agree?
- It's gentle on the stomach.

298
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,008
So eating it
as a fine dish like this...

299
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,510
Indeed. Yes.

300
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,280
I'll come here in my old age.

301
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,516
- He's already decided.
- Please, feel free.

302
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,252
- I'll grow old here.
- Thinking that far ahead?

303
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,453
Yeah.

304
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,055
- I ate all of mine already.
- You're so fast.

305
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,092
<i>Let's go to the next place.</i>

306
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,527
Wanna go?

307
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:30,396
Thank you.

308
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,532
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

309
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,667
I'll come again.

310
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:42,074
<i>The 21st Century Museum
of Contemporary Art is nearby.</i>

311
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,443
What's that?

312
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,778
You'll take us
to the Museum of Contemporary Art?

313
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:48,481
The 21st Century Museum
of Contemporary Art?

314
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,083
This will be good.

315
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,487
- The Museum of Contemporary Art is fun.
- I'm not familiar with it.

316
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:58,090
Speaking of museums, you know...

317
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:03,362
It's similar to when I looked
for heritage sites like you mentioned,

318
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,264
but I've also looked for museums.

319
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,868
- Out of curiosity?
- Yeah. Himeji.

320
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,437
In Japan, huh?

321
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,273
There's a museum
near Himeji Castle.

322
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,843
So I visited that one.

323
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:18,744
Cool.

324
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,080
Thankfully,

325
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,685
people regard me as an educated person,

326
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,321
and they've put me in a morning program.

327
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:35,828
I hope I can do more of that.

328
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,532
Maintaining the status quo
is a very difficult thing.

329
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:46,873
Over the past five years,

330
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:52,078
the most important thing, in my opinion,

331
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,084
has been to hold on to
the same feelings and aspirations.

332
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:03,556
Aren't we getting close?

333
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,693
- It looks like it.
- I think the museum is around here.

334
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,098
<i>We have reached our destination.</i>

335
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,768
Look at the clouds.

336
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,371
- Amazing.
- Awesome.

337
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,777
These new modern objets d'art are also

338
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:28,047
a major feature of this museum.

339
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:29,448
Looks tasty.

340
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,256
- The inside is so cool.
- Yeah.

341
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,593
It's amazing.

342
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,398
- What's this?
- Listen to one, Sakuma.

343
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,533
You'll hear out of one of them.

344
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,601
Hear what?

345
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,771
- Abe.
- Yoo-hoo.

346
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,107
Is it this one?

347
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,175
Abe.

348
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,778
- That's not it.
- Then...

349
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,480
Is it somewhere else?

350
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,283
I wonder? I think it was the one behind.

351
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:07,987
Is that it?

352
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,488
A dragonfly.

353
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,857
A dragonfly.

354
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,293
A dragonfly.

355
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,168
A dragonfly.

356
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,705
Abe.

357
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,139
- Yoo-hoo.
- Abe.

358
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,076
- Abe.
- I heard you.

359
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,644
This is it.

360
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,013
Sakuma.

361
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,081
What?

362
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,616
Can you hear me?

363
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:39,552
I like you!

364
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,127
- Did you just confess your love to me?
- Yeah.

365
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,131
What do you mean "I like you"?

366
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,268
Let's go inside.

367
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,937
- It's hot.
- It's hot out here.

368
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,840
This is a big place.

369
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,309
What's this?

370
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,277
- Cool.
- Look.

371
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,980
- Cute.
- Cute shadow.

372
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,483
Is it a bunny?

373
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,917
It's a bunny.

374
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,787
This too?
This is an art piece too.

375
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,625
- So bright.
- It's so bright.

376
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,827
- Direct sunlight.
- Direct sunlight.

377
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,231
Cute shadows.

378
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,566
You're cuter.

379
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,468
I haven't heard that in a while.

380
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,442
Okay.

381
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,579
- The shadows look artistic too.
- Yeah.

382
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,482
It'd be cool to shoot an MV here.

383
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,550
For sure.

384
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,059
- Is this it?
- This is it.

385
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,127
I know this!

386
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,962
So this is where it is!

387
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,131
- You must know this.
- I know this.

388
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,701
So this is where it is.

389
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,703
The pool.

390
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,812
We're like a married couple.

391
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,415
It'd look cooler if one of us went down.

392
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,950
Exactly.

393
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,653
- Wanna go down and I'll take a pic?
- Sure.

394
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,656
Since this is your episode.

395
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:25,991
- I'll go, then.
- Yeah.

396
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,297
Cool!

397
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,968
Here I go.

398
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,804
- Awesome!
- Here it is!

399
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,574
- Cool!
- Awesome!

400
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,689
I've seen this.

401
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,794
What's it like down there?

402
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,232
- Here you are!
- Abe.

403
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,701
- Cool!
- It's so cool.

404
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:12,037
This is the inside of a pool?

405
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,608
The museum's hard to get in.

406
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,675
Did you want to?

407
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,411
Admissions were over
when I came here before.

408
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:20,813
- Really?
- Yeah.

409
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,351
Cool.

410
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,258
- I got a bunch.
- All right.

411
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,326
Nice.
I wanna keep looking at this.

412
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,195
Yeah. Isn't it exciting?

413
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,930
It is. I've seen this before.

414
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,532
So this is the place.

415
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,467
- The Museum of Contemporary Art.
- I see.

416
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,235
TABI.

417
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,437
- What's the next place?
- What's next?

418
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,772
Where to next?

419
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,109
- What's next, TABI?
- <i>Next is...</i>

420
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:52,444
You can breathe?

421
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,114
<i>After contemporary art,</i>

422
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,516
<i>would you like to time travel</i>

423
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:01,754
<i>to the Ninja Temple?</i>

424
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,457
- Ninja...
- You're still doing that?

425
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,760
Still underwater.

426
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,296
You sounded like Goofy just then.

427
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:15,034
- Let's go.
- Let's go to the Ninja Temple.

428
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:25,477
<i>Buzz, buzz, buzz...</i>

429
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:28,380
The Ninja Temple.

430
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,449
- It says Ninja Temple over here.
- It does.

431
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,519
- What does that mean?
- Excuse us.

432
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,187
Excuse us.

433
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,022
Why ninjas?

434
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,290
Why ninjas?

435
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,660
Oh. What's this?

436
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,830
- Is this the entrance?
- Looks like it.

437
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,266
PROPAGATING THE LOTUS SUTRA

438
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,371
- All right.
- Hello.

439
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,843
What kind of temple is this?

440
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,812
I heard it's called the Ninja Temple.

441
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,982
This is
a Nichiren Buddhist temple.

442
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:08,220
A prayer hall that had been near a castle
was moved to this location.

443
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:12,892
It has a complex structure to defend
itself from attacks by the shogunate.

444
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,860
It's prepared for attack.

445
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:16,662
- Is that why it's Ninja Temple?
- Yes.

446
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,665
May I ask you to greet

447
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,634
- the Buddha with me?
- Yes. Of course.

448
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,569
- Okay. This way.
- Okay.

449
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:28,240
- The offertory box is below.
- Please raise your hands to the Buddha.

450
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:29,875
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

451
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,245
Okay. Hands together.

452
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,454
- Thank you. You can put your hands down.
- Okay.

453
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:46,859
- Will you turn around for me now?
- Okay.

454
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,594
As you have noticed,

455
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,696
this is the hole for the offertory box.

456
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,031
- The hole?
- It's a pitfall?

457
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,966
It's the same height as the tatami.

458
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,201
- Right. Usually, it's above.
- Yes.

459
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,471
Any enemies that enter from the front
would fall into this hole.

460
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,207
- It served to slow their invasion.
- I see.

461
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,843
- That's cool.
- An interesting tactic right away.

462
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,579
There are many
complex features like this.

463
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,015
- I'll show you around.
- Please do.

464
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,317
Right this way.

465
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,757
Look outside the window.

466
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,826
- There's a well.
- There is.

467
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,528
- You're right.
- A well.

468
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,431
This well is 24 or 25 meters deep.

469
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,967
- That's deep.
- Twice as deep as a normal one.

470
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:32,104
About three or four meters
from the water,

471
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:33,872
there's a tunnel in the wall.

472
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,675
- The tunnel leads to Kanazawa Castle.
- Cool.

473
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:39,345
- So it is said.
- That's cool.

474
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,080
Excluding the main worship hall,

475
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,416
the well is almost at the center
of this building.

476
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,653
In case of emergency,
you could lower a rope ladder

477
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,690
and climb down into the well
to go through the tunnel to the castle.

478
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,559
So it is said.

479
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,828
Next, this way.

480
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,430
- Please crouch down.
- So low.

481
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,966
Do you see
the staircase-like shoji screens?

482
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,067
They're stacked.

483
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,570
This is on the other side
of the staircase.

484
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:09,041
Light comes in from outside.
It's called the skylight staircase.

485
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,310
If enemies were to invade,

486
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:14,279
you could see their feet through this
even if they tiptoed.

487
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,248
- You can see them.
- With a lance,

488
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:19,051
- they could attack from this side.
- Scary.

489
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,285
- That's cool.
- Yes.

490
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,988
And right next to this,

491
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,723
you can't see it from here,

492
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,793
but there's a small room
the servants lived in.

493
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,796
The room where the men
who did the chores stayed.

494
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:31,864
Mmm.

495
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,433
There was no electricity, so it was dark.

496
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,869
They lived by the light from the stairs.

497
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,437
I see.

498
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,839
So this is the skylight staircase.

499
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,075
That's cool.

500
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,146
Now this has a mysterious...

501
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,747
- shape.
- Yeah.

502
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:55,154
As for this door,
I'll open the left side first.

503
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,990
- It leads to the outside.
- You're right.

504
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,292
There's a staircase below.

505
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,660
This staircase is the one

506
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,896
- that we just looked at.
- I see.

507
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,598
With a normal door,

508
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,401
both sides lead to the same place.

509
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,203
But if you open the other side...

510
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,304
NO ENTRY

511
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:13,539
...it leads here.

512
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,507
- I see.
- To a separate building.

513
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:20,546
Let's say an ally ran back to the building
when enemies attacked.

514
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:24,049
Since they know the layout,
they can hide in this other building.

515
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,019
Then, when the enemies come in,

516
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:31,523
they can't enter
without opening both doors.

517
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,792
That meant the allies here

518
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,862
could be fully hidden from invading foes.

519
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:37,996
I see.

520
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,899
The foes didn't know the layout,

521
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:45,737
so they would wander the building
looking for the allies.

522
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,541
So they would wait for a chance
to quietly sneak out

523
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,511
and attack the foes from behind.

524
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,613
They knew how to wait them out.

525
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,014
Yes.

526
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,549
I'll show you more.

527
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,784
- Okay.
- Okay.

528
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:02,087
Please come around the front again.

529
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,524
- This sliding door...
- Yes.

530
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:07,893
The center is bamboo.

531
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,162
- Yes.
- It's woven from thin bamboo.

532
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:13,332
It's hard to see the dark room inside
from a lighted area,

533
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,669
but you can see the bright main hall
from the other side.

534
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,705
In case of emergency,

535
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,442
the servants would protect the lord here.

536
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,577
It's called "the warrior's hiding place."

537
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:28,313
- It functions like a magic mirror.
- It does.

538
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:33,819
<i>Let's look
from the other side, Sakuma.</i>

539
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,788
Yeah. Let's look.

540
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:40,692
Here.

541
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:47,166
It's completely see-through.

542
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,035
- TABI is too bright.
- Hey, TABI!

543
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,970
What are you doing, TABI?

544
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,605
You can't be stealthy.

545
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,808
Thank you.

546
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:01,647
These intricate constructions are why
this is called the Ninja Temple.

547
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,916
It has nothing to do with ninjas.

548
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:08,654
True. Although it does seem like
a place ninjas would live.

549
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,322
That impressed me the most.

550
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:13,192
How it leads outside on the left
and to stairs on the right.

551
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,295
- So it's stairs. That's revolutionary.
- That's the coolest.

552
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,465
<i>Did you enjoy the Ninja Temple?</i>

553
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,502
- It was cool.
- It was interesting.

554
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:29,408
<i>Now, shall we go eat some sweets?</i>

555
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,809
Sounds good.

556
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:38,951
<i>I recommend Salon de The Kawamura
in the Nishi-Chaya District.</i>

557
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,753
AMANATTO KAWAMURA

558
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,423
- It says <i>amanatto.</i>
- <i>Amanatto.</i>

559
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:47,759
- Welcome.
- Cool. The first floor is a shop.

560
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:52,531
The streetlights are so close.
Ouch. I'm sore.

561
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,266
Excuse me. Here is the menu.

562
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,334
Okay.

563
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,903
It's so trendy.

564
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,372
What do you recommend?

565
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:04,943
We have this seasonal shaved ice.

566
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,044
It's seasonal?

567
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,080
Yes. It's very popular.

568
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,148
Peach shaved ice.

569
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,317
Nice.

570
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,386
One Kawamura plate.

571
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,521
- Okay. One Kawamura plate.
- Yes.

572
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:18,523
I'll have the shaved ice, then.

573
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:23,495
- One apricot <i>anmitsu.</i>
- One apricot <i>anmitsu.</i> Got it.

574
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:29,301
- One peach shaved ice, please.
- Okay. Understood.

575
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:31,203
- Eat whatever you want.
- Yeah.

576
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,671
I'd like this one.

577
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,706
- Thank you.
- Understood. Excuse me.

578
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,841
Thank you.

579
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:40,145
- We can share the Kawamura plate.
- Yeah.

580
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,349
Today was another full day.

581
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:47,586
I mean, we started with Shirakawa-go.

582
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:50,589
That was so impressive.

583
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:51,990
It was hype.

584
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,625
Huh?

585
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,861
- It's here!
- It's here.

586
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,462
Here is your Kawamura plate.

587
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,530
There it is.

588
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,899
Awesome.

589
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,969
- Cool.
- It looks tasty.

590
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,205
- Time to eat.
- Let's eat.

591
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:09,341
- Start with the cashews?
- Cashews.

592
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,011
- Yum. Smoked.
- I like these.

593
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,013
- I really love these.
- I love smoked.

594
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:16,782
Yum.

595
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,550
- We ate smoked food.
- We did.

596
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,085
- Several times.
- Totally.

597
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,987
- Smoked Camembert was really good.
- Yeah.

598
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,723
That brings me back.

599
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,025
It made me think
anything could be good smoked.

600
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,328
I get you. It was all great.

601
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,596
Yum.

602
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,098
The simple <i>iyokan</i> is good.

603
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,967
Yum. And it smells great.

604
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,537
- Here is your apricot <i>anmitsu.</i>
- Okay. Thank you.

605
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,506
- Figs!
- Over here.

606
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,175
- May I put it here?
- Yes.

607
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,178
- Where do I start?
- True.

608
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,514
- This?
- That's the best part of <i>anmitsu.</i>

609
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,050
Look.
It has everyone's favorite, <i>shiratama.</i>

610
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,252
This? I'll go for this.

611
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:55,987
Apricot.

612
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,489
- It's apricot.
- Apricot.

613
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,124
Not peach, apricot.

614
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,759
- Actual apricot.
- Nice.

615
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,361
Yum!

616
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,932
- Premium soy flour mochi cakes.
- Premium soy flour!

617
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,769
This is shining like a disco ball.

618
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:11,837
Awesome.

619
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,673
I might start dancing.

620
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,376
<i>♪ CHARISMAX ♪</i>

621
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,277
- It goes with the disco ball.
- Ad time.

622
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,712
<i>♪ CHARISMAX ♪</i>

623
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:29,988
Yum.

624
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,226
It's as if soy flour is really packed.

625
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,662
- Does it have wings?
- There it is!

626
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,132
Here is your peach shaved ice.

627
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,601
- It's huge.
- It's huge.

628
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,771
Let's start with the peach.

629
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,173
It's big.

630
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:53,678
Yum.

631
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,949
You were enjoying it so much,
you did an evil laugh.

632
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:01,820
- The flesh-to-ice-to-cream ratio's ideal.
- Really?

633
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,824
- Just right.
- How's the shaved ice?

634
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:07,859
Nothing.

635
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,731
The instant I put it in my mouth,
it's gone.

636
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:15,133
- It melts? I'll have some too.
- Okay.

637
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,370
Have it with the fruit too.

638
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,475
- For real.
- It actually disappears instantly.

639
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,877
- It's gone.
- I'm eating nothing right now.

640
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,914
- It's zero calories.
- I'm eating nothing. Zero.

641
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,283
Am I eating air right now?

642
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,121
<i>You two
have known each other a long time.</i>

643
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:39,391
<i>Has your relationship changed at all?</i>

644
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,295
- Yes, but not only with Abe.
- Yeah.

645
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:46,031
- When we all do work...
- Right.

646
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:50,535
...we all end up counting on each other.

647
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,138
Each at different times.

648
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,773
- Different scenarios.
- Yeah.

649
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,007
It's like...

650
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,277
We can rely on each other.

651
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,180
- We can pass the baton to each other now.
- Yeah.

652
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:06,151
- But our relationship value is the same.
- Right.

653
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,752
I think...

654
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,324
- When I do variety shows on my own...
- Yeah.

655
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,092
For example,

656
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,464
when I'm presenting a new Snow Man song...

657
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:20,899
- Promos?
- Yeah.

658
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:24,603
- When I'm doing publicity for us...
- Yeah.

659
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:26,605
I think...

660
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:31,376
I get nervous sometimes. Naturally.

661
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:35,981
So sometimes I think to myself,
"What would Sakuma do?"

662
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,716
Wow. I didn't know.

663
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,585
That doesn't mean I act 100% like you.

664
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:41,820
Of course.

665
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:46,124
But that helps me understand
how to take it on sometimes.

666
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:49,027
- Like, find a breakthrough?
- Yeah.

667
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:50,395
Like, "Here's what he'd do."

668
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:53,465
Still, there are times I worry
I might not be able to do it.

669
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,533
For sure.

670
00:33:56,735 --> 00:34:01,072
Sakuma is a guy
who can jump into a conversation

671
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,308
without overthinking it.

672
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,078
So I imagine what he would do

673
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:12,117
to contribute to a program,
to make people happy.

674
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:17,622
I try to imagine his philosophy
in those situations

675
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:22,127
and let that guide me.

676
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,729
About 10 years

677
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:28,567
before we were in the same group,

678
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,570
we went to a concert of an older group.

679
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:36,007
They were performing at Tokyo Dome.

680
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:42,113
And one of the staff told me,
"Snow Man is next."

681
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:46,151
At the time, I thought, "No way."

682
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:52,824
To think we stood in the stadium
about 10 years afterward...

683
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,427
It really moves me.

684
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,164
Above all,

685
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:06,705
it's thanks to the people
who had faith in us.

686
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,676
<i>We three guys
should travel together again.</i>

687
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:16,181
- TABI, do you count as...
- Same thought.

688
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,583
- I know, right?
- I had the same thought.

689
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,152
Is TABI a "guy"?

690
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,955
More of a "thing"?

691
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,890
<i>I am a "guy."</i>

692
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:29,628
That reminded me of a ninja just now.

693
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,163
- Like "whoosh."
- "I am... a guy."

694
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,467
<i>Whoosh.</i>

695
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,030
Traveling with Snow Man!
