-Is here okay?
-[staff] Yes.

176
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:07,153
-[Ryohei] "Japan."
-[TABI] This year's theme is Japan.

177
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,323
[Ryohei] The route starts here.

178
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,460
First time, TABI?

179
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,730
[TABI] Yes, it's my first time.

180
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,599
-[Ryohei exclaims]
-[Ryota] You too, TABI?

181
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,967
[Ryohei] Yeah, even TABI.

182
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,371
Here we are. Let's start here.

183
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,339

-[Ryohei laughs]

184
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,141
-[Ryota exclaims]
-Cool.

185
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,276
It's sand, right?

186
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,112
[Ryota exclaims]

187
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,179
Wow!

188
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,548
[Ryota exclaims]

189
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,283
This is all sand.

190
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:38,952
[Ryota exclaims]

191
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,555
[Ryota] He's slashing a giant snake.

192
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,090
[Ryohei] From Japanese mythology.

193
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,992
Cool!

194
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,927
Very cool.

195
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,462
This looks good.

196
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,964
-I'll look over here.
-Okay.

197
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,333
That's different.

198
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,035
The cool air from the spot cooler.

199
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,603
[both laugh]

200
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,571
-A modern convenience.
-It is.

201
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,373
-Let's keep going this way.
-[Ryota exclaims]

202
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,208
[Ryohei] It's Himiko.

203
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,445
Look at the depth in the background.

204
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:06,713
-[Ryota exclaims]
-[Ryohei laughs]

205
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:08,948
[Ryota exclaims]

206
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,617
[Ryohei] It makes it really look far away.

207
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,818
[Ryota] For sure.

208
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,486
This is so detailed.

209
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,424
The amazing thing about this is
they're made of only sand and water.

210
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,959
[Ryota exclaims]

211
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,096
-[Ryohei] And as for us...
-Yeah.

212
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,632
-[Ryohei] We've been in Kabuki plays.
-We sure have.

213
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,233
[Ryohei] It was around this time period.

214
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,102
-[Ryota] Kamakura?
-[Ryohei] The Kamakura era.

215
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,437
[Ryohei exclaims]

216
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,306
[Ryohei laughs]

217
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,576
[Ryohei] The body armor looks detached.

218
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:37,677
[Ryota] Right.

219
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,879
-[Ryohei] How do they...
-[Ryota] This...

220
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:43,583
[Ryohei] You'd think that the sand
would fall apart.

221
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,218
-[Ryota] Well...
-[Ryohei] Yeah.

222
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:48,388
-This kimono inside the armor...
-Right.

223
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,390
-Here.
-The folds?

224
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,558
[Ryohei exclaims]

225
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,227
-[Ryohei] This.
-It's so realistic.

226
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,328
[both laugh]

227
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,197
-[Ryohei] That's exactly how it folds.
-Yeah.

228
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,965
-[Ryohei] Just like that.
-Amazing.

229
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,336
[Ryota] So, are all these
based on historical events?

230
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,704
[Ryohei] Yeah.

231
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,440
-In chronological order.
-[Ryota] Yeah.

232
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,045
Look at this. They're kind of fused.

233
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,214
-[Ryohei] The stone wall...
-Yeah.

234
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,415
[Ryohei] ...and water fountain.

235
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:20,920
[Ryohei] This is sand.
I've said it before, but this is all sand.

236
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,456
[Ryota] The top is cool too.

237
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,458
[Ryohei] It goes so deep.

238
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,761
Isn't the interior cool?
It's the Byodo-in Phoenix Hall.

239
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:29,963
[Ryota exclaims]

240
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,331
[Ryohei] As seen on the 10-yen coin.

241
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,234
An ukiyo-e.

242
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,569
Do that pose, Date.

243
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,173
[Ryohei laughs]

244
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,374
You're good at that.

00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,411
-Thanks.

247
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:47,914
Nice.

248
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,052
[Ryohei] It's a lot different
from when I came here before.

249
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,655
Right. They took it all down.

250
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,590
[Ryota] There's beauty
in how it's temporary.

251
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,293
[Ryohei] Maybe so.
You can only see this now.

252
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,361
[Ryota] Exactly.

253
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,130
[insects trilling]

254
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,231
[Ryohei] TABI.

255
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,369
Do you have any recommendations
for places nearby?

256
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,740
[TABI] How about a theme park?

257
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,175
[Ryohei exclaims]

258
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,310
-[Ryota] A theme park?
-There's a theme park?

259
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:22,415
[TABI] About an hour and a half from here,
on the border with Okayama.

260
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:26,486
-That's kind of far.
-[TABI] Are you interested in Joyful Park?

261
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,621
Joyful Park sounds nice, though.

262
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,457
I'll leave TABI...

263
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,160
-in your care, Date.
-[Ryota] Okay.

264
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,129
Here you go.

265
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,463
-[Ryohei] All right.
-[Ryota] Okay!

266
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,200
-[Ryohei] Oops.
-[Ryota] What?

267
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,568
[Ryohei] I didn't get directions.

[Ryota] Okay, TABI.

275
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,754
[TABI] When was the last time
the two of you went to a theme park?

-Well...
-Yeah.

278
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,695
We went to the theme park in Asakusa.

279
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,964
[exclaims] We did.

280
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:15,368
-On a shopping trip.
-Yeah, on a shopping trip.

281
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,104
Only for a short time.

282
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,374
-For one roller coaster ride. [laughs]
-Yeah.

283
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,576
[Ryota] When was that? [sharp inhale]

284
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,378
[Ryohei] About two years ago.

285
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,313
-[Ryota] Two years.
-Yeah.

286
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,751
What else? How about Disneyland?

287

-If it was DisneySea...
-Yeah.

288

I was 20, right?
I had my coming-of-age ceremony.

[exclaims] Is that right?

293
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,103
I got a suit for the ceremony.

294
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,706
But I didn't have a chance
to wear it then.

295
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,509
So I wanted to wear it somewhere.

-For sure.

I haven't had a chance
to wear the suit since.

-It probably won't fit now.
-Really?

when I'm not trying to be funny?

-You weren't going for that?

[Ryota] To be honest,

379
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,074
I didn't really want to have
that kind of talk.

380
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:52,578
But I'm able to look back
on how things used to be

381
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:57,416
because I had a member
from back then with me,

382
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:01,988
so I was able to be open about it.

383
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:06,459
I surprised myself
with how easily the words came out

384
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:11,531
in the flow of that conversation.

Everything I said was true, though.

Overcoming something you dislike

389
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:28,114
makes you stronger as a person.

390
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,785

00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,738
-[Ryohei exclaims]
-[laughs]

525
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,974
I'll take an espresso.

526
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,909
-[laughter]
-Something different?

527
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:05,444
I thought you'd go for it.

528
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:08,981
Sorry. That's a no-fail joke.
I'll have the lassi.

529
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,149
-[staff] The lassi.
-Yes.

530
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,152
Me too, then.

531
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,487
-I'd like the Jersey lassi.
-[staff] Thank you.

532
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,491
-Thank you for waiting.
-[Ryota] Thank you.

533
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,460
Time to enjoy.

534
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:23,662
-[Ryohei] Thanks.
-Thank you.

535
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,502
[Ryota exclaims] The ice is so crunchy.

536
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,838
Do we mix it up?

537
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,473
I wanted to cool it down.

538
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,208
-I see.
-[laughs]

539
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,878
-Cheers!
-Cheers. Thank you.

540
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:44,717
Yum. It's so mellow.

541
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,655
This is good.

542
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,091
-[Ryohei] Good stuff.
-I like it.

543
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,860
It's a refreshing drink on a hot day.

544
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:00,399
-Up until now...
-Yeah.

545
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:03,802
-...our schedule has been packed.
-For sure.

546
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,205
So we need times like these.

547
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:11,443
[TABI] Do you two often go to cafes?

548
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,514
I like to study at cafes.

549
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,549
Hey, stop it.

550
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,520
I think if I lived around here,
I'd study around there.

551
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:24,757
I look for cafes to go to
when I have free moments.

552
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:25,958
Ah.

553
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,559
But I just buy and leave.

554
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,762
-You get takeout?
-Yeah.

555
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:34,767
[TABI] Where do you go to relax, Miyadate?

556
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,069
Uh...

557
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:41,006
I don't have a lot of time
to relax these days.

558
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,141
I guess not.

559
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:44,810
Well...

560
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,146
You do change modes, right?

561
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,081
-Like go into work mode?
-Yeah.

562
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,817
When do you switch out of work mode?

563
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,219
When you get home?

564
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:58,857
I'd think that's when you can relax.

565
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:04,329
Once I've gotten out of the bath

566
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,833
and done my skincare and stuff.

567
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,301
[exclaims, laughs]

568
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,538
-That's nice.
-I don't think I've ever shown that.

569
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:14,373
No.

570
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,775
-When I'm in the bath.
-Right.

571
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:23,949
But sometimes,
we get in hot springs on camera.

572
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,652
-We do.
-Maybe I've shown that.

573
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,988
-But not post-skincare.
-Yeah.

574
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,127
Why's it so quiet?

575
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,762
What now?

576
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,931
[TABI] Want to show it?

577
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,365
[both laugh]

578
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,702
-[whispers] Sorry.
-[whispers] I'm sorry.

579
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,872
[Ryohei] Read the room, TABI.

580
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,775
I could, though.

581
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,444
-You're answering the question?
-[laughs]

582
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,915
[Ryohei] Can you keep
your voice down, TABI?

583
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,017
[TABI] I'm hungry.

584
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,253
[both laugh]

585
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:06,458
In terms of airports,
Yonago is closer than Tottori.

586
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:10,596
Anything good to eat on the way to Yonago?

587
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:11,897
-Well...
-Yonago?

588
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:15,868
There's a hot pot, which we've been having
since the first episode.

589
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,436
Right.

590
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:21,707
[TABI] Yonago is famous
for saba-shabu hot pot.

591
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,345
-Saba-shabu?
-Never heard of it.

592
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:33,085
[TABI] How about Yuraku,
where you can enjoy fresh mackerel?

593
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,654
-Yuraku. Wanna try it?
-Let's go there.

594
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,389
How far is it?

595
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:41,827
[TABI] It will take
approximately 40 minutes.

596
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:46,165
[Ryohei] Then it'll be right in time
for dinner.

597
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,333
[♪ pleasant upbeat music playing]

598
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:54,373
YURAKU

599
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,508
[Ryohei exclaims] Yuraku.

600
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:58,010
Let's go in, TABI.

601
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,880
Hello.

602
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:05,017
-Hello.
-[Ryota] Thank you for having us.

603
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,818
[Ryohei] All of our energy...

604
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,221
Right here.

605
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,160
-[Ryota laughs]
-[Ryohei] Here we are.

606
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:16,328
[Ryota] Let's order.

607
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,531
There's silver saba-shabu.

608
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,066
-[Ryohei] Excuse me.
-[staff] Yes.

609
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:22,534
-Excuse me.
-Your order?

610
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:25,437
-We'd like to order saba-shabu.
-[staff] Okay.

611
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,372
Will two servings be enough for us?

612
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,440
Yes.

613
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,142
We have two types of saba-shabu.

614
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:33,946
Regular saba-shabu
is made with wild mackerel,

615
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:38,083
and silver saba-shabu
is made with farmed mackerel.

616
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,151
[Ryota exclaims]

617
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:43,188
With this tasting course,
you can try both types.

618
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,256
That sounds good.

619
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:45,591
-Wanna do that?
-Yeah.

620
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:46,892
Would you like both?

621
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,393
Yes. For two.

622
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,362
Understood.

623
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,031
-Cheers! Good work today.
-Good work.

624
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:57,603

[exhales]

626
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,473
[Ryohei] Yum!

627
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:03,041
You know...

628
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,746
I used to go on a lot of solo trips.

629
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:10,882
But I don't have time
for itineraries like this nowadays.

630
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:11,950
[Ryota] Yeah.

631
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:13,118
-For sure.
-I think...

632
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,854
this has been a good breather.

633
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:17,823
-Today.
-It has.

634
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,958
-Here you go.
-Go ahead.

635
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,593
-[Ryota exclaims]
-I see. That comes out.

636
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,862
Here is your saba-shabu pot.

637
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,899
[Ryohei] This pot has such
an interesting shape.

638

639
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:33,405

for your saba-shabu.

TASTING COURSE

641
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,742
-[Ryohei] Pretty.
-[staff] This is wild mackerel.

642
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,278
And this is farmed silver mackerel.

643
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:44,149
The wild mackerel is best enjoyed
after three or four dips in the pot.

644
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:48,420
The farmed mackerel only needs one or two.

645
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,089
We recommend enjoying it with ponzu.

646
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,891
-Ponzu sauce.
-Ponzu sauce.

647
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,594
-Let's eat!
-Let's eat!

648
00:29:56,828 --> 00:30:00,132
I'll start with the vinegared seaweed.
I eat this first nowadays.

649
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,167
-[Ryohei] For your digestion?
-Yeah.

00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,639
Awesome.

653
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:11,643
I like how you eat it.

654
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,078
I can have some?

655
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,179
[crunching]

656
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:15,247
Great.

657
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,317
So crisp.

658
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,252
Good stuff! It's so firm.

659
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,124
You're right. It is firm.

660
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,761
-Can I get a shrimp?
-Go for it.

661

-Like this...

I'll take one too.

663
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,239
All right.

664
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:45,911
-Just like that?
-Yeah.

665
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:52,284
-All right.

-It's time...
-It's ready?

669

It's one of those ones
where you do this with the onions.

670
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,866
I see.

671
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:11,269
-Yeah. Three or four times for that.
-This is wild.

672
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:13,872
-Three or four.
-Yes.

00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,343
Okay.

It is.

-Yeah.

00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,498
-The wild mackerel is more powerful.
-Yeah.

Personally, just Date and I,

700
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:48,533
-we haven't done an on-location shoot.
-Yeah.

701
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,601
So...

702
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,537
-This was a first.
-A first.

703
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,876
It's like how we are
when it's just us two on the radio.

704
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,778
-[Ryota exclaims]
-Except it's on film now.

705
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:02,047
-For sure.
-That's my impression.

706
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,216
-Yeah.
-It felt...

707
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,318
-like it went by fast.
-Yeah.

708
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,390
[TABI] Have you discovered
any new sides of each other?

709
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,093
Well...

710
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:20,298
We've been together
longer than with TABI. [laughs]

711
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,068
-But I found out...
-Yeah.

712
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,304
-...that you do solo trips.
-I see.

713
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:30,075
That you like to go around
and try the local food.

714
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,142
All sorts of stuff.

715
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:34,813
-You've done a lot. [laughs]
-[♪ pleasant guitar music playing]

716
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,516
I enjoy it.
I just haven't gotten to do it lately.

717
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,252
[Ryota] Traveling with someone

718
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:43,922
lets you see a lot about them as a person.

719
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:45,490
We naturally...

720
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,994
not in any kind of role, just naturally...

721
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:53,732
get into a good mood
and find ourselves smiling.

722
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:58,737
I think that happens because all of us

723
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,641
are fully enjoying ourselves.

724
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,444
So I really think this trip

725
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:12,150
will bring us closer as a group.

726
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,921
In five or ten years, I hope

727
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:20,625
we'll be able to look back
on how things are like now.

728
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:23,728
I've said this before,

729
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,831
but the places we're in,

730
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:31,369
where we can go, where we find ourselves.

731
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:36,975
I have a feeling
this trip will teach us about that.

732
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,378
-At a fundamental level...
-Yeah.

733
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:48,119
...it's all meant to make people smile.

734
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,022
That's why we're doing this.

735
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:54,826
-Not like we're comedians.
-Right.

736
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:56,194
How do I put it...

737
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,863
We're not like street performers.

738
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,399
-Right.
-We're different.

739
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,069
-There are many types of entertainers.
-Yes.

740
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,638
But we, as idols...

741
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,909
-We're actors at times, singers at times.
-Yeah.

742
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,445
We can do so many genres.

743
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,381
That's what I think
makes it so nice to be an idol.

744
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,449
Yeah.

745
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,152
So I hope when people see me,

746
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,822
they feel energized,

747
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,524
motivated to take on another day.

748
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:30,428
-That's my dream.
-[Ryohei chuckles]

749
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:35,000
[TABI] I had a smile on my face
all day today.

750
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,770
