00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:05,005
[TABI] Traveling with Snow Man.

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,876
-[Tatsuya] First time in Kochi?
-[Daisuke] Yes.

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,277
[Tatsuya] It's my first time too.

4
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,152
[Tatsuya] TABI, how are you?

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,355
[TABI] I am doing well! Good morning!

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,158
-Good morning, TABI.
-[TABI] Let's enjoy today.

7
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,027
-Yeah, let's have fun.
-Let's have fun.

8
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,232
[Daisuke] Nice. Mountains.

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,735
[Tatsuya] It's so full of nature.

10
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,637
-I like it.
-It's nice.

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,140
It's the best.
This is the kind of thing I'm looking for.

12
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,609
-For sure.
-This is where I want to go on off days.

13
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,177
-This is the best.
-[Tatsuya] Awesome.

14
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:48,448
[TABI] Since Sakuma said
he wanted to enjoy nature,

15
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,850
I made plans for that.

16
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,552
[Daisuke] Thank you.

17
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:52,653
-You know what?
-Yeah?

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,589
TABI is evolving
as he follows our journey.

19
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,225
-He already speaks unprompted.
-[laughing] True.

20
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,426
[Daisuke] I like it.

21
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,562
-He's one of our traveling group.
-[Tatsuya] Yeah.

22
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,297
Look, this time...

23
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,365
-His scarf is pink.
-That's my color.

24
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,800
-Yeah.
-He's taking after me.

25
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:10,237
Yeah, he is. So you can tell
his specifications are right.

26
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:15,576
-[♪ "Cry Baby" playing on radio]
-[♪ Daisuke singing along]

27
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,946
[♪ Daisuke singing loudly]

28
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:20,047
[Tatsuya chuckling]

29
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:25,652
-[♪ "Pale Blue" playing on radio]
-[♪ Daisuke singing along]

30
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,722
[Daisuke exclaims]
Nice. What a wide space.

31
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:32,025
[Tatsuya] Seriously,
isn't this area too open?

32
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,628
-[Daisuke] It's wild.
-[TABI] We have reached our destination.

33
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,666
NISHIJIMA HORTICULTURAL PARK

34
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,635
-[Daisuke] What? So cool.
-There's so much.

35
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:42,769
[Daisuke] Wow, awesome.

36
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,204
[Tatsuya] I'll eat this for sure.

37
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,707
-[Daisuke] Look, "melon tail."
-[Tatsuya] I'll eat it for sure.

38
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,075
[Daisuke] I like this.

39
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,444
-So cool.
-[Tatsuya] Yeah.

40
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,679
-[Daisuke] It's like a botanical garden.
-You think so?

41
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:53,981
[Daisuke] A bottle palm.

42
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,849
[Tatsuya] Wow.

43
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,785
-[Daisuke] Cool. So many kinds for sale.
-Let's buy some.

44
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,121
-[Daisuke] There are succulents.
-[Tatsuya] What's a succulent?

45
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,090
-[Daisuke] A fleshy plant.
-[Tatsuya] I see.

46
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:06,293
-[Daisuke exclaims]
-[Tatsuya] Awesome!

47
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,262
[seller] The freshest fruit right now
is mango.

48
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,564
[Daisuke] It smells amazing.

49
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,834
The sweet smell of mango.
In season? I guess it's summer.

50
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,403
-[Tatsuya] They're apple mangoes.
-[Daisuke] I want to eat a mango.

51
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,639
Melons.

52
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:19,706
[Tatsuya] Oh, my gosh.

53
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,541
[Daisuke exclaims]

54
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,076
-Watermelon.
-[Tatsuya] Hold on...

55
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,612
2,000 yen each?

56
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,681
-[Daisuke] Impossible in Tokyo.
-Not for that price.

57
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:28,749
[Daisuke] Absolutely not.

58
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,651
[Tatsuya] You never see that price.

59
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,853
-Here!
-This is it!

60
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:38,325
[Tatsuya] I'd like the melon tail.

61
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,127
-Two large.
-Two, please.

62
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,729
-Two large ones? Okay, coming right up.
-Yes.

63
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,032
-[Daisuke] Thanks for the treat.
-No.

64
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,800
-[Daisuke] What?
-Rock paper scissors.

65
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,569
Like always. I mean, this is a private...

66
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,304
You do always pay for me.

67
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,173
Stop it.

68
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,975
-That's not true.
-[laughs]

69
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:56,043
Whoever wins.

70
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,377
[both] Rock, paper, scissors!

71
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:58,979
-Thanks for the treat.
-Yes!

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,416
I've wanted to treat you to something.

73
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,418
-[Daisuke] Change one to small, please.
-[Tatsuya] Hey.

74
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,119
-[Daisuke laughing] Kidding.
-Don't change it.

75
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,057
[Daisuke] They look so impressive.

76
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,993
They're gonna melt.

77
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,995
-They're gonna melt.
-They're gonna melt.

78
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,131
[Daisuke] Mangos. I want one.

79
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,634
-[Tatsuya] Later.
-[man] You should have mangos too.

80
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,136
-They're really good.
-[Daisuke] You'll cut one for us?

81
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,838
-[man] Yes, we can.
-Then this, please.

82
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:25,906
-This one?
-[Daisuke] Yes.

83
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,774
-Yes. One mango, please.
-[Tatsuya] Two, please.

84
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:28,975
Two? Okay.

85
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,143
[Daisuke] Great.

86
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,013
[Tatsuya] Are you paying for those too?

87
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,848
-[Daisuke] Rock paper scissors.
-Okay.

88
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,718
[both] Rocks, paper, scissors, shoot.
Tiebreaker.

89
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,987
[Daisuke exclaims] I lost...

90
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,424
I wanted to buy it for you.
Thanks for the treat!

91
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,492
[Tatsuya] Darn it.

92
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,961
This is the mango you wanted?

93
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,664
-Yes, two.
-Two. Okay. Thank you.

94
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,737
[camera clicking]

95
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,509
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

96
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,244
-Thank you.
-They look good.

97
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,082
These look so good.

98
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,252
-Why are you eating already?
-[laughs]

99
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,422
I was hoping you wouldn't catch me eating.

100
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,656
-Too late.
-[Tatsuya] Looks good.

101
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,427
-[Daisuke] It looks so good!
-[Tatsuya] It looks really good.

102
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,329
-Time to eat.
-[table clatters]

103
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,897
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

104
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,701
The pink goes with your hair.

105
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,670
What do you think?
You won't be able to find Sakuma in here.

106
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,706
-Sure, you could.
-That was quick. [laughs]

107
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,141
Okay, time to eat.

108
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,611
-The ice cream is good!
-Isn't it?

109
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,214
Good mango!

110
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,117
It's extremely sweet.

111
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,320
[both] Yum!

112
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,323
It's so soft. Delicious.

113
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,459
It's so fresh.

114
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,097
-They could...
-Sweet.

115
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,266
[Tatsuya] They could charge
more money for this.

116
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,134
-Yeah.
-[Tatsuya] It's too cheap.

117
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,274
I mean, this is...

118
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,243
-Half a melon, right?
-Yeah.

119
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,611
About 1,500 yen, right?

120
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,548
-[Daisuke] 1,500 for half a melon is wild.
-Yeah, it even has ice cream.

121
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:15,916
-[Daisuke] Isn't that wild?
-Yeah.

122
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,753
[Tatsuya] I mean,
this ice cream on its own...

123
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,522
would normally be 400 or 500 yen.

124
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,758
-It would.
-Yeah.

125
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,728
-[Daisuke] Because at home...
-Yeah.

126
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,964
-...if you buy melon...
-Yeah.

127
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,766
-...you don't eat it like this.
-No.

128
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,268
This is such a luxurious way to eat it.

129
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:44,644
[TABI] Eating fruit under the beautiful
bougainvillea flowers is wonderful.

130
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,848
He's giving us a monologue.

131
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,282
-Awesome.
-[laughs]

132
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,985
-This one's definitely getting used.
-[laughing]

133
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,253
Well, it's true.

134
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,556
-I don't see these flowers often.
-Yeah. Bougainfleur.

135
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,792
-No, that's not it at all.
-[chuckles]

136
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,629
I want to get some exercise in.

137
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,730
Okay, I got it.

138
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,298
I'll take the car and you can run.

139
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,900
-No way.
-[laughs]

140
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,103
-Who would want to see that?
-[laughing]

141
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,738
No, that's not what I mean.

142
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,374
-Yeah.
-We're enjoying nature, right?

143
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,843
I want to enjoy nature more for sure.

144
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,278
-[Tatsuya] Right?
-Yeah.

145
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,714
TABI has a plan.

146
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:24,918
[TABI] Yes!
Let's do something Sakuma wanted.

147
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,486
Fishing.

148
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,390
-[Daisuke] I want to.
-You want to fish?

149
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,626
You know... The flowers. [chuckles]

150
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,561
-So pretty.
-I have a lot of friends...

151
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:35,862
Yeah.

152
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,265
Friends who like to go fishing.

153
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,399
You do?

154
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:42,369
So I always said
I wanted to try it, but...

155
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:46,139
Hey, TABI, what are we fishing for?

156
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:49,009
[TABI] We will be fishing ayu.

157
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,076
[Tatsuya clapping]

158
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,245
Just so you know, I love ayu.

159
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:56,616
I like ayu so much that I look for places
in Tokyo where I can eat it.

160
00:06:56,683 --> 00:07:00,987
[Tatsuya] So you really like it.
Now we can catch it ourselves.

161
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,055
Let's salt-grill it.

162
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,790
-We can salt-grill it.
-[Daisuke] Sounds great.

163
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,726
[Tatsuya] Let's do that after this.

164
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,028
-[Daisuke] Shall we go?
-Let's go.

165
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:14,901
[TABI] You two are in the fishing club
in Snow Man, correct?

166
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,537
[Daisuke] Yes. Fukazawa is the president.

167
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,638
I'm the president.

168
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:19,973
I'm the vice president.

169
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:21,574
And yet...

170
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,344
[TABI] What do you do in the fishing club?

171
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,580
-We wanted to go fishing at the beach.
-Yeah.

172
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,550
We've been talking about it.

173
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:34,020
We bought fishing gear.
Fukazawa bought it.

174
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,355
I bought it.

175
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,492
But it's been a year
and we haven't done it.

176
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,127
-Yeah.
-So today...

177
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,195
The president and...

178
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,697
[both] Vice president of fishing club...

179
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,899
-Well...
-Will show you real fishing. [chuckles]

180
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,868
[Tatsuya] Ayu.
It'll be a feeding frenzy.

181
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,104
[♪ upbeat music playing]

182
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,673
[TABI] You can see Monobe River
where we will be fishing.

183
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,875
[Tatsuya] Huh?

184
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,844
[Daisuke] Huh?
We can fish in such a big river?

185
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,613
-[Tatsuya] All right.
-[Daisuke] All right.

186
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,315
[Tatsuya] All done changing clothes.

187
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,683
[Daisuke] Fully equipped.

188
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,252
-[both] Hello.
-[fishermen] Welcome.

189
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,555
-[Daisuke] Thanks for having us.
-[Tatsuya] Thanks for today.

190
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,425
I appreciate your willingness to teach us.

191
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,361
-Thank you.
-Thank you for coming.

192
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,762
[fisherman 1]
To the fishing spot.

193
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,830
[both] All right.

194
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,866
[Tatsuya] When you're ayu fishing,

195
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,003
are there times you catch a lot
and times you can't catch any?

196
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,404
[fisherman 1] There are.

197
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,207
[Daisuke] I don't want to go home
empty-handed.

198
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,308
[Tatsuya] That would suck.

199
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,177
[fisherman 1]
Depends on how lucky you two are.

200
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,247
-[Daisuke] I see. I got this, then.
-[Tatsuya] We've got this.

201
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:35,982
Awesome.

202
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,619
How are we going to fish?

203
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,988
[fisherman 1] There's moss on these rocks

204
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,189
-that they eat.
-[Daisuke] Okay.

205
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,825
They each claim a rock as their own.

206
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:49,496
-[Tatsuya exclaims]
-Then, when another ayu comes to eat,

207
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,999
it gets angry, like, "Don't eat my moss."

208
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,768
I see. Catching ayu with ayu...

209
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,669
-[fisherman 1] When they attack.
-[Daisuke] Awesome.

210
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,205
[fisherman 3] These little guys
will be our bait.

211
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,974
-[Daisuke] Bait?
-[Tatsuya] They'll be our bait.

212
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,210
[fisherman 1] I put a nose ring on it.
It's like a nose piercing.

213
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,645
-Yes.
-[fisherman 1] And on its rear...

214
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,514
we put a needle that they'll get stuck on.

215
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,015
[Daisuke and Tatsuya exclaim]

216
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,083
[Tatsuya] Amazing.

217
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,751
[fisherman 2]
This method is unique to Japan.

218
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,720
-Nobody else fishes this way.
-I see.

219
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,388
I suppose not.

220
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,690
[Tatsuya] I thought it was hot,
but it feels all right.

221
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,225
-[fisherman 1] It's cold.
-[Daisuke] Yeah.

222
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,627
[Tatsuya] It's cold. Just right.

223
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:21,694
"Hiyaiya" in Tosa dialect.

224
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,296
-[both] Hiyaiya.
-[fisherman 1] Hiyaya.

225
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,465
-[both] It's hiyaiya!
-[fisherman 1] Exactly.

226
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:26,533
[Tatsuya] Hiyaiya.

227
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,169
It's so long! Wow.

228
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,403
[Daisuke] It's long!

229
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,704
[fisherman 2] Nine meters.

230
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,273
Hold on, it's so light!

231
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,808
-You're kidding.
-It's like...

232
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,309
A clothesline would be heavier.

233
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,311
-Yeah.
-For that reason...

234
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,847
-This is a special ayu fishing pole.
-One hand. Look.

235
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,215
-Unexpected.
-Only one hand.

236
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,650
-Oh. You're right.
-So unexpected.

237
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,186
You can hold it like this! Awesome!

238
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,555
-It's as long as Raul's legs.
-Not true.

239
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,256
[chuckling] Raul's legs are way too long.

240
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,424
-Raul's just like this.
-No.

241
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:52,525
[Daisuke laughing]

242
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,128
-[Tatsuya] Well, I'm going down.
-[Daisuke] Okay.

243
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,198
-[Tatsuya exclaims]
-[fisherman 1] Stand there.

244
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,265
[Tatsuya] Stand there?

245
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,334
-[fisherman 3] Shall I put it on?
-[Daisuke] Okay.

246
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,970
[fisherman 3]
Make it easier for them to get to it.

247
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,271
[Daisuke] You're right.

248
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,174
-It already went out on its own.
-[fisherman 3] On its own.

249
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,742
[Daisuke] Interesting.

250
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:14,013
[fisherman 3] Now we just wait for the ayu
to swim over of their own accord.

251
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,148
[Daisuke] I see.

252
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,151
Does it wiggle when one bites?

253
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,087
[fisherman 3] Sometimes a fisherman
moves the pole

254
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,189
as if to tell it to do its job. [laughs]

255
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,257
[Daisuke] I see.

256
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,660
[fisherman 3] A little bit like that.

257
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,329
Oh.

258
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,630
I felt a bump.

259
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,866
[fisherman 3] Pull it up a bit.

260
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,934
[Daisuke] It's stuck on something.

261
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,035
-Is it a bite?
-No.

262
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,871
Not a bite. Is it?

263
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,272
[Daisuke] I got a bite!

264
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,573
[Tatsuya] No way!

265
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,142
[Daisuke] It's so strong.

266
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,543
[fisherman 2] Slowly.

267
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,611
[Daisuke] Okay.

268
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,679
For now...

269
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,314
[fisherman 3] Take it slow.

270
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,483
-[fisherman 2] You have one.
-[Daisuke] It's a bite.

271
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,886
[fisherman 1] Oh, no. He beat me to it.

272
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,788
-[Daisuke] There it is!
-[Tatsuya] Already.

273
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,058
-Where?
-[fisherman 2] Lift it up again.

274
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,594
-[Daisuke] I caught one!
-[fisherman 2] Got one.

275
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,729
[laughs]

276
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,564
-[fisherman 3] You did it.
-I caught one.

277
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,199
-[Tatsuya] That was fast.
-[all clapping]

278
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,067
-[Daisuke] I got one!
-[fisherman 1 laughing]

279
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,169
So fast!

280
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,904
[fisherman 3]
I didn't think it'd be so easy.

281
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,539
-Really?
-[fisherman 2] So little effort.

282
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,073
-I have one!
-[fisherman 2] You have one.

283
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,308
Awesome.

284
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,776
[Tatsuya] Lucky you.

285
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,479
-[in English] Beginner's luck.
-[Tatsuya] Yeah, lucky.

286
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,114
[Daisuke] Wow, it's slippery.

287
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,282
I caught one!

288
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:24,918
[laughs]

289
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,153
-Awesome.
-[fisherman 2] Yes.

290
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,788
-And then...
-Yes.

291
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,089
...try smelling it.

292
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,358
[Daisuke] Ah.

293
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,194
-[fisherman 2] Not fishy-smelling, huh?
-It's not.

294
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:35,795
Amazing.

295
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,697
-I can't breathe.
-[fisherman 2] So...

296
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,299
Ayu are known as fragrant fish.

297
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,366
-Oh...
-[exclaims]

298
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,868
-[fisherman 3] It got away.
-I let it go.

299
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,504
-[fisherman 2] That was a release.
-[in English] Catch and release!

300
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:45,905
-[Tatsuya] Awesome.
-All right.

301
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,208
It was the moment...

302
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,309
You did "do your job."

303
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,011
-It bit right at that moment.
-[Daisuke] Wow.

304
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,648
[fisherman 2] Fishermen say
if one fish jumps, a hundred are below.

305
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,284
So there are a hundred
to catch here. [laughs]

306
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,128
[Tatsuya] Ah.

307
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,431
Something...

308
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,600
-[Tatsuya] Something tugged.
-[Daisuke] Yeah.

309
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,735
This is peaceful.

310
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:16,869
I like it.

311
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,086
[Tatsuya] Let's go further apart.
If there's nothing...

312
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,520
[Daisuke] Interesting.

313
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,790
[Tatsuya] I could wait
in this position forever.

314
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,394
I could stay forever if I had the time.

315
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:46,132
[Daisuke] How long
have you been working here?

316
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:49,402
[fisherman 3] I've been ayu fishing
since I was in middle school.

317
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,204
[Daisuke] Wow, awesome.

318
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,106
[fisherman 3] Roughly 15 years.

319
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:57,110
[Daisuke] 15 years.

320
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,614
Good luck.

321
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,118
[Tatsuya] So fun... Interesting.

322
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,188
[fisherman 3] The river breeze feels good.

323
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,757
[Tatsuya] It feels good.

324
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:16,996
[Daisuke] So many are jumping.

325
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,632
[Tatsuya] Are they there?

326
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,168
[Daisuke] Five more minutes!

327
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,736
[fisherman 3] Five more minutes.

328
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,605
[Tatsuya] I'll catch one for sure.

329
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,273
Let's catch one.

330
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,209
No more playing around.

331
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,380
I have a good feeling.

332
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,683
This is awesome.

333
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,985
I have it good because I can do this.

334
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,956
It's wiggling a little, but...

335
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,862
I think there's one here.

336
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,364
Can I pull it up?

337
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,799
[fisherman 1] Slowly. There it is.

338
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,034
-There it is!
-[Daisuke] It's here?

339
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:58,071
[fisherman 1] Slowly.
Bring it this way slowly.

340
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,907
-[Daisuke] Isn't it big?
-[Tatsuya] There it is!

341
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:01,974
[Daisuke] Isn't it big?

342
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,643
[fisherman 1] Take it slow.

343
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,144
[Tatsuya] It's strong!

344
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,880
[fisherman 1] Wow! You caught an eel.

345
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,515
-[Tatsuya] An eel.
-[Daisuke] An eel?

346
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,984
What do you mean?

347
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,953
[fisherman 1] An eel. That's great.

348
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,121
[Daisuke] You caught an eel?

349
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,424
-[fisherman 1] That's awesome.
-[Tatsuya] A wild-caught eel.

350
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:19,625
-For real?
-[Tatsuya] I have it.

351
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,261
I did it. Yay!

352
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,697
-[fisherman 1] A wild eel. Hold on.
-[Tatsuya] Isn't that awesome?

353
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,065
[fisherman 1] This really is great.

354
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,201
-I've been ayu fishing for 20 years.
-[Tatsuya] Yeah.

355
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,236
-[fisherman 1] I've never caught an eel.
-[Tatsuya] Wow.

356
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,537
[fisherman 1] That's very rare.

357
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,140
[Tatsuya] A wild eel, right?
That's amazing.

358
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,775
I wanna see!

359
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,077
-[Tatsuya] I caught an eel.
-[Daisuke laughs]

360
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:39,812
Look.

361
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,317
An actual eel.

362
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,785
An eel!

363
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,854
Wait, that's awesome!

364
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,658
-[Tatsuya] Hold on.
-[Daisuke] This is great.

365
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,860
[fisherman 1] Excellent.

366
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,830
[Daisuke] Awesome. So cool.
You can catch eels.

367
00:14:58,765 --> 00:14:59,766
[fisherman 1] So dramatic.

368
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,136
-[Tatsuya] Isn't that crazy?
-[Daisuke] Oh, my gosh!

369
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:04,971
It's an eel!

370
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,308
I don't think I've ever touched
a live eel.

371
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,443
So cool.

372
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:11,978
So with that...

373
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,882
We may not have caught any ayu,

374
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,017
but we can eat some.

375
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,485
-Yes!
-[Tatsuya] Let's eat.

376
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,120
Let's go back.

377
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,055
That was cool.

378
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,258
It was. But now I feel hot.

379
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,528
It was definitely cooler
when we were in the river.

380
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,629
No doubt about that.

381
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,764
[both] Thank you.

382
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,434
While you were out fishing,

383
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:37,570
-our staff prepared some ayu.
-[Daisuke laughs]

384
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,072
[Tatsuya] We didn't end up catching any.

385
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,574
[Daisuke] Yeah, only that little one.

386
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,444
-[Tatsuya] Yeah, you released it.
-[Daisuke in English] Catch and release.

387
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,446
-[in Japanese] Cheers!
-Let's eat.

388
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,483
-Yum.
-Yum.

389
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,455
-Yum.
-[fisherman 2] It smells like the river.

390
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,356
-[Tatsuya] It does.
-It smells really good.

391
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:58,925
[Tatsuya] Yum.

392
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:02,862
It's really good.

393
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,933
-So tender.
-Yum.

394
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,069
The saltiness of our sweat
makes it just right.

395
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,370
-Right?
-Yeah.

396
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,506
[Tatsuya] Yum.

397
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,610
What a nice face you have.

398
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,545
Even the organs taste good.

399
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,549
[Daisuke] Ren will be so jealous.

400
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,618
-True. He'd like this.
-[Daisuke] Yeah.

401
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,621
Thank you.

402
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,089
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

403
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,124
-We'll be back.
-[fisherman 1] Take care.

404
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,226
Thank you.

405
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:37,129
I have an ideal
for what an idol should be.

406
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,767
I think the ultimate idol is someone

407
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,570
who makes you want to support them.

408
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:45,738
I think...

409
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:49,242
the most important thing for an idol

410
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:53,179
is for everyone to think
"I'm not familiar with them,

411
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:56,415
but they seem to be working really hard.

412
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,384
They seem to be having fun.

413
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:02,522
I want to cheer for them, support them."

414
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,257
To me,

415
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,660
that's the number one trait for an idol.

416
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,397
-[TABI] Speaking of which...
-[both] Cheers.

417
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,567
[TABI] ...the bonito we had for lunch
was good too.

418
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,936
Yes. This is it.

419
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,905
-Delicious.
-[Tatsuya] No doubt, this is it.

420
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,573
I can't wait.

421
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,809
Would you like to try
straw-grilling bonito?

422
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,911
[Tatsuya exclaims]

423
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,879
-[Daisuke] You'll let us?
-[Tatsuya] I want to try.

424
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,648
-[Daisuke] Yes, please.
-[Tatsuya] We'd love to.

425
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,217
-[staff] This is the bonito.
-[Daisuke exclaims]

426
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,353
-Lift it up and put it in.
-[Daisuke] Okay.

427
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,055
[staff] As much as you like.

428
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,690
[Daisuke] As much as I like.

429
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,693
-[Daisuke] Yay!
-[Tatsuya] For real?

430
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,529
[staff] Let's make a gap to let air in.

431
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,431
The fire will come out.

432
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,499
-The fire...
-Yes.

433
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,667
-Wow, the straw!
-Wow!

434
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,602
-[staff] Set it down.
-I have to put it down.

435
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,572
Awesome!

436
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,640
[Tatsuya] Cool!

437
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,009
[staff] In order to grill it evenly,

438
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,879
lift it up and move it... Yes.

439
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,547
-And the straw...
-Okay.

440
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:02,982
[both exclaim]

441
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,685
-You keep adding more.
-It's so smoky.

442
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,520
So much straw.

443
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,023
Isn't this shot awesome too?

444
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,327
-You don't see this every day.
-[Daisuke] The shot of me watching you.

445
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,829
Can you really add that much?

446
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,297
-Won't it be hot?
-[staff] It's okay.

447
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:21,901
So professional! He touched the flames.

448
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,503
Awesome.

449
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,939
-So smoky.
-[Tatsuya] It smells amazing over here.

450
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,074
It smells so good.

451
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,643
Cool.

452
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,045
-[staff] You're great at this.
-[Daisuke] Really?

453
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,748
The straw smells amazing.

454
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,016
He says I'm great.

455
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,484
Like a great white shark?

456
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,052
-Once more.
-Oh, great at this.

457
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,253
[Daisuke chuckles]

458
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,924
Now that the skin side is grilled...

459
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,759
-That must be hot!
-[Tatsuya] For real?

460
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,361
-[staff] I'm fine.
-Amazing.

461
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,430
-[Daisuke exclaims]
-[staff] Try to grill it evenly.

462
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:56,369
[Daisuke] So cool!

463
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,771
[Tatsuya] I could never do that.

464
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,440
It looks so yummy.

465
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:06,245
-[staff] This bonito is fresh...
-[Daisuke] Yes.

466
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,781
[staff] So don't grill it too much.

467
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,316
[Daisuke] I see.

468
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,717
[staff] We grilled the skin long,

469
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,919
-but the flesh is already done enough.
-[Daisuke] It is?

470
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,121
[staff] I'll slice it for you.

471
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,956
-[Daisuke] Thank you.
-[staff] Hold on.

472
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,090
[Tatsuya] Awesome.

473
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,525
[Tatsuya] This is gonna taste great.

474
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,496
-[Daisuke] The bonito was smoked to death.
-[Tatsuya laughs]

475
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:24,830
-There it is.
-It's here.

476
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,400
-Here is your straw-grilled fish.
-[both exclaim]

477
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,168
[Daisuke] Looks delicious!

478
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:32,204
-[Tatsuya] It's so thick.
-So, Sakuma...

479
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:35,675
-We slice it thick here in Kochi.
-[Daisuke] I see.

480
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:39,111
[staff] This style, which has been
popular recently, is called salt tataki.

481
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,613
[both] It must be good.

482
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,881
Time to eat.

483
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,051
Yum!

484
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,653
[laughs]

485
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,855
So tender!

486
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,092
-You know...
-Isn't the straw scent great?

487
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,729
-[Daisuke] It totally changes the smell.
-[Tatsuya] The garlic is great.

488
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,199
-Onions will be good with this.
-[Daisuke] Yeah.

489
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:03,135
Check out how thick it is.

490
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,303
[Tatsuya] It's really thick.

491
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,371
[Daisuke] Time to try it.

492
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,073
Mmm.

493
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,475
[laughs]

494
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,277
No doubt about it.

495
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,012
-Delicious.
-Delicious.

496
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,147
Yum.

497
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,419
It's so good.

498
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,189
-Thank you for your patience.
-Thank you.

499
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,057
-Here's your Shamo hot pot.
-[Daisuke] Okay.

500
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,726
-[staff] Excuse me.
-[Tatsuya] Thank you.

501
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,662
[Daisuke] It looks delicious!

502
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,863
PUREBRED SHAMO HOT POT

503
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,164
It smells so good.

504
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,800
-It looks really good.
-Oh my gosh.

505
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,769
[both exclaim excitedly]

506
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,304
[both] It's Shamo chicken.

507
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,340
-[Daisuke] I don't think I've ever had it.
-[Tatsuya] Shamo.

508
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,411
[both exclaim]

509
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:46,479
That hits the spot.

510
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:47,847
So flavorful.

511
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,749
-That hits the spot.
-This is good.

512
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,755
-[Tatsuya] What do you think?
-That's good!

513
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,857
[Tatsuya] It warms me up.

514
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,426
Shamo is really high-quality meat.

515
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,095
-Isn't it firm?
-[Daisuke] Yeah.

516
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,467
-Amazing.
-[Tatsuya] It's chewy in a good way.

517
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:09,869
[Daisuke] It also smells great.

518
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,837
The vegetables are good too.

519
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,207
[Daisuke] Yum.

520
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,476
-This kind of...
-Yeah.

521
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,645
-Excuse me.
-No worries.

522
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,914
-[staff] Here's white trevally...
-[Daisuke exclaims]

523
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,517
[staff] And eggs
flavored with bonito broth.

524
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,118
[Tatsuya] I want to eat that.

525
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:28,554
-[staff] Is here okay? Excuse me.
-[Tatsuya] Yes.

526
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,457
You always order eggs.
I have so many memories of that.

527
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,592
Yeah. Absolutely.

528
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,061
I'm going for the trevally.

529
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,196
The trevally is good.

530
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,498
-I love trevally.
-I love trevally.

531
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,934
-It's so good. Time to try it.
-It is good.

532
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:44,603
[chuckles]

533
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,071
What do you think?

534
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,941
-Is it good?
-It's amazing.

535
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:51,110
-[Tatsuya] Really?
-This stuff is amazing.

536
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,278
The eggs are great.

537
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,148
-Where'd you put the soy sauce?
-Here you go.

538
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:57,883
This is awesome.

539
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,488
Isn't it amazing?

540
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:03,923
[Tatsuya] The flesh is so firm.

541
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,325
-It's so compact.
-[Daisuke] Yeah.

542
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,295
-It's really good. I'm shocked.
-[Tatsuya] Yum.

543
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,462
It hurts.

544
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,731
-[laughs]
-Delicious.

545
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,234
-It's so good it hurts.
-No, no.

546
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,802
Turn that frown upside down.

547
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:17,970
Okay, sorry.

548
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,505
It tastes so good it hurts.

549
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,740
Isn't this so cool?

550
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,509
This is great.

551
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,881
After just five years as Snow Man,
we get to film purely fun stuff like this?

552
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:30,516
[Tatsuya] That's the amazing part.

553
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,718
[Daisuke] Before we debuted,

554
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,021
people told me, really,

555
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,724
"You're not going to become big."

556
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:44,897
We've always been fighting
an uphill battle.

557
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:50,135
Despite that, all of us
believed we were idols

558
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,206
and kept on running from the bottom,

559
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:57,710
wanting to take the idol world by storm.

560
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,846
And in the last five years,

561
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,783
it's paid off in all kinds of ways

562
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,587
so that we can now say to those people,
"What do you think of us now?"

563
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:11,056
at the five-year mark.

564
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:15,060
[Tatsuya] Hey, TABI.
Where are we going next?

565
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,831
[TABI] Let's go to KOHANYU.

566
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,200
KOHANYU! [mimicking TABI]

567
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:23,836
[TABI] It seems to have
a lovely hot spring.

568
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,038
-There we go.
-Perfect.

569
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:28,607
[Tatsuya] It's so mountainous.

570
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:30,109
[Daisuke] So mountainous already.

571
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,344
Nice!

572
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,445
What a nice view.

573
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,848
Take a picture.

574
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,651
-[Tatsuya] Of me?
-[Daisuke] Okay.

575
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,619
[Tatsuya] Isn't this so nice?

576
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:44,556
-In the mountains.
-[phone camera clicking]

577
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,694
-[Daisuke] This is it!
-[Tatsuya] Oh, my gosh.

578
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,029
[Daisuke] This is it!

579
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,633
This view is awesome.

580
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,369
[exclaims]

581
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,272
[Tatsuya] Ooh.

582
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,842
-[Daisuke] What a huge mountain.
-[Tatsuya] Ooh.

583
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,613
-[Daisuke] Awesome.
-[Tatsuya] I like the clouds right now.

584
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,747
For sure.

585
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,916
[Daisuke] Awesome.

586
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:17,189
[Tatsuya] This view in front of us
is all green.

587
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,659
-There are no buildings around anymore.
-[Daisuke] You're right.

588
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,663
I hardly ever drive
around places like this anymore.

589
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,434
Well, you don't have a driver's license.

590
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,069
That's right.

591
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,570
I don't have a license.

592
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:33,672
You don't have a license.

593
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,310
[Tatsuya] Is there something here?

594
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,613
[Daisuke] It's a bridge.

595
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,515
[exclaims]

596
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,553
This kind of bridge is awesome!

597
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,857
-So cool.
-[Tatsuya] Awesome.

598
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:54,760
-[TABI] We will arrive shortly.
-Really?

599
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,730
So KOHANYU is here.

600
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,231
-The one he mentioned.
-Yeah.

601
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,834
-[TABI] We have arrived.
-Huh?

602
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,969
-Where?
-[TABI] Good job driving.

603
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,037
[Daisuke] Thank you.

604
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:07,740
We're here.

605
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,341
[Tatsuya] We're here?

606
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,810
-Actually, there's a smell...
-I know.

607
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,179
[Tatsuya] Isn't it like a hot spring?

608
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,915
[Daisuke] What is this place?

609
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,519
There's moss already.

610
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:23,288
-It's like a different world.
-[Tatsuya] What is this?

611
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:27,126
-[Daisuke] We're in a different world now.
-[Tatsuya] Cool.

612
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,394
[Daisuke] Look at that.

613
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,263
[Tatsuya] Here?

614
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,966
-[landlady] Hi there.
-[Daisuke] Hi there.

615
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,235
-Here. Hello.
-[clerk] Welcome.

616
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,837
-[landlady] Welcome. Thank you for coming.
-[Tatsuya] Thank you.

617
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,906
-[Daisuke] Thank you.
-[Tatsuya] Awesome.

618
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,675
-What is this place?
-[Daisuke] The atmosphere is so...

619
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,310
-What is this?
-A hotel.

620
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,578
-[Daisuke] It's a hotel?
-It is?

621
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,813
-[Daisuke] I see.
-Yes.

622
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,281
[Tatsuya] It smells good too.

623
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,517
-[clerk] Right this way, please.
-[Daisuke] May I?

624
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,786
[Daisuke exclaiming]

625
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,989
-[Tatsuya] It's totally like...
-[Daisuke] Oh my gosh!

626
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,223
[clerk] Have a seat over there.

627
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,559
-[Daisuke exclaiming]
-[Tatsuya] Oh my gosh!

628
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,163
This is awesome!

629
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,866
-[Daisuke] Isn't this amazing?
-[Tatsuya] Wow!

630
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:12,638
Awesome!

631
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:15,874
[landlady] A turtle.

632
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:16,975
A turtle.

633
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,043
[Daisuke] A turtle!

634
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,780
[Tatsuya] I didn't bring my phone.
Send it to me later. [chuckles]

635
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,248
[Daisuke] It's going away.

636
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,118
[Tatsuya] Awesome. That's so cool.

637
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,753
This is great.

638
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,421
[Daisuke] All right.

639
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,190
[Tatsuya] Doesn't it look great
by the horizon?

640
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,324
[Daisuke] Yeah.

641
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:34,426
Amazing.

642
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:38,864
[Tatsuya] The trees are above...
It's like a mysterious picture.

643
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,267
I don't know if it's
because of the tree cover.

644
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,671
[Daisuke] This place is amazing.

645
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,906
[staff] Excuse me.

646
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,375
-Here are your complimentary drinks.
-[Tatsuya] Thank you.

647
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:54,313
[staff] This is a house-made yuzu drink.

648
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:57,116
And here in Kochi, we serve
salted sweet potato fries.

649
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,151
-[Daisuke] Salted?
-[staff] Yes. Please try some.

650
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,385
[both] Thank you.

651
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,820
-Good work.
-You too.

652
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,192
[both] Good stuff! [laughing]

653
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,028
Yum!

654
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,464
-[landlady] I'm glad you like it.
-It's really good.

655
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,266
[landlady] Thank you.

656
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,605
[Tatsuya] These are good too.

657
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,673
Ah.

658
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,543
They're not sticky
like candied sweet potatoes.

659
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,611
They're not.

660
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,280
-Salted sweet potatoes.
-Delicious.

661
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,481
Amazing.

662
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,484
What is the concept of this hotel?

663
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,420
[landlady] Here,

664
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,122
-if you look at our sign...
-Yes.

665
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,191
...it's a musical symbol called a natural,

666
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:42,861
which means to return
to what a note was originally.

667
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,831
When you're exhausted from work,
you can come here,

668
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:48,267
take your time in the hot springs,

669
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,236
and soak in the soft music
and natural scenery

670
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:52,938
during your stay.

671
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,874
For your stomach,
you can enjoy the vegetables I grow here

672
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:58,143
-in our pesticide-free field.
-[both exclaim]

673
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,112
-You grow vegetables?
-[landlady] Yes, I do.

674
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,682
-And we use zero additives in our dishes.
-[Tatsuya exclaims]

675
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:07,719
[landlady] So this was created
to be a place

676
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:10,589
where you can completely
reset your tired body.

677
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,525
-Please relax today.
-[Tatsuya] Okay.

678
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:14,760
[Daisuke] Thank you.

679
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:15,861
[Tatsuya] I'll take a nap.

680
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:17,796
This is a real digital detox.

681
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:18,864
[Daisuke] Yeah.

682
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:23,101
Maybe we should leave TABI behind
if it's a digital detox.

683
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,772
-[TABI] Please don't leave me.
-[laughs] Sorry.

684
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,041
We won't leave you.

685
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,342
[Tatsuya] That's right.

686
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,880
-[landlady] I'll show you to your room.
-[Tatsuya] All right.

687
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,417
-[Daisuke] Is this a banana tree?
-[landlady] A Japanese banana plant.

688
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,419
-[Daisuke] Japanese banana?
-[Tatsuya] Rice fish?

689
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,855
[landlady] Not rice fish.
These are called stone moroko.

690
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,524
[Daisuke] There are tiny fish.

691
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,594
[landlady] This is a biotope.

692
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,995
-[Daisuke exclaims]
-[Tatsuya] I see.

693
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,897
[landlady] So we have many kinds... Look!

694
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,466
-[Daisuke] A dragonfly!
-[Tatsuya] You're right!

695
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,534
[landlady] A damselfly.

696
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,269
-[Tatsuya] It's so big.
-[Daisuke] A damselfly.

697
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,671
-I like this.
-[Tatsuya] Awesome.

698
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,407
-[landlady] We get a lot of fireflies.
-[Daisuke] Yes.

699
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,943
-Fireflies? Is it that time of year?
-[Tatsuya] Wow!

700
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:11,483
From the end of May to mid-June,
this area is covered with them.

701
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,952
When you're in the hot spring,

702
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,887
you'll see them flying around.

703
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:17,723
[both exclaim]

704
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,658
[Tatsuya] This is so nice.

705
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,861
[landlady] This is the Western room
you will be staying in today.

706
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,296
-Western.
-[Daisuke exclaims]

707
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,265
-Excuse me.
-[landlady] Yes.

708
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,332
[Daisuke] What?

709
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,201
[landlady] Enter on the right.

710
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,903
[Daisuke] Wait, bell cricket sounds?

711
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,272
[Tatsuya] Cricket sounds?

712
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,508
-[Daisuke] And it smells so good.
-It smells good.

713
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:41,146
-Wow, what is this?
-[Daisuke] This is awesome!

714
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,814
[Tatsuya] It's nothing like
I had imagined.

715
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,549
Look! Awesome!

716
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,884
Oh, my gosh!

717
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,787
Awesome!

718
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:52,090
[Daisuke] What is this place?

719
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,925
[landlady] I'm glad you seem to like it.

720
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,495
-[Daisuke] Awesome.
-[Tatsuya] This is great.

721
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,863
[Daisuke] Is this a speaker?

722
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:58,930
[landlady] It is.

723
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,832
[Daisuke exclaims softly]

724
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,402
This is really great.

725
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,903
[Tatsuya] It smells so good.

726
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,806
[landlady] This is a floating seat.

727
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:10,609
-[Daisuke] It really is!
-[Tatsuya] Whoa!

728
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:12,077
[Daisuke] A floating sofa!

729
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,280
[Tatsuya exclaims]

730
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:18,016
This is the best!

731
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,084
Oh.

732
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,320
[landlady] Now, you can exit this way.

733
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,322
[Tatsuya] Don't sit down.
Let's go outside.

734
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,489
[Daisuke laughs]

735
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,325
Tatami.

736
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,426
[Tatsuya exclaims]

737
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:28,994
Wait.

738
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:31,196
[exclaims]

739
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:33,265
Awesome!

740
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,668
[Daisuke] It'll be great to wake up
to this view.

741
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:39,838
[landlady] The water is cloudy now
due to the rain last week,

742
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,540
-but it's usually green.
-[Tatsuya] Oh.

743
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,675
-It rained all last week.
-[Tatsuya] Makes sense.

744
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:45,610
-It's a bath!
-That's right.

745
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,746
[landlady] With free-flowing water
from the hot springs.

746
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:50,082
-[Daisuke] Leaking water?
-[Tatsuya] Free-flowing.

747
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:51,883
[Daisuke exclaims]

748
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,186
-Seriously, what the heck?
-[Tatsuya] This is amazing.

749
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:59,424
[landlady] We let it flow here
directly from the source.

750
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,060
It's the freshest water.

751
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:03,895
[Daisuke] Isn't this great?

752
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:06,398
-[Tatsuya] It's the best. Here, right?
-[landlady] Yes.

753
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,502
-You've gotta do that every time.
-[landlady laughs]

754
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:11,937
Every time.

755
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,906
-I get it. How's the bed?
-When you do that...

756
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:18,110
Look this way. Here.

757
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,480
-You see the window frame?
-[Tatsuya] Oh.

758
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,515
[landlady] It's all sky from there.

759
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,550
-[Tatsuya] I see.
-[landlady] The starry sky.

760
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,520
-[Daisuke] Amazing.
-[landlady] Nothing but the starry sky.

761
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,489
[Tatsuya exclaims]

762
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,424
-Okay.
-[landlady] This is great.

763
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,426
Let's forget about work for now.

764
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:37,028
[landlady] Good idea. [chuckles]

765
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,030
[Daisuke] This is fun.

766
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:46,071
We've never had the chance
to come here before.

767
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:49,207
Simply put, the food is good,

768
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,711
and the scenery is beautiful.

769
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,012
It's a lot of fun.

770
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,349
It's nothing but good things.

771
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,317
I'm glad I got to know this place.

772
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:05,056
I hope more people learn
about Japan through Snow Man.

773
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:10,195
And there are many places in Japan
I've never been to and don't know about,

774
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,997
so I hope people from Japan

775
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,499
will also learn a lot
about Japan's attractions.

776
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,503
[both] All right.

777
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,338
[laughs] Nice.

778
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,873
Awesome!

779
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,444
-[Daisuke] Epic.
-[Tatsuya] I like the color.

780
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,279
-[Daisuke] Wanna wash up?
-[Tatsuya] Sure.

781
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,047
Come on.

782
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,217
[sighs]

783
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,621
This feels good.

784
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,024
[sighing]

785
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:40,592
This is the best!

786
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,628
So this is the leaking water.

787
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,798
It's not leaking.
That would be bad, right?

788
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:50,368
-[Tatsuya sighs] This feels good.
-Very nice.

789
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,237
Wait a minute.

790
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:57,008
-It has that hot spring smell.
-You're right.

791
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:58,877
This is nice.

792
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:15,293
But I'm sure the viewers of this trip
will think it's just normal work.

793
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,929
-True.
-They must think so.

794
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,731
But it's not like that.

795
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,134
It's constant off-day energy.

796
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,637
-True.
-Like when we're on break together.

797
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:26,705
[Tatsuya] For sure.

798
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,108
We're not working in the slightest.

799
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,778
It actually makes me nervous.
Like, am I doing enough?

800
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:35,847
Yeah.

801
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,717
Isn't this temperature just right?

802
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,652
-We can soak for a long time.
-Yeah.

803
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:45,223
[Tatsuya] And we get to look at this.
This is too luxurious.

804
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,992
[Daisuke] Isn't this place great?

805
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,567
[TABI] Did you enjoy your day?

806
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,303
-[Tatsuya] I did.
-[Daisuke] I really enjoyed it.

807
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,539
Simply a fun-filled day.

808
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:01,640
For real.

809
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:04,509
Ayu fishing was great.

810
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:06,344
It was too much fun.

811
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:10,215
[Daisuke] And the hot pot
at the first place was good too.

812
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:11,283
-Shamo.
-Shamo.

813
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,153
-The bonito was amazing.
-The bonito was good.

814
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,588
[Tatsuya] The bonito was really good.

815
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:19,624
-[Daisuke] Kochi is the best.
-[Tatsuya] Yeah.

816
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:22,561
And then there's the melon tail.

817
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,162
[Tatsuya] That was awesome.

818
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,430
Too cheap.

819
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,999
[Daisuke] Too cheap. We ate so much.

820
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,603
We ate, ate, fished, and ate.

821
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,272
-Then here. Yeah.
-[Daisuke] Bathed.

822
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,340
It's the best.

823
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:39,578
Can we have this much luxury?

824
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,981
I never knew one day could be so full.

825
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:48,753
This is it. This is how
I want to spend my days off.

826
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,021
[Tatsuya] That's right.

827
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:53,692
-Is my training paying off? Does it show?
-[Daisuke] Nope.

828
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,363
-Show in what way?
-My pecs...

829
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,698
I don't see anything.

830
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,499
No, look at my pecs. They're big.

831
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,269
[sighs]

832
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,304
This feels great!

833
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,976
[TABI] What do you think
of the hot spring?

834
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,445
-[Tatsuya] It feels great.
-[Daisuke] Awesome!

835
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:15,680
[Tatsuya] I could go to sleep.

836
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,849
-[Daisuke] It's too perfect.
-[Tatsuya] I know.

837
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,988
[Daisuke] It's the best.

838
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,695
TABI, I'm doing a digital detox right now.

839
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,199
[TABI] Isn't that impossible?

840
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,434
[both laugh]

841
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,770
