00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,005
<i>Traveling with Snow Man.</i>

2
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:13,647
Well...

3
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,817
I see a castle.

4
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,891
Thanks for waiting!

5
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,192
Did you wait long?

6
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:28,495
- Hot day today.
- What are you doing here?

7
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:31,999
Sorry, I got here early. You're early too.

8
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,901
- Where is this?
- Shizuoka.

9
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,669
- It's Shizuoka!
- Shizuoka.

10
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,204
I came here wearing a blindfold.

11
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,940
What kind of game show is that?

12
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,577
Let's head over to Hamamatsu Castle.
We can see the top.

13
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,979
- Isn't that parasol small?
- You finally noticed?

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,047
Yeah.

15
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,448
Want under?

16
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,517
You don't mind? Okay. Let's go.

17
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:52,653
Let's go to Hamamatsu Castle.

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,126
- It's burning hot.
- It really is burning hot.

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,595
Have you been here?

20
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,130
- Here?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,898
- It's my first time.
- First time?

22
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,601
- You haven't either.
- No.

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,139
I looked into the history
of Hamamatsu Castle.

24
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,041
- You did? Really?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,143
Studied... Yeah, I got it.

26
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,244
TABI!

27
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:19,413
I get you. For sure.

28
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,748
- TABI?
- TABI.

29
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,617
<i>- </i><i>Yes.</i>
- Good morning.

30
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,152
It's been a while.

31
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:30,157
<i>Raul, Mukai, let's have</i>
<i>another lovely traveling day.</i>

32
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,794
- Yes, let's.
I'm counting on you.

33
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:39,199
Tell me something about Hamamatsu Castle.

34
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:46,506
<i>Hamamatsu Castle was built</i>
<i>by Tokugawa Ieyasu in his youth.</i>

35
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,709
- Ieyasu!
Ieyasu?

36
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:53,680
<i>He established it as his base</i>
<i>at age 29 and remained for 17 years.</i>

37
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:57,084
- 17 years starting at 29?
Wow.

38
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,453
- All right.
- Let's go.

39
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,122
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

40
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,359
It's so hot.

41
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,227
It's a hot day.

42
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,765
Nice.

43
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:14,735
- Wanna see Ieyasu?
- Let's look.

44
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,237
And it says "in his youth."

45
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,842
- Doesn't his face look old?
- He's getting up there.

46
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,745
Since he moved in at 29.

47
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,547
- Wanna take a pic?
- Sure.

48
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:28,982
I'll take it.

49
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,120
All right. Say "Ieyasu."

50
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,755
Okay.

51
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,190
- One for you?
- Sure.

52
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,628
I'm better at photography than I look.

53
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,631
All right. Ieyasu.

54
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,068
- Ieyasu.
- Suyaie.

55
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,437
- Nice.
- Yay.

56
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,674
It captured the contrails too.

57
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,308
- Clouds?
- Very nice.

58
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,711
I bet we can get good pics up there too.

59
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,312
This feels nice.

60
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,515
- It's very refreshing to me.
- It's nice.

61
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,683
- Good.
- Yeah.

62
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,485
Refresh yourself today.

63
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,888
- No, let's both do it.
- Yeah.

64
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:15,262
"This is a valuable portion that
remains original for about 400 years..."

65
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,097
So this is untouched.

66
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,199
- It's the same.
- Awesome.

67
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,669
- This is all original.
- It hasn't been repaired even once?

68
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,838
- All original.
- That's amazing.

69
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,444
- Ain't it this way?
- Ain't it.

70
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,212
- Go ahead.
- Awesome.

71
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,147
Go ahead.

72
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,852
- Going up. Are you ready?
- Let's go.

73
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,320
Yeah, I'll be fine.

74
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,927
I see.

75
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,863
You know...

76
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,365
- This is exciting.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,737
I mean, the town...

78
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,706
- What's this?
- A helmet.

79
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,344
- It's compact.
- Ieyasu was tiny.

80
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:11,451
<i>Because this is where Ieyasu</i>
<i>gathered strength to unify the nation,</i>

81
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,421
<i>it is also known as the Promotion Castle.</i>

82
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,125
- I like that.
- Nice.

83
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,963
- This feels nice.
- This is nice.

84
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,301
<i>Would you like to shout something</i>
<i>from this Promotion Castle?</i>

85
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,871
Shout something?

86
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,139
Is there anything...

87
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,876
- you'd like to shout here?
- There is.

88
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,179
I'm gonna be loud.

89
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:43,283
True.
Just no heavy bass sounds, please.

90
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,820
My canker sore hurts!

91
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,622
What, a canker sore?

92
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,125
- Your canker sore hurts right now.
- It hurts.

93
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,927
That's not something to shout here.

94
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,196
- But when I shouted...
- Yeah.

95
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,132
- My mouth moved and made it hurt again.
- Yeah.

96
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,734
Should we hold off on meals?

97
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,102
No, as long as it's soft.

98
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,870
- Soft food?
- It doesn't have to be.

99
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,273
I hope your canker sore gets better. Tsk.

100
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,407
It's getting there.

101
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,042
- It is? Is it okay?
- Yeah.

102
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:12,445
I've had a huge one
for about a week.

103
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,314
Shouting here will cure it.

104
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:24,357
It's a car to match your height, Raul.

105
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,660
Okay. Leave it to me, then.

106
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,229
Wait, driving? Can you do that?

107
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,533
Sorry. I forgot my license today.

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,768
You don't have it.

109
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,269
- You never do.
- Sorry.

110
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,838
You, Date, and Fukka never do.

111
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:38,905
I'll leave it to you.

112
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,608
Okay?

113
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,143
So cool!

114
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,312
Raul.

115
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,614
Can we ask TABI?

116
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,482
Okay then.

117
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,019
- Somewhere you can savor Shizuoka tea...
- Yeah.

118
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,322
Like a cafe.

119
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,257
Yeah.

120
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:58,558
- Like that?
- Yeah.

121
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,993
- You want that?
- I want it.

122
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,061
How about it?

123
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,998
<i>About 10 minutes from here</i>

124
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:08,969
<i>is a place called Kanegonn.</i>
<i>Would you like to visit?</i>

125
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:10,770
Kanegonn?

126
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,074
- I've never been.
- Sounds good. Thanks!

127
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,876
Let's be on our way!

128
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,511
- This really is roomy.
- It is.

129
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,483
Bye-bye.

130
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,754
About 10 minutes?

131
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,723
- 10 minutes.
- 10 minutes.

132
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,493
- I'm already used to your driving.
- Has it been a while?

133
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,729
Hasn't it been a while
since you rode with me?

134
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,698
When was the last time? On YouTube?

135
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,067
YouTube. Not since
high school outside work.

136
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,638
Because we drink on personal times
these days.

137
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,640
Yeah, so... Right.

138
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,943
- So we take taxis.
- I prefer taxis lately so I can drink.

139
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,448
Actually, I don't really drink
with the other guys.

140
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,217
- No?
- Mostly just you.

141
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,351
They don't drink much.

142
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,354
- I don't out for drinks with them.
- Yeah.

143
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,990
- Date either.
- Shota doesn't.

144
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,258
He doesn't drink much.

145
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,195
A while back, Shoppi... We went to sushi.

146
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,264
- You guys drank?
- He did.

147
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,099
Fukka doesn't drink much either.

148
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,468
He doesn't. They all don't.

149
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,804
- Doesn't Abe drink?
- Abe drinks?

150
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:21,408
I haven't hung out with Abe
outside of work yet.

151
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,476
- You haven't?
- Not for a long time.

152
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,846
- Not as adults.
- I see.

153
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,982
Actually, after work... Want more air?

154
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,850
No, this is good.

155
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:37,057
Shizuoka is known for tea.
What else?

156
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,025
- Gyoza.
- Eel.

157
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,193
Right. Eel.

158
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,896
- And Tokugawa Ieyasu.
- Who we just saw.

159
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,432
- Conquering all.
- Lake Hamana.

160
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,267
- Yes, Lake Hamana.
- Yeah.

161
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:52,205
I love how much greenery there is.

162
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:56,176
- So this is Shizuoka.
- Yeah.

163
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,179
I like it.

164
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,613
- It's really nice.
- Yeah.

165
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,317
Why did I come to Shizuoka before?
Was it outside work?

166
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,485
Camping?

167
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,922
There are camping grounds.

168
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,891
Right, there are. You can see Mount Fuji.

169
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:19,632
<i>I didn't discover the new side</i>
<i>of him through traveling, to be honest.</i>

170
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,136
Like how slow he puts on the brakes,

171
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,771
I already know.

172
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,139


173
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,508
I know him that well.

174
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,143
But even still,

175
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,247
sometimes we do photoshoots for magazines

176
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,517
with every possible combination.

177
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:41,588
I think all of those are interesting.

178
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,692
So I can totally do eight different
one-on-one trips.

179
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,063
- We're here!
- Kanegonn!

180
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,299
- I love the atmosphere.
- Isn't this so cool?

181
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,336
I want shaved ice.

182
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,838
- Welcome. Hello.
Hello.

183
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,707
- Pardon us.
Welcome.

184
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,977
- Takeout too.
- "Kanegonn's special ice!"

185
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:05,812
It has soft serve.

186
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,913
Kanegonn's Special Ice

187
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,181
I see.

188
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,050
And tea powder.

189
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,719
- Can we add toppings?
- Yes, you can.

190
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,789
Then I'll have the special ice.

191
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:16,956
Special ice. Okay.

192
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,192
With red bean paste on top.

193
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,462
What else would you recommend?

194
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,099
- The regular matcha shaved ice.
- Okay.

195
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,734
- The regular.
- It's very good.

196
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,103
- It has matcha syrup.
- Maybe I'll get that.

197
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,738
- The syrup kind.
- Yes.

198
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,073
And add <i>shiratama </i>to that.

199
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,908
- Matcha ice with <i>shiratama</i>.
- Yes.

200
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,144
- I'd also like matcha ice cream.
- Okay.

201
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,514
- Don't take it out.
- What?

202
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,216
- Stop.
- Are you ready to pay?

203
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,617
It's okay.

204
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,486
I've brought my wallet today.

205
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,356
- Yeah...
- Is that okay? Thank you.

206
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,593
We don't go to shops like this
in Tokyo often.

207
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,228
- We don't.
- Right.

208
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,097
So spacious.

209
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,465
- Excuse me.
- A mirror.

210
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,433
- That looks good!
- It does!

211
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,135
Here is your iced matcha.

212
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,403
That looks good.

213
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,672
- Awesome!
- Hey! Hold on!

214
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:07,874
Time to enjoy.

215
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,143
- Let's go for it.
- Cheers.

216
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,178
- Hold on.
- I'm the senior.

217
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,781
- Right. Sorry.
- Step back.

218
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,950
This is good.

219
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,151
I'm gonna try it.

220
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,787
Good matcha.

221
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,256
This is good matcha.

222
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,926
- Good. I like it.
- It's good.

223
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,762
This matcha tastes so traditional...

224
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,031
- But drinking it from this glass...
- I get it.

225
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,967
Can we take these with us?

226
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,302
It's good. It's sweet.

227
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,570
Isn't it good?

228
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,640
- It's so good.
- I can't stand it.

229
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,642
It's so good I can't stand it.

230
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:43,743
Look out.

231
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,844
That was fast!

232
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,412
- That's mine.
- Yes.

233
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,281
Thank you for waiting.

234
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,783
- There it is. Thank you.
- It's huge!

235
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,053
It's awesome how we're
surrounded by green today.

236
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,155
You're right.

237
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,990
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

238
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,792
- Your special ice.
- Wonderful.

239
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,427
It does look special.

240
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,863
- There's soft serve inside.
- I see.

241
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,565
It's inside.

242
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,534
Awesome.

243
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,205
Closer.

244
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,207
Like that.

245
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,809
Okay. Eat up.

246
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:18,811
Thank you.

247
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,079
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

248
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,283
It's hard not to mess this up.

249
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,119
Fluffy!

250
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,687
Amazing!

251
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,323
- It's actually really fluffy.
- It's tasty.

252
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,694
Yum!

253
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,897
Everyone should eat this!

254
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,366
For real.

255
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,635
- It's so good!
- Was shaved ice always so good?

256
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,804
- Isn't the flavor strong?
- Amazing!

257
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,940
Wait, it's special inside.

258
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,509
Eat it.

259
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,010
- I'm not Abe, but...
- Okay.

260
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,179
- Can I have a bite?
- Sure. Go for it.

261
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,514
- Like this?
- Yeah.

262
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,717
This is the best.
I'll take a bit of this too.

263
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,725
- Yum.
- It's good.

264
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,828
They must use
high-quality water, too.

265
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:10,897
Yum!

266
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,670
<i>When did you two become friends?</i>

267
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,640
Just recently. Yesterday.

268
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,009
Yesterday, for real.

269
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,246
Recently, though...

270
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,681
- Yeah.
- We've been talking more.

271
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,416
- You're right.
- Yeah.

272
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,852
I'm really happy about that.

273
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:40,960
<i>What were your first impressions</i>
<i>of each other?</i>

274
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,963
- I'm so curious.
- Me too.

275
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,867
My impression? I guess
people say you're really tall.

276
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,769
But you weren't much taller back then.

277
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,839
- Yeah. We're almost the same.
- Just about the same.

278
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,809
You really seemed...

279
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:00,179
like a cute guy.

280
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,382
- With your puffed-up cheeks.
- Mm.

281
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,684
You were "Rau-chan."

282
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,486
- Cutesy?
- Yeah, cute.

283
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,720
A cute side?

284
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,323
You had a cute side. But not anymore.

285
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,092
What was that?

286
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,994
- Okay, you're still cute.
- Yeah.

287
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,864
- You were cuter back then.
- Watch your mouth.

288
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,566
My impression...

289
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,939
- You're from Kansai, right?
- Yeah.

290
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,575
I'd never talked to a Kansai guy.

291
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,611
That makes sense.

292
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,113
- True.
- So to me...

293
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,548
You were my first Kansai guy.

294
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,983
I see.

295
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,485
I talk too much at first.

296
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,622
It was nice.

297
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,856
- Really?
- Yeah.

298
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,794
<i>You're lucky</i>
<i>to meet such nice friends.</i>

299
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:53,232
We were nobodies at first.

300
00:13:54,233 --> 00:14:00,039
But then the grown-ups around us

301
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:04,877
and our seniors' fans supported us.

302
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:09,549
Their continual support is how we're able
to stand on the stage we do now.

303
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,686
So I've always had respect for that.

304
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:16,556
Basically, I feel indebted to them

305
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:21,127
for the opportunity to have this platform
even though I'm nobody.

306
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,597
So I want to fulfill their needs.

307
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,100
<i>Those are my thoughts.</i>

308
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,003
TABI always asks questions like that.

309
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,842
He was quite reserved
in front of all nine of us,

310
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,211
but in smaller groups...

311
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,445
TABI pries into us.

312
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,581
- Recently...
- He's one of those people.

313
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,216
Yeah. We had a fight.

314
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,419
TABI and I had a fight the other day.

315
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,855
He wouldn't shut up.

316
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,257
TABI.

317
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:52,959
<i>What is it?</i>

318
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,360
Let's get along today.

319
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,130
<i>We have always gotten along.</i>

320
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,564


321
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,433
The tone is the same.

322
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,535
Because he's AI.

323
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,506
- I feel bad for him.
- You should bully him.

324
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,708
You should bully TABI.

325
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:09,842
Thanks for the food.

326
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,244
- That was good food.
- Yes.

327
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,213
Where to next, TABI?

328
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:19,685
<i>Lunchtime is coming up, isn't it?</i>

329
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,091
- A Hamamatsu classic.
- Hamamatsu gyoza.

330
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,793
Right, TABI? We're eating here?

331
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,694
<i>Yes.</i>

332
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,266
<i>This is Fukumitsu, a restaurant</i>
<i>so popular that people line up to get in.</i>

333
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,771
- It's Fukumitsu.
- Everyone knows Fukumitsu.

334
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,440
Hello.

335
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,643
The height!

336
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,511
- Excuse me.
- Like this.

337
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,013
Do this.

338
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,248
All right.

339
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,121
- Nice and cool.
- Excuse me.

340
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,659
- So gyoza...
- Yeah.

341
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,794
- They have lots of flavors.
- Sure.

342
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,496
Which do you like?

343
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:06,999
- I make gyoza at home sometimes.
- Oh.

344
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,201
- Add my own stuff.
- Yeah.

345
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,570
- What do you add?
- My favorite kind...

346
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,805
- I like crunchy gyoza.
- Yeah.

347
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,107
- But also soft gyoza.
- Yes.

348
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,543
- The ones at the store.
- The steamed ones?

349
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,846
The store-bought gyoza
that you just pan fry.

350
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,915
- I really like those.
- Those are nice.

351
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:24,851
You cook, right?

352
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,720
- Yeah. I make gyoza too.
- You do?

353
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:30,990
- There it is!
- Really?

354
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,658
Thank you.

355
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,861
- The kimchi is Raul's.
- The kimchi.

356
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,630
- Awesome!
- That's the small size?

357
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,932
- So crispy.
- Thank you.

358
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,835
- It's so crispy.
- Thank you.

359
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,804
- It's all hard.
- Awesome.

360
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,573
- Like Teru-nii's muscles.
- Okay, here.

361
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,775
- Okay.
- What is this?

362
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,777
I make two types of dipping sauce.

363
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,546
- Right.
- Vinegar...

364
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,348
And this.

365
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,450
- Pepper?
- Pepper.

366
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,118
I actually...

367
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,621
- Pepper?
- No, this.

368
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,422
- Chili oil.
- Yeah.

369
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,092
Soy sauce and chili oil.

370
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,161
What?

371
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,366
Having kimchi at this hour makes me happy.

372
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,936
- You can choose kimchi or pickles.
- I love kimchi.

373
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:19,205
- Time to eat.
- Let's eat.

374
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,707
It's so crispy.

375
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,311
This is gonna be great.

376
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,214
It really is crispy.

377
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,622
- Yum!
- How is it?

378
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,993
It's just been cooked.

379
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,095
Freshly cooked.

380
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,964
- Fish cooked?
- Fresh.

381
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,532
- Fresh.
- Fish?

382
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,733
Fresh!

383
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,403
It's hot!

384
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,338
Grilled fish?

385
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,240
No! It's freshly cooked!

386
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,575
- Freshly cooked.
- Yes.

387
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,009
Then I'd better get to it.

388
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,779
- Time to eat.
- Yeah.

389
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,054
- Isn't it good?
- Yum!

390
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,358
The colors are so simple,
but it has a solid flavor.

391
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,694
What is this?

392
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:16,796
It's good!

393
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,403
<i>These gyoza are known</i>
<i>for their outer texture</i>

394
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,973
<i>and generous cabbage filling.</i>

395
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,576
<i>You can eat them guilt-free.</i>

396
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,644
Yeah.

397
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,113
I see.

398
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,549
Even a person on a diet can eat them.

399
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,851
It's true. They're full of cabbage.

400
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,853
Gyoza are healthy, right?

401
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,189
- They're well-balanced.
- Balanced, yeah.

402
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,625
Last one.

403
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,994
- You know...
- Yeah.

404
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,596
- I thought there was a lot at first.
- Right.

405
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,199
- But they went down fast.
- Yeah.

406
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,835
I bet the viewers want gyoza now.

407
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,881
- Those are the best.
- The best.

408
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,987
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>to move your bodies now?</i>

409
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,590
What do you mean by that?

410
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,461
<i>Let's go to Lake Hamana.</i>

411
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,498
-
What? Lake Hamana?

412
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,467
Work out at Lake Hamana?

413
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,568
All right.

414
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,537
- Good meal.
- Good meal.

415
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,139
That was great.

416
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,041
Let's go.

417
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,145
- I'll pay. Go ahead of me.
- Thank you.

418
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,881
Can we leave TABI?

419
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,318
<i>Please take me with you.</i>

420
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,421
- Let's go. When TABI is around...

421
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,389
- He gives us orders.
- Hold on.

422
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,224
Let's leave him.

423
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,626
- Bye.
- Bye.

424
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,366
Just kidding.
You're coming with us.

425
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,672
- Come on.
- Let's get going.

426
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,941
Let's go!

427
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,077
- This will be fun.
- I'm excited.

428
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,180
- Here we go.
- What activities await us?

429
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,415
Exactly. Let's go!

430
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,686
- You could nap.
- By the way...

431
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,155
I'm not taking a nap.

432
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,824
- Of course.
- I'm not napping.

433
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,159
- While your senior drives.
- I'll just check...

434
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,496
How far the seat can tilt back.

435
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,764
For sure.

436
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,366
- That's important.
- But I'm not napping.

437
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,868
Where do I tilt it?

438
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,303
There it is.

439
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,839
You found it?

440
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,741
You can't do that.

441
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,509
Sorry, but you can't.

442
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,411
- Good night!
- Not allowed.

443
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,381
I might actually fall asleep.

444
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,152
You should sleep, so I can
talk to TABI about you.

445
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,588
What are you talking about?

446
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,157
So, Shizuoka...

447
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,226
No, it's Sawayaka, right?

448
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,727
- It's Sawayaka.
- Sawayaka.

449
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,297
- Sawayaka!
- There's Sawayaka.

450
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,333
- Here?
- There are a lot.

451
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,135
- There are?
- It's a chain.

452
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,070
I want to go!

453
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,205
Wait, let's take a picture.
Of Sawayaka?

454
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,673


455
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,943
SAWAYAKA

456
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,179
People are lined up.

457
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,081
Popular as ever.

458
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:23,549
Awesome.

459
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:29,688
Look!

460
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,424
Isn't that Lake Hamana?

461
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,694
<i>Lake Hamana is in view.</i>

462
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,264
It's Lake Hamana!

463
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,834
That looks fun.

464
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:44,303
Cool. Isn't that Palpal?

465
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,706
Apparently,
Hokuto does commercials for it.

466
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,542
- He does?
- Yeah, apparently.

467
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,145
I've been here with my brother.

468
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,849
We're here!

469
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,489
How cute.

470
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,690
Let's go.

471
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,260
- Actually...
- Yes?

472
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,431
I tried to ride on that parachute thing
with that boat today.

473
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,532
You did?

474
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,467
- So we got changed.
- Yeah.

475
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,269
But the wind was too strong.

476
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,771
So, it's changed to this.

477
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,841
- So in these outfits...
- Yes.

478
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:24,410
- We'll ride that?
- Yes, we will.

479
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,978
We didn't have to change.

480
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:28,047
Maybe I'll just dive in then.

481
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,216
Sure. I won't stop you.

482
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,118
- Excuse me.
- Due to your height...

483
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,222
I might get seasick.

484
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:41,794
Is this good?

485
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,868
I've only seen these in anime.

486
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,805
- Wanna get going? Okay.
- Let's change directions.

487
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,808
- Take care.
- I'll be fine.

488
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,243
Thank you.

489
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,677
- Let's row.
- Thank you.

490
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,346
- Let's go.
- Okay.

491
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,850
This is connected.

492
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,852
- Is it moving?
- It's...

493
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,921
- Can I row hard?
- Sure.

494
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:11,457
- One, two, one...
- Two.

495
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,228
It's not moving.
It's pretty slow.

496
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,734
Should we turn the wheel?

497
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,035
There are waves today.

498
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,938
You know...

499
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,908
- I'm not dressed for this.
- True.

500
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,677
I wanted to do the parachute today.

501
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,379
The waves are strong.

502
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,680
Awesome.

503
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,148
Can you feel them?

504
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,816
Stop rowing.

505
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,686
- This is bad.
- Hold on. Careful.

506
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,722
This looks bad. We should turn this way.

507
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,393
Where are we going?
Won't it be hard to get back?

508
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,896
- We'll have to swim back.
- That'd be faster.

509
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,665
Look, we're drifting.

510
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:54,867
This is hard work.

511
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,804
Watch out!

512
00:23:58,871 --> 00:23:59,872
Watch out!

513
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,473
- Watch out!
- Watch out!

514
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,610
- What are you doing?
- The waves!

515
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,879
- There was a wave!
- Be careful!

516
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:08,614
We're gonna argue.

517
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,182
Let's go.

518
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:12,318
- Let's work together.
- It's easier that way.

519
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,954
Working together makes things easier.

520
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,189
Now play "Ready Go Round".

521
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:20,826
How does it go?

522
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,514
What's next after Nessie? Messie?

523
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,249
- For sure.
- I'm still full.

524
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,852
- Messie will be waiting tonight.
- Messie's waiting.

525
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:55,260
<i>Hot pot has been prepared</i>
<i>to refuel you post-exercise.</i>

526
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,297
Look at this!

527
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,965
Awesome!

528
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,267
Shizuoka <i>oden </i>is a must-have.

529
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,204
- Shizuoka <i>oden</i>.
- Shizuoka <i>oden</i>.

530
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,672
It's ready for us.

531
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:08,974
- It looks really good.
- Yes.

532
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,143
- Since this trip has one more theme.
What?

533
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,311
Hot pot.

534
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:13,512
That's right.

535
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,281
SHIZUOKA ODEN

536
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:20,486
<i>Oden </i>in summer is counterintuitive.

537
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,987
It's a winter food.

538
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,356
So we're flipping it around.

539
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,760
Oden <i>in the middle of summer</i>
<i>is good too.</i>

540
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,661
- TABI.
He's right.

541
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,630
TABI's timing.

542
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,799
This is so exciting.

543
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,034
- Let's do cheers.
- Cheers!

544
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,970
- TABI, cheers!
- Do it with us, TABI! Cheers!

545
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:39,805
<i>Cheers.</i>

546
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,011
What a nice house.

547
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,447
It is a nice house.

548
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:49,815
All right.

549
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,450
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

550
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:54,953
I like the cucumbers. And the tomatoes.

551
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,922
Cool way of slicing them. Is that rice?

552
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,824
- Miso?
- Miso. I'll try it.

553
00:25:58,891 --> 00:25:59,958
Tomatoes.

554
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,861
- Trying the tomato.
- That's a big tomato.

555
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:05,597
It looks good.

556
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,368
Nice expression.

557
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,471
Mm. It's good.

558
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:14,440
You like it?

559
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,242
It's as big as a billiard ball.

560
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,144
This? It is big.

561
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,016
Be careful.

562
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:27,920
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

563
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,489
Next, the cucumbers.

564
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,595
The tomato juice is great.

565
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,198
Yum!

566
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:41,633
- So fresh.
- Yeah.

567
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,606
Since we have this,

568
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:50,909
let's turn it on low.

569
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,146
What do you eat first in <i>oden</i>?

570
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,681
Tough question.

571
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,617
I'll go for the beef sinew.

572
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,554
- You want the broth?
- Give me some.

573
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:06,892
- You know...
- Yeah.

574
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:10,095
Maybe because this is Shizuoka <i>oden</i>...

575
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,931
- it smells different.
- For sure. It does.

576
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,199
The broth looks good too.

577
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:17,402
- Nice.
- Yeah.

578
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,106
I'll take konjac.

579
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,207
You like konjac best?

580
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,609
No, radishes.

581
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,676
Okay.

582
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,479
I see why you'd start with konjac.

583
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,817
The flavor is really macerated into it.

584
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,352
- It is? Look!
- Yeah.

585
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,255
- Wow! That's a chunk of beef.
- That's beef sinew?

586
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,624
It's beef. The kind you'd have in curry.

587
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:40,792
Time to dig in.

588
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,365
Mm.

589
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,068
What's the broth made from?

590
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:57,109
<i>Shizuoka </i>oden <i>uses broth</i>
<i>made from beef sinew.</i>

591
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,645
It does?

592
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,047
I see.

593
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:09,621
<i>It is characterized by its</i>
<i>dark broth and the use of skewers.</i>

594
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:15,027
<i>You can also change the flavor</i>
<i>with dashi powder.</i>

595
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:17,729
This?
This.

596
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,366
- Not yet? Is it too soon?
- Yeah, not yet.

597
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:26,104
It's true. I don't usually see
skewers in <i>oden</i>.

598
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,940
Only at carts, right?

599
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:31,076
- You're right.
- Yeah.

600
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,745
Now that I think about it.

601
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:36,215
- Beef sinew...
- I've seen it, though.

602
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:40,285
- But everything being skewered...
- For sure.

603
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:41,587
I'm not used to it.

604
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:49,695
That's good.

605
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,033
The day is already over.

606
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,169
- It's been a good day.
- Yeah.

607
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:03,342
<i>How do you see</i>
<i>each other's current activities?</i>

608
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,745
- True...
- Wild.

609
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:08,981
How do I explain...

610
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:13,085
Do you mind if I talk to TABI?

611
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,554
- Instead of you?
- Sure.

612
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:21,026
The first thing that comes to mind

613
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:26,932
is that I think it's so impressive

614
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:33,505
that someone born and raised in Japan
would try to succeed in another country.

615
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,476
It must be difficult.

616
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,646
The languages and cultures are different.

617
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:45,317
- And when you're immersed there...
- Yeah.

618
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:50,589
The food, the living spaces,
everything is different.

619
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:52,758
And...

620
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,628
he does TV and movies too.

621
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,698
- I think...
- Right. I'm doing a movie now.

622
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:01,733
That's amazing.

623
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,202
- Thanks, Raul.
- It's true.

624
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:11,677
We're all trying to expand our horizons
to keep up with the times.

625
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:16,348
Not just acting,
but modeling and voiceover.

626
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:19,918
We're smoothly moving
in nine different directions.

627
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:26,458
So when I go to different workplaces...

628
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:30,629
Like, when I go to an acting job,
I want to take acting seriously,

629
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,732
so I get into that mindset.

630
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:38,804
And when I go to a modeling job,
I want to take modeling seriously,

631
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,871
so I go all in.

632
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,074
If even part of me believes

633
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:45,844
it's for the best

634
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,716
for everyone in the group...

635
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:52,884
- Right.
- I'll push forward.

636
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,486
Of course...

637
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,722
I believe in all of us.

638
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,223
- And in myself.
- Right.

639
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:03,929
And Raul is the first one in the group
to take a job overseas.

640
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,230
- As a model.
- Overseas.

641
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:08,166
- So... are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

642
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,969
You have many talents.

643
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,971
- I see many sides of him.
- No, I'm clumsy.

644
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,908
It was cool how you made a business card

645
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,511
- to work overseas.
- Yeah.

646
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,316
This is good.

647
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,988
I respect that. It's rare that you can
respect someone younger than you.

648
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:33,658
You flatter me.

649
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:40,866
<i>Let's enjoy</i>
<i>this summer vacation evening.</i>

650
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,237
It's the best time of the year for this.

651
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:47,706
Fireworks?

652
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,009
Well, it's a secret.

653
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,644
- I'll find out?
- Yeah.

654
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:53,979
So it's possible.

655
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,548
It's possible. Depends on the weather.

656
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,452
<i>Preparations are complete.</i>

657
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,557
- I got Shizuoka fireworks.
- Okay.

658
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,159
Let's do this.

659
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,694
- Can we go for it?
- Wanna try one?

660
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,396
- We have many.
- Let's do one.

661
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:12,931
Let's go. Ready, go!

662
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:14,699
Is it catching?

663
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,768
It's on. Here you go.

664
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:21,773
Cool!

665
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,211
- I don't see that often.
- It's so red.

666
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,015
Nice. What's that dance?

667
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,420
Raul.

668
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,190
- I wrote "Raul."
- That's what it was?

669
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,125
- The photo thing.
- I'll do it too.

670
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:45,730
- There won't be enough.
- I'm done writing.

671
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,166
Two letters?

672
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:49,701
Only two letters?

673
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:50,836
You could tell?

674
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,003
- Two, right?
- Yeah.

675
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:53,839
What was it?

676
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,808
- "Travel?"
- You wrote "Raul," right?

677
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,643
Koji?

678
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,046
- Uh... I wrote "Meme."
- Meme?

679
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:05,283
I saw you doing the curved lines.
Why "Meme"?

680
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,152
The energy of that retort.

681
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:08,253
I'm impressed.

682
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,322
- Why "Meme"?
- It turned black!

683
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,591
- Meme?
- It's black. "Kuro." Like Meguro.

684
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:13,992
Thank you, Meme.

685
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,062
- This is fun.
- Why "Meme"?

686
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,197
Fun.

687
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,337
It changes colors!

688
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,541
Green. It's Abe.

689
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,676
- Abe!
- Another one.

690
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,481
Blue. Shoppi.

691
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,592
- That looks long.
- Now pink! Sakuma!

692
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:55,767
Again! It's so bright.

693
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,068
I wanna do a rocket.

694
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:59,671
- Me too.
- A rocket would be fun.

695
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,241
Sparklers are...

696
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,445
Sorry, that's the bell.

697
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:09,614
- Gotta go.
- Where?

698
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:13,218
When the clock hits seven, my magic fades.

699
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:15,320
What are you gonna do?

700
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:18,857
It's a good time.

701
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,126
- Weird to hear a bell at seven.
- Yeah.

702
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,966
Wanna finish with a one-on-one?

703
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,803
- A test of luck?
- Yeah. A competition.

704
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,406
Okay. Ready, go!

705
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,542
I'm good with sparklers.

706
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,048
It fell off.

707
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:45,317
- There. Take it slow.
- Here...

708
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,620
Mine isn't going.

709
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,556
Okay.

710
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,659
Nice. Good.

711
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,632
- That's good.
- No good?

712
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:04,135
- Does this take skill?
- It does.

713
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:08,306
It actually does. Nice picture.

714
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,042
Look. It's a nice picture.

715
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,114
Good picture.

716
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,222
- Cool.
- So adolescent.

717
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,524
It makes me feel young.

718
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,260
Nice.

719
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:31,696
- Let's travel together again.
- Yeah.

720
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,100
<i>Let's travel together again, guys.</i>
