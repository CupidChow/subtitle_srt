00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,005
[TABI] Traveling with Snow Man.

2
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:13,847
[yawns loudly]

3
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,817
[♪ humming "7％" by Hikaru Iwamoto]

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,321
Teru-nii is late.

5
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,200
Over here!

6
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:34,801
You went too far!

7
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,839
-Good morning.
-I've been waiting for you.

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,308
You went past me, dummy.

9
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,243
I was looking for a four-leaf clover.

10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,413
[Koji] Don't look for four-leaf clovers.

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,648
[Hikaru] What?

12
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,983
-[Koji] The sky cleared up.
-[Hikaru] That's funny.

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,319
It's sunny. I thought you attracted rain.

14
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,588
[Hikaru] It was raining until just now.

15
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,290
-Did you bring the talisman?
-Ah.

16
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,395
I brought it from home
like I was supposed to.

17
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,763
We'll do a lot today.

18
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,300
Where are we going? I have no idea.

19
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,969
-I got this. I'll talk to TABI.
-Really?

20
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:11,338
It's nice to hang out with just us two.

21
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,774
It was kind of hectic
with nine of us before.

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,576
-[Hikaru] In Okinawa?
-[Koji] In Okinawa.

23
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,578
We can talk about that in the car.

24
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,745
Oh my.

25
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,848
-Let's go.
-We're going.

26
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,317
[Hikaru] Do you have your license?

27
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,418
Of course.

28
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:28,255
That's weird.
It was supposed to rain a bit.

29
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:33,026
I was planning to say
"Whose fault is this?" in the downpour.

30
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,428
[Koji] It's your fault, Teru-nii.

31
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,297
Nice car.
It's got a Fukuoka license number!

32
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,466
[Hikaru] Let's go.

33
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,468
Wow.

34
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,273
Good morning, TABI.

35
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,042
[TABI] Good morning.

36
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,280
I'm in Fukuoka with Koji.

37
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:57,217
Please tell me your first
recommended place for us to go.

38
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:03,423
[TABI] Okay. How about Meoto-iwa
in Sakurai Futamigaura?

39
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,791
The Married Couple Rocks.

40
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,159
[Koji] Lead the way, TABI.

41
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:10,163
[TABI] Please use NABI for directions.

42
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,231
[Koji] What, you can't?

43
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,432
That's NABI?

44
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,235
NABI, not TABI.

45
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,605
So you have nine scarf colors, TABI?

46
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,774
[TABI] One for each member.

47
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,042
-[Hikaru] Okay.
-[Koji] Yes.

48
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,211
I want this snowman.

49
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,014
I'm always drawn to snowmen.

50
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,349
In games, I always play
as a snowman if I can.

51
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,417
-[Hikaru] You do?
-Yeah.

52
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,287
[Koji] Where are we going today?
How many places?

53
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,157
[TABI] Look forward to it!

54
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,392
Is that so?

55
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,827
So you can have fun.

56
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,097
[Koji] It's been two days
since the stadium, though.

57
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:45,932
Yesterday off?

58
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,467
-Yeah.
-What did you do?

59
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,736
I worked out yesterday.

60
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,205
-Good for you, after the stadium.
-I could say...

61
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,373
I did some training.

62
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,442
Wow. Do you go to the gym?

63
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,310
[Hikaru] I go to the gym sometimes.

64
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,548
Sometimes I run outside
if it isn't raining.

65
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:02,716
[Koji] That's amazing.

66
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,552
I mean, we're outside
at stadiums and concerts.

67
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,755
So we have to get used to moving outdoors.

68
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,190
Yeah, that's for sure.

69
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,994
All the guys acted like it was so hot,
but it wasn't hot to me.

70
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,729
Yeah, Thailand was hotter.

71
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,165
[Hikaru] Yeah, well, compared to that.

72
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,735
All day, in 102-degree weather,

73
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:25,639
we did a beach volleyball shoot.

74
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,441
Well, compared to that...

75
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,276
Compared to that!

76
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,379
[TABI] You can see the ocean
on your right.

77
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,880
-[Koji] Yes.
-[Hikaru] Amazing.

78
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,551
Yeah, the ocean was really pretty
in Okinawa.

79
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,152
[Hikaru] I don't come this way much.

80
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,023
When I think of Fukuoka,
I don't think of going to the beach.

81
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,091
[Koji] You're right.

82
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,760
-[Hikaru] Is that...
-Isn't that Meoto-iwa?

83
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,595
This is it, right?

84
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,863
[Hikaru] So loud.

85
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,132
[Koji] If you see this,
you get eternal love!

86
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,735
[Hikaru] TABI.

87
00:03:55,469 --> 00:04:01,374
Tell us about
the Married Couple Rocks in Itoshima.

88
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:05,078
[TABI] These rocks are known as
a power spot for marital harmony

89
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:09,883
because they resemble a happy couple
tied together with a rope.

90
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,651
[Koji] Marital harmony, you say?

91
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,153
[Hikaru] Don't smack my butt.

92
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,221
Wow, there's a gate!

93
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,456
[Koji] A gate!
Let's take a picture with it.

94
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,825
[Hikaru] It's so pretty.

95
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,528
[Koji] It's nice up here too.

96
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,031
Here, how about this?

97
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,100
Meoto Iwamoto.

98
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,304
That's good.

99
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,075
[Hikaru] How's that?

100
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,244
-No, take a cuter picture.
-[Hikaru chuckles]

101
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,512
[Koji] Of my face.

102
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,947
[Hikaru chuckles] That's not me.
You're the issue.

103
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,217
[Koji] This is good.

104
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,020
[yelps, exclaims]

105
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,690
Just like Ninja Warrior.

106
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,426
-[Hikaru] Nice.
-[Koji chuckles]

107
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,963
-That was a cute jump.
-A cringey jump. [chuckles]

108
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,900
-A very cute jump.
-A cringey jump.

109
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,871
[Koji] There are a lot of tourists.
Many from abroad.

110
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:08,842
Take a pic, Teru-nii!

111
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,678
[Hikaru] Here I go. Nice!

112
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,482
[Koji] What about you?

113
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,654
Taking a selfie? Okay.

114
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,026
[Hikaru] That was really nice, TABI.

115
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,995
[TABI] I'm glad you enjoyed it.

116
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,096
[Hikaru] Right, Koji?

117
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,565
[Koji] That was fun, TABI.

118
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,269
[Hikaru] I'm getting hungry.

119
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,771
[TABI] Would you like lunch?

120
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:38,839
Lunch.

121
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,473
I'd like to go to lunch.

122
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:44,244
[TABI] Let's go
to the Nishiura fishing port,

123
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,546
which is about 10 minutes away by car.

124
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,248
[Koji] What do they serve?

125
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,317
[TABI] You can eat
delicious seafood there.

126
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,418
[Koji] Seafood.

127
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,886
-[Hikaru] Do you like it?
-[Koji] Yes.

128
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:55,889
[TABI] I recommend a restaurant
called Kazura.

129
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,091
Seafood is good. It's healthy.

130
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,593
My dinner was just chicken.

131
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,696
You said that. [chuckles]
You eat that before concerts too, right?

132
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,897
[Koji] Yeah, even for concerts.

133
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,066
-I think it was Shota...
-Sakkun.

134
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,169
He said to you,
"Let's take off our shirts!"

135
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,738
And you said, "I don't have
the body for that." [chuckles]

136
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,174
It'd be best to get the body for it.

137
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,142
But we don't strip for concerts.

138
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,679
I was done with the drama,
so I was drinking beer.

139
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,949
Cute. Pink.

140
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,587
[Hikaru] This is cool.
It's almost like we're overseas.

141
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,389
[Koji] Lots of photogenic places.

142
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,092
[Hikaru] Yeah, these would make good pics.

143
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,159
[Koji] Yes.

144
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,429
Aren't we close?

145
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,432
-The open space... Is this it?
-Wow.

146
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,035
-[Koji] That's it. Kazura.
-[Hikaru] So stylish.

147
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,570
[Koji] This is awesome.

148
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:44,971
Nice.

149
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,473
We're here. Thank you!

150
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,540
[Hikaru] All right.

151
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,011
TABI will stay with me.

152
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,078
[Koji] Should I take TABI?

153
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,115
It was sprinkling a bit.

154
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,050
I like it that it's not crowded.

155
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,453
-This has such a nice atmosphere.
-Kazura.

156
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,657
Hello.

157
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,228
-[Hikaru] This is so nice.
-[Koji] Wanna order?

158
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,596
-Excuse me.
-[server] Yes.

159
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,431
[Hikaru] What'll you get?

160
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,333
-Here you go. Hello.
-[Koji] Thank you.

161
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,168
-Hello.
-[server] Hello.

162
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,304
Mixed fried...

163
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,571
-[server] Mixed fried set.
-Yes.

164
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:19,873
[Koji] You went for fried?

165
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,809
Fried is good, but I'm on a bit of a diet.

166
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,844
I think I'll go for grilled.

167
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,546
-I'll have the mackerel.
-[Hikaru] Oh.

168
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,847
-[server] Mackerel.
-Mackerel.

169
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,483
All right. I'll bring them right away.
Excuse me.

170
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,353
[Koji] You can get rice and miso soup
over there.

171
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,888
-[Hikaru] Over there?
-[Koji] Yes.

172
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,491
I'm starting to get hungry.

173
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,827
Yeah. [sighs]

174
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,362
Isn't this nice?

175
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:43,897
A hidden gem.

176
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,833
[TABI] I have a question for you.

177
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,536
Did you join your agency at the same time?

178
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:53,907
Yes, but Koji was in Kansai,
at Kansai Junior,

179
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,476
and I was in Tokyo.

180
00:07:56,543 --> 00:08:00,313
So it's been 19 years.
But Koji joined a week after me.

181
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,717
Yeah. We did join
at basically the same time, though.

182
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,786
Teru-nii is just
hung up on that one week, TABI.

183
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,022
19 years. Isn't that crazy?

184
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,523
[Koji] 19 already?

185
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,525
This week.
We joined Johnny's in 2006.

186
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,461
[Koji] 19 years already?

187
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,330
Next year is 2026,
so it'll have been 20 years.

188
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,498
[Koji] Frightening.

189
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,266
Oh.

190
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,602
I didn't realize it had been so long.

191
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,306
And now it's Snow Man's fifth anniversary.

192
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,010
I'd like to make it to 19 years

193
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,978
as a part of Snow Man.

194
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:35,682
We've been doing stadium performances
until recently,

195
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:39,719
but to be honest, I don't think all of us
are satisfied with the status quo.

196
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,356
I think we want to go

197
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,493
as far as we can make it.

198
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,128
Here it is.

199
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,497
[server] Thank you for waiting.
Your mixed fried set.

200
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,564
-[Koji] That's him.
-Okay.

201
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,467
-That looks good.
-[server] Here you are.

202
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,669
The side dishes look good too.

203
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,939
The fish is a mix
of monkfish and tuskfish.

204
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,341
[Hikaru] Thank you.

205
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,577
And the sashimi here is
yellowtail shashimi.

206
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,446
-Shashimi?
-[laughter]

207
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,348
-It's shashimi?
-Sashimi.

208
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,417
-Yellowtail shashimi.
-Shashimi, I see.

209
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,985
-Excuse me.
-I'm sorry. Thank you.

210
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,920
This fried fish is crazy.

211
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,055
That was cute.

212
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,356
It's shashimi.

213
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,991
[server] Thank you for waiting.

214
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,160
-Your mackerel set.
-Thank you.

215
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,328
[Hikaru] That looks good too.
There's mentaiko.

216
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,696
[server] Yes, mentaiko.

217
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,466
That building with the orange roof
is a mentaiko factory.

218
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,168
[Koji] Is it? It's mentaiko-colored.

219
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,235
[server] Sunset Mentai.

220
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,670
-[Hikaru] Sunset Mentai.
-[server] Yes.

221
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,805
What sashimi is this?

222
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,640
This is yellowtail sa-- shashimi.

223
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,475
-Shashimi, yes. Thank you.
-Enjoy.

224
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:36,743
-Time to eat.
-Thank you.

225
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,578
[Koji] Let's eat.

226
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,214
Wow, this looks good.

227
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,021
This is good miso soup.

228
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,693
Eating at a place like this...

229
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,795
-Yes.
-The fish...

230
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,098
-It's bound to be good.
-It is.

231
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,699
More so with the ocean view.

232
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:03,837
[gags]

233
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,207
-Is it good?
-Delicious.

234
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,878
[Koji] Here. This.
I love mackerel stomach.

235
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,083
[Hikaru exclaims]

236
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:19,752
Yum.

237
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,256
-[server] You can ask for more rice.
-[Koji] Yes, thank you.

238
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,327
[Hikaru] This is bliss.

239
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,495
[Koji] Yeah.

240
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,463
[Hikaru] Delicious.

241
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,898
It's really good.

242
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,510
I'll get more rice.

243
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,644
[Koji] That was fast.

244
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,280
I'm impressed.

245
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:50,016
-Fill it high. Thanks.
-[server] Okay. I'll bring it over.

246
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,718
[Hikaru] Come on.

247
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,353
[Koji] What?

248
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,589
I'm scared of bones.

249
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,391
-[Hikaru] Hmm?
-I don't like them.

250
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,828
-They're sharp.
-Yeah.

251
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,364
All right.

252
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,007
-That was fast.
-Good meal.

253
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,378
Ah, I'm full now.

254
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,314
But mackerel is healthy.

255
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,423
[exhales] This is it!

256
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,059
[TABI] Is your hunger satisfied?

257
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,794
[Koji] I'm stuffed, TABI.

258
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,765
[TABI] There is a beach nearby
that you could play at.

259
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,033
Would you like to go?

260
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,736
-No, I'm not ready to move yet.
-[Hikaru chuckles]

261
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,572
[TABI] Would you not like to go?

262
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:47,774
Hang in there, TABI!

263
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,178
We just ate. We need time to digest.

264
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,316
[TABI] Would you not like
to visit a beach?

265
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,117
Go! Hang in there!

266
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,688
[TABI] I will go to the beach.

267
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,022
It says it's going.

268
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,824
-[Hikaru] See you.
-See you.

269
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,327
-Later.
-[Hikaru] We'll wait here.

270
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,063
[TABI] Let's go together.

271
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,332
[Koji] Okay. Let's go.

272
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:14,968
Bye-bye.

273
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,038
-Take care!
-Bye-bye. Thank you.

274
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,608
I'll come again.

275
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,546
That mackerel was good.

276
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:27,647
[Hikaru] Yeah.

277
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,217
I thought I had tomorrow off, but I don't.

278
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,952
Tomorrow will be tough.

279
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,221
[Koji] It'll be tough dancing
early in the morning.

280
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:41,527
[♪ singing "SERIOUS" by Snow Man]

281
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,034
We haven't done a costume fitting.

282
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,102
No.

283
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,939
[TABI] We will be arriving soon.

284
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,875
-[Hikaru] Over here.
-[Koji] Very nice.

285
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,176
What is this place?

286
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,480
I wanna do this.

287
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,248
[Hikaru] This is awesome.

288
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,183
-[Koji] You wanna do this?
-[Hikaru] We can, right?

289
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,256
[Koji] "We are not responsible
for injuries sustained during play."

290
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,092
You like this?

291
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,628
I haven't done this since grade school.

292
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,463
This is pretty scary.

293
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,200
-Let's go on "ready, go."
-What do I do?

294
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,935
Get on this.

295
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,538
-[Hikaru] And then what?
-[Koji] Just get on and slide.

296
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:28,074
On ready, go!

297
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,444
I'm scared!

298
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,414
[both shouting]

299
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,616
-This is crazy!
-Thrilling!

300
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,084
[Hikaru grunts]

301
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,754
This isn't for first-timers. Seriously.

302
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,189
That was scary.

303
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:44,957
[Koji] It was thrilling.

304
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,826
It gets really high at the end.

305
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:48,895
I'll shoot on slow-mo.

306
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,298
Okay.

307
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,502
[Hikaru exclaims]

308
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,737
[Koji] You're not gonna jump?

309
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,806
Then I'll shoot.

310
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,974
I'll do it there. This is too high.

311
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,309
[Hikaru] Do it over here.

312
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,478
That was scary.

313
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,680
Here, take this.

314
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,753
[Koji] I'm gonna get serious.

315
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,457
Don't try this at home, kids!

316
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,360
Only if you've had special training.

317
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,695
I think this one is...

318
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:24,897
easier to jump from.

319
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,700
-Here I go.
-[Hikaru] Go ahead.

320
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,003
Whoo!

321
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,171
Wow!

322
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,307
-[Hikaru chuckles]
-All right!

323
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,876
[Koji] This is it.

324
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,614
[TABI] Mukai has had special training.

325
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,417
Do not attempt this at home.

326
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,623
Let's sit down for a second.
It's still a bit wet.

327
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,758
I'll push you.

328
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:52,825
Let's sit together.

329
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,528
That looks nice.

330
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,097
[chuckling]

331
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,999
Your hair is full of sand, though.

332
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,100
That's fine.

333
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,705
People usually come here
as a couple, right?

334
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,241
Woo-hoo!

335
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,510
-What do you think?
-It's fun.

336
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,211
Swings are fun.

337
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,083
[chuckles] Awesome, awesome.

338
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:19,952
That's awesome.

339
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,789
-Come a little closer.
-[chuckling] What are you doing?

340
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:26,192
[Koji] Wait, wait. Hold on.
The people on the bus saw.

341
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,895
Two more steps. Yes, right there!

342
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,197
-Watch out! Don't move!
-[chuckling]

343
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,932
-[Hikaru] What do you want?
-Push it again.

344
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,301
Two steps ahead. Yes, exactly there.

345
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,403
-Don't move. [chuckling]
-I'm scared.

346
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,706
-No! Here...
-What?

347
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,041
[Koji] I did this kind of thing.

348
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,143
[Hikaru] But the swing comes
all the way here.

349
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,246
-[Koji] Wanna go there?
-[Hikaru] Let's go.

350
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,182
[Koji] It's pretty scary.

351
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,318
-Can we make it to the tip?
-[Hikaru] How far?

352
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:58,090
THE MIRACLE DRIFTWOOD

353
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:05,798
I think I can make it.

354
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,636
I think so, but I'm scared.

355
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,306
-[Hikaru] This is amazing, though.
-Just a little more.

356
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:16,042
Just a little further.

357
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,188
-[Hikaru exclaims]
-Watch out!

358
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,023
-[Koji shouts]
-[Hikaru laughs]

359
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,195
[Koji] That was terrible.

360
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,263
[Hikaru] All right.

361
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,999
-That was fun.
-[Koji] That was fun.

362
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,937
Now, TABI, what's next?

363
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:50,176
[TABI] How about Cafe Awamo in Fukuoka?

364
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,379
-Let's go.
-That's what Teru-nii likes.

365
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,050
-Aren't I the hero?
-[TABI] You can enjoy coffee and sweets

366
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,719
in a calm, traditional space.

367
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,121
-[in English] All right, let's go.
-[chuckles]

368
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,322
Okay.

369
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,259
[in Japanese] I want coffee and sweets.

370
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,136
[yawning]

371
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,240
-[Hikaru] Are you gonna fall asleep?
-I think so.

372
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,609
That bus has a lot of students.

373
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,013
-Stop it!
-[laughing]

374
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,248
So many students.

375
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,985
All the kids
are looking at their phones now.

376
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,921
When Snow Man is right here.

377
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:38,024
Look up, won't you?

378
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,759
Look at the sky, just a little.

379
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,061
Not just your phone.

380
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,332
Not your hands...
Oh, they're gone. Too bad.

381
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,067
Oh, but we're right here!

382
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,869
-Oh!
-[chuckling]

383
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,537
What a shame!

384
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,073
[TABI] But Snow Man is here!

385
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,275
That was too bad, TABI.

386
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,777
I'm sad now.

387
00:17:58,711 --> 00:17:59,912
All we do is eat.

388
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:03,482
I miss the energy
we get from screaming fans.

389
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,485
Let's look for a student bus.

390
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,756
It's at a temple, right?

391
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,593
[Hikaru] Yeah, it's a temple cafe.

392
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,828
-Temple sweets are nice.
-Hmm.

393
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:17,863
That thing at the entrance.

394
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,366
Looks like the egg dish in osechi.

395
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,201
-This?
-Yeah.

396
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,971
I like it. Here?

397
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,876
-[server 1] Welcome. Hello.
-[Hikaru] Hello.

398
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,845
-Thank you for visiting our shop.
-Hello.

399
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:33,913
-Welcome.
-Excuse me.

400
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,081
-How cute.
-Hello.

401
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,749
-[server 2] Thank you.
-[Koji] Awesome.

402
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,517
-[server 1] Please have a seat.
-[Koji] Okay.

403
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,989
-Cafe Awamo.
-[server 3] Yes. [chuckles]

404
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:48,027
This cafe is on the premises
of Keiunnzann Myouhouji-temple.

405
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:50,162
-[Hikaru] It's stylish.
-What's popular here?

406
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:55,534
Our most popular item is
this temple parfait set.

407
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,902
Also, the Awamo set.

408
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,705
The set named after our shop
is quite popular.

409
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,909
-I can't choose.
-Maybe I'll get the parfait.

410
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,446
Wanna get the parfait?

411
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,548
[Hikaru] Can you make this right away?

412
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,684
-The Kumomikuji? Yes.
-[Koji] Let's do that.

413
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,186
-[Hikaru] Two then, please.
-Okay. I'll bring it to you.

414
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,022
We're gonna get fortunes, TABI.

415
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,025
Which one of us do you think is luckier?

416
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,261
[TABI] You both seem lucky.

417
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,496
[Koji] I like that, TABI.

418
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,332
[rattling]

419
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,500
[Koji] Lately...

420
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,469
It's Fukka's color.

421
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,372
-[server 3] That's "Ren."
-[Koji] It's both Meme and Fukka.

422
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,245
-Pink. It's Sakkun.
-[server 3] It's pink.

423
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,014
That would be the cloud that says "Myou."

424
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,683
[Koji] I haven't done fortunes in a while.

425
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,252
-Cute, right?
-[Hikaru] Yeah, cute.

426
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,188
Oh.

427
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:51,691
[scatting]

428
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,793
[Koji] It's a normal fortune slip.

429
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,097
Ready, go.

430
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,400
Future luck.

431
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,669
Good luck.

432
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,471
[Koji] Can we tie these outside?

433
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,306
-[server 3] Yes, you can tie it...
-[TABI] Yes,

434
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,908
there is a place to tie it outside.

435
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,276
I didn't ask you, TABI.

436
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,877
-[laughter]
-I'm sorry.

437
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,212
Bed!

438
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,716
Thank you very much for waiting.

439
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,218
Here is your temple parfait set.

440
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,220
-Here you go. "Diligence."
-[Koji] Looks good.

441
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,091
[server 1] You can use this matcha syrup
whenever you like.

442
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,294
That way, you can enjoy
the aroma of matcha to its fullest.

443
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,497
-Thank you.
-[server 1] Enjoy.

444
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,971
Squeeze here while you drink
so you don't finish it too fast.

445
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,140
[Hikaru] Why?

446
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:44,710
You can drink it
for longer that way, right?

447
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,413
By making the hole smaller?

448
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,049
Right. Otherwise,
it'll be gone immediately.

449
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:52,785
[Hikaru] Let's eat.

450
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,954
[Koji] You can grab the monaka.

451
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,288
Mmm!

452
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,494
[Hikaru] I love the shiratama dango.

453
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,429
Japanese desserts are so good.

454
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,534
-Nice.
-Like this.

455
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,906
You're eating a lot.

456
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,042
You're right. I'm gonna gain weight.

457
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,011
So much good food in Fukuoka.

458
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,213
Should I add the matcha now?

459
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,782
-Like this, right?
-[server 3] Yes.

460
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,017
The matcha will change
the flavor profile...

461
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,085
I'm putting it in.

462
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,354
[server 3] Yes. That way,
you can taste the matcha.

463
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,457
-For matcha lovers.
-[Koji] Matcha is bitter, though.

464
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,927
Yes. Yame matcha is relatively sweet.

465
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:36,529
-Sweet.
-[server 3] I think it's good.

466
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,564
[Hikaru] Adding this
changes it completely.

467
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,499
[Koji] Yeah. It's good.

468
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,471
Mmm.

469
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,240
I can't eat dinner tonight.

470
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,009
-Yes, we will.
-I can't.

471
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,378
In two hours or so.

472
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,514
[both laugh]

473
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:59,685
I'm gonna put on weight.
I'll have to skip a meal tomorrow.

474
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:00,753
That's fine.

475
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:03,789
[TABI] Our final destination

476
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:09,228
is the gold medal winner
for Most Influential Design of the World,

477
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:12,198
NOT A HOTEL FUKUOKA.

478
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,200
Is it near here?

479
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:18,237
[TABI] We can be there
in about 15 minutes.

480
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:19,638
-That's close!
-[laughs]

481
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,041
Wait, I can't eat yet.

482
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:25,644
-Thanks for the food.
-[server 1] Thank you very much.

483
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:26,712
[Hikaru] Thank you.

484
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,715
[Koji] Today was pretty plain.

485
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,751
We didn't do much.

486
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,787
We ate, so I want to do a food review.

487
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:39,058
I get the urge to do things like this,
but this isn't like that.

488
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,461
While I'm traveling alone with Teru-nii,

489
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:46,966
I'm able to get a bit of a sense

490
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,369
of what he's thinking at the moment.

491
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:53,372
We break into groups of four or five,

492
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:57,843
but we don't often get to go to places
with just the two of us.

493
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,681
It feels really personal,
even though it's work.

494
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,351
I'm really grateful we get to do this.

495
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,353
It's kind of nice.

496
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,522
[Hikaru] NOT A HOTEL.

497
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,324
[Koji] NOT A HOTEL.
It isn't a hotel?

498
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,959
-Here it is.
-What?

499
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,161
-[Hikaru] Isn't it stylish?
-[Koji] It is.

500
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,731
-[Hikaru] The exterior.
-[Koji] What is this hotel?

501
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,167
I like it.

502
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,335
[Hikaru] Yeah, isn't it nice?

503
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,908
[Hikaru] It looks completely different
from outside.

504
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,011
[Koji] Can we really?

505
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:34,313
[Hikaru] You... [chuckles]

506
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,549
-[Koji exclaims]
-What a pain.

507
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:38,884
[Koji] Awesome!

508
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,120
This is great.

509
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,123
[Hikaru] Stylish.

510
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:49,695
-Nice, we can have a bonfire.
-Yeah.

511
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:51,797
What's this?

512
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,867
Let's take a room tour.

513
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,001
[Hikaru] Amazing.

514
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,838
Is there anything above?

515
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,308
There's a roof space.

516
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,577
[Koji] Awesome!

517
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,813
How many people is this for?

518
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:12,117
Awesome!

519
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,421
What do you do here?

520
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,889
[Hikaru] Things like barbecues.

521
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,057
[Koji] Cool.

522
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,794
Hold on!

523
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,630
-There's a sauna!
-[Hikaru] You're kidding.

524
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:28,233
[Koji] Wow! Hold on!

525
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:32,438
[Hikaru] This is so cool.
I'm pumped for this.

526
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,440
Wow!

527
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:36,442
What's this?

528
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,545
Seeing a room like this
gets you pumped, right?

529
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:42,247
[shower running]

530
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,355
All right.

531
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:54,960
[Koji] Perfect.

532
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,233
How's the heat level for you?

533
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,869
-The heat?
-How is the temperature?

534
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,238
-Pretty good.
-[sighs]

535
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,575
To be honest, I don't like this very much.

536
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:11,176
Showing this on TV.

537
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,813
-The unvarnished Koji?
-My curly hair.

538
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,083
-You don't like it?
-I'm self-conscious of it.

539
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,419
Some people like it.

540
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:24,256
I guess. These curls, though...

541
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:25,624
I try to keep it straight.

542
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,826
-[Hikaru] It is pretty curly.
-Curly, yeah.

543
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,196
When you and I went to Thailand...

544
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,033
-For work.
-[Koji] Right, we did.

545
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,069
[Koji] There was a Japanese-style sauna.

546
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:42,808
Like a public bath.
And all the staff were there.

547
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,143
You were scary, Teru-nii.

548
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,079
You went like this.

549
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,415
Showing off your muscular body like this.

550
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:53,452
I bet the Thai people thought
you were a Buddha statue.

551
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:56,021
-I bet, yeah.
-Right.

552
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,058
[Koji] It's so hot.

553
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,094
This is good.
A drink afterward will be nice.

554
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,930
[clicks tongue, exclaims]

555
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,368
-This is the best.
-Really.

556
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,473
Is this okay?

557
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:16,975
Yeah.

558
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:21,847
Like this?

559
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,582
How many times?

560
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,452
-[Hikaru] Five times.
-Five.

561
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,624
-Extra.
-[Hikaru] Good job.

562
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,527
-You're doing good.
-[Koji] Aren't I?

563
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,698
Being a sauna lover
is one of my selling points.

564
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,134
This is pretty good.

565
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,803
I want you to show your arms here.

566
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:48,073
[laughing] I'm just sweating. Stop it.

567
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,409
[Koji] You've been working on this lately.

568
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,679
You've been doing it secretly.
Haven't you?

569
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,181
-Here.
-Don't smack me.

570
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,282
Your arms show it.

571
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,494
It's pretty sturdy.

572
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:13,132
-[Koji grunts]
-[laughing]

573
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,733
[Hikaru] The wrap.

574
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,269
This is cold!

575
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,204
-This is so cold.
-Cold.

576
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,373
[exhales]

577
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,376
That's crazy.

578
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,180
Wow.

579
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,987
[Koji] I can't stay in the cold bath
for long.

580
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,695
I'm the main character today.

581
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,801
My face is bare right now.

582
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,005
I'm embarrassed. My bare face.

583
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,610
This is great.

584
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,214
It really is.

585
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,053
[TABI] Dinner is ready.

586
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:12,457
[Hikaru] You gotta have mizutaki
in Fukuoka.

587
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,725
-[Koji] Mizutaki?
-[Hikaru] Yes.

588
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:17,963
Let's get ready and then have a toast.

589
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,998
I, Mukai, the boss of the hot pot...

590
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,635
The soup is good enough on its own.

591
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,304
What'll you drink, Koji?

592
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,505
What should I choose?

593
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,007
I'll have what you're having.

594
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,610
Although I always start with beer.

595
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:34,246
-[Hikaru] Wanna have beer, then?
-You like beer, Teru-nii?

596
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,148
-[Hikaru] I don't mind it.
-Beer, then.

597
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,817
-[Koji] Wow!
-This one?

598
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,221
[Koji] The scent... I wanna soak in this.

599
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:43,855
I could soak in this.

600
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,260
Better not pour too much.
The vegetables have water.

601
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,730
Awesome!

602
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,435
This is luxurious.

603
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,538
Hold on. Let's add meat.

604
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:03,675
Look!

605
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,612
Thank you.

606
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,381
-Is that good?
-[Hikaru] Yeah, that's enough.

607
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,783
-Good work today.
-Yeah, you too.

608
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,519
Doing this with Teru-nii! [exclaims]

609
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:22,261
[sighs]

610
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,265
[Hikaru laughing]

611
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,169
-Yum!
-This is great.

612
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,271
Ah.

613
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,905
You don't usually drink, right?

614
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,007
-I do.
-You do?

615
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,375
-Yeah.
-Okay.

616
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:41,813
Yum.

617
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,549
-[Hikaru] Good, right?
-[Koji] Yeah.

618
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:48,153
Wow, so luxurious.

619
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,955
It's luxurious. Surprisingly,

620
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,857
I'm hungry.

621
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:54,626
-[Hikaru] After all that food?
-[Koji] Yeah.

622
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,964
I'm drinking beer with Koji.

623
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,303
Nice doing this once in a while.

624
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,504
Yeah.

625
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,073
[Koji] We keep saying
we'll go camping, but we don't.

626
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,909
-Because of our schedule.
-[Hikaru] Yeah.

627
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,847
I want to add salt like this.
I'm a salt guy.

628
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:17,683
It feels like good salt.

629
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,919
[Hikaru] Wow.

630
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:26,358
Hot pot in warm weather is nice.

631
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,127
Very nice.

632
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,762
Great chicken.

633
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,199
The soup is good.

636
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,641
[Hikaru] I haven't been recently.

637
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,776
-Sure, I'll go. Yeah.
-You will?

638
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,012
-What about you?
-I do it at home.

639
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,146
Wow.

640
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,983
[TABI] What kind of songs do you sing?

641
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,886
I sang my own solo song three times.

00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,358

00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:06,465
It's different doing karaoke at home.

Let me do it.

649
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:16,108
[TABI] Has this made up
for missing Fukuoka last year, Iwamoto?

650
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,110
Right, last year...

651
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,244
What?

652
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,480
I couldn't make it to Fukuoka.

we can't go out,
but we get to eat local dishes.

Yeah.

657
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,125
I feel like I'm getting more
out of Fukuoka than then.

-For sure.
-I'm grateful.

659
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:38,530
It's lonely if we're missing someone
at a concert.

-[Hikaru] Really?
-It's not the same.

-Yeah.

So I really want everybody there.

668
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:03,054
[chuckling] I mean, it's not like
I skipped on purpose.

You can't cancel at the last second.

it's like I just didn't feel like coming.

672
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,196
It's really rude.

Hospital? No, never before that.

679
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,012
First time, then.

680
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,247

-A member being hospitalized.

That was really something.

-After surgery.

685
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:45,831

00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:21,066
I always asked them to include "Snow Man"
in parentheses after my name.

695
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:26,605
I want our individual activities
to benefit Snow Man

696
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,242
and for that expanded Snow Man
to benefit each of us.

697
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,945
So that fits with the theme of this show.

698
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,084
So far, I've only been
to Okinawa and Fukuoka,

699
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,922
but traveling with just the two of us
gives me a sense of...

700
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:49,361
"What's on Iwamoto's mind right now?"

701
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,664
I think having that sense

702
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:55,634
will turn out to be really important

703
00:33:56,568 --> 00:34:01,540
in our future activities
from this fifth anniversary

704
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:05,577
going into the sixth and seventh.

705
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:09,714
[TABI] Tell me about your future goals.

706
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:15,787
I'd like to do an Asia tour outside Japan.

707
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,957
But that can come later.

708
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:20,792
That is a goal of mine,

709
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:26,197
but most of our fans are in Japan.

710
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:29,834
-Yeah, I get that. I know how you feel.
-Let's see what the future holds.

711
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,470
Making it overseas

712
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,240
is one goal.

713
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,342
-But we also don't want...
-Yeah, yeah.

714
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,678
-...to abandon our fans in Japan.
-True.

715
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,247
Well, I think my goal is to continue

716
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,416
trying new things.

717
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,517
That's right.

718
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:49,688
Just doing the stadium
doesn't mean we're satisfied now.

719
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,490
-Yeah. I'm grateful, but...
-But...

720
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:58,163
I'd like for people to see Snow Man,
such as our fans, of course...

721
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,700
But also juniors...

722
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,336
Who else?

723
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:07,539
Little kids who don't know about idols...

724
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,441
I want them to look up to us.

725
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,910
-And want to be like us.
-Yeah.

726
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:14,980
I'd like that. Creating inspiration.

727
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:18,416
-I get that.
-I hope we can create inspiration

728
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:22,887
-for a positive force in people's lives.
-I agree.

729
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,191
That's my thought.

730
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,459
[Koji] There you have it, TABI.

731
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,529
[TABI] By the way,
would you like some more sake?

732
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,832
-Shut up!
-[laughs]

733
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,001
Let me go at my own pace!

734
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,952
