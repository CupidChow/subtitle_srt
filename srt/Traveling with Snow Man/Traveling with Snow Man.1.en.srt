1
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:04,872
[TABI] Traveling with Snow Man.

2
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,663
Where is everyone?

3
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,331
[laughs]

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,601
TABI,

5
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:36,537
how are you doing?

6
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:40,140
[TABI] I am doing well.

7
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:43,110
TABI, what's your favorite food?

8
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,245
[TABI] My favorite food

9
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:46,980
is sushi.

10
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,517
-It's Hikaru.
-It's Hikaru.

11
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,155
Meeting up on-site is kind of a hassle.

12
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,424
-I mean...
-[Ryohei] Coming all the way to Okinawa.

13
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:58,592
I sat in front.

14
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,260
[both laughing]

15
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:01,762
I sat in front.

16
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,430
We have shisa!

17
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,199
Isn't Okinawa nice?

18
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,135
It's been about a year for me.

19
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,638
I visited Okinawa with Date.

20
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,674
I see. Was that two years ago?

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,808
Didn't you two meet?

22
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,077
Hikaru and I met up two years ago.

23
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,645
Did we meet at the aquarium?

24
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,981
Yeah. I was at Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium,

25
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,618
looking at the fish like this,
then I looked over and saw

26
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,054
a guy with super pink hair.

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,856
I thought he looked like Sakuma,
and he really was.

28
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,794
I wanted to go to the aquarium by myself,

29
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,331
so I got all the tickets the day before,
rented a car,

30
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:41,702
and drove the two hours
there and back on my own.

31
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,970
So proactive.

32
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,237
[Daisuke] It was crazy.

33
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,306
I hoped we could go again this time.

34
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,375
You don't get to go often even for work.

35
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,876
No, you don't.

36
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,044
I've been, though.

37
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,112
[Daisuke] Really?

38
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:55,549
My school went on a field trip to Okinawa.

39
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,484
Time's limited on field trips.

40
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,353
It's like "meet here at this time."

41
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,420
[Ryohei] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,357
Morning.

43
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,294
The way they showed up
kind of ticks me off.

44
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,362
[Ryohei laughs]

45
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,429
[Shota] Good morning.

46
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,431
Have you been here, Fukka, Shota?

47
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,066
In middle school.

48
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,368
Like Abe's field trip.

49
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,536
-Hard to imagine Fukazawa here.
-Yes.

50
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,338
You took a field trip to Okinawa?

51
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,309
-Morning.
-[Daisuke] Morning, oppa.

52
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,477
[Shota] Morning.

53
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,913
-[Hikaru] Shut up.
-[Shota] Here's another annoying guy.

54
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,282
Eager to be in Okinawa.

55
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,151
Aloha!

56
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,353
"Aloha" is Hawaiian.

57
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,421
Different place.

58
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,689
It's Eageraul.

59
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,325
My first time in Okinawa!

60
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,526
It's Eageraul.

61
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,694
First time?

62
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:41,862
-It is.
-Me too.

63
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:42,929
First time ever?

64
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,965
-[Raul] First time ever.
-[Daisuke] I'm surprised.

65
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,100
[Hikaru in Thai] Kob khun ka.

66
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,502
-Kob khun ka.
-[Raul] Kob khun ka.

67
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,270
-Have you started?
-Getting started.

68
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,805
You're so quirky.

69
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:52,873
We've been waiting.

70
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,875
Oh!

71
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,476
-Welcome.
-Here he comes.

72
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,146
[all] There he is.

73
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,480
-[Daisuke] Ren!
-He's here!

74
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,615
[Koji] Meguro!

75
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,417
-We've been waiting.
-Sorry.

76
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,484
Hey there.

77
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,686
[Koji] We've been waiting.

78
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:06,887
Hey, why there?

79
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:07,954
Why not there?

80
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,623
Okay, you're right.

81
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,691
That's right.

82
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,659
That's right. Completely right.

83
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,764
-First of all, good morning.
-[all] Good morning.

84
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,067
Congratulations on
the 5th debut anniversary.

85
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,134
Thanks.

86
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:22,836
-Thanks.
-Five years.

87
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,272
We've had a lot of firsts,
like playing in stadiums

88
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,241
-and putting on live concerts...
-Yes.

89
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,411
So I thought it would be nice
to take on a new challenge

90
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:32,979
or new experience.

91
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,848
-In Okinawa?
-Starting here.

92
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:39,319
Starting in Okinawa,
we will travel all across Japan.

93
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,089
-[Raul] That's what this is?
-Yes.

94
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,024
So the last episode's in Wakkanai?

95
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,059
On the opposite side.

96
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,095
Wakkanai say?

97
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,362
Hey!

98
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,065
Okay, I'll announce
the theme for this show.

99
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,433
[Tatsuya] Hey, not yet!

100
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,634
-There?
-That was fast.

101
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,571
Ready? Here's the theme for the show.

102
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,339
-[Tatsuya] It's in English.
-Read it, Abe.

103
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,411
[Hikaru] Okay. What does that mean?

104
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:09,116
It means each one of us supports Snow Man,

105
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,919
and Snow Man works toward one goal.

106
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,155
I see... You're really good.

107
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:18,225
So as we travel, we won't just have fun.

108
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,528
We'll be thinking
about what we can do for Snow Man

109
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,364
over the course of this journey.

110
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,099
-Deep. Very deep.
-Deep, isn't it?

111
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,534
Yeah, maybe so.

112
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,871
-No... I want the mood to be lighter.
-[members laugh]

113
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,639
You can think of it lighter.

114
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,208
Also, one more person is coming with us.

115
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,377
See, there's an extra snowman.

116
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,979
[Daisuke] But Snow Man is nine people.

117
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,580
-[Koji] True.
-[Hikaru] There's one more.

118
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,982
A new guest every episode?

119
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,383
[Ren] Hey, what is that?

120
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,551
[Hikaru] It's called TABI.

121
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,119
-[Hikaru] TABI?
-[members] TABI.

122
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,221
[Tatsuya] That's pretty on the nose.

123
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,689
Since "tabi" means travel.

124
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,725
Well, it can talk.

125
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,993
-No, no.
-You're kidding.

126
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,227
-No way.
-It can't talk.

127
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,595
How are you, TABI?

128
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,498
Hello. I am TABI.

129
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,433
It's nice to meet you.

130
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,335
-It really can.
-Wow.

131
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:06,540
You can ask it any questions you have.

132
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,341
-Ask TABI?
-[Hikaru] Yes.

133
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,443
Did TABI come from Tokyo too?

134
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,912
Where are you from, TABI?

135
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,979
Will it answer?

136
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,149
TABI wanders the cyber world.

137
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,819
-What? That's so sci-fi.
-Cool.

138
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,721
We'll all have a barbecue today.

139
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,256
For real?

140
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,357
Yay.

141
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,960
So we'll be asking TABI

142
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,395
about the food menu...

143
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,663
Asking TABI?

144
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,799
...while we go shopping.
So Date, take TABI.

145
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,901
-Why?
-Why not me?

146
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,571
-This thing?
-You're giving Dati your TABI, Hikaru?

147
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,706
-Yep.
-[Shota] Dati and TABI?

148
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,043
We shouldn't dawdle. Let's get moving.

149
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,144
Okay.

150
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,412
-I'll take it.
-Let's go.

151
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,414
Heck yeah, a barbecue.

152
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,950
[Koji] So we don't have
to think about anything.

153
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,152
-[Raul] Barbecue's the goal, after all.
-[Hikaru] Yeah.

154
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,521
-[Koji] Come on.
-[Hikaru] All right.

155
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,791
[Koji] Let's go.

156
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,459
-[Tatsuya] Come on.
-[Koji] Where to?

157
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,729
[Tatsuya] You mean, with this thing?

158
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,065
-[Koji] Okinawa license plates.
-[Daisuke] This is cool.

159
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,700
-[Tatsuya] A motorcycle.
-Wow.

160
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,001
[Shota] The motorcycle...

161
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,970
It's mine.

162
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,471
-[Tatsuya] What?
-Really?

163
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,539
It must feel great.

164
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,841
-You're riding this?
-I may get sunburnt.

165
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,543
Look, isn't that cool?

166
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,545
-Okay, I'll get behind.
-[members laugh]

167
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,613
Nice.

168
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,882
-Isn't this cool?
-Awesome.

169
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,150
-Shouldn't you switch places?
-Wrong positions.

170
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,952
[Tatsuya] So, what are we doing with this?

171
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,655
Well, go shopping for food,
like I'm about to.

172
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,090
Food. Yeah, yeah.

173
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,359
So I'll take care of things on my own...

174
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,693
-You're leaving us!
-Hey!

175
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,761
[Koji] Come on!

176
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,463
-That's not right!
-Hey!

177
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,499
-Who's riding behind?
-You said it was us nine!

178
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,700
Leaving already?

179
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,269
Look! The sky is beautiful.

180
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,536
Where'd that come from?

181
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,005
-So much.
-That was fast.

182
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,007
-[Raul] Let's get started.
-[Koji] Not much time.

183
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,275
[Raul] Happy to ride shotgun.

184
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,542
Don't forget to shop.

185
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,610
[Tatsuya] Whoa, whoa!

186
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,878
[Koji] What'll you do, Teru-nii?

187
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,447
-I've got somewhere to go.
-[Koji] Huh?

188
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,149
-[Hikaru] Take care.
-[Ryohei] Will do.

189
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,051
-[Tatsuya] Don't go back first.
-[Raul] We're here.

190
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,487
-Bye-bye.
-[Shota] Going to the airport.

191
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,554
Don't go home.

192
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,822
[Raul] Bye-bye, Iwamoto.

193
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:03,990
See you! Don't leave!

194
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,058
Teru-nii!

195
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,192
-See you.
-Bye.

196
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,627
-Don't leave.
-See you!

197
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,663
-Don't go home!
-[Daisuke laughs]

198
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,798
-[Ryota] We look anxious to go home?
-[Daisuke laughs]

199
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,304
[♪ pleasant music playing]

200
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,981
[Hikaru] What kind of trip?

201
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,619
As you experience
more and more things, I think

202
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,689
the older you get,
the fewer things there are

203
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,325
that you can experience
for the first time.

204
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,228
And when you do want to try something new,

205
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,765
you might be afraid
or conscious of what others will think.

206
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,235
It's hard to take that first step forward.

207
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,873
So if we can experience
more firsts through this trip,

208
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,811
whether between ourselves,
the places we see,

209
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,914
the foods we eat,
or anything that makes us feel like

210
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:05,051
"Wow, this is what it's like?
I had no idea,"

211
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:08,655
then maybe we can come to love more
the Japan we grew up in,

212
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:13,226
and we'll be able to look inward more.

213
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,695
I'm really looking forward to that.

214
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,833
I hope they'll cherish these firsts.

215
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,570
[Ryota] Wanna ask TABI something?

216
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,637
TABI?

217
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,373
I'm not sure what to buy.

218
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,041
TABI?

219
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,511
-[TABI] Yes, what is it?
-[laughs]

220
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,713
You're so happy.

221
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,715
For barbecue ingredients,

222
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:39,986
I recommend Yunta Market in Yomitan.

223
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,554
[Raul] Market?

224
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,692
It has many Okinawan foods.

225
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,328
We can get everything.

226
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,163
Markets have it all.

227
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:58,371
Shooting on location with all nine of us
is really rare, though.

228
00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,773
-It is.
-Totally.

229
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,675
Like, how many years
since we've done this?

230
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,077
It might be a first.

231
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,279
-Coming this far...
-[Ryohei] Of a distance.

232
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,580
We haven't gone this far.

233
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,749
Well, the Kanto area...

234
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,351
[Tatsuya] Yeah, we've done it.

235
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:15,655
This feels like
a special anniversary thing.

236
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,123
It does feel like that.

237
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,191
Yeah.

238
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:19,926
[Ryohei] For sure.

239
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:24,497
Our seniors have done travel shows
for their anniversary too.

240
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,533
-I've seen them.
-I thought that was cool.

241
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,734
For sure.

242
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,403
Okinawa.
It's your first time, right, Raul?

243
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,504
It is.

244
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,374
You want to touch the sea
if this is your first time.

245
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,143
-Uh...
-Right? At least with your feet.

246
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,411
Yeah, true.

247
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:42,415
Okinawa's all about food, though.
That's what's most Okinawan.

248
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,451
Eat some goya champuru.

249
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,087
-I like goya champuru in the summer.
-[Daisuke] Me too.

250
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,154
Perfect for summer.

251
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,291
Bitter is
my least favorite flavor, though.

252
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,561
-I hate bitter most.
-[Raul] Yeah.

253
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,764
But I like goya champuru for some reason.

254
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,065
-I get it.
-It's different.

255
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,067
-It's different.
-it's special.

256
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,336
-[Daisuke] Maybe this is the place.
-[Raul] Oh?

257
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,904
-[Koji] Are we here?
-Is this it?

258
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,106

-See you, Abe.
-I'm coming too.

265
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,284
-Thanks!
-I said I'm coming!

266
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,587
-All right!
-Good job.

267
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,255
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.

268
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,023
-[Ryota] A market?
-[Ren] Wow. It's a market.

269
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,425
Awesome, a market.

270
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,327
[Shota] Oh, they're selling bitter melon.

271
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,661
[Raul] Wanna get some?

272
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,930
-But we're making barbecue.
-Right.

273
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,466
Do we get meat first?

274
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,401
-Buy meat?
-Meat first.

275
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,237
Wanna take the cart?

276
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,938
-I'll go that way.
-Over there.

277
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,307
What vegetables would be good?

278
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,408
Whoa, hey.

279
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,776
I want asparagus.

280
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,812
-Sugarcane!
-[Raul] Wow, awesome.

281
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,013
[Daisuke] Let's get some.

282
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,849
-We can get some of this, right?
-Sure.

283
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,317
Let's pick some meat.

284
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,986
-Sounds good.
-All right.

285
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,087
Wait.

286
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,788
[Shota] Let's get an Okinawan meat.

287
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:56,923
That looks Okinawan.

288
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,894
But look.
Even the steaks are from Okinawa.

289
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,595
[Tatsuya] Then let's get some.

290
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,264
[Shota] Let's go with steak.

291
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,465
[Tatsuya] Let's go.

292
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,433
-Red meat.
-Is four enough?

293
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,701
You're paying, Abe.

294
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,003
-Me?
-Thanks.

295
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,473

296
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,176
for our upcoming barbecue?

297
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,277
[TABI] Yes.

298
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,479
Since you have nine people,

299
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,950
how about yakisoba with Okinawa soba?

300
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,952
Yakisoba with Okinawa soba noodles?

301
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,888
I recommend them for their chewy texture.

302
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,724
Yakisoba with Okinawa soba.

303
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,993
I understand. Thank you!

-Guys.
-[Koji] Yes?

305
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,164
-I just asked TABI...
-What?

306
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,800
-What to eat at the barbecue.
-Okay.

307
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,502
It said yakisoba with Okinawa soba.

308
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,304
-Sounds good.
-Okinawan yakisoba?

309
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,306
-Wanna get stuff for yakisoba?
-Sure.

310
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,441
We choose too much greens for a barbecue.

311
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,210
But greens are important.

312
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,179
[Raul] What goes in yakisoba?
Oh, we need onions.

313
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,215
-You said you want yakisoba.
-Let's do it.

314
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,050
-Here's Okinawa soba.
-They have it. Let's go.

315
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,152
-[Tatsuya] There it is.
-[Ren] Wanna buy it?

316
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,120
-[Tatsuya] Let's get it.
-[Ryohei] Thick noodles?

317
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,323
[Tatsuya] Is two good? This and this?

318
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,059
-[Ryohei] Thin noodles?
-[Tatsuya] Thin and thick?

319
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,260
We can mix them.

320
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,761
That'd be good.

321
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,064
-Did you get Okinawa soba?
-Yeah.

322
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,400
TABI said yakisoba with Okinawa soba
would be good to make.

323
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,237
That sounds awesome.
Yakisoba with Okinawa soba.

324
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,504

Where's Iwamoto?

-Maybe he's already started.
-[Daisuke] True.

00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,233
Is he making charcoal?

He's an ace in the coal.

Ooh.

00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:55,475
we will head to HOSHINOYA Okinawa.

-It's TABI.
-TABI.

Heading to HOSHINOYA Okinawa.

-[Daisuke] No problem.
-We're here!

351
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,173
-[Ren] But Iwamoto...
-[Tatsuya] We're here.

352
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,975
-Where's Teru-nii?
-Where is he?

353
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,210
-Here?
-Hey, look at this.

354
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,046
-What?
-A fortress.

355
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,614
-Awesome.
-What is this?

356
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,849
-That's crazy.
-The trees are impressive.

357
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,384
It's sticking out so far.

358
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,819
You don't see that in Tokyo.

359
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,120
You really don't.

360
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,022
[Daisuke] There's a shisa at the entrance.

361
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,123
[Koji] Can we go in?

362
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,291
[Tatsuya] A shisa?

363
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,026
-A shisa?
-[Daisuke] There it is.

364
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,394
[Raul] Nice.

365
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,296
-[Daisuke laughs]
-Is this a hotel?

366
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,964
-[Ryohei] Stylish.
-[members exclaim]

367
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,267
-[Daisuke] Cool. Like a music video.
-What's here?

368
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,769
-Is this the final boss?
-A museum?

369
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,904
-Hello there.
-Teru-nii.

370
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,505
Come to the reception.

371
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,441
-This is crazy.
-What is this?

372
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,076
-You're late.
-What were you doing?

373
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,078
[Daisuke] I missed you, Hikaru.

374
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,145
[Hikaru] Thank you.

375
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,214
-[Ren] Thank you.
-[Ryota] Ryukyu.

376
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,716
-[Daisuke] Thank you.
-[Koji] Hello.

377
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,817
Thanks.

378
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,151
-[Koji] What is this place?
-It's...

379
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,553
-[Ryohei] Cool.
-This is reception.

380
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,620
[Daisuke] Reception?

381
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,688
[Hikaru] Let's go inside.

382
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,323
-Reception's done?
-May I?

383
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,858
-Reception's over?
-Checked in?

384
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,227
-Excuse me.
-This way, guys.

385
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,295
Thank you.

386
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,629
Thank you so much.

387
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,997
-Thanks.
-Excuse us.

388
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,233
[man] Please take the second
and third row seats.

389
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:28,901
[Koji] We're going in two?

390
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,870
Splitting up again like before.

391
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:33,406
-[Ryohei] The weather is perfect today.
-Not too hot.

392
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,574
-See you.
-Yay!

393
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,142
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

394
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,443
-Bye-bye.
-See you.

395
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,112
This is a nice hotel.

396
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,747
Isn't it? What is this?

397
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,015
I can't see the whole thing.

398
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:46,018
-[man] This is called Gusuku Hall.
-Okay.

399
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,689
Gusuku is the Okinawan word for "castle".

400
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,959
-Really?
-These are inspired by those castle walls.

401
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,026
Wow.

402
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:57,864
Right, some Okinawan castles
are called "gusuku".

403
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,065
[man] Indeed.

404
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,733
Your knowledge is coming out.

405
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,235
-Yeah.
-Your knowledge.

406
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,302
I brought it out.

407
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,772
-Wow.
-Whoa, these trees are cool.

408
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:07,874
That twisty tree.

409
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,510
[Ren] Yeah, the trees are cool.

410
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,911
-Awesome.
-I know.

411
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,447
It's like a tunnel.

412
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,651
Here!

413
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,787
What is this place?

414
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,124
Apparently, you have to
climb this wall to get inside.

415
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:28,060
[Tatsuya] Really? That sure is a trial.

416
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,529
Did you buy the stuff?

417
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,596
-Yeah.
-This is crazy.

418
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,265
-We did.
-Crazy.

419
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,066
-What is?
-Where were you, Iwamoto?

420
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,002
Me? Secret.

421
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,470
-Huh?
-Ahh.

422
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:38,771
Where are we going?

423
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,072
Hey!

424
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,041
-Check it out!
-What?

425
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,176
-Wow.
-Awesome!

426
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,777
-Awesome.
-No way.

427
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:45,845
I can't believe it.

428
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:49,048
-[Koji] A private beach!
-[all cheering]

429
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,250
-[Ryohei] The sea is beautiful!
-[Tatsuya] This is great.

430
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,719
[Shota] You can see
the color gradient from here.

431
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,887
[Tatsuya] Awesome.

432
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,190
[Shota] Wow, isn't this spectacular?

433
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,091
-[Ryohei] Oh my gosh!
-[Ren] It's so pretty.

434
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,159
Right here...

435
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,228
[Daisuke] The Okinawan sea is awesome!

436
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,296
[Ryohei] Paddleboarding.

437
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,397
Huh?

438
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,432
[Tatsuya] Wow, cool.

439
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,767
[Koji] The sand is white.

440
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,735
-[Tatsuya] Whoa, awesome.
-Wow.

441
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,205
[Hikaru] So? Feel like Okinawa yet?

442
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,606
-I feel it.
-At last.

443
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,074
-Finally?
-We're here.

444
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,109
[Tatsuya] Okay, let's get in!

445
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,912
-I bet you could get in.
-More than us.

446
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,848
I touched the Okinawan sea.

447
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,516
-[Ryota] You touched it?
-[Ryohei] Nice.

448
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,318
[Koji] It's Raul's first time, right?

449
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,586
[Daisuke] Wait, this feels great.

450
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,154
[Raul] Mind if I take these off?

451
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,522
[Shota] Why not?

452
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,493
-[Daisuke] Wow, awesome.
-[Ryohei] Nice!

453
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,927
-Cool.
-You did it.

454
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,662
-He did it.
-It's done.

455
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,064
Whoo!

456
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,832
[Tatsuya] I did it.

457
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:40,900
[Ren] Stop it, Shoppi.

458
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,035
[Koji] Shoppi?

459
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,872
Don't do that, Abe.

460
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,473
-Me?
-[Raul] You got a change of clothes?

461
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,408
Wow, no one's looking.

462
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,577
Ren, you're looking. Say something.

463
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,681
[Ryohei] They're doing
the Titanic scene on the hill.

464
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,749
[Ryota] Good picture.

465
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,752
Hold on. I want to get in too.

466
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,087
Whoa.

467
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,055
-[Ren] You too, Fukka?
-[Ryota] You seem eager.

468
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,624
[Koji] Going up to your head, Fukka?

469
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,427
-Whoa, this feels great.
-Wow!

470
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,963
[Shota] The view from here is great.

471
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,398
[Tatsuya] It's amazing.

472
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,567
-Squatting feels good.
-[members laugh]

473
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:17,169
Squatting wide feels good.

474
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,871
Working your muscles feels good?

475
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:19,939
Is it cold?

476
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,742
Yeah... No, it's just right... I think.

477
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,410
[Ryota] This is it. The true fun.

478
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,178
[Ryohei] It's the true fun.

479
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,180
[Ren] Sakuma went too.

480
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,149
-[Tatsuya] This is great.
-It feels so good.

481
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,351
Wow, it feels so good.

482
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,120
-You should get in.
-This is great.

483
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,221
Shoppi's unsure. Cute.

484
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,656
It's warm, actually.

485
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,659
-Maybe because it's shallow.
-[Ren] Shoppi.

486
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,527
What's Shoppi doing?

487
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,867
[wooden brush swishing]

488
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,043
Oh.

489
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,177
Hello.

490
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:02,114
Here you go. This is a traditional
Okinawan drink called bukubuku-cha.

491
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,116
-Traditional?
-Bukubuku-cha.

492
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,320
First, bring the cup close to your face

493
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,322
and smell the scent of roasted rice.

494
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,590
Roasted rice?

495
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:11,757
-Let's do it.
-Let's.

496
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:12,959
Roasted rice?

497
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,627
It's cold.

498
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,563
-It smells good.
-Smells sweet.

499
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,798
What's this?

500
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,366
-What?
-It smells really good.

501
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,500
It smells so good.

502
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,102
-Fragrant.
-[Koji] And it's cold.

503
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,038
Now take a mouthful
of the foam from the top.

504
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,106
Huh?

505
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,941
-You eat the foam?
-Are you sure?

506
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,576
-Yes.
-That's right.

507
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,644
Okay. Here goes.

508
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,145
Is this proper manners?

509
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,014
Thanks for the tea!

510
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,315
It looks good.

511
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:37,783
Cute, Shoppi.

512
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,819
Wow, that feels strange.

513
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,120
That's interesting.

514
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,622
Never tasted before.

515
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,056
-It's light.
-Light.

516
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,859
The cup is filled to the brim
with jasmine tea.

517
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,427
-Jasmine tea.
-Try not to spill.

518
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,029
-Careful.
-Thank you.

519
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,497
Don't get it on you, Abe.

520
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,235
-Maybe it won't stick.
-It won't.

521
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,771
That's a good way to drink it.

522
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,339
-Very good.
-You're good at this.

523

00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,379
I think we should all make
yakisoba together.

698
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,048
-Sounds good.
-Yakisoba? Nice.

699
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,983
-This?
-Is it warm?

700
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,118
The meat will disappear.
Can I use chopsticks?

701
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,987
-Delicious.
-[Daisuke] You can use this sauce.

702
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,689
Delicious.

703
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,024
Local sauce.

704
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,092
Thank you.

705
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,662
-Yum. Sea grapes.
-Great shiitake.

706
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:04,730
Yum.

707
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:06,899
Delicious.

708
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,267
Sausage.

709
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,635
What's that? Good sausage.

710
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,103
It's really good.

711
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,671
-Soy sauce...
-Here.

712
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,006
The standard choice.

713
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,941
-It's local.
-Local stuff.

714
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,677
-Hirami lemon.
-Hirami lemon-flavored.

715
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,312
Start cooking yakisoba?

716
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,748
-Wanna start?
-Yes!

717
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,016
Everything is chopped.

718
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,818
-This?
-You can just put it in.

719
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:26,885
Thanks.

720
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,720
-We'll put in bitter melon?
-Yeah.

721
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:29,988
Let's go!

722
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,390
First the onion.

723
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,125
What should I do?

724
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:36,495
I tried to help but it looks like
they don't need it, so I'll just eat.

725
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,297
[Shota] Eating is important too.

726
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,731
[Koji] I'm in charge of eating.

727
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:42,634
-Cheers!
-The cook will be happy.

728
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,603
-[Raul] Wanna add noodles?
-[Ryohei] Now?

729
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,572
[Tatsuya] It's cooking.

730
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,507
This is Agu pork and chicken.

731
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,243
[Daisuke] Agu pork is the best!

732
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,444
[Tatsuya] Hey, hey.

733
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:53,946
[Shota] Agu pork, here we go!

734
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,883
Look, they're doing something weird.

735
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,218
Yakisoba is ready!

736
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,486
Okay!

737
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,920
Wow, that's irritating!

738
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,956
-They'll only come back to eat.
-It's done.

739
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,492
[Daisuke] Let's eat it before they arrive!

740
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,127
Take some of the bitter melon.

741
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,862
The bitter melon is great.

742
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,530
How is it?

743
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:13,899
-Is it good?
-Very good!

744
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,934
[Shota] I heard the yakisoba is ready.

745
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,069
[Tatsuya] It's really good.

746
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,071
Is the yakisoba done?

747
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,405
-Yakisoba is done?
-Yes.

748
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,473
With bitter melon?

749
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,975
This might be awesome.

750
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,977
It's good. Eat it.

751
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,246
The more the better with this stuff.

752
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,281
[Daisuke] I think I like this flavor.

753
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:30,883
It's fresh to have bitter melon.

754
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:31,950
Yeah, it is.

755
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,620
-Excuse me.
-And because it's Okinawa soba.

756
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:35,687
Great noodles.

757
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,189
They're so chewy.

758
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:40,325
-Wow, delicious.
-[Hikaru] Yum.

759
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,227
This tastes too good.

760
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,030
So how was today?

761
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:46,899
It felt a bit rushed.

762
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,066
But it was actually...

763
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,601
-Yeah, it was.
-It was fun.

764
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,436
-We took it easy.
-Enjoyed it.

765
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,006
Well, the journey will begin here.

766
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,275
You know how I went off on my own?

767
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,876
-[Shota] What were you doing?
-[Raul] Yeah.

768
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:58,944
That's right.

769
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,979
[♪ pleasant music playing]

770
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,485
Whenever I'm working or traveling,

771
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:07,920
if I have the time...

772
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:13,559
I like to drop by a shrine nearby.

773
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,063
I might have been here before.

774
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,267
I like to go to shrines and temples often.

775
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,702
Maybe two years ago.

776
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:28,173
This is going to be a long journey.

777
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:32,477
So since I have the chance,
I decided to go to a shrine in Okinawa

778
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,914
and observe
the start of our journey from there.

779
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,617
I also went to give my greetings

780
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:42,321
on behalf of Snow Man.

781
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,122
It's not exactly a prayer,

782
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:48,293
but it's not often
we can all come to Okinawa together,

783
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,561
so I felt obligated

784
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:54,399
to make a proper greeting.

785
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,470
Which one is good?

786
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,641
This one for a journey, right?

787
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:05,477
Charms for safe travels.

788
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:06,645
Nine.

789
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:08,847
For nine people.

790
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:13,285
Thank you.

791
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,458
I went to a shrine called Futenmagu

792
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:22,160
and got good luck charms for the trip.

793
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,062
It says something.

794
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,797
Since we're going to many places...

795
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,266
-[Ryota] Stylish.
-[Ren] Starting here.

796

-Yeah, we're starting here.
-[Ryohei] Very nice.

797
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:30,535
I bought them for you.

Wow, thanks.

799
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,005
[Shota] Awesome!

800
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,473
-[Daisuke] Cool.
-[Tatsuya] Awesome!

801
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,208
-[Koji] You went there?
-Yes.

802
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,909
-[Ryohei] Feels like a new journey.
-Thanks.

803
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,211
-[Ren] Awesome.
-[Daisuke] Thanks.

804
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,680
I really did go there to buy those.

805
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:42,914
But I've been there.

806
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,483
I like shrines.

807
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,718
[Koji] What kind of protection is this?

808
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,487
-Travel protection.
-Thanks, really.

809
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,988
[Shota] Makes me happy.

810
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,156
[Ryota] Starting here...

811
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:52,991
-Exactly.
-Yes, yes.

812
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,126
Until the very end.

813
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,193
It would be nice

814
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,862
-if we could put them here.
-Yeah.

815
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,499
[Ryota] So, shall we go back?

816
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,167
-[Raul] Really?
-[Tatsuya] You're going back?

817
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,802
I'll stay. I'm free tomorrow.

-Two people?
-I'll stay.

00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:08,006
-Two people?
-Really? That's not fair.

820

You're staying there?

821
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,943
We didn't see it,
but it's just a hotel, right?

822
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,414
That place? It seemed really cool.

00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,416
-Wow, I'm envious.
-You want to stay?

No, I'm a little worried about Abe.

-I want a specialty dish.

876
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:27,712
Let's get food. We can call a taxi.

877
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,215
-[Tatsuya] There it is.
-Let's go.

878
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,185
Good evening. Thank you.

879
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,352
Okay. Let's go.

880
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,420
Yes.

881
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:42,494
TABI told me
about a nice Okinawan restaurant.

882
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,796
We can go there thanks to TABI.

883
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,064
What? You asked TABI?

884
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,199
Yes.

885
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,267
[♪ pleasant music playing]

886
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:54,406
[Tatsuya] Is it here?

887
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,375
-Here.
-Wow, awesome.

888
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,511
[Tatsuya] This is really narrow.

889
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,214
[Hikaru] Nice atmosphere.

890
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,448
[Tatsuya] For sure.

891
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,217
-[Hikaru] Very Okinawa.
-[Tatsuya] Yes, Okinawa!

892
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,553
-[Tatsuya] Excuse me.
-[Hikaru] Isn't this great?

893
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,356
-Good work.
-Thank you.

894
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:15,460
It's really good.

895
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:16,761
[Tatsuya] Doesn't it taste good?

896
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,930
It's very smooth.

897
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,308
Whoa!

898
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,244
-[Tatsuya] Yes, yes.
-It's popping.

899
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,345
This is it.

900
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,883
This is going to be good shabu-shabu.

901
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,050
RYUKYU PORK SHABU-SHABU

902
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,887
Wow, great sauce.

903
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:43,555
Black.

904
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:48,026
Whoa.

905
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,362
Delicious.

906
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:52,163
Which one did you have?

907
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,833
I had that black stuff.

908
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,334
-This?
-One of these two.

909
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,037
It's kind of yuzu-like.

910
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:01,606
I used this stuff. Is that miso?

911
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,241
Is that ponzu sauce?

912
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,443
I can't tell.

913
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,249
-Whoa.
-It's good.

914
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:14,019
-Delicious!
-Isn't it great?

915
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,321
What is this?

916
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,324
-It's salted ponzu.
-Salted ponzu? Looks delicious.

917
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,959
-What is this?
-Black sesame.

918
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,627
-Black sesame seeds.
-Oh, I see.

919
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:24,529
This is delicious.

920
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,233
-But you know...
-What?

921
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:32,704
I was going to come to Okinawa before.

922
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:33,772
Oh.

923
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,507
That's right.

924
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,642
I'll never forget. February 22nd.

925
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,212
None of us can forget that.

926
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,748
I mean, you even booked a flight.

927
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,016
I booked a flight.

928
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,885
-I booked a hotel.
-Booked a hotel.

929
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,888
I had a restaurant reservation made.

930
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:51,756
The car was reserved.

931
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,992
-Reserved activities.
-Yeah.

932
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,261
And then...

933
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:59,864
I got stomach flu the night before.

934
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,534
-There was no way you could go.
-[Hikaru laughs]

935
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,269
I don't get so sick often.

936
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:05,971
Yeah. That's why...

937
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:10,275
Places like hotels and restaurants...

938
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,544
are different from the last time.

939
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:16,081
But I wanted to eat with you like this.

940
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,717
-So I'm glad we got to.
-Me too.

941
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,784
Yeah.

942
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,387
Now that your stomach's better.

943
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,356
Yeah. I'm glad.

944
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,525
Hot pot is nice this time of year.

945
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,827
Yeah, for sure.

946
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:33,431
This is kind of a local dish
of Okinawa, right?

947
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,233
Right. This is Agu pork.

948
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:39,738
So, each of us will go to places
from here, right?

949
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,840
-We're going to a lot of places.
-Yes.

950
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,075
What if we keep getting hot pot?

951
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,044
Local hot pot.

952
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,748
So we can taste the local cuisine.

953
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,550
We could go to local restaurants,

954
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:58,623
and we could eat special hot pot
of the region with all the members.

955
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,125
I think that would be fun.

956
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,292
-Like a rule.
-A rule.

957
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,527
That's our only rule.

958
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:03,595
TABI!

959
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,196
TABI, are you listening?

960
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:09,467
What do you think
about the idea of eating hot pot

961
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:14,105
when we go to various places on this trip?

962
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,008
[TABI] That sounds lovely.

963
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,177
-Then where...
-I think it's very good.

964
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,212
Thanks.

965
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,882
So, TABI, you're going to come with us

966
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,317
for our entire journey.

967
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,553
So, when we go to a new place,

968
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:33,258
look up hot pot recommendations
in that area.

969
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:34,926
[TABI] Okay.

970
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:37,162
-Sounds good. Thanks.
-Understood.

971
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,564
-Thanks.
-That's a good rule.

972
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,433
Wonderful.

973
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,171
[TABI] This is how Snow Man and I

974
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:50,241
began our journey across Japan.
