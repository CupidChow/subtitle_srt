00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,972
<i>Traveling with Snow Man.</i>

2
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,577
Wow!

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,484
The ocean!

4
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:18,886
We're by the sea.

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,792
The weather is so iffy.

6
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,228
There might be a typhoon.

7
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,498
- Please don't become a storm.
- I hope it lasts.

8
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,002
Well, this weather
has a charm of its own.

9
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,471
- A charm. Yeah.
- It's a charm.

10
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,506
- Right. So...
- Yeah.

11
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:41,742
- <i>Good morning.</i>
- This... Huh?

12
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,344
Ah. Good morning.

13
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,179
TABI.

14
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:50,384
<i>I look forward to our day together,
Watanabe, Raul.</i>

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,119
Thank you.

16
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,523
- <i>Now let's get on a boat.</i>
- Yeah.

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,991
- Get on a boat.
- A boat?

18
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,994
What you see in front of you there

19
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:02,896
- is Asuka.
- That?

20
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,998
- We'll ride on Asuka...
- Yeah.

21
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,868
...to Matsushima.

22
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,137
Wanna get going, then?

23
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,438
Let's go.

24
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:17,778
Matsushima is one
of the Three Views of Japan, right?

25
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,313
The Three Views?

26
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,615
It really has a splendid view.

27
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,251
It piques my interest.

28
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,153
A healing experience.

29
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:28,889
It's Asuka.

30
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,859
Here we are. Let's sit down.

31
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,762
It's already moving.

32
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,332
You're right.
Hurry. Let's sit here.

33
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,902
Nice. It's fast.

34
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,971
- For sure.
- Speedy.

35
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,039
- Oh!
- Hello.

36
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,674
Thank you for riding today.

37
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:50,711
- Thank you. Pardon me.
- Thank you. Please take a seat.

38
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,313
Your hat is cute.

39
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,448
Thank you.

40
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,817
- A frog? Is it a frog?
- It's a frog.

41
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:57,985
You like frogs?

42
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,853
- I do like frogs.
- Wow.

43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,023
You know, I ain't no good
at standard Japanese.

44
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,726
- That's fine.
- What dialect?

45
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,860
What dialect is that?

46
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,429
This here's how we talk in Matsushima.

47
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,931
I see.

48
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,899
- Like "ain't" and stuff?
- "Ain't."

49
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:18,538
So I'll be tellin' y'all about Matsushima
in my own dialect.

50
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,340
- That all right with y'all?
- Yes.

51
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,276
You're a couple o' cuties.

52
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:27,214
I may be an old lady,
but you've got my heart fluttering.

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,716
- That's sweet of you.
- I'm happy to hear that.

54
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,284
- So handsome.
- That's... Well...

55
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,620
It's our job. But thank you.

56
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,088
How 'bout I be your guide?

57
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,723
You don't mind?

58
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,791
- May I?
- Yes.

59
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,793
We're going to Matsushima now, right?

60
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,528
We're on the way to Matsushima.

61
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:44,631
There are about 260 islands.

62
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,167
Ah. All of those islands
make up Matsushima?

63
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,268
Yep.

64
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,403
People be asking me,

65
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,640
"Is there an island called Matsushima?"

66
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,075
But it's a region name.

67
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,410
- I see.
- Mmm.

68
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,644
Matsushima Bay.

69
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,479
- Amazing.
- It's a miracle.

70
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,783
- It is, to have so many islands.
- For sure.

71
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,452
Gorgeous.

72
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,824
There's one island that's
most popular here in Matsushima Bay.

73
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:11,958
Niojima.

74
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,260
Niojima.

75
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,595
'Cause it looks like a Nio statue.

76
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:16,830
That's why...

77
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,165
- Oh!
- There it is.

78
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,600
- That's it!
- The real thing.

79
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,602
Amazing.

80
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,672
It's facing the open sea.
It's got eyes.

81
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,275
It's even got a cigarette
in its puffy lips.

82
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,177
- Wow.
- Really?

83
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,145
And he's got
a fancy beret on, see?

84
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,981
- It's getting closer.
- Whoa.

85
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,317
Cool.

86
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,553
Wow. I wonder how it formed
into that shape?

87
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,755
It's natural erosion.

88
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,725
Natural erosion.

89
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,927
Wow!

90
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:50,097
- Like the waves whittled it down?
- Right.

91
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,198
Also...

92
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,600
- A lot of black birds are on it.
- Cool.

93
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:57,104
Those birds are called cormorants.
Its Japanese name is a palindrome.

94
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,005
- <i>Umiu?</i>
- It's <i>umiu</i> both ways.

95
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,073
Cormorants.

96
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,609
So which of you would like

97
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,378
to be a bit happier than you are now?

98
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,882
Yeah, we want happiness.
I want to be happy.

99
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,284
Although I'm already happy enough.

100
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,487
You naughty boy.

101
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,789
I'm happy enough already, but...

102
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,324
- If...
- Look at this island.

103
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,692
What is this?

104
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,260
An island that's got four holes.

105
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,328
Oh!

106
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:25,232
- If you can see all four holes at once...
<i>- Shi</i> means four...

107
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,467
...it gives you <i>shiawase,</i> or happiness.

108
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:28,535
Wow.

109
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:33,006
But all four can only be
visible at once for one second.

110
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,208
- At once?
- Look. Right now, on the right.

111
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,444
- One, two, three on the right.
- Just barely. 1, 2...

112
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,479
- It's now. 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Now!

113
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,547
Just now!

114
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,649
I saw it for a second!

115
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:43,717
All done.

116
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,285
- It's over.
- Just a moment.

117
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,354
- Okay? Got it?
- Just barely.

118
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,357
The hole on the right was tiny,
but I barely saw through.

119
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,758
'Cause they're natural.

120
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,495
I looked at Shoppi's piercing hole
when there were three.

121
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,031
I made four that way.

122
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,736
You sure want to force happiness, eh?

123
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,640
<i>Care to go up on the roof?</i>

124
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,677
- The roof?
- The roof?

125
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,612
- Can we go there?
- Yes.

126
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,015
- Let's go to the roof.
- Okay.

127
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,551
Here?

128
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,259
- Wow!
- Wow! Awesome.

129
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,199
Oh! Nice.

130
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,234
This feels nice.

131
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,904
Whoa! The island is getting closer.

132
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,843
- I like the green.
- It's nice.

133
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,211
It's calming.

134
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,346
It's healing.

135
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,916
Besides, the color palette...

136
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,119
- Isn't it autumn-like?
- Yeah. You're right.

137
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,255
It's already autumn
on the calendar.

138
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,893
This feels nice.

139
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:08,735
<i>Matsushima, O Matsushima,
let us eat sushi.</i>

140
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,174
That was so much fun.

141
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,945
- All right. We're here.
- We're here.

142
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,015
- You know...
- The smell.

143
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:23,483
ASUKA

144
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,819
This feels nice.

145
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,691
Awesome.

146
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,094
This is great. The green is pretty.

147
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:40,767
<i>Would you like to see
a national treasure now?</i>

148
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,637
A national treasure?

149
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,707
<i>There is one nearby.</i>

150
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,977
- Let's go see it.
- Let's go.

151
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,013
ZUIGANJI TEMPLE

152
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,915
- We're here already.
- That's it.

153
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:01,788
<i>This is Zuiganji Temple,
which Date Masamune built.</i>

154
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,324
- Zuiganji. Date Masamune?
- Zuiganji.

155
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:05,992
<i>Yes.</i>

156
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,262
Excuse us.

157
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:14,301
- Pretty. Wow.
- Pretty.

158
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,304
Feels nice.

159
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,408
Lovely.

160
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:29,015
Oh, I think I turned into Matsuo Basho
just now for real.

161
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:33,119
- At a loss for words? I get it.
- Yeah.

162
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,888
Of course you'd be at a loss.

163
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,856
- It's too beautiful.
- Yeah.

164
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,925
I mean,
there are no words for this.

165
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,093
Yeah.

166
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:43,697
Wow!

167
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,367
Beautiful.

168
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,103
A national treasure.

169
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:54,841
"The entrance to the worship hall
is this way." To the right.

170
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,143
- I see. We'll go to the right.
- Wow.

171
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,479
- Amazing. For real.
- Cool.

172
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,016
- This is really awesome.
- Yeah.

173
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,354
Hello.

174
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,322
- Hello.
- Hello.

175
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,224
Welcome to Zuiganji Temple.

176
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,059
- Thanks for having us.
- Thank you.

177
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,561
I am Inatomi of Zuiganji Temple.

178
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,329
- Thank you.
- We are Snow Man.

179
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,631
- We're called Snow Man.
- Welcome.

180
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,233
- Thank you.
- Okay.

181
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,936
Let's get started right away.

182
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,606
I'd like to give you a tour
of this building first.

183
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:31,411
This building is a national treasure.
It's the temple kitchen.

184
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,848
- Temple kitchen.
- Where the cooking is done.

185
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,485
It also serves as living quarters.

186
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,552
I see.

187
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:44,090
The gable, or the area
where the roof parts...

188
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,826
There is a carving installed there.

189
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:47,927
I see.

190
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:54,100
It reflects the aesthetic sensibilities
of Date Masamune, the Sengoku warlord,

191
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:58,705
and his passion for the construction
of Zuiganji Temple.

192
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:02,876
This makes it a very valuable place.

193
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,611
Wow.

194
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,313
- Please come inside.
- Amazing.

195
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,882
- May we?
- I'll give you a tour.

196
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,284
Wow. This is a rare opportunity.

197
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,322
- The main hall of Zuiganji.
- Yes.

198
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,926
Yes, it's the main building,
and in 1943...

199
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,027
- 1943.
- Yes.

200
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:24,330
- It was designated a national treasure.
- Wow.

201
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:27,801
Then in 1959,

202
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,937
this temple kitchen, as well as
the hall I am about to show you...

203
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,273
- Okay. The hall is a treasure too?
- Yes.

204
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,774
A national treasure.

205
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,709
<i>They also became
a national treasure.</i>

206
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,144
CORRIDOR

207
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:41,681
<i>This corridor
has a similar grand feeling.</i>

208
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,450
- It's amazing.
- The beams...

209
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,286
- are truly impressive.
- Yes.

210
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,890
- Impressive.
- They too reflect Masamune's sensibility.

211
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,559
Mmm.

212
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,262
- The garden is lovely too.
- What we see here...

213
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,697
Is this a garden?

214
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,165
It is.

215
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,533
Beautiful.

216
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,901
It's a stone garden.

217
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,404
Wow. Cool.

218
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,440
And this is where
the main hall starts.

219
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,109
- I see.
- The main building.

220
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:13,179
The most important place in any temple.

221
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,519
This is the interior of the main hall.

222
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,322
This is indeed a national treasure.

223
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,389
Wow.

224
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,960
I'd first like you to look
at this carved transom.

225
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,761
Awesome.

226
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,432
These pigments
are from 400 years ago.

227
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,834
The fact that these colors
have remained as is...

228
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,136
Wow.

229
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,705
- ...is part of their great value.
- Cool.

230
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,307
Hence their designation
as a national treasure.

231
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,542
Cool.

232
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,878
- But this screen painting...
- Yeah.

233
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,913
On this sliding door here.

234
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,152
It's a detailed reproduction that took
10 years to create starting in 1985.

235
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,586
- I see.
- Mmm.

236
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,455
So it was
reconstructed recently.

237
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,092
- So they really had these vivid colors...
- Yes.

238
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,527
- At the time.
- Indeed.

239
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:04,797
And now we can view the same image
from back then.

240
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,000
I'd like to show you the interior.

241
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,035
- Really?
- Excuse me.

242
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,571
- Excuse me.
- Pardon me.

243
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,073
This is called the Falcon Room.

244
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,676
- Falcon Room.
- Also the Prayer Room.

245
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:17,744
PRAYER ROOM

246
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:22,015
It served as a spare room
for the chief statesmen

247
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,385
- of the Date family.
- I see.

248
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:30,056
What you see
depicted here is a raptor.

249
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:33,860
A raptor is a bird of prey,
such as a hawk or an eagle.

250
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:38,131
- It symbolizes the bravery...
- I see.

251
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:42,402
...and strength
that Date showed as a warrior.

252
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:46,172
As well as his precepts as a warrior.

253
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,408
- Precepts?
- Teachings.

254
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,877
This painting reflects those as well.

255
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,679
Mmm.

256
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,514
Look here, for example.

257
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:58,251
- The falcon is holding down a white bird.
- I see.

258
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:02,789
- Another's hunting a white bird.
- Yes.

259
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:06,226
What do you think
this represents?

260
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,595
- What is it?
- This white bird is the hint.

261
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,730
- The white bird?
- This white bird.

262
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,032
A symbol of peace?

263
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,201
This here is a white heron.

264
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,237
- A white heron.
- Yes.

265
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,138
- Which means?
- A black heron?

266
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,241
You're not too far off.

267
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,944
A warrior must not deceive.

268
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,946
<i>Sagi,</i> deceit,
is a homophone for <i>sagi,</i> heron.

269
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,681
I see!

270
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:33,086
A warrior also must not allow
any deceit to escape him.

271
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,321
So that's what it means.

272
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,824
So to apply it
to you, Snow Man...

273
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,895
You could say
you too must not use deceit and facade.

274
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,398
- That is the lesson here.
- I see.

275
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,000
Very educational.

276
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,335
And then, this pheasant.

277
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:52,138
- Are you familiar with pheasants?
- Yes.

278
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,208
Do you know how a pheasant's cry sounds?

279
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,877
- Have you ever heard one?
- I might not have.

280
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,546
They have
a very high-pitched call.

281
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,949
- I see.
- It reveals where they are.

282
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,017
Yeah.

283
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,287
So this means as a warrior,
you must keep your mouth shut.

284
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,455
Do not say what does not need to be said.

285
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,257
That's all I say.

286
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,625
You're so right.

287
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:16,529
There is a saying, "The pheasant
who does not cry shall not be shot."

288
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,832
It means to not be boastful or conceited

289
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,802
but to listen attentively to others.

290
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,370
Right.

291
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,105
Lessons like this

292
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,174
- are contained within this room.
- Yes.

293
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,376
It's been educational.

294
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,379
Here is the main room.

295
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,482
It is known as the Peacock Room.

296
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,318
Cool.

297
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,187
Would you please join your hands
for a moment here?

298
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,755
- May we?
- Yes.

299
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,096
Hands together.
Please make a bow.

300
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:54,000
Give thanks for our everyday good fortune.

301
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,773
Thank you.

302
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,376
You may enter here as well.

303
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,144
- Really?
- Yes.

304
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,379
We get to go inside.

305
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,681
These floorboards are considered

306
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:12,218
to be the same ones
used in the original construction.

307
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:15,321
It is said Date Masamune himself
walked on these very floorboards.

308
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,990
- Cool.
- Yes.

309
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,827
Please come close to this side.

310
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,995
- Wow, cool.
- This way.

311
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,366
- Cool.
- Awesome.

312
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,135
- I'm getting goosebumps.
- Mmm.

313
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,939
After hearing that Date Masamune

314
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,908
walked on this very floor...

315
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,777
From below, I feel...

316
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,747
- A power? I understand.
- Some kind of energy.

317
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,116
Emanating in great force.

318
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,585
This is a very valuable

319
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,654
area and experience.

320
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,191
Would you like to see
the next room over?

321
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,493
- May we?
- Yes.

322
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,996
- We can go in?
- Right this way.

323
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,265
Pardon me.

324
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,268
- It's so...

325
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,971
Is this...

326
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,841
This hat...

327
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,777
- I've seen it.
- The helmet. Yes.

328
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:15,081
This is the room
where the lord was welcomed into.

329
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:19,552
We were bequeathed
with Date Masamune's armor and helmet.

330
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,356
This is a replica, however.

331
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:28,060
What comes to your mind
when you think of Date Masamune?

332
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,029
- Oh...
- An eyepatch.

333
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,765
- Mmm.
- I see.

334
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,400
As for his eye,

335
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:38,571
there are actually no records
of him wearing an eyepatch.

336
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,240
- I see.
- No official evidence.

337
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:45,845
But looking at this,
it isn't symmetrical.

338
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,513
That is intentional.

339
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,483
It was a last request of Date Masamune.

340
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,153
"To lose this precious body
given to me by my parents,"

341
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,592
"even if lost to an illness,
would be disrespectful to them."

342
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:05,298
He requested that
he be depicted with a right eye

343
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:09,035
in any portraits or statues of him
created after his death.

344
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,304
- Ah. I see.
- Yes.

345
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:17,710
It's really interesting to look at this
while hearing about its backstory.

346
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,378
I'm glad you think so.

347
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,950
<i>I'm really grateful
for the opportunity.</i>

348
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,853
If not for <i>Traveling with Snow Man,</i>

349
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:32,258
I wouldn't have had the chance
to go see Zuiganji on my own.

350
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,462
Let alone being given special permission
to enter rooms

351
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,299
that are usually off-limits.

352
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,703
Having the paintings explained

353
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,339
in modern language as to what they mean,

354
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:52,211
as well as given modern interpretations
of the lessons...

355
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,614
It felt like a place

356
00:16:55,214 --> 00:17:00,887
where, if I ever found myself
carried away as a celebrity,

357
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:05,424
I could go and plant my feet
back on the ground.

358
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,361
It was a moment
that made me reexamine things.

359
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,767
That was stunning.

360
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,770
It really was stunning.
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

361
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,305
To be able to go inside.

362
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,009
- So, by the way...
- Yeah.

363
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,411
Isn't it about time
we were getting hungry?

364
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,779
- Good call.
- Yeah.

365
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,514
I'm starving.

366
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:29,649
MATSUSHIMA SUSHIKOU

367
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:34,186
- Look to the left.
- What's this narrow alley?

368
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,321
SUSHIKOU

369
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,224
It's the sushi place
TABI told us about.

370
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,026
Really? I wanna eat there.

371
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:44,397
<i>It serves sushi toppings
that are hard to come by.</i>

372
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,033
- Rare toppings!
- Rare toppings! I'm interested.

373
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,968
- Let's go.
- Let's go in.

374
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,505
- Excuse me.
- Welcome.

375
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,774
- Excuse me.
- Wow. A counter.

376
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,576
- Awesome.
- Please take a seat.

377
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,777
This kind of system.

378
00:17:58,344 --> 00:17:59,512
Thanks for having us.

379
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,013
- Take a seat.
- Hello.

380
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,416
- First off, can I ask...
- Right.

381
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,517
...what you recommend?

382
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,620
We heard there are unusual...

383
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,722
- rare types of toppings here.
- There are.

384
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,692
- That's what he said.
- So I heard.

385
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,226
Then, first...

386
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,394
Amazing.

387
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,597
- Here you go.
- This is...

388
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,433
- There's salt on top.
- Okay.

389
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,601
So no soy sauce needed.

390
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,336
- As is.
- Have it as is.

391
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,272
- What is this?
- It's a bit unusual.

392
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,873
This is unusual?

393
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,776
I want to guess.

394
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,313
- It's a white fish.
- A white fish.

395
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,581
Let's try it.

396
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:36,649
Go ahead.

397
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,488
Mmm. It tastes good.

398
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,557
It has a chew to it.

399
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,626
It does.

400
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,561
Huh?

401
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,765
What's a rare white fish?

402
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,133
It's rare.

403
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,635
A little long.

404
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,670
- Long?
- A long ingredient.

405
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,606
- Not a deep-sea creature?
- No.

406
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:03,142
It's an ingredient you can find
at average shops

407
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,880
but served raw rather than cooked.

408
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,483
- That's a big hint.
- That's the topping.

409
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,953
- Uncooked?
- Conger eel?

410
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,721
Ding-dong!

411
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:16,956
I see!

412
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,357
It's raw conger eel.

413
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,226
Raw conger eel.

414
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,828
- So this is its texture when raw.
- The texture.

415
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,964
- It's very interesting.
- It's a first.

416
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,499
- Eating it this way.
- It's tasty.

417
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,167
- I'm glad you like it.
- Yeah.

418
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:31,070
Why isn't it served raw more often?

419
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,339
The issue with conger eels is...

420
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:36,709
Only about three in ten conger eels
are tasteless and odorless.

421
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,545
If the environment isn't good,

422
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,814
- it's hard to...
- I see.

423
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,083
- ...get good conger eels.
- Mmm.

424
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,586
When I came back to Miyagi
and filleted a conger eel,

425
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,188
it was very shiny.

426
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,423
I see.

427
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,458
It made me want to eat it as is.

428
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,260
- From the heart.
- Mmm.

429
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,930
And as you can see, it depends...

430
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,598
So that's a conger eel.

431
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,934
...on whether you can cut it

432
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,936
without damaging the organs and vessels.

433
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,371
Wow. So clean.

434
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:08,240
- It takes a lot of skill, then.
- Yes, it does.

435
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,776
As well as peeling the skin.

436
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,778
- A lot of effort.
- A lot of effort.

437
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,050
Next, since we're in Kesennuma, Miyagi...

438
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,418
Oh!

439
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,886
A local specialty.

440
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:21,987
- Local specialty?
- Yes.

441
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,590
- This too...
- As a sushi topping?

442
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:27,259
...has salt on it, so please eat it as is.

443
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,327
Okay.

444
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,463
This is great.

445
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,966
- Kesennuma's specialty.
- Awesome.

446
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,368
Hold on.

447
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,640
Mmm.

448
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,076
- That's good.
- Thank you.

449
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,612
Wow.

450
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,848
- It's tasty.
- It's good with the salt.

451
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,449
It's good. Very good.

452
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,985
This is an uncommon ingredient,

453
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,587
- isn't it?
- It is uncommon.

454
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:59,225
<i>Do you two
go to restaurants together?</i>

455
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,228
Us two?

456
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,997
- Not just us two.
- I don't think so.

457
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,401
Should we?

458
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,137
No...

459
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,039
- Well...
- We could.

460
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,641
We could for sure.

461
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,144
- Right?
- Yeah.

462
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:23,582
<i>What kind of senior is Watanabe
in your eyes, Raul?</i>

463
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,752
- Uh...
- I'm not his senior.

464
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,355
I'm not really his senior.

465
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,323
He's pretty casual...

466
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:35,327
and cool, if I had to say.

467
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,396
Tell me more.

468
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,466
Be specific.

469
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,836
I figured out my type recently.

470
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,372
I like people who don't make drama.

471
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:51,477
- What does that mean?
- Like when things are serious,

472
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,079
they don't make it a bigger deal.

473
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,782
- Not the type of person...
- Yeah.

474
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,952
...who takes serious things
even more seriously

475
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:05,424
or who treats unimportant things
as if they're serious.

476
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,759
Yeah.

477
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,929
Some people do a preface
before they say something good.

478
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,998
Right. I like how you're not like that,

479
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,168
- but more relaxed.
- Casual?

480
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:18,838
- I'm glad.
- Always casual.

481
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,577
I'm embarrassed. Can I have some food?

482
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:25,911
Yes.

483
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,147
<i>We actually
haven't had many situations</i>

484
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,549
<i>where it was just us two.</i>

485
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:33,752
Partly because we talk so much at work,

486
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,822
we don't have much
to talk about elsewhere.

487
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:39,091
Not in a bad way.

488
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:43,162
It was just like,
"Oh, we actually haven't gone out to eat."

489
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,364
So I was kind of...

490
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:48,100
Kind of embarrassed, to be honest.

491
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:54,673
I get embarrassed sometimes,
depending on who I'm with.

492
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,408
Mmm.

493
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,711
Like, when we were eating lunch,

494
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:02,615
the way he was complimenting me.

495
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:07,119
That kind of thing embarrasses me.

496
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:09,788
Just a bit.

497
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,128
But I think
Raul might have been embarrassed too.

498
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,197
I don't know.

499
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:22,501
- Now that we've eaten...
- This?

500
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:26,005
- ...we're going back to Sendai.
- Oh.

501
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,241
So I got a car for us.

502
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:30,709
Thanks, boss!

503
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,445
Get in.

504
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,982
- The driver will be with us.
- Pardon me.

505
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,552
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

506
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:46,158
- This is pretty nice.
- Yeah. It's spacious.

507
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,999
<i>How about some dessert?</i>

508
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,770
That sounds lovely.

509
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:05,177
<i>There is a trendy shaved ice shop
where one serving is over 3,000 yen.</i>

510
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:06,478
3,000 yen?

511
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,681
- 1,000 yen...
- <i>Let's go there.</i>

512
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,282
Let's go.

513
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,519
3,000-yen shaved ice?

514
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,888
That's a lot.

515
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,557
3,000 yen is a lot.

516
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,594
When I think of shaved ice,
it's those food stalls

517
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:26,865
with the pictures of penguins
and the Styrofoam...

518
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,768
- Those.
- 100 yen.

519
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,171
- The 100 or 200-yen range.
- Mmm.

520
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,044
- Are we here?
- We're here!

521
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,247
- Thank you.
- Thanks, driver.

522
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,050
- Here?
- Above.

523
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,056
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

524
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:54,727
- It looks so fancy.
- Yeah.

525
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:58,197
- Shaved ice, right?
- Yes.

526
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:03,035
- I don't mean any offense by this, but...
- Yes?

527
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,236
Yes?

528
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:06,405
- I'm shocked by...
- The price?

529
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:07,873
- ...the price tag.
- Yes.

530
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,108
TAHITIAN VANILLA AND OLIVE OIL

531
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,243
So I'm really
looking forward to trying it.

532
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,745
- Really? I'm glad.
- Yeah.

533
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:13,812
DOUBLE BERRY FROMAGE

534
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,516
It's huge!

535
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,218
Huh?

536
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,254
Pretty.

537
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,191
Here it is!

538
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,260
It's that kind!

539
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:31,330
I'm starting to get it.

540
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:34,033
It'll be fluffy, right?

541
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,268
I'm excited.

542
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,338
It's like it's being sliced.

543
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,008
Huh?

544
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,277
- That's crazy.
- Awesome!

545
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,915
It's like a salon here!

546
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:54,553
Mister, you look like
you're styling hair after being cut.

547
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,660
- He's really piling it on.
- Plenty of it.

548
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,964
- Wow. It's cheese.
- Wow. Cheese!

549
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,236
- Fluffy times fluffy.
- For sure.

550
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:18,410
And our cute and fluffy Shoppi
is going to eat it.

551
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,045
- Wild, huh?
- That's wild.

552
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,781
It's cannibalism.

553
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,751
- Fluffy cannibalism.
- Yeah.

554
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:27,653
Here.

555
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,354
Two.

556
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,657
- So big!
- Awesome.

557
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,126
- Let's eat it together.
- Sounds good.

558
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,662
- There's two spoons.
- Yeah.

559
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,831
Cool!

560
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,833
The cheese smells amazing.

561
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,468
- I'll try it first.
- Okay.

562
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,039
- Yum!
- It's good?

563
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,041
- Try it.
- I'll have a bite.

564
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,944
It's delicious and interesting.

565
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,948
This is good.

566
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,249
What is this?

567
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,918
I can't believe it's shaved ice.

568
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:00,986
I'm glad.

569
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,089
- It's both a dessert...
- Yes.

570
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:06,191
- ...and a meal.
- Right.

571
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:07,726
Thank you.

572
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:11,263
- A chilled meal?
- For sure.

573
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,833
- I understand the price now.
- For sure.

574
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,637
- Thanks for your patience.
- Thank you.

575
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:22,774
Here.
These flecks are vanilla beans.

576
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,309
I see.

577
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,216
This is good!

578
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,118
I'm glad.

579
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,554
- You do like sweets.
- I like sweets.

580
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,624
Try the middle here, Shoppi.

581
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,626
- Dig in like a cave.
- I can dig?

582
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,127
Yeah, dig in.

583
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,962
There's espresso and red bean paste.

584
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,802
Ah. Yeah.

585
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,472
- So grown-up.
- Yeah.

586
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,107
- This one is classy.
- Yeah.

587
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:58,744
It's good.

588
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:00,979
Ah.

589
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,283
Artistic.

590
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,219
Since we saw Matsushima first,

591
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:09,788
I want to make this
into an interesting shape.

592
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,230
Ah.

593
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,132
- Are you full now?
- I am.

594
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,201
- That was pretty filling.
- High volume.

595
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,636
But I didn't notice while eating it.

596
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,339
Thank you. That was good.

597
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:28,507
Thank you.

598
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:34,279
<i>Would you like to see
more of Sendai?</i>

599
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,781
See more of Sendai?

600
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,216
Let's go.

601
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,151
It just started pouring hard.

602
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,719
Yeah.

603
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:45,958
<i>I know of a place where we can
enjoy ourselves despite the rain.</i>

604
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:51,697
Here we are. Our next destination.

605
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,033
SENDAI

606
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,268
Oh.

607
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:57,603
What's this?

608
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:02,274
So big.

609
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:04,743
Amazing.

610
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,779
What is this place?

611
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:11,483
- This is the visitor center.
- I see.

612
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,618
Mmm.

613
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:16,755
It says Tanabata Festival here.
Are these from that?

614
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:20,459
Yes.
These are of the streamer type.

615
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,562
Traditionally, there are seven types.

616
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:27,966
- Streamers are the most popular.
- They are?

617
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,034
How cute.

618
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,502
Very cute.

619
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:33,905
- There are a lot of souvenirs.
- A souvenir shop.

620
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:38,310
Iconic Sendai and Miyagi goods
and traditional crafts

621
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:43,015
combined with modern elements
are sold here.

622
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,449
<i>Kokeshi</i> dolls.

623
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,719
- A specialty here.
- Are <i>kokeshi</i> from Sendai?

624
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,755
Maybe I'll buy a <i>kokeshi.</i>

625
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,558
Cute. There are so many kinds.

626
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,261
Do you see one you like?

627
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,431
I can never decide
with these things.

628
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:03,135
This one says "Sendai specialty <i>kokeshi."</i>

629
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:06,071
- A <i>zunda kokeshi.</i> That's cute.
- Cute!

630
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,506
This is so cute.

631
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,109
I want this.

632
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,514
Stop talking like that, seriously.

633
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,682
I want this.

634
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,052
- For a decoration?
- In the bathroom.

635
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,358
I'm buying this.

636
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,895
- I haven't looked at souvenirs...
- Yeah.

637
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,397
Not often lately.

638
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,367
- When we went to places.
- Yeah.

639
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,536
- Okay.
- Thank you.

640
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,305
Got a <i>zunda kokeshi.</i>

641
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:41,940
Go!

642
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:44,409
<i>That was a good shopping trip.</i>

643
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,047
<i>Now the customary hot pot!</i>

644
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,216
- Right, we all eat hot pot.
- That's right.

645
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:52,284
BEEF TONGUE
KISUKE

646
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,954
- The shop TABI told us about.
- It's already written here.

647
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,157
Beef tongue hot pot? Let's go in.

648
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,160
Excuse me.

649
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,896
Good evening.

650
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,299
Today Raul has...

651
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,801
- Hosted you.
- Been a good host.

652
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,869
How was it?

653
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:12,971
- It was the best.
- Mmm.

654
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,907
And, well...

655
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,611
a little embarrassing.

656
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:21,847
- Right.
- But weren't you embarrassed too?

657
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,081
I am.

658
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:28,053
Cheers to embarrassment in Sendai!

659
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,855
- Good work today!
- You too.

660
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:33,425
Mmm.

661
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,094
So...

662
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:38,663
- I analyzed why I was embarrassed.
- Yeah.

663
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,534
And this is something I say a lot...

664
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:47,939
People who joke around a lot
tend to be pretty serious on the inside.

665
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:51,009
- Your theory. Right.
- My theory.

666
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,979
Just a theory. So...

667
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,415
You were joking around while hosting me.

668
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,516
Yeah.

669
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,184
- While hosting me.
- Yeah.

670
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:05,123
And I know how serious you usually are,
so... you know?

671
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,626
- The gap?
- The gap, yeah.

672
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,662
There aren't many scenes
of us two not joking around.

673
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:13,131
- We joke around all the time.
- Right.

674
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:14,733
Just recently,

675
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,735
the two of us did a location shoot.

676
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:19,371
And seeing you differently
was a bit embarrassing.

677
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,439
For sure.

678
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,809
It was like that joking mode

679
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,578
got turned off for a bit.

680
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:32,384
And I think that goes to show
how traveling can reveal your raw self.

681
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:34,286
Yeah.

682
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:37,989
We're good friends, but actually,

683
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,894
we haven't gone traveling together.

684
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:46,364
So on our first trip...

685
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,467
- This is how it turns out.
- Right.

686
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,701
I get what you mean.

687
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,270
We had a proper trip, then.

688
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,638
- Right.
- In that sense.

689
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:58,443
<i>Each pairing
has a different flavor to it.</i>

690
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,347
I think our shape-shifting nature
is what makes Snow Man interesting.

691
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:06,151
How our characters change
depending on the pairing.

692
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:10,922
There are members that are never shaky,
and some that are.

693
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,059
That's what makes traveling so good.

694
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,864
You learn about the members
all over again.

695
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,733
I thought I knew all about them,

696
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,338
but in this kind of situation,
I see new sides of them.

697
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,874
That's interesting in itself.

698
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,443
When you don't know
what's going to happen...

699
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:36,381
I want to see the other pairs
as a mere viewer,

700
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:40,051
and I'm curious what would happen
if I was in other pairings.

701
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:42,554
It's strange.

702
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,691
- Wow!
- Wow! Pretty!

703
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,294
Thanks for waiting.
Here's your beef tongue shabu-shabu.

704
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,829
- Cool!
- Awesome!

00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:51,930
PREMIUM BEEF TONGUE

706
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,732
Looks good.

707
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,534
I think it's ready.

708
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,870
- Let's go!
- Let's eat!

709
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,642
- It's already done.
- Already.

710
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,546
- Already done.
- Let's eat.

711
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,047
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

712
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:11,483
- As is first.
- Time to eat.

713
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,518
Time to eat.

714
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:21,927
- Awesome. Yum!
- Yum!

715
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,097
- Nice.
- Delish!

716
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,734
This might be gone in no time.

717
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,102
Yeah, it goes down fast.

718
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:33,305
With green onions now.

719
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:35,106
Nice.

720
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,180
It's so nice.

721
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,182
It's good.

722
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,785
- The food in Tohoku is so good.
- Yeah.

723
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,725
<i>With your next trip,
you will have crossed all of Japan.</i>

724
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,694
- Ah. You're right.
- Right.

725
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,765
The nine of us back in Okinawa,

726
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:05,770
and when we all meet again in Hokkaido,
I'll bet...

727
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,906
It'll feel totally different, I'm sure.

728
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:11,142
Things can change in such a short time.

729
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,877
- It's like...
- Things change.

730
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,880
I think...

731
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,517
the group will have
a different atmosphere.

732
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:21,620
I can see that.

733
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,956
- What will we do last?
- What'll we do in Hokkaido?

734
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:29,494
<i>Let's meet again in Hokkaido.</i>

735
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:32,464
In Hokkaido. Thanks for everything, TABI.

736
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,898
Thank you.

737
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,030
Traveling with Snow Man!
