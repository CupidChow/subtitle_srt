- Jaws. Jaws.
- Good job.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,516
Hold on. Too fast.

5
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:18,252
How far are we going here?

6
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:19,553
Well...

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,455
I'm running away in this.

8
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,892
- From reality?
- Escaping reality.

9
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,160
Awesome.

10
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:31,064
Back in Tokyo,

11
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,833
- it was so hot.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,335
- But it's not here.
- Right. It's fine here.

13
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,437
Is it because of the elevation?

14
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,906
We're up pretty high.

<i>It is the second-highest
elevated lake in Japan.</i>

18
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,752
I see. So that's why.

19
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,354
The breeze feels nice.

20
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,559
Isn't it nice being outdoors?

21
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,262
You can almost taste it.
Look at all the mountains around.

22
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,101
Awesome. It's the great outdoors.

23
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,336
It is.

00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,772
It's Gunma today, yes?

25
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:15,208
I don't have many opportunities
to come to Gunma.

26
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,845
So I want to enjoy the restaurants.

27
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,315
- We can get good food while we're here.
- Yeah.

28
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,849
And then...

29
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,985
We can ask TABI if we don't know things.

00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,453

- Yeah.

<i>Would you like to try

I would.

39
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,304
That's unexpected. Pasta.

40
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,506
Nice. You're doing well.

41
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:49,176
Not bad at all.

- All right.

- Going home already?
- Yeah, wanna go to Tokyo?

56
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,748
You know, Traveling with Snow Man...

57
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,217
doesn't feel like work at all.

58
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,153
- I know what you mean.
- Yeah, isn't it nice?

59
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,058
It's like we're just on vacation

60
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,926

So I read the script closely.

63
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,670
I peruse,
and if there are any guest stars,

64
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:54,374
I look up their birthdays
and hobbies and stuff

65
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:59,813
as much as I can before recording.

66
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,417
That's my personal rule for doing MC.

67
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,821
But today, I'm leaving it to Date.

68
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:11,291
Yesterday too, the vibe was that Date...

69
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,460
would take the lead.

70
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,896
So I got plenty of sleep.

71
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:17,964

72
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,800

The event sounds like
that one comedy show.

79
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,023
- Sounds great.
- "King of Conte."

80
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,659
King of... King of Pasta?

81
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:49,262
I'm really hungry
even though I had a bento this morning.

82
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,363
Me too.

83
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,802

We're here, Date. Bambina.

87
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,112

88
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,580
Yeah, let's.

89
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,115
Ouch. It's really hot.

90
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,751
No way. I mean...

91
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,253

93
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:16,890

- Hello. Welcome.
- Hello. Thank you.

95
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,329
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

96
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,198
I heard about the "King of Pasta."

97
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,533
- It's written there.
- Yes.

98
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,770
- "2023 King of Pasta winner."
- Yes.

99
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,671
- Is this...
- That?

100
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,240
- That's here?
- It is.

101
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,042
All of the dishes we entered
into King of Pasta

102
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,145
are in that menu.

103
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,980
- In here?
- They're all in here.

104
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,282
- So many.
- Yes.

105
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,284
- This is 2024. Last year.
- It's new.

106
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,419
The tomato Genovese

107
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,289
- and the shrimp Geno pasta.
- Yes.

108
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,824
These look good!

109
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,392
Is this real?

110
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,994
- So many.
- I want this.

111
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,762
- You'll like it.
- This one...

112
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,265
- You love scallop pasta.
- I'll like it for sure.

113
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,300
Then I'll have the latest addition.

114
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,068
- Okay.
- The tomato Genovese.

115
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,870
- So it's tomato...
- Yes.

116
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,238
- And what?
- Genovese?

117
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,040
And Genovese sauce. Yes.

118
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:08,942
CHOOSE PASTA SIZE

119
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,877
- 2024. What?
- Wow.

120
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,445
What's this?

121
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,649
- Which is best?
- 100 grams of dry pasta is the standard.

122
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,618
We used dry pasta
in the King of Pasta competition.

123
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,520
- I see.
- If you choose fresh pasta,

124
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,990
it's 50 grams more
and has a doughier texture.

125
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:27,427
For the tomato Genovese,
I think fresh pasta is better.

126
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,529
It picks up the sauce and is more tender.

127
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,498
You got the large!

128
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,733
- As for me...
- Yes.

129
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,335
I mean...

130
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,270
That one for sure, right?

131
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,139
- Large?
- Yes.

132
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,174
- Okay.
- Let's send it.

133
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,709
- Order received.
- Thank you.

134
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,711
- I'll bring it out soon.
- Thank you.

135
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,214
- Wow.
- Such a sonorous voice.

136
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,348
Amazing.

137
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,151
So this is the place...

138
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,387
...that won the King of Pasta.

139
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,990
- Such a sonorous voice.
- Resonant.

140
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,059
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

141
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,961
Here is your large fresh tomato pasta.

142
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,495
Awesome.

143
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,065
It's drowning in Genovese sauce.

144
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,400
- It's like pasta soup.
- Awesome.

145
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,835
You're right.

146
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,771
The visual appearance of a dish
is really important too.

147
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:12,873
- It's a contest.
- Yeah.

148
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,942
Here is your large scallop, soy sauce,
butter and lemon pasta.

149
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,210
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

150
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,445
Thank you.

151
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,682
Isn't this crazy?

152
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,819
- Should I squeeze the lemon?
- Looks that way.

153
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,188
Yeah, looks that way.

154
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,689
- That sounds like that TUBE song.
- Yeah.

156
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,529

All right.

158
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,467
- You start, Date.
- Here goes.

159
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,703
- But today's spotlight...
- Right.

160
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,871
Then I'll go first.

161
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,773
- That was loud. Sorry.
- You startled me.

162
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,743
- Scallop, butter, soy sauce.
- Yes.

163
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,244
- Time to try it.
- Okay.

164
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:02,022
Well, that was a good meal. Really.

165
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,790
- Done already?
- Of course not.

166
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:07,227
- I thought scallops with soy sauce...
- Yeah.

167
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,262
...would be more like Japanese...

168
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,364
- Japanese-style pasta?
- Exactly.

169
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,068
I wonder if this on the side
is chili pepper.

170
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,303
Paprika powder?

171
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,904
- No, it's spicy.
- Spicy?

172
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:21,508
This stuff is in the soup,
so it's a little spicy.

173
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:25,745
It's a new type of Japanese-style pasta.

174
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,014
This will leave an impression on me.

175
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,749
It's delicious.

176
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,519
- I think that's 2024, Date.
- Yeah.

177
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,322
Tomato Genovese.

178
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,791
Time to try it.

179
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,359
It's really hot.

180
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,565
Is it good?

181
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,002
Well, it's tomato.

182
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,074
- It's good!
- I bet.

183
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,276
It must be,
for you to savor it for so long.

184
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,979
The base is Genovese sauce...

185
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,914
- With tomatoes?
- I taste tomato too.

186
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,183
And a kick from the garlic.

187
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,719
Also, the pasta!

188
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,822
- It's a good fit?
- It's soft.

189
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,190
Mine...

190
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,926
- It's a little thin.
- Yeah, since it's dry pasta.

191
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,461
It's different.

192
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,630
This is delicious.

193
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,033
It's so creamy.

194
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,668
- No way.
- Yeah.

195
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,037
Try this, Date.

196
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,140
- Okay.
- You can use this.

197
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,708
- I'll have some.
- Yeah.

198
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:30,744
Here goes.

199
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,349
This is good.

200
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,953
- Yeah.
- It's good.

201
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,288
- Isn't it new?
- Yeah.

202
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,290
This Japanese-style pasta...

203
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,860
- With an ethnic flavor.
- For sure.

204
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,763
I didn't know the word "ethnic."

205
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:53,066
I think that fits perfectly. Ethnic.

206
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:59,906
<i>Takasaki is famously the number one
producer of Daruma dolls in Japan.</i>

207
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,641
I see.

208
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,310
<i>Would you like to visit
the birthplace of Daruma dolls,</i>

209
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:08,648
<i>Syorinzan Darumaji?</i>

210
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,017
- Okay.
- Sure.

211
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:16,723
That's good.

212
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,698
That was a good meal.

213
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:27,967
NATIONAL ROUTE 18

214
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,543
SYORINZAN TEMPLE
BUS STOP

215
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,745
What is this place?

216
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,247
Here we are.

217
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,317
Look at those stairs.

218
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,652
The stairs look huge.

219
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:46,719
SYORINZAN DARUMAJI

220
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,922
- I can't see ahead.
- I'm scared already.

221
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,157
It looks awesome.

222
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,027
So impressive.

223
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,529
- Can we make it?
- We just ate.

224
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,597
Can we do it?

225
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,202
So cool!

226
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,904
- All right.
- Let's go.

227
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,005
SYORINZAN

228
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,807
Some post-meal exercise.

229
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,876
- Let's go.
- Cool.

230
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,679
- Pardon us.
- Excuse us.

231
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,316
Awesome.

232
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,053
I bet we'll feel some energy here.

233
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,288
I bet we'll feel some energy.

234
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,057
Stop the TABI impression.

235
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:28,528
That was a good tomato Genovese.

236
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:29,796
My mouth...

237
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,698
I still taste scallops.

238
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,703
Oh no. My legs.

239
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,173
My legs feel like boulders.

240
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,374
Hold on.

241
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,114
About 60 more steps.

242
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,383
I'm about ready to go home, bro.

243
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,853
- Bro?
- Bro.

244
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,955
Is this the place?

245
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,425
- Oh. Hello.
- Oh my.

246
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,627
- Hello.
- Hello.

247
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,028
- Hello.
- Hello.

248
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,864
Thank you for visiting Syorinzan Darumaji.

249
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,867
- So this is the place.
- I'm Isshin, the deputy head priest.

250
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,502
Those stairs were amazing.

251
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,070
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

252
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,741
I'm going to have you walk up
even higher.

253
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:15,909
- Wait...
- A bit more.

254
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,711
- Hold on.
- First, greet the principal image.

255
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,580
- Greet.
- That's important. Of course.

256
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,884
Maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but...

257
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,587
But an escalator would...

258
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,022
Let's go up the stairs.

259
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,559
This is the main building
with the principal image.

260
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,028
Amazing.

261
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,337
There are also
many Daruma dolls...

262
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,805
- Amazing.
- ...on both sides.

263
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,941
These Daruma dolls...

264
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,776
These Daruma dolls

265
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,945
came from owners whose wishes came true.

266
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,914
- So they were returned?
- Yes.

267
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,216
- For a year...
- Eyes open.

268
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,918
- ...you enshrine a Daruma doll...
- Yes.

269
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:02,155
...at home or in the workplace,
and if it grants your wish,

270
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,525
- you open its eyes and dedicate it here.
- I see.

271
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,926
We do a ceremony for them.

272
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,962
- These Darumas are waiting for it.
- I see.

273
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,432
- What now?
- You can ring it.

274
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,234
Ring the one in the middle.

275
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,238
I want to do it too.

276
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,639
Twice.

277
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,622
- Thank you.
- Awesome.

278
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:36,990
Amazing.

279
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,159
This way. Our Daruma museum is here.

280
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:43,162
- A Daruma museum.
- Awesome.

281
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,034
This is the conferment place.

282
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,737
- You can receive amulets...
- Excuse me.

283
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,240
...or Daruma dolls
according to the wish you've presented.

284
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,042
Wait. They're here.

285
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,145
There's pink, green, and blue.
Isn't that perfect?

286
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,314
- Perfect.
- One for each of us.

287
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,850
- That's uncommon.
- It is.

288
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,752
Should we get one for everyone?

289
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,487
Let's get one for everyone.

290
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,322
- Let's buy them.
- Let's.

291
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,924
There are so many goods.

292
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,326
- Amazing.
- Yes.

293
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,761
Pretty.

294
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:15,862
Beautiful.

295
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,598
This is the Daruma museum.

296
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,969
- This is the museum.
- This is so cool.

297
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,273
Bodhidharma has followers
all over the nation.

298
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,511
So these are Bodhidharmas
made with local materials.

299
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:35,581
- There are so many Daruma shapes.
- What about Tokyo?

300
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,150
- Tokyo is...
- The cat Daruma.

301
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,485
Also,
the Hachioji mustache Daruma.

302
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,553
Hachioji.

303
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,588
- Here's the cat Daruma.
- I see it.

304
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,691
- You're right.
- There's two. No, three.

305
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,827
- Cool.
- This is Gunma Prefecture?

306
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,796
- That's the one you usually see.
- Right.

307
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,897
- For sure.
- It is.

308
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,800
Takasaki Daruma dolls
make up 80% of Daruma dolls

309
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,768
- in the whole nation.
- I see.

310
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,637
TAKASAKI DARUMA

311
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,106
At this temple, you can draw your own

312
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:04,010
Takasaki Daruma doll's face if you want.

313
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,279
You can make a one-of-a-kind

314
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,980
- Daruma doll.
- Awesome.

315
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,816
- I'll lead the way.
- Thank you.

316
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,384
There are so many varieties.

317
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,121
- TABI could be there too.
- No way.

318
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,796
You can select your Daruma here

319
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,198
and paint it.

320
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,532
DARUMA PAINTING

321
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,768
- Hello. Thank you.
- Hello. Thanks.

322
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,504
It really is.

323
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,872
- This way.
- Here.

324
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,173
What do you...

325
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,274
1000 YEN

326
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,509
Awesome. What do I do?

327
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,379
Well, purple and red, right?

328
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,147
- Of course.
- Yeah.

329
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,750
It's still at this stage.

330
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:47,053
- It's not painted yet.
- This will be tricky.

331
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,855
You can write letters on in gold.

332
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,590
- You can write letters?
- Yes.

333
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,796
Allow me to walk you through.

334
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,932
Takasaki Darumas have
particular facial features.

335
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,367
The eyebrows here

336
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,469
- are shaped like cranes.
- They are.

337
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:04,804
- I see.
- Cranes. Yes.

338
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,639
Cranes facing each other.

339
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,041
Yes. And a turtle mustache.

340
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,144
Cranes and turtles.

341
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,347
The nose is the turtle heads,
and the legs become the shells.

342
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,448
Interesting.

343
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:19,118
The turtles also face each other.
The cranes and turtles form the face.

344
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,887
I see. Thank you.

345
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:24,690
I'll reference this.
I want to draw this on mine for sure.

346
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,059
- Let's try it.
- Let's.

347
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,730
But the round dots are hard.

348
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,077
I'll do it like this.

349
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,381
Draw it that far and then paint over it...

350
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,984
I can't talk while painting.

351
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:56,055
I get it. I'm sorry.

352
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,959
I want it to be stronger.

353
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,494
This is really fun.

354
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,496
- I made the nose tall.
- Where?

355
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,598
It's like kabuki makeup.

356
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,366
It's got kabuki makeup on.

357
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,204
And the gold...

358
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,005
Here I go.

359
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,008
This is tricky.
I can write as much as I want.

360
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,781
I doubt many people
write this character here.

361
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,282
What is it?

362
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,919
No. They don't.

363
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,387
That's so you.

364
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,559
<i>What is your biggest wish
right now?</i>

365
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,163
My wish?

366
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,565
For <i>Traveling with Snow Man...</i>

367
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,369
to go overseas.

368
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,972
Next year.

369
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,674
To go travel overseas.

370
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,377
<i>I'd love to go.</i>

371
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,546
Yeah. Let's do that.

372
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,083
These days, I don't make a wish

373
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,485
- as often as I used to.
- Yeah.

374
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,722
It's hard to find a good timing.

375
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,725
Up until our debut,
we had to do what we had to do.

376
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,059
The work in front of us.

377
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,529
We had no choice.

378
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:13,766
I've visited temples and shrines
to pray, of course.

379
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,237
But when I went, I never said,

380
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,640
"I want to debut."

381
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,643
You can't make it happen by praying.

382
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,177
- I get it.
- You know?

383
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,680
You don't know if that alone

384
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,549
- will bring things together.
- Yeah.

385
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:33,486
When it came to that,
I just had to put in hard work,

386
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,454
considering my goals at the time.

387
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:39,392
- Though I wished sometimes, you know.
- Of course.

388
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,462
There it is.

389
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,266
I'm taking this home for sure!

390
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,470
I'm taking this home for sure.

391
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:52,605
I'm done.

392
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,708
Ready, go!

393
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,745
DATE-SAMA
KIND

394
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,013
Both of them are good.

395
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,482
- Very nice.
- They're good in their own ways.

396
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,986
- This says Date-sama?
- Yes.

397
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,424
- Ones with writing like this...
- Yeah.

398
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,459
- You see them sometimes, right?
- Yes.

399
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,895
- Or get them as presents.
- For sure.

400
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,763
But if I'm painting it myself...

401
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,700
- Yeah, painting.
- I wanted to write my name.

402
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,767
Awesome.

403
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,870
I really think
this nickname of "Date-sama"...

404
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,240
really suits you.

405
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,910
It's short and sweet.
And it has a strong ring to it.

406
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,379
- It's not common, right?
- Right.

407
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,348
To be nicknamed with "sama."

408
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,117
For mine, I kept it simple
and just wrote "kind."

409
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,285
- Kind.
- Yes.

410
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:42,555
It's not something
I'm conscious of all the time,

411
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,958
but it represents how I want to be.

412
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,027
It means that I want to keep in mind

413
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:50,429
- this feeling in the future.
- Good wish.

414
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,064
- That's a good word.
- Yeah.

415
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,034
- This was really fun.
- Yeah.

416
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:57,169
- It felt meditative.
- Yeah.

417
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,307
We can perform
an eye-opening ceremony if you'd like.

418
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:04,610
It would imbue these Daruma dolls
with souls.

419
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,245
- Yes, that sounds good.
- Okay.

420
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,780
- Then I'll lead.
- Okay.

421
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:08,848
Thank you.

422
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,485
It's been on my mind
the whole time.

423
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,586
Me too.

424
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,522
Since they have
all of our colors, let's buy one for each.

425
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,124
- Let's.
- Let's buy them.

426
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,127
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

427
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,228
EYE-OPENING CEREMONY

428
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,598
We'll start by making wishes
for the two that you made.

429
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:31,337
Then we'll imbue all of them
with souls as well.

430
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:35,074
Please put your hands together.

431
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,544
Thank you.

432
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:18,084
Each one of these has been imbued
with a soul through these tiny dots.

433
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,720
Now that their eyes are open,

434
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:25,624
you may imbue them with your wishes more
and draw them larger.

435
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,294
- Good work.
- Thank you.

436
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,796
I'm making the eyes bigger
as soon as I get home.

437
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,035
- It's getting dark already.
- It is.

438
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:37,803
What now?

439
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,942
<i>What do you two usually discuss?</i>

440
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,111
What do we discuss?

441
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,445
We were just talking.

442
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,247
Yeah. So...

443
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,549
What do we usually talk about?

444
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:56,388
While we're working,
we usually talk about work.

445
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,857
But usually...

446
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,761
we both like to shop.

447
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,829
For sure. Shopping.

448
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,832
So we talk about what we bought.

449
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:10,736
Date has liked it for a long time.

450
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,873
- I got into it a few years ago.
- Right.

451
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,241
You know the thing.

452
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,476
- Thrifting is the best.
- Yeah, thrifting.

453
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,845
So if it's something Date is wearing,

454
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:22,848
- I'll ask, "What's this?"
- Yeah.

455
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,850
- "I found this at a store."
- Right.

456
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:28,754
Now that I like thrifting,

457
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,756
- we talk about it more.
- We do.

458
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,392
- Over the past few years and months.
- Right.

459
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,662
<i>So you two like thrifting.</i>

460
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,297
- Yes.
- I like thrifting.

461
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:39,398
Thrifting, huh?

462
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:44,804
<i>There are some good
new thrift stores in Takasaki.</i>

463
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,206
- There are?
- New ones?

464
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:49,675
<i>My next recommendation for you...</i>

465
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:50,776
For real?

466
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:53,946
<i>-...is to visit the store GOODY.</i>

467
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,915
GOODY?

468
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,818
I know that place.

469
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,453
- GOODY? That's famous.
- I know it.

470
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,657
Cool. I've wanted to go.

471
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:08,494
- I've heard the name, but...
- Right.

472
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:11,363
- ...it's hard...
- To find the time, right?

473
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,932
I haven't been, so I'm glad.

474
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,136
This is great.
I was just looking at it online.

475
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,604
- On social media?
- Yeah.

476
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,607
- If you would, driver.
- Please.

477
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,309
Understood.

478
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,982
- They have long clothes, right?
- Yeah.

479
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,151
I'm interested in that.

480
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,255
- Right at the same time.
- Our yawns.

481
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:40,092
I don't usually yawn
during on-location filming.

482
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,394
- Me neither.
- What's up with this?

483
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,231
This doesn't usually happen.

484
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,398
Feeling free...

485
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,567
I rarely see that.

486
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,071
<i>What I was really glad
to see today is...</i>

487
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,374
Date-sama is always Date-sama, you know?

488
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:58,944
He's Date-sama on and off camera.

489
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:02,381
And when we were in the car today,

490
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:06,151
I looked over and he was yawning
at the exact same time as me.

491
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:11,056
It's not that I think
he's always being polite with me,

492
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,892
but at that moment,

493
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:17,396
I saw how Date-sama
was being his real self.

494
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:21,367
He was really feeling at home with me.

495
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,568
I could tell.

496
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,537
That was my favorite thing today.

497
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,940
I think we're here.

498
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,775
- We're here.
- Thank you.

499
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,543
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

500
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,245
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

501
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:34,346
Thank you.

502
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,015
GOODY.

503
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,817
- I have a feeling we'll be here a while.
- Yes.

504
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,253
Coming in.

505
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,454
Excuse us.

506
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,189
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

507
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,793
All of a sudden...

508
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,562
I'd like this one first.

509
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:51,897
- Too fast.
- No, no.

510
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:55,768
- Too fast.
- I mean, I saw it as soon as I walked in.

511
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,569
- Which one?
- This.

512
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:00,973
Big Mac?

513
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,976
It seems like something you'd like.

514
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:07,112
Checkered button-down shirts
aren't that common.

515
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,380
I get you.

516
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,849
I just had a feeling about this.

517
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,851
- It's captured your heart?
- Yeah.

518
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,820
I like the color
of this one too.

519
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,589
- I can see you liking that.
- Yeah.

520
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,358
Isn't this so good?

521
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,694
- I'll try this on later.
- Okay.

522
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,595
- Just check the size.
- Yeah.

523
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,898
- Can I look at this?
- I'd like to look.

524
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,868
- Isn't this area good too?
- Yeah.

525
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,303
The Hawaiian shirts.

526
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,006
Isn't this so cute?

527
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,344
How do I...

528
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,481
- That was fast.
- No, I'm just browsing for now.

529
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:45,751
Seeing what I'll try on.
There are a lot I could try.

530
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,121
I like how they're sorted.

531
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,522
Me too.

532
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,257
This one's interesting too.

533
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,394
It is interesting.

534
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,896
Yes.

535
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,065
- You'd like these.
- Yes.

536
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,300
Wait a second.

537
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,371
You'd like these.

538
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,839
I found CL.

539
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,008
- Who?
- CL.

540
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,409
- CL?
- 2NE1.

541
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,179
CL from 2NE1.

542
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,547
They have CL.

543
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,116
I think I'll get it.

544
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,384
It's hangul.

545
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,685
I think you'll get it.

546
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,855
They have KISS too.

547
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,823
It's a concert tee.

548
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:29,962
- Also...
- A 2016 CL concert tee.

549
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,431
- KISS too.
- Yeah, there's also KISS.

550
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,867
How many should I try on?

551
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,135
GUNS.

552
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,236
GUNS?

553
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,872
Yes.

554
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,574
A little small?

555
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:44,977
This is...

556
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,882
This place is fun.

557
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:51,950
Wanna go up a floor?

558
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,018
Let's check it out.

559
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,187
- I wanna see.
- What's there?

560
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:57,556
- Is it the same stuff?
- I think.

561
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,059
- But the vibe is different.
- Yeah?

562
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,294
It is a bit different.

563
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,197
That's right.

564
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:08,534
- TABI mentioned earlier...
- Hmm?

565
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,104
There are new thrift shops here.

566
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,472
- In Takasaki?
- Yeah.

567
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,441
More are opening?

568
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,675
Yes, more are opening.

569
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:21,713
- I can't say for sure why that is.
- Okay.

570
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,415
But definitely.

571
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:26,051
- Really?
- More are opening.

572
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:27,419
I see. So...

573
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,922
How long has this shop been open?

574
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,790
18 years as of this year.

575
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:33,225
- 18 years?
- Yes.

576
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,526
18 years.

577
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,663
- Mmm.
- So that makes it more...

578
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,264
- It's an elder.
- An elder.

579
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,999
No, not quite.

580
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,734
- There are others?
- Yes, older ones.

581
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,236
We're not the oldest.

582
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:45,704
- So there are newer ones.
- Yes.

583
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:49,708
Compared to about 10 years ago,

584
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,111
there are a lot more.

585
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,480
Is this a remake?
Or an original?

586
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,682
It's an original.

587
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:01,153
- It's cute.
- The owner kept repairing it.

588
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,556
It's a French work jacket.

589
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:08,193
- French.
- This is really nice.

590
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:11,196
- I like this too.
- This black.

591
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,365
Isn't the black nice?

592
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:14,800
The black is nice.

593
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,235
This black is cool.

594
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,703
- Isn't it cool?
- It is.

595
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,204
It's the coolest thing here.

596
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:20,405
- The black?
- Yes.

597
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,875
It's placed
right at the top of the stairs.

598
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,511
You're right. Would you get this for me?

599
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,179
Sure. I'll get it for you.

600
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:31,783
With things like this,
people do patchwork or mend it.

601
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,019
- Yes.
- Which was more common back then?

602
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,121
- Blue was more common.
- Blue?

603
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:40,659
Black work jackets
were for particular jobs.

604
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:44,329
So there weren't many of these made.

605
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,431
It's one of the rarer vintage pieces.

606
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,634
- So that's why it's cool.
- Yes.

607
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,837
And it goes with anything.

608
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:53,005
- Nice.
- Exactly.

609
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,040
- I'll try it on.
- That one? Okay.

610
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:56,575
- Okay, I'm trying it on.
- Okay.

611
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:57,876
- Here goes.
- Going for it.

612
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,445
- Maybe I'll try the blue.
- I get you.

613
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,780
- It's cool too.
- Yeah.

614
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:05,651
<i>I hope it fits him.</i>

615
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,887
It's extra large. XL.

616
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,560
I like this.

617
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,263
Throw it on top...

618
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:21,433
I'm buying this.

619
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:24,503
This one next.

620
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:27,940
I see.

621
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,543
It's a little small.

622
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,612
- Too small?
- This one.

623
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,382
The Hawaiian shirt was perfect.

624
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,017
- It was good?
- Yeah. Perfect.

625
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,920
- Okay.
- A little oversized.

626
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,556
- Let's go for the big one.
- Let's do it.

627
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,358
Go for it.

628
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,631
- Plenty of room.
- That looks good.

629
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:53,732
There's room.

630
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,369
- This has plenty of room. This is...
- Yes.

631
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,471
Which one is bigger?

632
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,640
Want to try this one on too?
Here you go.

633
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:03,709
- They're different.
- They are.

634
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,411
- They have different tags.
- Yes.

635
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,914
- The shine...
- This one is bigger.

636
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:09,982
It's bigger?

637
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,684
Maybe bigger is better.

638
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,153
- This one might be better.
- Yeah.

639
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,856
- I like this one.
- I agree.

640
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,025
- Want to try the blue?
- Yes.

641
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,293
Okay. Here you go.

642
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,129
- Is it small?
- Maybe.

643
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:26,832
It might be small.

644
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,467
Hold on...

645
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,636
- The way it comes out is cool.
- Yeah.

646
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,137
I wanted to show it off.

647
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:33,472
I see. I like it.

648
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,007
But the arms...

649
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,375
- It's cool.
- It is.

650
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,776
It's very cool.

651
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,481
- It's just a little small.
- True.

652
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,284
I'll get the Hawaiian and the black one.

653
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,418
- Thank you.
- Yes.

654
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,120
- Thank you.
- And Date, the CL...

655
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,554
- The CL.
- The CL.

656
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,656
Yes.

657
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,190
- Can I try it on?
- Yes.

658
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,594
It's CL.

659
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:58,363
- It's CL.
- It's CL.

660
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,265
- This is good.
- Yeah.

661
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,400
And uncommon, right?

662
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,834
- Basically.
- Yeah.

663
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,637
- It's a little long.
- You're right.

664
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:09,741
- You could wear something over it.
- For sure.

665
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:12,811
- Then this...
- I think I'll buy the CL.

666
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,279
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

667
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:18,550
- I'll check out first.
- Okay.

668
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,719
- The Hawaiian shirt.
- Okay.

669
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,488
- And the black moleskin jacket.
- Okay.

670
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,590
- The work jacket.
- Yes. The moleskin.

671
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,560
<i>Did you find something you like?</i>

672
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:29,728
I'm buying it.

673
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,129
<i>I'm glad.</i>

674
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,597
Thank you. Really.

675
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,702
- Here. Thank you.
- Thank you.

676
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:37,869
- Thank you.
- Come again.

677
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,371
Thank you.

678
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,547
<i>For dinner, we will visit</i>

679
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,116
<i>-a restaurant established in 1971.</i>
- Okay.

680
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,085
<i>Japanese Dining Kitchen SAWA.</i>

681
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,654
- This way?
- A long-established shop?

682
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,357
According to TABI...

683
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,360
- Here? He said SAWA, right?
- SAWA.

684
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:02,427
SAWA

685
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,430
- This is it. Let's go in.
- Awesome.

686
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,866
- Good work today.
- Thanks.

687
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,478
It was fun.

688
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,879
It is so nice

689
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:23,448
- to finish the day with this.
- It is.

690
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:28,019
That looks good. It's sukiyaki.

691
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,555
Awesome.

692
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,957
- Cool.
- Gorgeous.

693
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,058
JOSHU WAGYU SUKIYAKI

694
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,359
This is the good stuff.

695
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:35,861
It's not often we see it...

696
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,963
- Like this.
- ...coming out like this.

697
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,698
The meat looks so good.

698
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,934
It's heavy.

699
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,669
It has weight to it.

700
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:46,638
This is gonna be good.

701
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,175
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

702
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,343
Straight for it!

703
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,712
The meat.

704
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,747
- First thing.
- Yeah.

705
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:59,584
This looks good.

706
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,154
Time to eat.

707
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:12,864
- It's so good!
- No way.

708
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,104
- Yum.
- It's delicious.

709
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,940
- Joshu...
- Joshu beef.

710
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:25,076
It's my first time having it. The fat...

711
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,745
- Exactly.
- You know?

712
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:30,348
- And the meat is so savory.
- Isn't it great?

713
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,083
This is good stuff.

714
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,554
This is Joshu beef and Joshu Wagyu.

715
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,155
- They're different.
- Two kinds?

716
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,191
- Which did we try?
- The Joshu Wagyu.

717
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,859
Wagyu.

718
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:42,260
What to say?

719
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:47,332
- It's so smooth yet weighty.
- Yeah.

720
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,934
No need to chew.

721
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,939
I think if Gunma knew a bit more
about how to raise cattle,

722
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,408
it could compete with Matsusaka.

723
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,710
- Just my personal opinion.
- I mean...

724
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:02,013
- I never knew about this.
- Awesome. Me neither.

725
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,282
This is a nice piece of knowledge.

726
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,350
Yeah.

727
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,854
<i>I found out there's so much
you don't know until you go.</i>

728
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,323
Or until you talk.

729
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:16,094
Like what kind of culture a region has,

730
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:20,899
like the wheat production here
and the Daruma dolls.

731
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,635
There's so much I didn't know.

732
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:27,105
I think that's what makes
traveling so great.

733
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:32,310
I'm sure what I learned
will come in handy someday.

734
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:35,881
I really like communicating with people.

735
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,683
So I want to keep doing it, doing it more.

736
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,787
Idols can seem inaccessible yet admirable

737
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,623
and make you want to root for them.

738
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,325
That's part of the image of an idol.

739
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,995
I think it's an important part.

740
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:53,031
But I think at least one member

741
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:58,403
can be someone
you feel like you could be friends with.

742
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,507
That's how I personally feel.

743
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:05,977
If there's just one person
who feels friendly like that,

744
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,948
the whole group can be viewed

745
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:14,319
as a more friendly group.

746
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,522
And I'd be happy
if I could be in that role.

747
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,191
I like talking to people.

748
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:24,729
<i>How did you like
traveling to Takasaki?</i>

749
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,565
It was fun.

750
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,834
- It was fun. It was my first time.
- Yeah. Mine too.

751
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,703
- Including our hobbies...
- Yeah.

752
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,838
...we have a lot in common.

753
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,874
I think that's why this trip

754
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:37,742
- turned out the way it did.
- Yeah.

755
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,946
- It was plain old fun.
- Thank you, really.

756
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,148
- No, thank you.
- It was a good opportunity.

757
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:44,449
It was a chance...

758
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:49,220
- to learn to enjoy traveling more...
- Yes, for sure.

759
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,089
...to fall in love with the region,

760
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:53,725
and to interact with people.

761
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,061
And through this time with just us two...

762
00:34:56,127 --> 00:35:00,198
- Yeah. Yes.
- ...I think we've deepened our bond too.

763
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,867
This taught me that all over again.

764
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,337
- I'm glad I came.
- I'm glad.

765
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,640
I believe
we shouldn't end it here tonight.

766
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:09,975
Yeah.

767
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,944
Next is overseas.

768
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,613
Hawaii for me.

769
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,282
Not me.

770
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,753
<i>Let's travel the world.</i>

771
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,222
Can you travel the world, TABI?

772
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,057
<i>Of course.</i>

773
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,560
No way. You can go worldwide?

774
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,595
<i>Yes.</i>

775
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,966
You're doing the ending line?

776
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:36,434
Thank you.
