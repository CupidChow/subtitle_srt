Bai Shan.

Bai Shan.

22
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,490
What's this?

23
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,650
This is the Bai Clan Dou Technique that
my brother, Bai Cheng, left for me.

24
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,620
It's called "Great Rift Rock",

25
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,370
and it counters Xiao Yan's
fire attribute Dou Techniques.

26
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,930
I originally planned to use it

27
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,610
to fight against Xiao Yan
in the Grand Competition,

28
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,500
but I won't have the chance.

29
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,090
Wu Hao,

30
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,580
your Dou Techniques

31
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,780
can't completely counter Xiao Yan,

32
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,060
but with this,

33
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,780
it can definitely give you an advantage.

34
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:09,730
What do you mean?

35
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,420
You are targeting Xiao Yan?

36
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:14,810
Bai Shan,

37
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,090
you just can't enter the Tower this year,

38
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,550
but if you focus on training

39
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,420
and continue to work hard,

40
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,220
Elder Hao will certainly

41
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,580
strive for another chance

42
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,760
for you to enter
the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.

43
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,140
You don't have to be so discouraged.

44
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,340
Wu Hao.

45
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,860
What's going on?

46
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,380
Where's your Dou Qi?

47
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,500
It's disabled.

48
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,890
Xiao Yan did it.

49
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,940
Elder Hao said

50
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,970
I could never recover it.

51
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,250
Only you,

52
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,780
I,

53
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,890
and Elder Hao know about it.

54
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,450
I hate Xiao Yan,

55
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,970
but I can't defeat him anymore.

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,500
I can't participate
in the Grand Competition.

57
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,420
I can't enter
the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.

58
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,170
My ten-year dream is shattered,

59
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,220
and my future is ruined.

60
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,730
I don't have any other friends.

61
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,380
Only you can carry on my wish.

62
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,940
If you take this Dou Technique,

63
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,690
I'll know that someone can

64
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,610
defeat Xiao Yan for me honorably.

65
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,860
If you don't take it,

66
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,930
I can only

67
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,610
take it and leave the Academy with regret.

68
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,260
What are you talking about?

69
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,410
Will you take it

70
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,850
or not?

71
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,940
I'll keep it for you for now.

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,780
(Great Rift Rock)

73
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,850
Xiao Yan!

74
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,850
Xiao Yan!

75
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,940
Xiao Yan!

76
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,130
I've been looking for you.

77
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,730
Why are you at the door of Xun'er's room?

78
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,780
Your big brother is here.

79
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,410
My big brother is here?

80
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,540
He must be here
to watch me in the competition.

81
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,940
No,

82
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,330
your big brother was carried in.

83
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,940
When he entered the Academy,

84
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,940
he was covered in blood and barely alive.

85
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,500
Misty Cloud Sect!

86
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,890
Do you want to exterminate our Xiao Clan?

87
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,730
Xiao Yan!

88
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,500
I want to return to the Jia Ma Empire.

89
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,450
I want to bury everyone
in the Misty Cloud Sect.

90
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,130
What's the use of being so impulsive?

91
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,130
You don't even know what happened.

92
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,060
Even if you go back without any regard,

93
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,380
with your current abilities,
what can you do?

94
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,780
Your big brother is hardly alive

95
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,890
and needs immediate treatment.

96
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,660
The most important thing now

97
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,380
is to save your big brother's life

98
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,730
before finding out the reasons.

99
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,690
Moreover,

100
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,500
you still need to win the Grand Competition

101
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,170
and enter
the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.

102
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,570
How can we save his life?

103
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,500
His life is definitely savable,

104
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,850
as long as you stay calm and listen to me.

105
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,100
Okay,

106
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,010
I'll listen to you.

107
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,220
In my current situation,

108
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,580
I can't personally get out
of the Storage Ring to treat him,

109
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,010
but I can give you pills

110
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,780
to temporarily stabilize his condition.

111
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,570
We can find a way to cure him

112
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,850
after you finish the Grand Competition.

113
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,290
He'll survive.

114
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,690
I promise you.

115
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,900
Mr. Yao,

116
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,410
thanks for your pill.

117
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,130
(I can only temporarily
stabilize his vital signs,)

118
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,500
(but I can't tell you
how serious his injuries are.)

119
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,410
(Otherwise, you won't be able to focus
on the Competition.)

120
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,220
(Rather than saying I stabilized his body,)

121
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,260
(it's more accurate to say that I temporarily
stabilized your emotions.)

122
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,610
Forget about that.

123
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,260
It's too early for you to read that.

124
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,610
Read this one.

125
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,940
This one is suitable for you.

126
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,160
Captain.

127
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,010
What is it?

128
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,610
Take this one. This is good.

129
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,650
Why are you being so mysterious?

130
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,000
Xiao Yan's big brother
was carried into the Academy,

131
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,060
and it seems like he's quite injured.

132
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,770
You're not even as good as you were
at the beginning.

133
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,200
Tomorrow is
the Strong Ranking Grand Competition.

134
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,460
How can you compete like this?

135
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,380
This "Lion and Tiger Shattering Gold"
is not working!

136
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,730
Steady your mind
if you want to become stronger.

137
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,730
That's easy for you to say.

138
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,500
Every time I close my eyes,

139
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,170
I see my big brother unconscious.

140
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,940
I don't know how my father

141
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,220
and other clan members are doing now.

142
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,530
How can I calm down?

143
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,020
If you can't control your emotions now,

144
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,900
what will you do
when you face bigger challenges,

145
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:32,900
greater pressure,

146
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,460
and more dire situations in the future?

147
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,970
I don't know. I don't know!

148
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,930
Xun'er.

149
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,060
I've seen your big brother.

150
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,610
It's because I defeated Nalan Yanran

151
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,380
for the three-year agreement.

152
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,650
Misty Cloud Sect is truly shameless.

153
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,900
Misty Cloud Sect
did such a shameless thing.

154
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,090
I know you're anxious,

155
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,730
but for the sake of revenge,
you have to endure.

156
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,290
But it shouldn't make the entire clan
pay the price for me.

157
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,850
My feelings are the same as yours,

158
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,380
but no matter what lies ahead,

159
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,650
I will always be by your side.

160
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,220
I know,

161
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,290
the Gu Clan has sent people

162
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,140
to take you back.

163
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,610
Who said that?

164
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,610
They just came to check on me.

165
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,340
Gu Yao stayed

166
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,260
because he had another task at hand.

167
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,850
It has nothing to do with me.

168
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,810
Really?

169
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,610
I've finally seen you,

170
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,340
and so much has happened to the Xiao Clan,

171
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,380
how can I leave now?

172
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,970
I'm sorry, Xun'er.

173
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,850
Queen She Cailin you saw that day

174
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,260
was someone I met during my travels.

175
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,850
I obtained my Green Lotus Core Flame

176
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,060
from her.

177
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,730
She regressed into
the Heaven Swallowing Python

178
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,870
after she failed
to collect the heavenly flame.

179
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,460
I kept her with me and fed her since then.

180
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,730
At Misty Cloud Sect,

181
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,500
she saved me once from Yun Shan's hands,

182
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,340
so I owe her a medicinal pill.

183
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,380
We just have a contractual relationship.

184
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,260
Don't be angry.

185
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,380
You don't need to explain to me.

186
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,900
But last time...

187
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,050
Xiao Yan,

188
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,170
sometimes,

189
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,090
you are truly insensitive.

190
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,260
In fact, I know.

191
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,460
We grew up together.

192
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,170
No matter what happens,

193
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,500
we are each other's closest family.

194
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,770
The most important thing for me now

195
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,770
is to win the Grand Competition

196
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,060
and qualify for entry into the Tower.

197
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,940
But my mind wanders,

198
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,580
and I can't focus on anything.

199
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,250
Bai Shan!

200
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,610
Hu Jia?

201
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,690
Hu Jia.

202
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,210
Are you changing careers

203
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,940
to become a gatekeeper?

204
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,220
Speak up,

205
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,410
what do you want from me?

206
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,860
Hu Jia,

207
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,700
do you want to defeat Xiao Yan?

208
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,860
Of course,

209
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,900
otherwise, I wouldn't practice
until late at night every day.

210
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,290
I have a Dou Technique here

211
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,090
that can perfectly counter Xiao Yan's
Dou Techniques.

212
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,130
As long as you use it,

213
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,100
- I guarantee...
- No need.

214
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,500
I know how to defeat Xiao Yan.

215
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,260
I can tell you that

216
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,970
I have already obtained some pills
from my grandfather.

217
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,220
I am now

218
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,730
a Dou Spirit.

219
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,860
Hu Jia,

220
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,410
I heard that

221
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,700
Xiao Yan has a close relationship

222
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,530
with the Gu Clan.

223
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,210
What if Xun'er
also gave him some medicinal pills

224
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,970
to boost his strength?

225
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,260
And there's that Gu Yao.

226
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,600
- He...
- What about him?

227
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,180
Give it to me.

228
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,210
If this does not work so well as you said,

229
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,180
you'll be in big trouble.

230
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,850
These ten jade plaques

231
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,940
serve as the vouchers to enter the
Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.

232
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,650
The twenty students selected

233
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,210
from the previous round

234
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,380
will draw lots

235
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,970
and pair up.

236
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,340
Those who win

237
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,260
within the designated time
and seize the jade plaque

238
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,650
will have their names recorded
on the new Strong Ranking.

239
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,980
Now,

240
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,210
those who have qualified for
the Grand Competition come forward.

241
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,080
- Number seven.
- Number eleven.

242
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,820
Get ready.

243
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,050
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

244
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,690
This is…

245
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,020
We'll meet in the arena later.

246
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,690
Number eleven

247
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,770
will compete with number fifteen.

248
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,730
Xiao Xun'er won.

249
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,530
Number seven, enter the stage.

250
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,780
Number 7 is Xiao Yan!

251
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,610
Good luck.

252
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,380
You'll fight number three.

253
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,850
- Number three?
- Who is number three?

254
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,850
Number three is Hu Jia.

255
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,010
It's actually her.

256
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,140
Why is it Hu Jia?

257
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,460
It's going to be interesting.

258
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,810
Why are you here?

259
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,970
If Xiao Yan wants to have his name
on the Strong Ranking,

260
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,730
it won't be that easy.

261
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,900
Why?

262
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,860
According to my observations,

263
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,460
Hu Jia has already broken through
to the Dou Spirit.

264
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,450
That's not good.

265
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,500
But for Xiao Yan, this match is not about

266
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,730
winning or losing.

267
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,140
I think it's only about winning or losing.

268
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,610
I don't think you are number three.

269
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,650
Doesn't matter. Your opponent is me now.

270
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,980
Stop, stop, stop.

271
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,100
What? Surrendered already?

272
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,490
Don't play tricks.

273
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,220
You are a big bully!

274
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,460
You beat me so hard.

275
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,940
Then you surrender.

276
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,490
That way, I won't hit you.

277
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,740
Then you put down your big ruler first.

278
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,060
Happy now?

279
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,700
Hu Jia,

280
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,580
we are fellow students.

281
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,060
There's no need to go so hard.

282
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,820
Great Rift Rock!

283
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,780
Xiao Yan,

284
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,220
don't make excuses.

285
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,990
If you can't break my Dou Technique,

286
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,250
surrender obediently.

287
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,340
Fire-splitting Wave-gnawing Ruler!

288
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,490
Break!

289
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,010
What?

290
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,490
What Dou Technique is it?

291
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,580
What Dou Technique is Hu Jia using?

292
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,420
Interesting.

293
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,130
It seems like a defensive technique,

294
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,530
but if you don't break the stone formation,

295
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,940
you will be trapped for good.

296
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,770
But Xiao Yan doesn't seem to intend to

297
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,220
use his full strength now.

298
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,700
Hu Jia's Dou Technique

299
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,650
perfectly counters Xiao Yan's techniques.

300
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,010
It's impossible for him
to obtain the plaque

301
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,180
without going all out.

302
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,770
It looks like Hu Jia might win.

303
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,700
That's amazing.

304
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,700
Xiao Yan.

305
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,370
You'll never set foot

306
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,740
where I, Bai Shan, can't.

307
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,220
What Dou Technique is this?

308
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,410
Twelve Extreme Changes.

309
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,340
The Great Sundering Rock,
the Infinity Change.

310
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,980
You can't break this formation.

311
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,170
Xiao Yan, don't blame me
for tricking you.

312
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,400
Dou Practitioners only care
about victory and defeat.

313
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,460
Either you walk out of here with a win,

314
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,130
or you fall in the ring with a loss.

315
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,860
There is no third outcome.

316
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,370
(Xiao Yan.)

317
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,940
(What are you doing?)

318
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,620
(If you can't enter
the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower,)

319
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,290
(you won't be able
to subdue Fallen Heart Flame.)

320
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,490
(Are you willing
to be the Xiao Clan's trash?)

321
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,490
(The Xiao Clan's genius?)

322
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,370
(You're just a loser.)

323
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,060
(The Xiao Clan really has no one left.)

324
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,210
Xiao Yan.

325
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,540
Shout it out!

326
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,010
Are you afraid of losing
in front of others,

327
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,220
or that Xiao Xun'er
will see you lose pathetically?

328
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,490
Xiao Yan.

329
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,340
Shout it out if you are angry!

330
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,100
Otherwise,

331
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,340
how do people know
how powerful you are?

332
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,620
No mountain is taller

333
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,340
than a man.

334
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,370
You are right.

335
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,700
There is no third outcome.

336
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,890
Lion and Tiger Shattering Gold.

337
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,060
Xiao Yan is awesome.

338
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,340
I've never seen that before.

339
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,740
What a trick this is?

340
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,940
Is this loud enough now?

341
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,580
Xiao Yan.

342
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,780
You won.

343
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,010
Does it still hurt?

344
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,900
It's okay.

345
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,090
Xun'er.

346
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,090
Xiao Yan.

347
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,250
It was my fault.

348
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,170
- You finally realized it.
- Exactly.

349
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,980
You almost got Xiao Yan killed.

350
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,230
Xiao Yan.

351
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,890
I'll never go against you again.

352
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,940
What if you do it again?

353
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,210
Enough.

354
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,890
Playing tricks

355
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,530
in the game

356
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,900
means you're smart.

357
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,010
I forgive you.

358
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:42,730
Everyone.

359
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,680
The Strong Ranking Grand Competition
of today

360
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,770
was better than ever.

361
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,860
Based on your performance
on the arena,

362
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,650
as judged by the elders,

363
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,610
I would like to announce

364
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,530
the Strong Ranking next.

365
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,130
The third place.

366
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,820
Xiao Xun'er.

367
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,090
Applause.

368
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,980
The second place.

369
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,250
Hu Jia.

370
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,210
Thank you.

371
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,130
Tied for second place.

372
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,490
Xiao Yan.

373
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,860
Tied?

374
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,170
Tied? Wait.

375
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,420
Headmaster.

376
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,770
Are you mistaken?

377
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,060
Who's the first place winner?

378
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,530
As for the first place...

379
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,180
It's over there.

380
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:09,460
(First Place Zi Yan)

381
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,860
(Jia Nan Academy, Medicine Forest)

382
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,340
The first place
should have been mine.

383
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,100
It should have been mine.

384
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,330
Who is that?

385
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,300
Who are you?

386
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,530
This is the Medicine Forest
of Jia Nan Academy.

387
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,130
How did you break in?

388
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,250
(Han Feng, Medicine Emperor in Feng City)
We had a deal before.

389
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:38,860
Have you forgotten?

390
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:40,850
It was you.

391
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,770
You're the one who hurt me
with the fake pill,

392
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,540
right?

393
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,420
Man.

394
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,410
Why is your Dou Qi

395
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,460
so deficient?

396
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,650
Stop pretending to be compassionate.

397
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,700
Isn't it all because
of your fake pill?

398
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,490
Let's go.

399
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:03,990
Come with me to see the elders

400
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,940
and make it clear.

401
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,060
Go.

402
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,860
Looks like you were in a hurry.

403
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,220
The pill I gave you

404
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,770
needs time to be digested.

405
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,460
You just took a fierce medicine,

406
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,890
and you were rushing to forcefully
raise your Dou Qi level,

407
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,860
and even fought with someone.

408
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,130
Think about it.

409
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,820
How can your body

410
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,770
withstand this kind of torture?

411
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,940
Don't think I'll ever trust you again.

412
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:42,290
My medicine has never gone wrong.

413
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,010
Otherwise

414
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,490
I wouldn't call myself
the Medicine Emperor

415
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,530
of the Blackhorn Domain.

416
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,660
Blackhorn Domain?

417
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,080
Medicine Emperor in Feng City?

418
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,580
So you are
Medicine Emperor in Feng City?

419
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,060
Think about it.

420
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,770
Who in the entire Jia Ma Empire

421
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,010
can give you
Purple Heart Barrier Breaking Pill

422
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,860
besides Jia Nan Academy?

423
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,980
Since you are the Medicine Emperor,

424
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,340
why did you hide your identity?

425
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,460
You…

426
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,060
You're coveting something

427
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,200
from Jia Nan Academy, aren't you?

428
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,340
It's not coveting.

429
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,490
I came to your academy

430
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,820
because I heard

431
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,460
that a treasure is

432
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,340
inside the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower,

433
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,410
so I would like to have a look.

434
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,700
You want to enter
the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower?

435
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,180
No way.

436
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,300
Absolutely impossible.

437
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,250
You're an outsider.

438
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,340
You'll never get into the Tower.

439
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,540
No way.

440
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,490
No worries.

441
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,980
It's not that hard
to restore your Dou Qi.

442
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,130
Just

443
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,620
do me a little favor.

444
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,490
His pulse is still weak.

445
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,900
Xiao Yan.

446
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,650
Why don't we go find
Headmaster Su Qian

447
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,940
and ask him to get everyone together
to diagnose him?

448
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:25,970
Other than Mr. Yao,

449
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,820
no one can cure him.

450
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:31,970
Mr. Yao?

451
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,420
Xun'er.

452
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,490
You've never pressed me
about my past.

453
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,220
I know you trust me.

454
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,490
But it's time to tell you

455
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,980
about this.

456
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,770
In fact, I have a very powerful teacher,

457
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,010
the Medicine Sage of Zhongzhou.

458
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,460
He taught me

459
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,650
all my Dou Techniques.

460
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,890
He's also the one

461
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,330
who stabilized my brother's injury.

462
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,220
The Medicine Sage of Zhongzhou?

463
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,100
It turned out that your teacher

464
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,530
is such a powerful figure.

465
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,220
Then where is he now?

466
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,340
Let's go find him together.

467
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,210
He's here.

468
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,820
He's

469
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,530
inside the Storage Ring?

470
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,650
It's a long story.

471
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,770
Anyway,

472
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,890
Mr. Yao can only stay
in my Storage Ring for now.

473
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,410
This is a secret.

474
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,170
Never tell anyone.

475
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,530
So, I'm going
into the Storage Ring now

476
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,220
and ask my teacher to save my brother.

477
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,860
It turns out that every time
you were in meditation before,

478
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,340
you went to see your teacher.

479
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,890
Don't worry. I'll be out there
keeping watch.

480
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,180
Okay.

481
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,290
Mr. Yao, what happened to my brother?

482
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,290
Didn't you say
you've stabilized his condition?

483
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,580
How could you fight in peace
if I hadn't said so?

484
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,700
I have indeed stabilized his condition.

485
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,700
But too much tainted blood
and turbid qi

486
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,460
has been deposited
inside his meridians.

487
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,460
It's necessary to comb through
all his meridians.

488
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,130
Only after the tainted blood is discharged
can he truly wake up.

489
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,580
What kind of medicine
should we use then?

490
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,490
There's no medicine available.

491
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,700
The only way is to use Dou Qi

492
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,860
to directly break
his necrotic meridians

493
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,130
and renew them
after discharging the tainted blood.

494
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,340
The process
is extremely dangerous,

495
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,650
and he could bleed to death
at any time.

496
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,220
Yet I can't go out
of the Storage Ring right now.

497
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,890
On the one hand, if I go out,

498
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,740
I will consume too much Dou Qi.

499
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,940
On the other hand,
even if I go out,

500
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,940
I still won't be able to save him

501
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,530
without enough Dou Qi
to support me.

502
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,370
Then I'll do as you say.

503
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,620
This has never been done before.

504
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,340
Once you've made your decision,
you can't go back on it.

505
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,900
By then,

506
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,340
you'll do whatever I say.

507
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,340
You'll be my hands, my eyes

508
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,250
and only listen to me.

509
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,130
My brother's life

510
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,490
depends on you.

511
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,540
Let's begin.

512
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,940
Mobilize your Dou Qi

513
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,740
between your two hands

514
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,530
and focus it at Fengmen on the back.

515
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,340
Open the meridians.

516
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,170
God, please

517
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,530
keep Brother safe.

518
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,730
Medicine Sage.

519
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,820
Please save him.

520
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,180
Xun'er.

521
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,060
How is it going?

522
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,370
Water.

523
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,780
Okay.

524
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,060
Here comes the water.

525
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,580
Here.

526
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,940
He drank it.

527
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,250
Thanks to Mr. Yao.

528
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,060
Xiao Yan.

529
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,330
I would like…

530
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,580
I would like
to thank the Medicine Sage.

531
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,530
Mr. Yao, how are you?

532
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,530
Your brother's life has been saved.

533
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,180
Mr. Yao.

534
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,070
This is…

535
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,340
I'm Xun'er.

536
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:28,850
You brat.

537
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,340
Why did you bring a girl in
while I am like this?

538
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,620
Mr. Yao, don't blame Xiao Yan.

539
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,770
It's my own fault.

540
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,860
I just realized

541
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,460
that it was you who helped Xiao Yan

542
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,060
in the Storage Ring
during those previous days.

543
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,460
You are his benefactor,

544
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,060
as well as mine.

545
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,130
So I have to come

546
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,620
to say thank you in person.

547
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,010
No wonder he kept talking

548
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,290
about you all the way.

549
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,250
It makes sense.

550
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:00,820
Really?

551
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,130
Why do you always expose me?

552
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:05,610
It's okay.

553
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,700
We have already met each other.

554
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,930
Don't take this lightly.

555
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,620
Go and find
Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit.

556
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,380
Another medicine is needed

557
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,660
for your brother to recover.

558
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,130
I'll go for it right away.

559
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,690
You should stay to look after Mr. Yao.

560
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:17,850
Okay.

561
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,210
You should go together.

562
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,420
Or you will miss each other.

563
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,690
And I can't be at ease.

564
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,090
Mr. Yao…

565
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,290
Go.

566
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,660
The Ice and Fire Dragon Beard Fruit
is a superb medicinal herb.

567
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,770
It should only be stocked

568
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:34,990
in the Academy's elixir room right now.

569
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
Doesn't the Academy
have a Medicine Forest?

570
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,700
Medicine Forest?

571
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,640
Students are not allowed
to enter there without authorization.

572
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,970
Seems like it's because
there's a monster.

573
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,820
I've heard that this monster

574
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,100
is neither animal nor fowl,
and it's very fierce.

575
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,490
A student was injured by it

576
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,200
when he entered the Medicine Forest
by mistake.

577
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,690
The Medicine Forest
has since been banned.

578
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,730
Now all of the Academy's
medicinal herbs

579
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,770
have to go through Elder Hao.

580
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,060
Is there really a monster

581
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:01,900
