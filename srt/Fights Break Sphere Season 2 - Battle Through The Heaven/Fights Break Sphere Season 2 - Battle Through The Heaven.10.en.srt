=Episode 10=

19
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,330
Han Feng.

20
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,650
(Hall of Misty Cloud Sect)

21
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,060
You rebelled against orthodoxy

22
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,610
and deceived your master.

23
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,570
This is the first sin.

24
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,140
You joined the Hall of Souls
and helped a villain to do evil.

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,290
This is the second sin.

26
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,860
And now you've killed my father
in the back.

27
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,180
This is the third sin.

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,980
Mr. Yao.

29
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,090
Elder.

30
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,170
Elder.

31
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,090
Save me.

32
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,330
If you take one more step closer,

33
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,330
you'll end up like him.

34
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,700
Yao Chen.

35
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,660
Your disciple is quite courageous.

36
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,530
Look

37
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,690
what you've done

38
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,500
to the Misty Cloud Sect.

39
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,690
If you follow me back
to the Hall of Souls now,

40
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,380
the Misty Cloud's view

41
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,330
may still be preserved.

42
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,660
You couldn't beat me back then,

43
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,220
and it's the same today.

44
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,810
Whirling Dervish Flame Fist.

45
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,250
I wanted to spare your lives.

46
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,140
Why are you so ungrateful?

47
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,620
Good.

48
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,380
It's almost time.

49
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,530
The game is over.

50
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,220
Senior, why are you doing this?

51
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,020
You have to return
to the Hall of Souls with me.

52
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,610
Your Bone Spirit Cold Flame

53
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,730
as well as Xiao Yan's Heavenly Flames

54
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,380
will all belong to the Hall of Souls.

55
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,500
I'll show you

56
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,290
how your disciple will die.

57
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,900
Xiao Yan.

58
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,100
Everyone of Starfall Hall is here today.

59
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,890
My junior.

60
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,850
My disciple.

61
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
Looks like it's time for me
to yield my post.

62
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,410
Mu Gu.

63
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,220
Compared to Xiao Yan's Heavenly Flames,

64
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,730
how about my Bone Spirit Cold Flame?

65
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,890
Wasn't it for it
that you did everything

66
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,890
to lure Xiao Yan
to the Misty Cloud Sect?

67
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,410
I'm handing it over now.

68
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,780
As for who gets it,

69
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,130
it's up to you.

70
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,410
Mr. Yao.

71
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,410
The Bone Spirit Cold Flame
cannot be given to him.

72
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,250
Xiao Yan.

73
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,170
I was right about you.

74
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,220
You are my proudest student.

75
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,410
Mr. Yao.

76
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,730
You are destined
to carry a greater responsibility.

77
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,130
Go and fulfill your mission.

78
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,850
- Mr. Yao!
- Sage!

79
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,170
Xiao Yan.

80
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,170
I failed to protect you

81
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,700
or anyone else.

82
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,890
It was you who protected me
since I was a child.

83
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,170
If it wasn't for you,

84
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,220
I'd be dead long ago.

85
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,220
From withdrawing from my marriage,

86
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,330
to studying at Jia Nan Academy,

87
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,170
and to dueling with Yun Shan,

88
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,130
I just wanted

89
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,330
to protect

90
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,220
the people I love.

91
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,730
I just wanted them to live.

92
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,380
But they...

93
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,850
Han Feng's move was meant for me.

94
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,090
But Father got in front of me.

95
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,170
To save me, Mr. Yao...

96
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,060
Xiao Yan.

97
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,850
The responsibility of the Xiao Clan.

98
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,970
The responsibility of the Starfall Hall.

99
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,170
Am I worth it?

100
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,420
Can I

101
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,770
afford it?

102
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,580
We all have our responsibilities

103
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,580
and missions.

104
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,530
We all have a lot of choices
we have to make.

105
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,210
Uncle Xiao did this for the future
of the Xiao Clan.

106
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,380
Medicine Sage

107
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,530
did this for the Starfall Hall

108
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,340
and to eradicate the Hall of Souls.

109
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,530
They chose to risk their own lives

110
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,260
and entrusted you
with a greater responsibility.

111
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,260
This is their deepest trust in you.

112
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,340
Uncle Xiao trusted you.

113
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,730
And so did Medicine Sage.

114
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,340
You're not

115
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,900
just Xiao Yan now.

116
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,380
You're the patriarch of the Xiao Clan,

117
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,700
the only disciple of Medicine Sage,

118
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,850
and my brother.

119
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,700
Xun'er, is your duty

120
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,770
the Gu Clan?

121
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,050
Yes.

122
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,820
But I'm also a member
of the Xiao Clan.

123
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,610
I'm Xiao Xun'er.

124
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,850
Your mission is mine too.

125
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,820
I'll always stand with you

126
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,980
and accompany you.

127
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,860
Father.

128
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,340
You once told me

129
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,340
that the Xiao Clan was originally
from the Central Plains

130
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,090
and fell because of the fight
against the Hall of Souls.

131
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,900
I remember

132
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,850
what you said.

133
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,770
I also understand

134
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,210
that the eagle has grown

135
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,460
and should fly in the sky.

136
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,020
I will take up
the Xiao Clan's responsibility

137
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,850
to fight against the Hall of Souls.

138
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,170
- Come and get me.
- Don't run, you brat!

139
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,020
- Don't run!
- You can't catch me!

140
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,420
I will beat you!

141
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,130
You brat!

142
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,210
Do you want to refine the tripod
with this much fire?

143
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,490
Xiao Yan.

144
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,900
(Mr. Yao.)

145
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,050
Mr. Yao.

146
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,130
Xiao Yan.

147
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,290
Take the source
of the Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

148
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,540
Don't look for me.

149
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,650
Take the Storage Ring
to the Central Plains.

150
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,580
Mr. Yao, where are you?

151
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,780
Go to the Central Plains.

152
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,900
Mr. Yao!

153
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,010
The Central Plains.

154
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,570
Mr. Yao.

155
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,680
Wait for me.

156
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,300
(Subsidiary of Hall of Souls)

157
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,530
I didn't expect that our reunion
would be in this way.

158
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,530
I did give you a choice.

159
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,410
All these years,

160
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,650
you've coveted

161
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,820
my Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

162
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,700
I will not give it to the Hall of Souls.

163
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,060
Don't waste your time.

164
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,940
I don't just want
Bone Spirit Cold Flame,

165
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,500
I want you.

166
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,940
I want a genius alchemist like you

167
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,900
in the Hall of Souls.

168
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,500
I really don't want to see

169
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,140
such an outstanding alchemist

170
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,850
working for those scoundrels

171
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,820
of the Central Plains
and the Jia Ma Empire.

172
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,770
You should serve the Hall of Souls.

173
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,500
Just tell these beautiful lies

174
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,060
to someone like Han Feng

175
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,530
who's obsessed with profit.

176
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,570
Mu Gu.

177
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,650
There's only one thing
I can't figure out.

178
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,770
The Hall of Souls kills and robs,

179
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,410
and sucks in people's Dou Qi
to cultivate their evil techniques.

180
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,090
Since when did you

181
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,210
have your eye
on the Heavenly Flames?

182
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,820
For power.

183
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,500
Isn't that quite simple?

184
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,140
Hun Miesheng used his evil technique
to restore your withered hand.

185
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,570
And you...

186
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,770
You offered your soul
to the Hall of Souls.

187
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,300
You...

188
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,990
What are you talking about?

189
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,770
How dare you laugh?

190
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,060
Mu Gu.

191
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,770
Do you remember

192
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,740
what you did with your hands?

193
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,370
Yes.

194
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,860
I fought the Hall of Souls
with my hands.

195
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,290
But so what?

196
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,290
The Hall of Souls killed me
and saved me.

197
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,490
The most important thing is

198
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,130
that he's given me something
that you never could.

199
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,650
No matter how many times you ask me,

200
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,060
I'll say the same thing.

201
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,170
It is never too late to mend.

202
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,940
Mu Gu.

203
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,250
Even if you've gone so far.

204
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,410
You should be the one to mend.

205
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,580
I feel sorry for you.

206
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,220
You're a genius.

207
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,700
But you don't see things
as clearly as I do.

208
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,250
On the Dou Qi Continent,
the strongest has the final say.

209
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,940
Why don't you join
the greatest power of all,

210
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,820
instead of making enemies of it?

211
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,580
Power is just a dirty word,

212
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,130
a way to trick people like you

213
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,820
into sacrificing themselves
to the greed of the Hall of Souls.

214
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,850
No.

215
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,580
The master of the world
is the master of power.

216
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,890
What did the Hall of Souls give you?

217
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,340
Lord Hun Miesheng chose me.

218
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,770
Before he died,

219
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,890
he granted me the greatest secret
of the Hall of Souls.

220
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,290
As long as I feed his formation
with the Heavenly Flames,

221
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,130
I'll have access to the Soul Lock

222
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,060
and a constant supply of Dou Qi

223
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,010
until I break through
to the strongest power.

224
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,130
That's why you want the Heavenly Flames?

225
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,650
Submit to the Hall of Souls.

226
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,460
I can give you

227
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,700
what the Hall of Souls gave me.

228
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,370
How many people died
because of the Soul Lock?

229
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,060
Don't you feel terrible?

230
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,170
You're so stubborn

231
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,340
because you haven't felt the power.

232
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,340
I'll see you again.

233
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
By then, I hope

234
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,620
you'll give me a wise answer.

235
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,060
Xiao Yan.

236
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,770
It's far from the Xiao Clan's camp.

237
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,700
What do you want to say?

238
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,780
I'm going to the Central Plains.

239
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,940
Mr. Yao is still alive.

240
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,980
He left me a clue in the Storage Ring.

241
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,490
This time,

242
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,650
I will bring him back.

243
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,610
The Hall of Souls originated
in the Central Plains.

244
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,220
You've seen
Mu Gu's evil technique.

245
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,410
Their power is not in cultivation
but in seizure.

246
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,940
I don't know

247
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,290
why they're
collecting Heavenly Flames.

248
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,370
But Mu Gu sees himself
as the new master of the Hall of Souls.

249
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,340
If he wants
to restore the Hall of Souls,

250
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,290
it won't be that simple.

251
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,340
The Gu Clan will never let it go.

252
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:09,850
It's the same

253
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,530
with your Xiao Clan.

254
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,290
Perhaps we'll meet again.

255
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,420
These days,

256
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,270
the Black Submerged Army
investigates all parts of Jia Ma Empire.

257
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,220
Follow this map

258
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,980
and you'll find a portal
to the Central Plains.

259
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,620
It may help.

260
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,410
But it's guarded by mercenaries.

261
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,250
Be careful.

262
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,900
Thank you.

263
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,180
This time,

264
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,370
I'm going alone.

265
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,650
This is my own mission.

266
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,530
I won't involve Xun'er anymore.

267
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,220
After I leave,

268
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,580
take Xun'er back.

269
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,580
Please take care of her

270
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,700
in the future.

271
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,700
It's my duty to protect her.

272
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,100
You can rest assured.

273
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,660
Gu Yao.

274
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,170
You're a good opponent.

275
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,860
One day,

276
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,490
I will go to the Gu Clan and defeat you,

277
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,860
then take Xun'er with me.

278
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,290
I'll prove that I'm strong enough
to protect her.

279
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,180
Okay.

280
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,610
Xun'er.

281
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,130
Xiao Yan.

282
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,980
You don't have to say anything.

283
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,700
I understand.

284
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,060
This is

285
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,460
the Gu Clan's Di Class Dou Technique,

286
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,060
Emperor Seal Technique.

287
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,290
By practicing this technique,

288
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,770
we can be connected.

289
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,370
When it's perfected,

290
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,580
it can reach the power
of a Tian Class Dou Technique.

291
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,580
But don't use it

292
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,100
unless it's critical.

293
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,290
If the clan finds out,
they'll take it back.

294
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,900
Xun'er.

295
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,550
I'm worried about you going
to the Central Plains alone.

296
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,080
I'm worried about you
fighting the Hall of Souls alone.

297
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,370
I'm worried

298
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,790
about leaving you here alone.

299
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,610
l promise you

300
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,130
we'll meet again in the Gu Clan.

301
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,940
I'll

302
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,940
keep my word.

303
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,460
But...

304
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,100
But this time is different from before.

305
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,460
After I go back this time,

306
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,530
I'll be Gu Xun'er.

307
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,770
But you'll always be my Xun'er.

308
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,170
The next time we meet again,

309
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,010
I will show my strength

310
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,770
and let everyone
in the Gu Clan know

311
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,170
that you are right about me.

312
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,940
I, Xiao Yan, am powerful.

313
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,940
All right.

314
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,860
Time is running out.

315
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,430
I'll take you
to practice the Dou Technique.

316
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,330
Okay.

317
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,650
Xun'er.

318
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,370
Xun'er.

319
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,560
Xiao Yan.

320
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
(Gu Realm, Gu Clan's Settlement)

321
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,380
I don't have to wear this.

322
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,580
Miss Xun'er.

323
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,220
The Returning Ceremony is a big event.

324
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
It's better to be solemn.

325
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,780
Miss Xun'er.

326
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,280
I've been ordered by the patriarch

327
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,300
to escort you to the Returning Ceremony.

328
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,620
What are you doing?

329
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,260
Just say yes.

330
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,860
Yes.

331
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,260
Are you used to everything here?

332
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,660
It's not the same
as when I was a child.

333
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,900
Now you are the Clan Lady
of the Gu Clan.

334
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,820
Naturally, you're honored.

335
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,260
I just want to be able

336
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,260
to stretch out comfortably.

337
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,860
You'll get used to it.

338
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,180
By the way,

339
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,900
when you see my father,

340
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,380
what are you going to say

341
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,740
if he asks about the Xiao Clan?

342
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,860
What do you want me to say?

343
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,620
I want the fact

344
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,060
that ancient jade is with Xiao Yan

345
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,860
to be a secret
between the two of us.

346
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,740
I have my duties.

347
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,820
I'll do what I have to do.

348
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,900
Gu Yao of Black Submerged Army

349
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,780
was ordered

350
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,020
to take the Clan Lady back.

351
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,020
Greetings, Father.

352
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,780
Your safe return

353
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,660
is a blessing from ancestors.

354
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,860
It's been more than ten years.

355
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,900
You've both grown up.

356
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,180
Father, don't worry.

357
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,540
The Xiao Clan has always
treated me well.

358
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,980
Uncle Xiao treated me
as if I were his own.

359
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,380
I've never been wronged.

360
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,420
The Xiao Clan is very kind.

361
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,340
It's just a pity about Xiao Zhan.

362
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,860
The Xiao Clan has collapsed.

363
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,980
Did you get the ancient jade back?

364
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,460
It's my fault.

365
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,100
The Xiao Clan's ancient jade

366
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,740
is lost.

367
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,180
Lost?

368
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,340
On his deathbed, Uncle Xiao

369
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,740
passed on the title
of Xiao Clan's patriarch to Xiao Yan.

370
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,980
But he didn't leave the jade
to Xiao Yan.

371
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,940
Both Gu Yao and I were there.

372
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,100
He can testify to that.

373
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,620
Gu Yao, tell me.

374
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,300
Patriarch.

375
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,220
Patriarch Xiao was killed
by Han Feng in the Misty Cloud Sect.

376
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,340
Before he died, he passed on
the title of patriarch to Xiao Yan.

377
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,100
I saw it with my own eyes.

378
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,780
It's true what Miss Xun'er said,

379
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,420
and I didn't see the ancient jade.

380
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,500
You once reported

381
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,700
that not only was Xiao Zhan killed
in the Misty Cloud Sect,

382
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,420
but the Medicine Sage
of the Central Plains

383
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,780
was also captured.

384
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,060
The Medicine Sage

385
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,940
was captured by Mu Gu
of the Hall of Souls.

386
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,300
His life remains unknown.

387
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,480
According to our investigations
in the Jia Ma Empire,

388
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,340
Mu Gu

389
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,180
is the Subsidiary Master
of the Hall of Souls.

390
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,980
How can a mere Mu Gu

391
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,860
