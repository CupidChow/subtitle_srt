19
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,400
Elder Hao.

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,290
Excuse me, excuse me.

21
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,270
- Excuse me.
- This is yours.

22
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,340
Thank you.

23
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,100
Thank you, Elder Hao.

24
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,860
Excuse me, excuse me.

25
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,060
Excuse me.

26
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,260
I, Xiao Yan,

27
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,330
apply for
Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit.

28
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,900
You want

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,610
Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit?

30
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,180
Please approve, Elder Hao.

31
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,980
Three thousand fire energy points.

32
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,650
- What...
- Three thousand?

33
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,820
Are you kidding?

34
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,220
It's okay, I'll go back and get it.

35
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,540
We don't have any fire energy points.

36
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,930
Then stop causing trouble here.

37
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,060
Step aside.

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,530
I don't understand.

39
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,970
Why do we have to pay

40
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,660
extra fire energy points

41
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,660
when we've already paid our tuition?

42
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,540
Am I right?

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,610
Yeah, why?

44
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,890
That makes sense.

45
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,780
Where do these

46
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,090
fire energy points flow to?

47
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,890
Elder Hao, please tell us.

48
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,670
So you are not

49
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,380
here for the herbs,

50
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,730
you are here to settle accounts.

51
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,170
Okay,

52
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,420
let's settle accounts then.

53
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,500
The annual fee for each student

54
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,690
is 5,000 fire energy points.

55
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,610
Deducting living expenses

56
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,580
and maintenance costs leaves a balance

57
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,220
of 2,000 fire energy points.

58
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,810
Adding the consumption of materials
for cultivation,

59
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,250
which is 1,500
fire energy points at least,

60
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,730
and plus

61
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,970
heating in winter,

62
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,140
cooling in summer,

63
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,530
mountain forest maintenance,

64
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,780
and the monthly payment for caretakers,

65
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,090
it adds up to 2,000

66
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,610
fire energy points
owed by you to the Academy.

67
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,380
Elder Hao, I think...

68
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,220
Let me finish.

69
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,940
And you, Xiao Yan,
are different from others.

70
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,610
During my class,

71
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,300
you destroyed my jade pill furnace.

72
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,370
I'll give you a discount,

73
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,530
500 fire energy points.

74
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,250
Also, for the items you destroyed
during the Grand Competition,

75
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,500
let me calculate.

76
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,090
Hey,

77
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,940
how can you steal Elder Hao's
medicinal ingredients?

78
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,810
Who's that?

79
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,730
It's easy if you want
to enter the Medicine Forest.

80
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,060
I'll use the name of the Gu Clan

81
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,300
to negotiate with the elders.

82
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,450
And then I can take you there.

83
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,330
We cannot let the elders know about this.

84
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,780
Why?

85
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,970
Why?

86
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,330
Because this matter is...

87
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,660
You are doing this for Xiao Yan?

88
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,140
Anyway, can you help me

89
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,580
get Elder Hu Qian's token?

90
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,260
You want to sneak into
the Medicine Forest?

91
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,130
Got you!

92
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,330
Will you surrender obediently

93
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,010
or come with me
to find the elders and explain?

94
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,690
Miss,

95
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,850
I don't think you are my opponent.

96
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,780
Of course, I'm not your opponent.

97
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,700
I'm your accomplice.

98
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,660
Accomplice?

99
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,410
You see,

100
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,060
now that I know your secret,

101
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,340
and

102
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,380
I'm going to help you

103
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,010
steal that token.

104
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,130
So,

105
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,700
aren't we accomplices?

106
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,780
Miss, are you willing to help me?

107
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,290
Think about it.

108
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,700
On a dark night,

109
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,330
you and I fly over rooftops,
and fight side by side.

110
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,170
Doesn't it sound exciting?

111
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,780
- Since it's the case, then...
- Shh...

112
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,100
Keep it down.

113
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,730
Since we can use the main gate,

114
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,100
why this disguise?

115
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,820
If we want to be thieves,
we should look like them,

116
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,450
and besides,

117
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,010
don't you like the feeling

118
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,170
of we fighting in unified uniform?

119
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,820
Elder Hu Qian is sleeping pretty soundly.

120
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,500
He usually wakes up every one hour.

121
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,450
How do you know?

122
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,610
He's my grandfather.

123
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,730
I know him well.

124
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,100
Now, let's get to work.

125
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,610
You go find, and I'll keep watch here.

126
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,780
Go.

127
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,570
Which one is it?

128
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,850
I haven't seen it.

129
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,570
Do you know what the token looks like?

130
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,290
I have never seen it.

131
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,130
Such an important item

132
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,500
wouldn't be left out in the open.

133
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,450
It should be carried on the person.

134
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,250
That makes sense.

135
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,340
I got nothing.

136
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,340
Have you found it?

137
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,660
Hu Jia.

138
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,330
There's a token.

139
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,010
Elder Hu.

140
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,500
Elder Hu?

141
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,850
Elder Hu.

142
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,260
Have you gone to bed?

143
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,890
Tonight, we should

144
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,330
guard the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower
together.

145
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,380
Elder Hu?

146
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,370
That was close.

147
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,940
He had to go there

148
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,340
at that critical moment.

149
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,140
Luckily, we got out in time.

150
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,050
Miss Hu Jia,

151
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,700
please give me the token.

152
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,260
I have forgotten to take it out.

153
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,100
What?

154
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,530
I've never seen you like this.

155
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,340
Miss Hu Jia, please don't joke about this.

156
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,610
I did that on purpose.

157
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,820
I don't think even Xun'er
has ever seen you like that.

158
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,820
If I give you the token,

159
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,610
I'll become useless to you,

160
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,780
right?

161
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,140
You helped me a lot today,
and I'm very grateful.

162
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,460
I don't need your gratitude.

163
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,130
Just remember,

164
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,940
you owe me a favor.

165
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,570
Miss Hu Jia,

166
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,060
aren't you going to ask me
what I want to do with it?

167
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,730
That's your business.

168
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,170
I've done

169
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,650
what I needed to do.

170
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,980
It's getting late.

171
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,100
Be careful.

172
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,580
I will be careful.

173
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,770
Thank you for today.

174
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,530
Give me the token,

175
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:17,970
and you can go back now.

176
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,220
I'm also going in.

177
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,770
More people means a bigger target.

178
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,290
You better leave now.

179
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,610
Just do what you need to do.

180
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,730
This token can only be used for an hour.

181
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,090
You must come out in an hour.

182
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,180
Understand?

183
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,260
Of course, I understand.

184
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,140
It was stolen by you,
so you are the boss.

185
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,060
What do you mean by "stolen"?

186
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,250
Stop talking.

187
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,850
It will close in an hour.

188
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,900
Hurry and go in.

189
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:51,940
Your Highness.

190
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,850
A decisive man like him

191
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,820
is quite charming.

192
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,540
Are you surprised?

193
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,900
What...

194
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,940
How can you act on your own?

195
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,420
You brat,

196
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,610
you are in no place to command me.

197
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,340
What if your identity is exposed?

198
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,450
Lower your voice.

199
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,610
It's just past midnight,

200
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,900
maybe many people are still awake.

201
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,410
Should I call them over

202
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,060
to see who is doing

203
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,460
something sneaky here?

204
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,650
What benefit do you get

205
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,090
from doing this?

206
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,180
None.

207
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,700
I just want you to learn a lesson

208
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,850
because you didn't

209
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,340
take my matter seriously.

210
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,770
I never said I wouldn't refine
the Thawing Spirit Pill for you.

211
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,900
But I need to save my brother first.

212
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,780
There are many medicinal materials here.

213
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,000
Some can save your brother,

214
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,610
and some can refine
the Thawing Spirit Pill.

215
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,770
Now go, find them for me.

216
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,610
Is this how you ask for help?

217
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,050
Cut the nonsense.

218
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,900
This is the Academy's elixir room.

219
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,770
There's a strange Dou Qi aura.

220
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,460
That way...

221
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,100
The Medicine Forest!

222
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,100
Here, take this.

223
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,210
Sprinkle it along the way.

224
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,610
Am I your servant?

225
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,090
What's the point of sprinkling this?

226
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,900
This pill

227
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,460
will make the Fire and Ice
Dragon Beard Fruit react.

228
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,260
Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit?

229
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,610
There's really something wrong.

230
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,740
Halt!

231
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,940
What a strange Dou Qi.

232
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,460
Who are you?

233
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,340
Be careful.

234
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,530
Quickly, go after them!

235
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,450
Watch out for ambushes.

236
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,090
Xiao Yan is still inside!

237
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,450
What beautiful eyes.

238
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,870
You're not human either?

239
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,970
Of course I'm not human.

240
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,410
I'm the Queen
of the Serpent Kingdom.

241
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,530
Miss Queen.

242
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,260
Miss. Miss. Miss.

243
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,100
Stop.

244
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,770
I'm not close to you.

245
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,260
She's a dragon.

246
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,170
She probably took the morphing herb

247
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,970
and can change her form at will.

248
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,690
Kid.

249
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,170
Are you staying here alone?

250
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,020
Old man Hao let me stay here.

251
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,290
He said I could eat
whatever I wanted.

252
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,530
So you're the monster
in the Medicine Forest

253
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,210
that everyone talked about.

254
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,820
I'm not a monster.

255
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,900
I'm the Ancient Dragon of Taixu.

256
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,820
The big three Magic Beast families.

257
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,980
No!

258
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,410
Let me.

259
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,090
Kid.

260
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,290
This doesn't taste good.

261
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,580
Put it down.

262
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,770
No way.

263
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,580
How can I grow up if I don't eat?

264
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,340
I'll give you something in exchange.

265
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,460
Old man Hao doesn't allow me

266
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,530
to eat anything from strangers.

267
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,170
I'm not a bad person.

268
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,540
Ask her.

269
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,340
I doubt it.

270
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,090
Little girl.

271
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,060
You are really strong.

272
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,530
You've got to do it harder. It's fun.

273
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,010
I lost.

274
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,290
You don't want to play anymore?

275
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,460
Since I've lost,

276
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,060
you can have
the Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit.

277
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,530
I was going to trade you

278
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,130
for the world's most delicious elixir.

279
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,700
I don't think

280
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,580
we'll get the chance. Maybe next time.

281
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,820
Give it to me.

282
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,980
Shame on you!

283
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,980
Give me the Fire and Ice
Dragon Beard Fruit first.

284
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,100
Give me the elixir first.

285
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,370
All for you.

286
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,370
So many.

287
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,530
What about the Fire and Ice
Dragon Beard Fruit?

288
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,860
It tastes good.

289
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,770
Easy.

290
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,980
You'll have problems
if you eat that much.

291
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,770
I don't care.

292
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,460
My father told me

293
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,290
I have to grow up fast to see him.

294
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,580
So I have to eat more
and grow up faster.

295
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,650
Who's your father?

296
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,010
My father is just my father.

297
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,940
But

298
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,060
my father doesn't like you humans

299
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,340
as much as I do.

300
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,890
You are always screaming

301
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,820
when you see us.

302
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:12,970
It's annoying.

303
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,770
But

304
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,890
you're not like them.

305
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,700
What's your name?

306
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,650
Just call me Xiao Yan.

307
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,090
Xiao Yan?

308
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,250
I've memorized it.

309
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,100
My name is Zi Yan.

310
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,250
I'll come back for you
when I'm hungry.

311
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,420
Zi Yan?

312
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,460
I think I've heard that name
somewhere before.

313
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,100
The first place
of Strong Ranking Grand Competition.

314
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,220
Your Highness, wait for me.

315
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,510
Zi Yan is the first place
of Strong Ranking Grand Competition.

316
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,100
The first place is a dragon,
not a human,

317
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,490
and even an Ancient Dragon of Taixu.

318
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,540
Xun'er.

319
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,650
Why are you together?

320
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,100
Why are you together?

321
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,940
Was there anyone suspicious

322
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,340
in the Medicine Forest?

323
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,570
Does it have anything to do with you?

324
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,250
This is not the time for such nonsense.

325
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,920
There's something wrong
with the Medicine Forest.

326
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,490
You'd better leave
and never come back.

327
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,540
- I…
- Gu Yao is right.

328
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,980
The boundary's been breached.

329
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,460
The elders will know soon.

330
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,410
Xun'er, why are you
always defending him?

331
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,580
Come on.

332
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,900
Let's split up.

333
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,490
Xiao Yan, you should
go back to your dormitory.

334
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,980
What a perfect match.

335
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,130
Right?

336
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,940
It's because you messed up.

337
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,650
You ungrateful person.

338
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,100
You don't realize
I'm trying to help you.

339
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,580
You call that helping me?

340
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,250
Let me ask you.

341
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,100
Was that girl angry when she left?

342
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,220
Of course she was.

343
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,530
It's a good thing

344
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,090
she's angry.

345
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,860
If she isn't,

346
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,100
you're done.

347
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,650
There's not that much going on
between Xun'er and me.

348
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,530
You're pretty confident.

349
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,540
Whatever.

350
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,130
Leave.

351
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,060
Don't look back.

352
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,820
This kid looks like Xiao Yan.

353
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,860
He must be Xiao Yan.

354
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,940
He asked me for the Ice and Fire
Dragon Beard Fruit during the day

355
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,700
and came to the Medicine Forest
at night.

356
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,840
There's something wrong with him.

357
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,370
Yes.

358
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,820
I...

359
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:13,850
It dropped.

360
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,980
We'll have to take a closer look later.

361
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,780
Mr. Yao.

362
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,740
Something is wrong with you today.

363
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,580
Things are getting
more and more complicated.

364
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,370
If I'm right,

365
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,530
Jia Nan Academy is being targeted.

366
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,780
What do you mean?

367
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,860
I didn't realize the filth was back.

368
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,770
Filth? What filth?

369
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,490
It's a bunch of ghosts in human skin.

370
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,620
On Dou Qi Continent,

371
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,530
only they would use
the most cruel of means

372
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,700
to make themselves stronger.

373
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,010
They suck the Dou Qi
of the living for their own cultivation.

374
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,770
They kill and suck blood

375
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,980
and do everything evil.

376
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,370
Who are you talking about?

377
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,610
The Hall of Souls.

378
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,370
Gu Yao, go back first.

379
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,610
Here I am.

380
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,940
Are you afraid Xiao Yan
will see the injury on your hand?

381
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,580
I brought medicine from the Gu Clan.

382
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,440
At least it will help you
get better faster.

383
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,650
Tell me if it hurts.

384
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,580
Did you want to go into
the Medicine Forest before

385
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,650
to find out
about the weirdness tonight?

386
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,490
Yes.

387
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,250
What's your mission here
at Jia Nan Academy?

388
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,410
To bring you back.

389
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,820
What else?

390
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,890
So you stay at Jia Nan Academy

391
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,410
because of some mission of the Gu Clan?

392
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,860
The Xiao Clan has
an ancestral ancient jade

393
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,290
related to the Gu Clan.

394
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,250
My father told me to use
the power of my bloodline

395
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,510
to guard the Xiao Clan's ancient jade
from being coveted by outsiders.

396
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,650
This is the task of the Gu Clan for me.

397
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,250
This is Ancient Jade Token.

398
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,820
When I first got to the Xiao Clan,

399
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,820
my father told me
to perceive the ancient jade with it.

400
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,490
Now this ancient jade

401
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,170
is most likely in Xiao Yan's possession.

402
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,620
So

403
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,010
I will not leave him.

404
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,620
An ancient jade related to the Gu Clan...

405
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,620
I've said all I have to say.

406
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,900
What about you?

407
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,340
Do you know
about the Hall of Souls?

408
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,130
The Hall of Souls?

409
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,370
I guess those two black-robed men
are related to the Hall of Souls.

410
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,340
The Hall of Souls...

411
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,940
The Hall of Souls...

412
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,940
I heard about it in the clan
when I was young.

413
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,780
But no way.

414
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,220
Wasn't the Hall of Souls

415
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,100
wiped out a long time ago?

416
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,300
Right.

417
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,130
They've been out of sight for years.

418
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,700
But the Black Submerged Army has been
investigating their movements.

419
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,130
We've received intelligence

420
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,940
that they've appeared
in the Jia Ma Empire.

421
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,860
So they've infiltrated Jia Nan Academy?

422
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,490
Yes.

423
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,490
The tower opening ceremony
is in the next few days.

424
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,290
The Hall of Souls is targeting
the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower?

425
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,770
The Heavenly Flames, Fallen Heart Flame,
of Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.

426
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,460
To get the Heavenly Flames?

427
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,860
If they took action at this moment,

428
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,170
Jia Nan Academy
would be in for a great calamity.

429
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,170
Firmament Fruit, Syrup of Longevity,

430
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,860
Evergreen Vine.

431
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,940
Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit
for now.

432
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,290
The control of the fire

433
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,460
is the key to refining the elixir.

434
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,100
A little too much fire

435
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,580
will turn the whole pot into ashes,
and all the work will be wasted.

436
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,010
A little less fire

437
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,100
will spoil the herbs
and you won't get anything.

438
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,370
To control the fire,

439
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,290
you need strong spiritual perception.

440
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,900
Refine.

441
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,530
You're running low on Dou Qi.

442
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,740
The Firmament Longevity Pill
is a grade 6 elixir.

443
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,010
It's too much for you to make it alone.

444
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,160
If you continue to refine it,

445
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,580
it will be too much of a drain on you.

446
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,530
As long as I can save my brother,

447
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,740
no matter what the cost is,

448
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,770
I will refine this elixir.

449
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,490
The yin and yang
of the Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit

450
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,060
are mutually exclusive.

451
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,530
The Green Lotus Core Flame
is neutral and peaceful.

452
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,980
Your Dou Qi is the most yang fire.

453
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,530
It lacks a cold fire.

454
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,820
That's why you can't digest
the Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit.

455
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,700
Cold fire?

456
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,740
The only cold fire I know of

457
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,860
is the Bone Spirit Cold Fire.

458
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,610
You don't have to do anything.

459
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,290
Just lend me the Bone Spirit Cold Fire.

460
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,770
Bone Spirit Cold Fire
doesn't belong to you.

461
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,890
It's not always obedient
when you're at the controls.

462
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,060
If you can't hold out,

463
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,630
your meridians will be in danger
of being melted by Bone Spirit Cold Fire.

464
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,770
I can make it.

465
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,010
Bone Spirit Cold Fire
is extreme yin and yang.

466
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,370
You have to endure the endless roasting
of fire in the Land of Eternal Day,

467
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,890
which is interchanged
with the drilling pain

468
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,010
of immutable metaphysical ice

469
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,410
in the Land of Extreme Cold.

470
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,290
I don't know when it will end.

471
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,820
Refining elixir

472
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,010
is refining the heaven and the earth,

473
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,170
the mountains and the sea.

474
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,220
Grade 1 elixir for external injuries.

475
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,340
Grade 2 elixir for internal injuries.

476
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,290
Grade 3 elixir for transformation.

477
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,980
Grade 4 elixir for reveling ability.

478
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,100
Grade 5 elixir for a new level.

479
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,490
Grade 6 elixir for Dou Emperor.

480
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,580
Grade 7 elixir for Dou Venerate.

481
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,620
Grade 8 elixir for heavenly calamity.

482
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,530
Grade 9 elixir for watershed.

483
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,770
The Grade Emperor takes human form.

484
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,490
An elixir

485
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,340
is not only used

486
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,460
to raise the level of Dou Practitioners,

487
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,460
but also a nameless object
that saves people from danger.

488
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,700
The key to making an elixir

489
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,220
is sincerity.

490
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,370
No!

491
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,610
Mr. Yao.

492
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,980
The Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit
is gone.

493
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,700
You made it?

494
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,490
Yes!

495
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:16,850
That's it!

496
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,010
Wake up.

497
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,310
Brother.

498
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,180
Brother.

499
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,370
He woke up.

500
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,610
Xun'er.

501
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,730
Brat.

502
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,490
I thought I'd never see you again.

503
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,610
Brother.

504
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,100
What happened?

505
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,860
After the three-year appointment,

506
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,220
you won over Nalan Yanran

507
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,170
fair and square.

508
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,700
But Yun Shan became enraged

509
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,250
and hunted down the Xiao Clan.

510
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,300
In the end,

511
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,570
in order to cover the retreat
of our second brother with the clan,

512
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,620
Father

513
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,180
was captured by them.

514
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,420
Father was captured?

515
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,500
I am sorry.

516
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,340
It's all my fault.

517
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,260
I...

518
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,220
Misty Cloud Sect is trying
to wipe out the Xiao Clan.

519
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,180
Brother.

520
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,140
Water.

521
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,140
This is the Xiao Clan's ancient jade.

522
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,945
(Xiao Zhan, Xiao Yan's father)
It is linked to the bloodline

523
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,920
(Xiao Zhan, Xiao Yan's father)
of all our patriarchs.

524
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,180
The flickering light proves
that I am safe.

525
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,940
If I'm gone,

526
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,380
this jade will make you

527
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,420
the patriarch of the Xiao Clan.

528
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,660
This is the ancient jade
from Father.

529
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,700
The life of the current patriarch

530
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,060
can be sensed on the ancient jade.

531
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,060
The flickering of the light point indicates
that Father is still alive.

532
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,220
Xiao Yan.

533
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,060
This jade is not an ordinary one.

534
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,380
This is Tuoshe Ancient Emperor Jade.

535
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,980
Tuoshe Ancient Emperor Jade?

536
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,780
When Father gave me the jade,

537
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,060
he said it was a legacy
of the Xiao Clan

538
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,980
and only the patriarchs could have it.

539
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,380
Since it is a legacy
of the Xiao Clan's patriarchs,

540
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,700
it might have a more important

541
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,060
meaning and function.

542
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,580
Xiao Yan.

543
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,100
Guard it well.

544
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,980
Don't show it to anyone.

545
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,380
Father.

546
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,620
I will definitely get you out.
