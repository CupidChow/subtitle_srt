Yao Chen.

20
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,690
You're meant to be

21
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,570
betrayed by your most trusted disciple.

22
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,690
I pity you.

23
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,740
There are many things in this world

24
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,460
that people like you
will never understand.

25
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,540
If you want me to die again,
there's no need to have Xiao Yan do it.

26
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,850
You can do it yourself.

27
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,330
Cut it out. Xiao Yan, kill him.

28
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,850
Mr. Yao.

29
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,770
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,300
It's okay.

31
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,810
Do what you have to do.

32
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,530
I won't blame you.

Han Feng.

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,810
Don't you want the Flame Mantra?

37
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,090
Dream on!

38
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,260
No!

39
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,700
Xiao Yan.

40
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,890
Turn to ashes

41
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,250
with the Flame Mantra!

42
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,250
Mr. Yao, I'll leave Xun'er to you.

43
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,020
- Xiao Yan!
- Xun'er!

44
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,580
If the Hall of Souls doesn't get
the Fallen Heart Flame today,

45
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,300
you'll all die with him.

46
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,090
Xiao Yan!

47
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,780
Xun'er.

48
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,610
I just gave you some medicine.

49
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,450
Don't get up yet.

50
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,660
Where's Xiao Yan?

51
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,060
In your condition,
you can't go anywhere now.

52
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,940
Just leave Xiao Yan to the elders and me.

53
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,260
He hasn't come out yet,

54
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,690
right?

55
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,730
Xun'er, it's been two days.

56
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,260
In the tower is the Fallen Heart Flame.

57
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,540
There's no chance he'll survive.

58
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,220
It's a fact.

59
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,260
You have to accept it.

60
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,450
Neither you nor I can change it.

61
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,380
Gu Yao.

62
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,700
You know nothing.

63
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,250
Xun'er.

64
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,890
What's the point of lying to yourself?

65
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,290
This is my own business.

66
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,100
Gu Xun'er, listen,

67
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,340
the patriarch ordered me

68
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,100
to bring you back to the Gu Clan safely.

69
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
I swore to him

70
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,540
that I'd protect you.

71
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,700
I can't put you in danger
unless I'm dead.

72
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,780
Gu Yao.

73
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,500
Get out of the way.

74
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,890
It seems that the Medicine Sage
and Xiao Yan

75
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,410
have tried their best.

76
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,940
Without them,

77
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,100
the Jia Nan Academy

78
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,330
would have ceased to exist.

79
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,450
Is there no hope?

80
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,010
Even us

81
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,940
won't be able to survive

82
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,890
in the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower

83
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,060
after being hit
by the Fallen Heart Flame,

84
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,100
not to mention Xiao Yan.

85
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,890
He sacrificed himself

86
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,890
for the Academy.

87
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,690
I know.

88
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,820
I know you're upset.

89
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,820
But you have to know

90
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,660
that you're taking care of yourself

91
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,170
for Xiao Yan.

92
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,380
Headmaster.

93
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,060
I'm going to find Xiao Yan.

94
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,170
The seal has just been restored.

95
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,380
The situation inside the Tower
is complicated.

96
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,660
We've checked it.

97
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,260
Xiao Yan's Dou Qi

98
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,890
has completely disappeared.

99
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,610
He has been devoured

100
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,410
by the Fallen Heart Flame.

101
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,130
Xun'er.

102
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,540
It's impossible.

103
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,290
Xiao Yan...

104
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,100
Xiao Yan has been devoured.

105
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,140
Xun'er.

106
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,030
It's impossible.

107
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,010
Xun'er.

108
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,610
It's impossible.

109
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,100
Xun'er.

110
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,250
It's impossible.

111
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,170
It can't be.

112
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,330
Headmaster, I'm going to find him.

113
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,170
No.

114
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,700
You can't.

115
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,980
Xiao Yan can't be dead.

116
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,130
He just came back.

117
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,790
He promised me

118
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,850
he would never leave me again.

119
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,700
I just saw him.

120
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,930
I...

121
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,820
I just saw him.

122
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,260
Xiao Yan!

123
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,770
Xiao Yan!

124
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,990
(Magma World, at the bottom
of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower)

125
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:40,930
Mr. Yao.

126
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,570
Mr. Yao.

127
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Boy, you're awake.

128
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,420
Mr. Yao.

129
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,530
Why didn't you leave?

130
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,140
You brat.

131
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,970
Would you still be there if I left?

132
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,940
I protected you
with the Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

133
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,730
If not for that,

134
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,770
you might have been devoured
by the Fallen Heart Flame.

135
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,050
Mr. Yao.

136
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,770
How are you now?

137
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,770
It cost me too much energy.

138
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,250
I'm afraid

139
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,730
I'll have to sleep for a while this time.

140
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,260
It's my fault.

141
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,210
It's all because of me.

142
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,180
- Mr. Yao.
- Listen.

143
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,340
When I fell into the Stone Well with you,

144
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,290
I saw the Fallen Heart Flame
turn into a Fire Python.

145
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,020
Its power is concentrated in the heart.

146
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,500
If you pull out the core,
you can subdue the Heavenly Flame.

147
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,820
I also left you
the Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

148
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,180
Remember,

149
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,060
a powerful Heavenly Flame
can devour a weaker one.

150
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,260
That's an unchanging rule,

151
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,380
and you should use it well.

152
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,900
It has different power
in different hands.

153
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,370
Are you awake?

154
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,290
Why did you hit me?

155
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,140
The first slap was to wake you up.

156
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,110
The second slap was to punish you

157
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,900
for bringing me
to such a dangerous place.

158
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,450
What are you doing?

159
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,090
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

160
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,700
Protect yourself
with the Green Lotus Core Flame.

161
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,340
You should leave now.

162
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,370
Do you want me to leave?

163
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,820
Do you want to take
the Fallen Heart Flame to yourself?

164
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,050
I'm not leaving.

165
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,250
Your Highness.

166
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,500
The Fallen Heart Flame
is in the Magma World,

167
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,210
and it could erupt at any time.

168
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,650
It's not a joke this time.

169
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,540
I have to save my father,

170
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,770
and I must take the flame.

171
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,770
I have to subdue it

172
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,940
even at the risk of my life,

173
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,640
but you don't have to do this.

174
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,610
You should leave now.

175
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,850
I'm the Queen of the Snake People.

176
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,970
I've seen all kinds of situations.

177
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,700
I don't need a brat like you

178
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,900
to pretend to care about me.

179
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,940
If I want to leave,

180
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,060
no one can stop me.

181
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,170
If I want to stay,

182
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,290
the Fallen Heart Flame

183
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,900
can't make me leave.

184
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:24,930
I know

185
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,900
that you're worried about me.

186
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,850
Our agreement

187
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,820
is less about a trade

188
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,540
but more about our friendship.

189
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,530
You've been protecting me,

190
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,610
and I appreciate that.

191
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,580
But it's different this time.

192
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,140
Whether it's good or bad,

193
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,500
I'll handle it myself.

194
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,610
Fine.

195
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,810
Now that you've said it,

196
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,850
whether it's for the sake
of trade or friendship,

197
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,020
I must help you.

198
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,740
I've told you

199
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,060
that your life is mine.

200
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,060
If I'm not asking you to die,

201
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,020
you're not allowed to die.

202
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,420
Your Highness...

203
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,340
All right, enough talking.

204
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,650
Let's subdue the Fallen Heart Flame now.

205
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,540
I don't believe we can't do it.

206
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,090
It's just a Heavenly Flame.

207
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,650
What's the big deal?

208
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,130
Okay.

209
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,370
I have a plan.

210
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,100
Go ahead.

211
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,170
If this plan works,

212
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,380
both of us can get out of here

213
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,530
and subdue the Fallen Heart Flame.

214
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,130
Are you sure?

215
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,730
It's 50% to you and 50% to me.

216
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,970
I'll use the Green Lotus
Core Flame as bait

217
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,210
to lure out the Fallen Heart Flame.

218
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,150
Then, I'll use the Bone Spirit Cold Flame
to protect myself

219
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,210
and enter the Fallen Heart Flame.

220
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,730
On my cue,

221
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:58,850
let's work together

222
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,250
to pull out its core.

223
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,340
Okay.

224
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,220
Let's do it this way.

225
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,500
But when I make a move,

226
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,580
there's no such thing
as a 50/50 chance.

227
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,900
If we're going to do it,

228
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,970
we're going to make it.

229
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,540
It's coming.

230
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,020
Fallen Heart Flame.

231
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,770
We finally meet.

232
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,010
I see it.

233
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,500
The core is in its heart.

234
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,900
I'm going in now

235
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,690
to mark it
with the Bone Spirit Cold Flame

236
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,660
so that you can see it.

237
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,410
Wait for my cue.

238
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,510
Hold on.

239
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,780
What if your armor gets burned through

240
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,650
when you go in there?

241
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,740
There's no other way.

242
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,650
Will you be able
to come back alive if you fail?

243
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,340
Just wait for me as I told you.

244
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,340
Don't make any move
until the Cold Flame lights up.

245
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,130
You brat.

246
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,100
Listen, you'd better not fail.

247
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,530
If you fail,

248
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,740
I won't spare you.

249
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,300
Xiao Yan!

250
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,820
Are you finished?

251
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Xiao Yan, say something! Xiao Yan!

252
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,770
The Bone Spirit Cold Flame
will drive the Fire Python crazy.

253
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,290
You must seize the chance out there.

254
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,620
The vibration is coming from below.

255
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,860
It's Xiao Yan. He's still alive.

256
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,740
Why are you so sure?

257
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,130
My Gu Jade Token
and Xiao Yan's Ancient Jade

258
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,370
are closely related.

259
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,340
The jade has a response,

260
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,490
which means Xiao Yan is still alive.

261
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,010
Xiao Yan! I can't hold on much longer!

262
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,010
Do it!

263
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,250
Do it now!

264
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,860
Burn the heaven and devour the earth!

265
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:13,850
Xiao Yan!

266
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,370
Xiao Yan.

267
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,780
Xiao Yan.

268
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,330
Xiao Yan.

269
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,210
Xiao Yan.

270
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,780
You brat.

271
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,530
We had an agreement.

272
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,530
Except for me,

273
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,010
no one can take your life. Get up!

274
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:08,850
Your Highness.

275
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,010
You're not really crying, are you?

276
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,620
How dare you make fun of me?

277
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,010
You were...

278
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,220
Your Highness,
your snake pattern is gone.

279
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,730
Really?

280
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,370
Snake Transformation.

281
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:54,970
I've leveled up.

282
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,580
The Fallen Heart Flame
has helped us level up.

283
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,660
No wonder.

284
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,860
I feel that my whole body

285
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,340
has been burned
by the Fallen Heart Flame,

286
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:07,100
and my limbs feel brand new.

287
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,130
Is this

288
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,340
what it feels like to level up?

289
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:16,730
Have a try.

290
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,820
Xiao Yan, well done.

291
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,650
You're at the level of Dou King now.

292
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,490
Xiao Yan!

293
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,700
Xun'er.

294
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,740
Xiao Yan.

295
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,410
She's noisy and everywhere.

296
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,130
Let's go up.

297
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,220
Xiao Yan!

298
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,460
I'm at the level of Dou King

299
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,660
and should be able to make it.

300
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,820
Xiao Yan!

301
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,700
Xiao Yan.

302
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,580
Xun'er.

303
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,700
How are you?

304
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,890
Are you hurt?

305
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,740
Do you know
you almost scared me to death?

306
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,460
- I thought you were dead.
- All right.

307
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,890
- I thought I'd never see you again.
- I'm fine.

308
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,770
All right. I'm fine.

309
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,650
See, I'm perfectly fine now.

310
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,130
Don't be afraid.

311
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,890
Xiao Yan!

312
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,510
- Are you really uninjured?
- What are you looking at?

313
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,100
Tell me

314
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,410
- what happened down there.
- You're not needed.

315
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,860
Haven't you realized
that you're an eyesore?

316
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,860
Since Xiao Yan is fine,

317
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,700
let's go and join them

318
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,740
instead of wasting time here.

319
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,090
You brat.

320
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,460
Come here.

321
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,420
It's okay.

322
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,340
Your Highness, what's wrong?

323
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,540
Listen,

324
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,250
since I've leveled up,

325
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,740
I won't stay by a mortal's side.

326
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,860
You'll have to

327
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,370
be careful with your life.

328
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,370
I'm leaving.

329
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,620
Are you leaving now?

330
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,490
Well,

331
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,180
do you not want me to leave?

332
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,010
I...

333
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,660
Your Highness.

334
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,250
I'm a man of my word.

335
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,410
I promise to give you
the pills you want.

336
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,770
Did I ever say I don't want the pills?

337
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,820
This is not over between us.

338
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,170
I'll settle the score with you later.

339
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,490
Don't follow me.

340
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,730
Look out for yourself.

341
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,130
Give it to me.

342
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,180
Be careful.

343
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,950
Let me do it.

344
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,800
Slow down.

345
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,610
Be careful.

346
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,220
Xiao Yan! Xiao Yan's back!

347
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,460
He's back.

348
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,780
It's Xiao Yan.

349
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,820
- Xiao Yan.
- That's great.

350
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,460
You're lucky to be back alive.

351
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,890
You survived it this time.
There must be a blessing waiting for you.

352
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,650
It's not just a blessing for him.

353
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,580
It's also a blessing
for the Jia Nan Academy.

354
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,010
- Yeah.
- That's right.

355
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,060
Headmaster.

356
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,490
Han Feng of the Hall of Souls failed,

357
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,580
and the Fallen Heart Flame
has completely subsided.

358
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,860
It won't stir up trouble again.

359
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,490
Does it hurt?

360
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,900
No.

361
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Why is your face so red?

362
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,100
Do you have internal injuries?

363
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,770
I don't have internal injuries.

364
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,370
Seeing you

365
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,290
can heal all my injuries.

366
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:01,940
Xiao Yan.

367
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,530
Do you have anything to tell me?

368
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,820
Oh, right,

369
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,890
I've subdued the Fallen Heart Flame.

370
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,610
Really?

371
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,660
That's great.

372
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,530
Tell me how you did it.

373
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,410
You know what,

374
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,490
the Fallen Heart Flame
turned into a Fire Python.

375
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,340
We worked really well together.

376
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,820
I was inside,

377
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,010
and she was outside.

378
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,180
- "We"?
- Then I...

379
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,090
"She"?

380
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,100
Yeah, me and Queen She Cailin.

381
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,330
Then what happened?

382
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,100
Then

383
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,940
I went into the python's belly,

384
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,100
stirred it up, and pulled out its core.

385
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,250
Finally,

386
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,010
I subdued it.

387
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:46,770
That simple?

388
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,530
It sounds simple.

389
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,700
You have no idea how dangerous it was.

390
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,370
Luckily, we worked well together.

391
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,740
You two are quite in tune.

392
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,220
It's not like that, Xun'er.

393
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,580
I couldn't handle it alone.

394
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,820
Well,

395
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,980
don't be angry.

396
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,170
Why should I be angry?

397
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,370
Are you not angry?

398
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,090
You fool.

399
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,340
You're back safe and sound,

400
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,940
and you've subdued
the Fallen Heart Flame.

401
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,650
I can't be happier for you.

402
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,740
As for Queen She Cailin,

403
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,250
she didn't abandon you in danger.

404
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,220
I truly admire her.

405
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,010
I don't get you girls.

406
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,940
Sometimes you disdain someone,

407
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,770
and other times you admire her.

408
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,860
I...

409
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,940
You don't need to understand.

410
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,650
It doesn't matter.

411
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,940
(Feng City, Blackhorn Domain)

412
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,340
(Mu Gu, Elder of Hall of Souls)

413
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,460
Greetings, Elder Mu Gu.

414
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:53,980
You failed.

415
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,740
I was incompetent.

416
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,940
I deserve to be punished.

417
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,200
It's just that there's someone powerful

418
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,130
in the Jia Nan Academy.

419
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,940
I need your help, Elder.

420
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,890
You always want more than you do.

421
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,410
Please grant me
the real Sea Heart Flame.

422
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,650
With the help of the Sea Heart Flame,

423
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,580
I can surely get you

424
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,860
the Fallen Heart Flame.

425
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,530
The Heavenly Flames are supreme treasures
in the Dou Qi Continent.

426
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,250
You want too much.

427
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,980
It's because the Heavenly Flames
are true treasures,

428
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,460
otherwise,

429
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:36,850
why would I

430
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,740
ask you for it?

431
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,900
Is this...

432
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,620
Is this the true Sea Heart Flame?

433
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,740
The Sea Heart Flame is hidden
in the cold underworld.

434
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,130
Once it enters your blood,

435
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,700
your muscles and bones
will be devoured by the cold poison.

436
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,010
You will die first before you live.

437
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,770
Enjoy the pain

438
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,220
and don't waste the gift
from the Hall of Souls.

439
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,250
My face...

440
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,940
Only the competent
deserve the supreme treasures.

441
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,490
You're merely a Dou Emperor,

442
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,220
and you leveled up by using
the Hall of Souls' Dou Qi.

443
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,890
You're overconfident.

444
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,620
Mercy, Elder.

445
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,170
Please take back the Sea Heart Flame.

446
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,460
Han Feng, remember this.

447
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,490
First, never negotiate terms
with the Hall of Souls.

448
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,130
You're just a pawn
for the Hall of Souls.

449
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,580
Secondly,

450
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,010
I can replace you at any time.

451
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,890
If you fail to complete your mission,

452
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,010
I will take back all the gifts
from the Hall of Souls,

453
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,490
including your life.

454
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,250
Elder, please give me one more chance.

455
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,700
It was

456
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,580
an accident.

457
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,220
What kind of accident can there be
in the small Jia Nan Academy?

458
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,820
Medicine Sage.

459
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,890
I didn't expect Yao Chen
to be at the Jia Nan Academy,

460
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,300
and

461
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,820
there was a guy named Xiao Yan.

462
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,490
Both of them have Heavenly Flames.

463
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,210
That's why

464
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,100
I failed.

465
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,180
Yao Chen is still alive?

466
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:17,610
That's right.

467
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,250
He has the Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

468
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,860
When I fought with him,

469
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,690
he hadn't recovered his strength
as a Dou Venerate.

470
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,340
That's why he's hiding
in Xiao Yan's Storage Ring

471
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,180
and dares not come out to fight

472
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,620
until he has to.

473
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,900
Is it true?

474
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,620
