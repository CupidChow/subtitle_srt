(Elders' House)

20
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,250
Here's the token, Headmaster.

21
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,460
Hope you'll forgive us.

22
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,410
Gu Yao,

23
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:40,780
you're selling me out.

24
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,900
This is a very big deal.

25
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,570
For the fear that the Hall of Souls
covets the Fallen Heart Flame,

26
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,060
I have to tell you this
before you unseal the Tower.

27
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,610
Sorry, Miss Hu Jia.

28
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,140
Your clan also knows

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,930
that we have the Fallen Heart Flame?

30
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,850
The Hall of Souls knows it too, I'm afraid.

31
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,263
Dozens of years ago, I heard

32
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:58,960
the Hall of Souls raged across
the Central Plains.

33
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,250
Unexpectedly, such a wicked organization
still exists in this world.

34
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,780
They even infiltrated
our academy in Jia Ma Empire.

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,380
Headmaster,

36
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,220
the two men we fought last night

37
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,380
wore black robes as if they were twins.

38
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,060
What's the strangest

39
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,970
was their breathing.

40
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,450
Very weird.

41
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,890
Black-fog corrosion

42
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,000
may not necessarily be
a technique of the Hall of Souls.

43
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,090
But the stinky and decayed Dou Qi

44
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,220
smelled exactly the same
as that in the rumors.

45
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,010
Headmaster,

46
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,860
do you know who in Jia Ma Empire

47
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,690
might collude with the Hall of Souls?

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,170
Speaking of that,

49
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,970
I do suspect a man.

50
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,660
A dozen years ago,

51
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,090
he came to Jia Ma Empire
and settled down in Feng City,

52
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,590
calling himself the Medicine Emperor.

53
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,940
The Gold Silver Brothers
glued together with him.

54
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,780
They're like the two men
Xiao Xun'er just described.

55
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:46,930
Medicine Emperor?

56
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,610
That's what he calls himself.

57
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,330
His real name is Han Feng.

58
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,730
That's it.

59
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,890
Fifty years ago, Hun Miesheng,
the last chief of the Hall of Souls,

60
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,100
prospered this organization again,
raged across the Central Plains,

61
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,060
and started a war.

62
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,940
In the end, he was sealed by the Gu Clan.

63
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,780
As for Han Feng,

64
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,420
he was from a decent sect.

65
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,780
But he joined the Hall of Souls.

66
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,810
After the war, he disappeared
from the Central Plains.

67
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,660
I didn't expect him
to show up in Jia Ma Empire.

68
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,250
Han Feng, the Medicine Emperor,
is a survivor of the Hall of Souls.

69
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,890
Our academy

70
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,500
isn't a noble school

71
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,610
on the Central Plains.

72
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,610
But I think

73
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,300
our seal is solid enough.

74
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,580
And the Medicine Forest is safe

75
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,420
when no one can get in without the token.

76
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,420
Grandfather, it was my fault.

77
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,970
- You...
- I'm responsible.

78
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,860
I asked Miss Hu Jia for help.

79
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,610
If Commander Gu hadn't explored
the Medicine Forest last night,

80
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,380
we wouldn't know
about the Hall of Souls or Han Feng.

81
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,730
He redeemed himself.

82
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,220
Commander Gu, you could have

83
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,660
told us about your plan.

84
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,780
Why did you sneak in?

85
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,380
Were you two in the forest alone?

86
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:02,930
Elder Hao,

87
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,690
what have you found out?

88
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,690
Commander Gu sneaked
into the Medicine Forest

89
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,330
while some lackeys of the Hall of Souls

90
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,940
broke into our academy.

91
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,220
Can't you see anything wrong?

92
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,980
Headmaster,

93
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,660
Xiao Yan was also
in the Medicine Forest last night.

94
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,730
Just to get...

95
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,940
Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit!

96
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,060
Xiao Yan.

97
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,060
I think he's the mole.

98
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,290
Elder Hao,

99
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,800
the Hall of Souls
can do weird techniques.

100
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,450
It's unclear whether they know

101
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,290
how to break a seal.

102
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,060
Over the last century, our academy
has had a great school spirit.

103
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,610
All the elders do their jobs seriously.

104
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,130
All the disciples
follow strict discipline.

105
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,700
Xiao Yan is the only exception.

106
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,130
Since he came,
he's been disregarding discipline

107
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,330
and ignoring rules.

108
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,330
He's totally trampled our academy.

109
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,380
Elder Hao,

110
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,060
this is a very serious accusation.

111
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,170
Do you have firm evidence?

112
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,730
Xiao Yan, tell me.

113
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,400
Last night, did you sneak
into the Medicine Forest without permission

114
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,940
and steal the Fire and Ice
Dragon Beard Fruit?

115
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,820
Did you make authorized elixirs

116
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,990
and cause a violent vibration
of Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower?

117
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,730
Last night?

118
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,700
Last night what?

119
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,940
Yes, I guess.

120
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,330
See, Headmaster? He confessed.

121
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,130
He's the mole
colluding with the Hall of Souls

122
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,850
and the black sheep we must get rid of!

123
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,260
Why am I the mole and black sheep?

124
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,310
I just stole

125
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,730
a Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit.

126
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,940
Headmaster!

127
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,290
Xiao Yan had no choice but to steal it

128
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,700
to save his brother.

129
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,010
I arranged everything

130
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,010
to steal the token.

131
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,540
Punish me if necessary.

132
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,610
It's so silly of you!

133
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,890
Xiao Xun'er, he used you.

134
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,780
Why do you think
he sneaked into the Medicine Forest?

135
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,820
It's my fault to steal the fruit.

136
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,510
I'm sorry and I'm ready for punishment.

137
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,010
But my brother is dying.

138
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,170
To make the Firmament Longevity Pill,

139
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,060
I had to steal the fruit.

140
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,900
Headmaster,

141
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,780
if you knew what had happened,

142
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,010
you would understand.

143
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,890
You're still lying.

144
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,340
I'm asking you.

145
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,100
You're merely a student, a Dou Spirit,

146
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,980
and you're not a alchemist.

147
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,220
Firmament Longevity Pill, Grade 6 elixir.

148
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,990
Even throughout the Inner Academy,

149
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,170
only a few elders can make it.

150
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,700
Tell me. How did you make it?

151
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,100
Just tell me.

152
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,410
Mr. Yao,

153
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,660
what do I do?

154
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,780
Mr. Yao.

155
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,620
Mr. Yao!

156
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,850
Let me see what you can say.

157
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,450
I have a clear conscience.

158
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,330
I made the pill just to save my brother.

159
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,720
- You...
- Headmaster...

160
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,660
- All right.
- He...

161
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,610
Colluding with the Hall of Souls
is a serious accusation.

162
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,260
Before we figure out the whole truth,

163
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,380
we can't blame Xiao Yan for everything.

164
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,130
But...

165
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,330
You had a reason for stealing the fruit

166
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,380
and making pills without permission.

167
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,780
But you went against school rules

168
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,700
and nearly damaged the seal
of Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.

169
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,510
You deserve to be punished.

170
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,690
Xiao Yan,

171
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,450
you're disqualified
from entering the Tower

172
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,700
and you're grounded.

173
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,060
Tell me.

174
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,380
How did you collude

175
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,260
with the Gold Silver Brothers?

176
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,730
And what's your relationship
with Han Feng of the Hall of Souls?

177
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,460
Where are you?

178
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,300
You...

179
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,900
Elder Hao,

180
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

181
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,100
Don't play dumb with me.

182
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,700
You did the whole scene,

183
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,740
pretending to steal the fruit for your brother,

184
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,380
just to cover for how you got

185
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,500
the Gold Silver Brothers into the forest.

186
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,060
Elder Hao, I'm not the mole.

187
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,340
Don't waste your time on me.

188
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,500
If you insist,

189
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,580
you should catch the real mole.

190
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,180
You're the mole in my eyes.

191
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,980
Let me tell you something.

192
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,300
All the tokens have been replaced.

193
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,500
Whatever you're up to,

194
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,220
as long as you're grounded here,

195
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,220
the Hall of Souls
can't get what they want.

196
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,940
- Elder Hao...
- I...

197
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,980
Elder Hao...

198
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,900
Mr. Yao.

199
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,260
Mr. Yao?

200
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,860
Xiao Yan, time for lunch.

201
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,700
How did you get in?

202
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,780
Gu Yao invited Elder Hao to lunch.

203
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,820
- Here.
- Oh, my favorite food.

204
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,260
I know.

205
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,620
You must be hungry, huh?

206
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,620
Xun'er.

207
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,260
Do you remember the first night
when I came to Jia Nan Academy?

208
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,700
Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower?

209
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,180
I came here

210
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,140
just for the Fallen Heart Flame in it.

211
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,980
So, Xiao Yan,

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,780
you don't want to get into the Tower
for body refinement,

213
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,460
but for the Fallen Heart Flame?

214
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,340
Exactly.

215
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,740
I'm here

216
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,060
to conquer the Heavenly Flame
and go to Misty Cloud Sect.

217
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,860
Now, my father has been caught.

218
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,620
I can't sit here doing nothing.

219
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,580
I get it.

220
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,140
I'm also from the Xiao Clan.

221
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,860
I will help you

222
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,500
to save your father and your clan.

223
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,540
- You...
- You'll get burnt.

224
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,220
This is the best beast flame

225
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,340
I could buy spending
all my fire energy cards.

226
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,700
Compared to Heavenly Flames,

227
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,180
it has little energy and violence.

228
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,460
If I can't even conquer this,

229
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,460
how could I conquer
the Fallen Heart Flame tomorrow?

230
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,380
You want to conquer that?

231
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,220
I can't break the school rule

232
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,900
to get Xiao Yan out of his grounding.

233
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,820
But at least,

234
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,500
I can do what he wants to do.

235
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,140
You refuse to go back to the Gu Clan

236
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,180
and Xiao Yan

237
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,820
is the real reason.

238
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,500
Mr. Yao, why didn't you reply just now?

239
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,860
I had a disciple.

240
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,460
When he was 15,
he could make Grade 3 elixir

241
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,700
with beast flames.

242
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,420
When he was 20,
he became a Grade 6 alchemist.

243
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,140
He had a gift for medicinal materials

244
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,780
and pure Dou Qi of fire.

245
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,860
So, without Heavenly Flames,

246
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,580
he could also make perfect pills.

247
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,100
You had a disciple?

248
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,620
How come I didn't know?

249
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,460
When a man became greedy,

250
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,990
he wouldn't improve step by step.

251
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,260
He would always gamble,

252
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,820
thinking he could challenge the destiny.

253
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,460
You mean your disciple?

254
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,700
Where's he, then?

255
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,740
I reminded you.

256
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,260
The most horrible trick
of the Hall of Souls

257
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,060
is that it can trigger greediness.

258
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,060
Your disciple and the Hall of Souls...

259
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,820
Those men must have come here

260
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,100
for Heavenly Flames.

261
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,140
The Fallen Heart Flame is mine.

262
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
No one can take it away.

263
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,940
Take some good rest.

264
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,060
I guess there'll be a big fight tomorrow.

265
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,940
Elder Hao,

266
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,780
aren't you going to unseal the tower?

267
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,500
You wish.

268
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,980
If I went there, who would guard you?

269
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,260
Elder Hao.

270
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,500
Elder,

271
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,260
the elixirs you asked for.

272
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,540
Go to Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower

273
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,900
and deliver them to the headmaster.

274
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,180
This year, the situation is tough
with internal and external problems.

275
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,500
Ask the elders to take the elixirs

276
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,580
for some improvements.

277
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,460
I'll guard here until the last minute.

278
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,740
What elixir is it?

279
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,940
It helps to enhance Dou Qi

280
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,860
and solidify the seal of the tower.

281
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,620
If your accomplices really come,

282
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,260
they won't end up well.

283
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,900
Elder Hao,

284
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,220
I can't get out

285
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,740
and you don't want to leave.

286
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,140
Why don't we talk?

287
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,460
About the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.

288
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,980
The Tower?

289
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,020
Yeah.

290
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,740
I heard

291
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,900
Jia Nan Academy was built on its basis.

292
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,620
What makes this tower so great then?

293
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,540
Well, I can tell you this.

294
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,260
There's really a treasure

295
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,020
inside the tower.

296
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,540
Once a Dou Practitioner practices in it

297
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,300
and refines his body with the treasure,

298
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,500
he can improve by one star at least

299
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,980
and one level at most.

300
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,220
He's even likely

301
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,540
to turn from a Dou King
into a Dou Emperor.

302
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,260
What treasure is it?

303
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,700
It...

304
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,340
It won't be like you

305
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,940
who moves on the sly.

306
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,380
Don't play tricks.

307
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,540
Fine.

308
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,900
Sorry, then.

309
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,500
Xiao Yan, what are you doing?

310
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,060
I have to get out of here!

311
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,020
Zi Yan?

312
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,340
What are you doing here?

313
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,060
I was stealing some food
in Hao's warehouse

314
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,060
when I saw the record in his diary

315
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,780
that you stole
a Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit.

316
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,740
He was going too far.

317
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,060
Just a Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit.

318
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,260
Did he need to be so stingy?

319
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,380
And I gave you that fruit.

320
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,500
I should come and get you out.

321
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,900
Back off.

322
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,260
You're not going?

323
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,620
You're No.1 on the ranking. Don't you go?

324
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,100
You go alone.

325
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,580
I hit him too hard just now.

326
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,300
Go feel

327
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,740
the power of that colorless flame.

328
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,820
Rather powerful.

329
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,180
All right.

330
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,780
The top 10 on the ranking
get into the tower.

331
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,420
It's such a big event.

332
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,420
Why was I not invited?

333
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,460
You can't break
into our academy as you wish.

334
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,100
Nor can you break
into the Tower casually.

335
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,060
An ordinary man like me
doesn't dare to break in.

336
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,980
But entrusted by the Hall of Souls,

337
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,700
I had to come.

338
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,020
I didn't expect to see

339
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,300
a hatchet man of the Hall of Souls
in Jia Ma Empire.

340
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,660
Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower

341
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,500
can serve as the treasure
of Jia Nan Academy

342
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,420
and refine the body
of winners on the ranking

343
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,980
just because it has

344
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,020
the Fallen Heart Flame,

345
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,760
No.14 flame
on the Heavenly Flames Ranking.

346
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,980
Am I right?

347
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,780
The Fallen Heart Flame
should belong to the Hall of Souls.

348
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,820
If you don't want the tough way,

349
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,540
give it to me.

350
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,900
Otherwise,

351
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,340
today,

352
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,900
I can make your whole empire

353
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,700
disappear from the world.

354
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,540
That's some tough talk.

355
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,740
You think you can do anything

356
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,300
just with the support
of the Hall of Souls?

357
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,460
Our academy has been
in this empire for a century.

358
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,420
It's as good as people say it is.

359
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,380
What power do you have?

360
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,060
Bring it on!

361
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,980
If you say so, Headmaster,

362
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,340
I have to be sorry.

363
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,780
Form the seal.

364
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,060
Protect the tower.

365
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,460
That can't be right.

366
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,940
We took the elixirs to enhance Dou Qi.

367
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,460
The elixirs can really work.

368
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,740
There's fun to see.

369
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,540
Han Feng!

370
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,140
Last night, you poisoned
the elixirs for the elders.

371
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,780
Bai Shan?

372
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,380
It's you.

373
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,180
No. He forced me.

374
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,220
He lied to me.

375
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,300
He gave me
the Purple Heart Barrier Breaking Pill.

376
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,060
Since then,

377
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,420
he's been threatening me to work for him.

378
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,140
He said he could help me regain Dou Qi.

379
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,380
That's why I...

380
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,900
You...

381
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,580
It's so silly of you!

382
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,420
He took advantage
of your competitiveness,

383
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,020
made you take an illegal elixir,

384
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,180
and lost your Dou Qi in the competition!

385
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,380
I defended you and covered it up!

386
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,220
But you made another mistake!

387
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,340
I shouldn't have let you get away!

388
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,500
I'm wrong, Elder.

389
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,740
I'm sorry.

390
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,700
Well, take your time talking.

391
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,900
But I have something serious to do.

392
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,140
Hatchet man, don't be so arrogant.

393
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,020
Black Submerged Army of the Gu Clan?

394
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,260
Want to get the Heavenly Flame? Never!

395
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,700
You also want it?

396
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,420
Xun'er, take your classmates away.

397
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,900
I'll take care of this.

398
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
Mr. Yao, Han Feng
also has a Heavenly Flame.

399
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,220
That's just a subsidiary flame.

400
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,460
Sea Heart Flame.

401
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,180
No.15 on the Heavenly Flames Ranking.

402
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,300
It can explode the Fallen Heart Flame.

403
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,660
Unless

404
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,060
you want to die here and now,

405
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,540
give the Fallen Heart Flame to me.

406
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,540
Have I made myself clear enough?

407
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,180
You just have a subsidiary flame.

408
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,180
Don't think only you have it.

409
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,020
A young man like you

410
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,340
has conquered a Heavenly Flame?

411
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,860
We can't lose the Fallen Heart Flame.

412
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,540
Use Dou Qi to reactivate the seal.

413
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,020
No.19 on the Heavenly Flames Ranking,

414
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,780
Green Lotus Core Flame.

415
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,260
Within a day,

416
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,580
I witnessed two Heavenly Flames.

417
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,860
Good.

418
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,380
Today,

419
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,700
I'll get them both.

420
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,420
Ba Ji Collapse!

421
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,980
Xun'er, are you all right?

422
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,510
Yes.

423
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,830
If you came later, I would be hurt.

424
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,060
I owe you once.

425
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,700
I wouldn't let you get hurt.

426
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,020
Heavenly Flames have levels.

427
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,220
Your flame only ranks the 19th.

428
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,980
Mine ranks 15th and it's stronger

429
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,180
even if it's a subsidiary flame.

430
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,020
What's worse,

431
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,980
you're a mere Dou Spirit.

432
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,180
You know really little about flames.

433
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,620
Traitor,

434
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,340
do you still dare to see me?

435
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,620
It...

436
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,020
It can't be true.

437
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,420
It can't be.

438
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,140
Mr. Yao, you can't come out.

439
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,260
Yeah.

440
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,220
You should have poisoned me to death, huh?

441
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,660
Throughout the Dou Qi Continent,

442
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,060
no one has ever heard from you.

443
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,820
I thought

444
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,780
you were thoroughly dead.

445
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,900
So...

446
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,860
So you've been hiding in the Storage Ring.

447
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,380
Mr. Yao,

448
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,100
he's Han Feng who killed you, right?

449
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,850
He...

450
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,700
He...

451
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,580
Xiao Yan,

452
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,600
why was the Medicine Sage
hiding in your Storage Ring?

453
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,220
The Medicine Sage of the Central Plains.

454
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,860
People used to say

455
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,660
the Medicine Sage was killed

456
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,020
by the Hall of Souls.

457
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,660
Unexpectedly,

458
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,020
the murderer turned out
to be his own disciple!

459
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,420
Such a traitor.

460
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,380
I didn't expect there
to be such a vicious man.

461
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,500
Master,

462
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,060
glad to see you again.

463
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,460
Sorry, I'm late.

464
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,860
Master.

465
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,220
(Yao Chen, Master of Starfall Hall)
Look at yourself.

466
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,900
You're losing your mind.

467
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,660
(Han Feng, Disciple of Starfall Hall)
Yes, Master. I'm losing my mind.

468
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,820
I beg you. Teach me Flame Mantra.

469
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,860
I've followed you for six years.

470
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,380
I've learned every technique

471
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,540
in Dou Technique Hall.

472
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,060
I kept practicing them day and night.

473
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,580
No other disciples

474
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,100
learned as hard as me.

475
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,260
I just want to experience
the most powerful technique.

476
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,700
Even if I fail and get burned to death,

477
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,660
I won't regret it.

478
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,380
Han Feng,

479
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,340
do you still not know
what you've done wrong?

480
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,260
On Dou Qi Continent,

481
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,060
the strongest men are respected.

482
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,020
I want to grow stronger

483
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,460
and what is the problem?

484
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,940
If I'm wrong,

485
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,140
the whole world will be wrong.

486
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,020
On my command.

487
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,620
Han Feng peeped at technique books
and disobeyed rules.

488
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,980
He'll be escorted
to Heavenly Star Mountain for introspection.

489
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,020
Without my permission,

490
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,780
he can't leave there!

491
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,260
Han Feng,

492
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,420
that year you failed to get Flame Mantra.

493
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,780
I expelled you

494
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,540
and you joined the Hall of Souls.

495
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,940
When I was making a breakthrough,

496
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,340
you even poisoned my elixirs,

497
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,100
making me fall off the cliff

498
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,580
and barely survive.

499
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,300
Now, what are you even qualified

500
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,160
to kneel in front of me?

501
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,940
Master...

502
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,420
You...

503
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,540
You're really

504
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,900
not as powerful as before.

505
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,580
Mr. Yao, go back to the ring.

506
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,780
Otherwise, you...

507
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,620
It's been years

508
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,260
and you're still so naive.

509
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,220
You made three moves

510
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,420
and that was what I repaid you.

511
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,060
Now, I've got nothing

512
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,940
and my association with you is over.

513
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,380
I owed something to you

514
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,220
and I repaid it.

515
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,500
You owed something to me, too.

516
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,300
Give it to me!

517
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,820
Han Feng,

518
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,420
how did the Hall of Souls fascinate you

519
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,700
to make you so loyal?

520
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,060
I used to think...

521
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,780
I used to think

522
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,660
as long as I kept tolerating,

523
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,300
you would finally teach me Flame Mantra.

524
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,380
But I was wrong.

525
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,780
You wouldn't let me stand out

526
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,700
unless you were dead!

527
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,500
Yao Chen,

528
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,780
tell me.

529
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,020
What else could I do

530
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,300
but kill you?

531
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,820
You betrayed your sect
and joined the Hall of Souls.

532
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,300
Now, you still work for them,

533
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,960
trying to snatch the Fallen Heart Flame.

534
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,820
Fine.

535
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,500
Today, I'll deal with you again.

536
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,540
Burn the heaven and devour the earth!

537
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,140
How could you pass on Flame Mantra

538
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,900
to this prepubescent boy?

539
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,540
The Fallen Heart Flame is out of control.

540
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,340
Seal!

541
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,780
Mr. Yao.

542
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,380
After I get the Fallen Heart Flame,

543
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,060
I'll get back to you.

544
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,420
You wish, Han Feng!

545
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,780
Use the Heavenly Flame.

546
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,020
Mr. Yao, you're exhausted.

547
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,300
You can't use that anymore.

548
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Use it!

549
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,460
Your master in the Hall of Souls

550
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,620
only gave you a subsidiary flame.

551
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,900
It's not the real Sea Heart Flame.

552
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,260
Let go of her!

553
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,820
Xiao Yan,

554
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,780
your Achilles' heel
