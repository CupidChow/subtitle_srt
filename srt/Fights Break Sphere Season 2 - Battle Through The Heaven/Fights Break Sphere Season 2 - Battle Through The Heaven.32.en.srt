=Episode 32=

19
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,120
Do you know about the battle

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,880
between Senior Xiao Xuan
and Huntian Emperor?

21
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,550
How did Senior Xiao Xuan

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,720
break through to the Dou God

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,000
and seal Huntian Emperor
in the Heavenly Tomb?

24
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
Xiao Xuan.

25
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,560
Come here.

26
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,680
Xiao Xuan.

27
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,720
Xiao Xuan was a fool.

28
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,030
All his life, he was trying to
do the impossible.

29
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,000
One thousand years ago,

30
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,630
Huntian Emperor wreaked havoc
on the world.

31
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,110
He had the power of a Demi Dou God.

32
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,600
No one in Dou Qi Continent
could defeat him.

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,630
Just at this time,

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,000
Xiao Xuan,

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,000
along with eight Dou Practitioners
of the Xiao Clan,

36
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,080
decided to have a showdown with him.

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,470
We and the Gu Clan…

38
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,470
Girl,

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,190
I mean your ancestors.

40
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,830
The Xiao Clan made a covenant
with your ancestors.

41
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,470
If the nine of us couldn't get out,

42
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,000
the Gu Clan would

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,880
protect the descendants of the Xiao Clan

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,240
and the Tuoshe Ancient Emperor Jade.

45
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,080
After we made this arrangement,

46
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,160
the nine of us entered the Heavenly Tomb.

47
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,800
In the Heavenly Tomb,
we entered the God Wood Formation.

48
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,720
We practiced day after day,

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
hoping to utilize the Source of Power
in Heavenly Tomb

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,910
to reach the Dou God.

51
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,630
But, we didn't know how many days
had passed outside.

52
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,930
And we didn't want to think about

53
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,390
how much blood had been shed

54
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,910
due to Huntian Emperor.

55
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,000
We could only go forward

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,270
until we could see hope.

57
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,190
So the legends of the Heavenly Tomb

58
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
are all fake?

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,800
There's no Source of Power at all?

60
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,270
We couldn't make any breakthroughs

61
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,190
and our passion diminished.

62
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,270
We lost all hope.

63
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,960
When we were so close to giving up,

64
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,600
there was a crisis.

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,030
Huntian Emperor sacrificed

66
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,830
the Elders of the Hall of Souls

67
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,630
and broke through the God Wood Formation.

68
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,830
We were caught off guard.

69
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,800
Did the Huntian Emperor breach
the Heavenly Tomb

70
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,320
also to capture the Source of Power

71
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,160
to become a Dou God?

72
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,390
He did want to become a Dou God.

73
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,470
But he broke into the Heavenly Tomb

74
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,630
for the greatest treasure,

75
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,480
the treasure of Dou God.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The treasure of Dou God?
The Supreme Power?

77
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,790
That's right.

78
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,520
Before the last Dou God
on the Dou Qi Continent fell,

79
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,510
he gave eight pieces of ancient jade

80
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,000
to the Eight Ancient Clans

81
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,760
and left a message:

82
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,480
United we stand.

83
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,830
Divided we fall.

84
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,000
When the eight pieces of ancient jade
are placed together,

85
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,550
we can open Dou God's tomb.

86
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,160
So the treasure is the relic of Dou God.

87
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,880
That's right.

88
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,790
But unlike the other Powerhouses' relics,

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,390
there's only one thing in that treasure

90
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,440
that will make you the dominant power.

91
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,760
The one who gets it

92
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,920
will become the Dou God
of the Dou Qi Continent.

93
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,950
This thing is God Fledgling Pill.

94
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,230
A pill.

95
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,550
Even if it's one of a kind,

96
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,510
it's just medicine, isn't it?

97
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,720
The God Fledgling Pill

98
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,000
is the source of God Qi.

99
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,070
So for thousands of years, no one

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,320
on the Dou Qi Continent
has become a Dou God.

101
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,350
That's the reason.

102
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,070
If anyone

103
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,200
can get the God Fledgling Pill
and make it a pill,

104
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,790
that person will be another Dou God

105
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,390
after thousands of years.

106
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,350
This is the secret of the Supreme Power.

107
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,510
(It's a great temptation.)

108
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,440
(Not to mention killing a few,)

109
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,020
(one would trade all lives in the world for it.)

110
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,700
(Huntian Emperor,
former Master of the Hall of Souls)

111
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,390
Hand over the ancient jade of Xiao Clan.

112
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,070
I won't kill Xiao Clan's descendants.

113
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,000
You…

114
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,550
You're not the Dou God yet.

115
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,950
It's too soon for big words, isn't it?

116
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,760
Xiao Xuan,

117
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,550
you know what's really stupid about you?

118
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,880
Nihility Devouring Flame.

119
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,510
The most stupid thing about you is

120
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,440
being the first to stand up

121
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,230
against an overwhelming power.

122
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,320
Remember,

123
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,160
if your clan is erased by the Hall of Souls,

124
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,160
that's because you're stupid.

125
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,920
I'll give you one last chance.

126
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,350
Succumb to me

127
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,550
and hand over the ancient jade.

128
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,720
Give them eight

129
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,440
a chance to live.

130
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,550
I couldn't bow to him.

131
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,630
Indeed.

132
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,390
Nihility Devouring Flame is unrivaled.

133
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,200
The Demi Dou God

134
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,640
is invincible in the world.

135
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,230
But I couldn't give in.

136
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,270
Can the strong kill the weak?

137
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,670
Can the strongest clan oppress the weakest?

138
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,270
Are Powerhouses honored

139
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,440
for their power to do anything they want?

140
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,830
If that's the law of the Dou Qi Continent,

141
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,640
then why won't we bow to them?

142
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,350
Yeah.

143
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,230
If the law is wrong,

144
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,230
we have to correct it.

145
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,480
That's it.

146
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,720
Good point.

147
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,480
We have to correct it.

148
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,920
I might not be able to challenge Gods,

149
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,000
but at least I'll try.

150
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,440
Dou Practitioners of the Xiao Clan
never give in.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,790
(I thought I was mistaken that)

152
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,000
(no force could overpower
Nihility Devouring Flame.)

153
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,600
(Quickly, I realized that)

154
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,160
that force was in ourselves.

155
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,480
That's the power of bloodline.

156
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,640
My followers gave their power of bloodline

157
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,320
to me.

158
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,720
Bloodline Suppression?

159
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,910
My Dou Qi is exhausted.

160
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,670
But I still have blood.

161
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,150
Huntian Emperor,

162
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,670
let's end this.

163
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,790
That energy storm

164
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,440
was the legendary Source of Power.

165
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,110
The eight men

166
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,640
sacrificed their power of bloodline

167
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,640
and activated the Source of Power.

168
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,030
With the support of this most powerful force,

169
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,320
we locked the Huntian Emperor

170
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,200
in a separate space, completely exiled
from the world,

171
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,880
so that he can never come down
again Dou Qi Continent.

172
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,550
We thought

173
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,790
the Source of Power was
within the Heavenly Tomb.

174
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,230
In fact, it's in all of us,

175
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,710
instead of anywhere else in the world.

176
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,870
In that battle,

177
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,520
except for me,

178
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,110
all eight of them fell.

179
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,710
Perhaps because
the Source of Power remained in me,

180
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,110
I fell into a deep sleep

181
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,000
for thousands of years.

182
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,080
So, Senior,

183
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,440
Xiao Clan's power of bloodline weakens

184
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,150
also because of the over-exertion

185
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,710
of the energy storm, right?

186
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,960
Xiao Clan's bloodline was exhausted

187
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,550
to seal the Huntian Emperor.

188
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,400
Is such a sacrifice

189
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
worth it?

190
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,350
Do you think

191
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Xiao Xuan

192
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,470
is a big hero?

193
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,430
Ancestor,

194
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,760
I, Xiao Yan, will always admire you.

195
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,990
Alright.

196
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,230
Get up.

197
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,710
Our momentary bravery

198
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,230
has led to the bloodline decline
of the Xiao Clan.

199
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
Don't you hate me?

200
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,000
Backing out

201
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,230
when you have the strength to fight

202
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,710
is not what a Dou Practitioner would do.

203
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,630
Senior,

204
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,110
if we were to fight the Hall of Souls today,

205
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,110
I'm sure we would make the same choice

206
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,350
and follow the path you took.

207
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,760
Please help us

208
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,110
and save Xiao Yan's life.

209
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,080
Xiao Yan has
five different Heavenly Flames.

210
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,000
He's our hope to defeat the Hall of Souls.

211
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,880
But he can't control
the Purifying Lotus Demon Flame

212
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,470
he just absorbed.

213
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,230
That's why we came down
to the Heavenly Tomb,

214
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,150
hoping to find the Source of Power.

215
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,080
I don't have to save him.

216
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,350
He can save himself.

217
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,080
The source of your power is in you.

218
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,760
It will not go away.

219
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,670
It's just dormant.

220
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,480
Come here.

221
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,950
Come here.

222
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,990
Come on.

223
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,960
Senior, what are you doing?

224
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,520
Exchange blood.

225
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,880
Exchange… blood?

226
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,640
Yeah.

227
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,400
I'll channel my power of bloodline to him

228
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,350
to activate his power of bloodline.

229
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,470
This is the Eight Ancient Clans' secret.

230
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,590
But if you pass the power of bloodline to him,

231
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,400
won't what happened back then repeat itself?

232
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,790
Stop babbling.

233
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,080
I've waited a thousand years for this boy.

234
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,000
It's a matter of chance

235
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,550
and a sign from Heaven.

236
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,150
Xiao Clan's bloodline shouldn't die out.

237
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,910
However, kid,

238
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,760
I have to warn you.

239
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,910
Exchanging blood hurts like hell.

240
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,550
It's like dismembering
and rebuilding the body.

241
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,710
Are you ready

242
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,470
for the immense pain?

243
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,920
As long as it works,

244
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,790
I can endure any pain.

245
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,470
I'm going to open your Du meridian,

246
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,520
enter your Ren meridian,

247
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,470
strike a balance

248
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,230
between yang and yin,

249
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,230
and get to your heart.

250
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,470
You have to hold yourself still

251
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,590
with the inflow and outflow of blood.

252
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,550
How are you holding up, Senior Xiao?

253
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,350
Always go forward.

254
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,230
Don't even think about going back.

255
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,920
Hold the Formation.

256
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,200
(Senior Xiao's power of bloodline)

257
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,960
(is soon to be exhausted.)

258
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,630
Girl,

259
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,000
what are you doing?

260
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,670
Transfuse my power of bloodline

261
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,230
to Xiao Yan as well.

262
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,400
Are you sure about this?

263
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,520
If the transfusion fails,

264
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,760
the bloodline of the Gu Clan
will be exhausted.

265
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,160
Gu Clan

266
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,000
will decline into mediocrity.

267
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,400
Are you really ready for that?

268
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,280
Back then, three drops of my blood

269
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,000
triggered Xiao Yan's power of bloodline.

270
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,640
We will succeed as well this time.

271
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,520
It will all be for nothing if we stop now.

272
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,920
There has to be a start
and an end for everything.

273
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,880
The result will speak for itself.

274
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,030
What a start and an end.

275
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,800
Kid,

276
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,400
have you heard that?

277
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,590
This girl of Gu Clan

278
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,790
is risking her life for you.

279
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,230
You must hang in there.

280
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,910
(Ancestor, what kind of power is this?)

281
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,230
(I feel warm and cozy.)

282
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,670
(It's not as hard as it was just now.)

283
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,440
(This is the Source of Power.)

284
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,760
(It's different from Dou Qi.)

285
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,280
(Dou Qi will eventually run out.)

286
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,000
(The Source of Power is the power of creation.)

287
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,230
(It doesn't exist or disappear.)

288
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,880
(Even this little bit has planted roots in you.)

289
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,710
(You have to take that power)

290
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,550
(deep in your Qihai point.)

291
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,080
(Repeat after me.)

292
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,550
- Qi from chaos,
- Qi from chaos,

293
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,760
- fire from the underworld,
- fire from the underworld,

294
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,350
- the Heavenly Lord of Thunder,
- the Heavenly Lord of Thunder,

295
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,200
- and result in infinite changes.
- and result in infinite changes.

296
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,350
Xiao Yan, how are you feeling?

297
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,790
He can easily subdue
Purifying Lotus Demon Flame now.

298
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,880
Give it a try.

299
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,070
Use your Heavenly Flame Triple Xuan Change

300
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,800
to activate your Heavenly Flame
and create the Flame Lotus.

301
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,350
This Flame Lotus is so strange.

302
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,350
It's completely different
from the Angry Buddha Lotus Flame.

303
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,800
Xiao Yan, this doesn't

304
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,310
seem to be any kind of fire
that belongs to you.

305
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,470
The true power
of Heavenly Flame Triple Xuan Change is that

306
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,310
it not only activates

307
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,470
the power of bloodline for a short period

308
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,560
to take your Dou Qi to the max

309
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,560
but also has

310
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,070
a power unknown to outsiders.

311
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,720
Change.

312
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,600
Change.

313
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,830
The power of bloodline of Xiao Clan

314
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,040
is to absorb the Heavenly Flame
of the world.

315
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,830
Men and fire are one

316
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,520
and we change them as we please.

317
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,640
That's the secret of Xiao Clan's

318
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,830
Heavenly Flame Triple Xuan Change.

319
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,710
You've created

320
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,070
a brand-new Heavenly Flame.

321
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,720
Ancestor.

322
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,830
Why is your pulse so weak?

323
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,920
Ancestor, I'm taking you out.

324
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,470
Oh, stop.

325
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,070
There's nothing wrong with me.

326
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,430
I'm fine.

327
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,110
I'm tired.

328
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,280
Just tired.

329
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,350
Senior.

330
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,830
My old buddies.

331
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,920
I've kept them waiting for too long.

332
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
My men.

333
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,430
My children,

334
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,830
you should go.

335
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,950
I…

336
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,310
I'm not leaving.

337
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,190
Ancestor,

338
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,240
you…

339
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,520
When you get out,

340
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,760
tell them

341
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,640
the hero who sealed the Huntian Emperor

342
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,800
isn't Xiao Xuan.

343
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,710
It's the Xiao Clan warriors

344
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
who had given their power of bloodline

345
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,710
to Xiao Xuan.

346
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,070
Old buddies,

347
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,190
have you

348
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,000
seen him?

349
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,760
This kid is a descendant of our clan.

350
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,880
He's no worse than us.

351
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,000
We didn't do this for nothing.

352
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,070
Good.

353
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,640
Kid,

354
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,000
I'll leave the rest to you.

355
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,310
I'm too old.

356
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,040
How I wish to see you

357
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,310
make a difference!

358
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,950
I will.

359
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,270
Ancestor,

360
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,430
you can rest here.

361
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,000
When we get rid of the Hall of Souls

362
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,070
and bring peace to the Dou Qi Continent,

363
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,880
I'll come back here

364
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,710
to talk to you.

365
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,070
Good.

366
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,240
They're back.

367
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,720
You…

368
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,150
Dad,

369
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,840
we're back.

370
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,560
You have returned safely.

371
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,950
Where is the Purifying Lotus Demon Flame?

372
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,880
Under the Heavenly Tomb?

373
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,190
Did you fail?

374
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,150
It's in me.

375
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,000
You don't have the power of bloodline.

376
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,870
How did you absorb
the Purifying Lotus Demon Flame?

377
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,760
Is the Source of Power

378
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,950
really down there?

379
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,280
Who says Xiao Yan doesn't have
the power of bloodline?

380
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,350
If he didn't have it,

381
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,110
how could he unlock the seal
on the Heavenly Tomb?

382
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,230
Did Xiao Yan unlock the seal?

383
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,880
Uncle,

384
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,280
may I borrow your astrolabe?

385
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
I'd like to say a few words

386
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,150
about Xiao Clan.

387
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,520
The bloodline is activated.

388
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,880
The astrolabe is sensing the bloodline.

389
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,640
One star.

390
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,950
Two stars.

391
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,910
Three stars.

392
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,840
Ten.

393
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,880
Ten.

394
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,920
Divine bloodline.

395
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,070
It's so high.

396
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,590
I knew you could do it, Xiao Yan.

397
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,350
This is the end of the celebration.

398
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,560
Sorry to interrupt you.

399
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,400
Xiao Yan,

400
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,230
three days later

401
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,230
at the Top of the Fallen,

402
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,040
I'll be waiting for you.

403
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,160
Three days later

404
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,230
at the Top of the Fallen.

405
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,310
Hun Miesheng

406
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,110
is proposing a showdown.

407
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,800
It's all coming back to us

408
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,760
as it was a thousand years ago.

409
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,310
Xiao Yan,

410
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,880
this is not

411
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,430
the battle between you and Hun Miesheng,

412
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,710
but one between the Dou Qi Continent

413
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,230
and the Hall of Souls.

414
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,360
Fellows,

415
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,000
as you've seen,

416
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,800
Xiao Yan is the chosen one

417
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,560
to destroy Hun Miesheng.

418
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,070
Today,

419
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,880
Xiao Yan's bloodline has been verified.

420
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,680
This is God's will.

421
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,760
I say

422
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,230
that the Eight Ancient Clans

423
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,230
make Xiao Yan the Alliance Leader

424
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,310
and united.

425
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,040
We can dispel evil.

426
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,790
Uncle.

427
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,710
Xun'er has told me about

428
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,000
your decision.

429
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,920
I've been thinking about it.

430
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,670
And

431
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,040
I have to say this to you.

432
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,160
For so long,

433
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,430
the Gu Clan

434
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,920
has wronged you.

435
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,720
Uncle,

436
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,950
I have never blamed you.

437
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,920
The Gu Clan has kept our promise
for a thousand years

438
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,560
and also been waiting

439
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,760
for the successor of the divine bloodline

440
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,520
to show up.

441
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
Just so you know,

442
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,160
even though this battle

443
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,800
is between Hun Miesheng and you,

444
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,350
in fact,

445
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,190
it's not a one-man battle.

446
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,230
I just thought

447
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,230
what we need is not an Alliance Leader.

448
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,360
It has never been.

449
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,160
The Central Plains and the Hall of Souls

450
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,470
have come to the point for a showdown.

451
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,110
But for hundreds of years,
the Eight Clans have been divided.

452
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,950
The alliance is falling apart.

453
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,800
They need a hero

454
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,430
to pull them together.

455
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,520
In the past,

456
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,560
the man was Xiao Xuan.

457
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,760
Now the man

458
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,880
has to be you.

459
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,150
Uncle,

460
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,280
do you think Xiao Xuan

461
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,830
is a hero?

462
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,040
I admire him.

463
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,040
I can't do

464
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,710
what he has done.

465
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,470
Back in the Heavenly Tomb,

466
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,560
no one knew if Xiao Xuan
would succeed or not,

467
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,110
or be killed by Huntian Emperor.

468
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,830
Why were the warriors of Xiao Clan

469
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,520
willing to take the chance

470
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,280
and give him their power of bloodline?

471
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,400
Because they believed

472
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,470
he was the great hero chosen by God?

473
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,840
No,

474
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:11,800
it wasn't that.

475
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,950
The one thing they believed was that

476
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,640
this isn't what the world should be like.

477
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,920
Powerhouses shouldn't bully the weak.

478
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,640
Stronger clans shouldn't bully weaker ones.

479
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,040
So it's not Xiao Yan they should believe in.

480
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,040
Rather, it should be justice they uphold.

481
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,430
Maybe

482
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,550
I…

483
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,000
I was really wrong.

484
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,230
For so long,

485
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,830
I've been treating you and Xun'er

486
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,430
as kids.

487
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,680
I thought you'd miss a lot of things.

488
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,910
Actually,

489
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,000
it was me.

490
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,880
You've all grown up.

491
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,310
It's time

492
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,190
for you

493
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,880
to take maximum responsibility.

494
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,070
The Top of the Fallen

495
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,960
is in the north of the Central Plains.

496
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,940
It's the Land of Extreme Cold.

497
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,040
In ancient times, it was a place of exile.

498
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,220
The Central Plains are protected

499
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,470
by barriers in all directions.

500
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,430
Only here

501
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,710
is unable to establish a protection barrier.

502
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,680
Hun Miesheng

503
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,710
might have become a Dou Saint.

504
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,710
But Xiao Yan

505
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,560
is only a Demi Dou Saint.

506
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,040
The small difference in level

507
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,950
suggests a huge disparity in strength.

508
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,760
What Qi Method did Hun Miesheng use

509
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,760
in the fight with the Black Submerged Army?

510
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,240
Uncle Gu,

511
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,310
do you remember?

512
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,110
The evil methods of the Hall of Souls

513
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,160
mainly ingest Dou Qi.

514
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,520
Among Hun Miesheng's Qi Methods,

515
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,470
the trickiest are his formations.

516
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,950
In the battle of Central Plains,

517
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,830
the formation he used

518
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,190
boxed up

519
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,230
dozens of Dou Venerates

520
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,520
of the Central Plains

521
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,160
until they fell due to Dou Qi exhaustion.

522
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,350
Even the Demi Dou Saints

523
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,830
could hardly break his formation.

524
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,880
What if he adds
the strongest Heavenly Flame in the world?

525
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,920
Filling Nihility Devouring Flame
into the formation?

526
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,730
Is such a formation possible?

527
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,680
I don't see why not.

528
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,830
The formations can gather power.

529
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,950
If he really can bring the power
of Nihility Devouring Flame into it,

530
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,160
I'm afraid the power exerted

531
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,920
will be a few times stronger

532
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,430
than that battle 50 years ago.

533
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,040
If Hun Miesheng

534
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,710
had mastered Nihility Devouring Flame
50 years ago,

535
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,470
why didn't he

536
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,310
use the Heavenly Flame before he died?

537
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,560
Because it was Huntian Emperor's flame,

538
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,520
so…

539
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,000
Xun'er, do you remember Ancestor
told us that

540
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,350
Huntian Emperor had been sealed by him?

541
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,430
So Huntian Emperor shouldn't be alive.

542
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:14,950
It's just that

543
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,000
he's the owner of Nihility Devouring
Flame after all.

544
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,590
The more powerful its master is,

545
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,040
the harder it is to destroy the mark

546
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,920
he gives to the Heavenly Flame.

547
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,560
If we want to absorb it,

548
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,590
we have to wait for it to explode.

549
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,910
It's like when I subdued the Heavenly Flame.

550
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,400
Hun Miesheng is trying to make it explode

551
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,070
with great power

552
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,760
so he can subdue it.

553
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,830
Hun Miesheng hasn't subdued it,

554
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,920
so he proposed a showdown
at the Top of the Fallen.

555
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,070
He wants to use formation
in the middle of the battle

556
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,640
to trigger its explosion.

557
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,920
Then he'll seek a chance to subdue it

558
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,470
and become the Dou God.

559
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,800
Once Nihility Devouring Flame explodes
out of control,

560
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
the entire Dou Qi Continent

561
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,710
will be destroyed with it.

562
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,520
What Hun Miesheng cares about is power.

563
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,190
When he sees the birth of such power,

564
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,310
he'll do anything crazy.

565
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,830
We can't let it explode.

566
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,920
We have to break this formation.

567
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,520
We get the ringleader first.

568
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,130
Nihility Devouring Flame must be
the core of formation.

569
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,640
If we don't remove it,

570
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,760
we won't be able to break the formation.

571
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,760
To win,

572
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,710
we have to fight fire with fire.

573
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,920
This is the Heavenly Flame created by
Xiao Clan's power of bloodline?

574
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,120
Right.

575
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,680
Can it

576
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,760
suppress Nihility Devouring Flame?

577
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,680
Are you sure?

578
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,800
It's not really about strength.

579
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
The Heavenly Flame I created

580
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,640
can change everything.

581
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
It's not swallowing it.

582
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,830
It integrates the Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

583
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,350
It can change the nature
of Nihility Devouring Flame.

584
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,270
In other words,

585
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,520
you can make it go inside
Nihility Devouring Flame

586
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,360
without being swallowed.

587
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,040
Then it can destroy
Nihility Devouring Flame,

588
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,640
removing this potential risk.

589
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,560
It's not on the Heavenly Flame list

590
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,430
nor does it exist to devour.

591
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,640
It won't be changed by any mighty power.

592
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,000
If the Dou Qi Continent

593
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,520
honors the Powerhouses,

594
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,310
the Nihility Devouring Flame is the law.

595
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,400
And I

596
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,590
will create another law,

597
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,160
a law that is mine.

598
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,280
What do you need us to do?

599
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,430
Give me some time.

600
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,760
Let me use my own Heavenly Flame

601
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,040
to change the rules.

602
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,710
Uncle Gu conferred with me.

603
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,520
The patriarchs of the Eight Clans will
go to the battle against Hun Miesheng

604
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,360
at the Top of the Fallen.

605
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,470
The Wind Sage will lead the elders
of the four halls

606
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,710
to build the Protection Formation
in the Central Plains.

607
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,850
The only thing I'm worried about right now

608
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,840
is the ancient jade.

609
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,920
The jade of the Eight Clans together

610
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,920
can open the treasure of the Dou God.

611
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,430
We must look out for Hun Miesheng's
sneak attacks

612
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,400
to take ancient jade.

613
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,520
Mr. Gu has made arrangements.

614
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,120
The ancient jade is in the Heavenly Tomb.

615
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,430
That's where Dou Qi is strongest.

616
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,680
We need someone we can trust
to guard the ancient jade.

617
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,710
I've been thinking about it.

618
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,280
It's got to be you.

619
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,670
Patriarch Yao, I heard that you insisted on

620
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,150
going with Xiao Yan on behalf of
the Yao Clan.

621
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,510
What?

622
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,320
Are you worried about

623
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,390
leaving Xiao Yan in my care?

624
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,230
I'm an ominous expellee.

625
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,560
I can't guard the jade.

626
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,080
Let's switch.

627
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,040
You're trying to escape again.

628
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,150
Patriarch Yao, you could get killed

629
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,360
at the Top of the Fallen.

630
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,910
My life is cheap, but if you die,

631
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,520
I'll be condemned for another crime.

632
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
As the patriarch,

633
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,440
I command you

634
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,390
to stay in the rear.

635
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,600
It should be me

636
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,870
to take the risks.

637
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,520
I'm no longer with the Yao Clan.

638
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,230
You can't command me.

639
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,320
Wherever you go, you're one of us.

640
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
You're the one who expelled me.

641
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,800
That's because you were being petty,

642
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,760
disappearing for some cross words.

643
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,840
Yao Chen,

644
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,190
do you think we never tried to find you

645
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,600
over the past years?

646
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,160
I'm grateful for that.

647
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,400
Patriarch,

648
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,470
I can't trust my stupid disciple

649
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,190
to anyone.

650
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,630
Let me go with him to the end.

651
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,950
I see,

652
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,000
you still won't listen to your patriarch.

653
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,400
Right?

654
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,600
Thank you

655
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,560
for letting me go.
