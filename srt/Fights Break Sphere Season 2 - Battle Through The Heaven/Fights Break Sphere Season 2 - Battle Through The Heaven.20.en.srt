19
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,270
Doesn't this place

20
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,830
feel a bit familiar to you?

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,240
Have we been here?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,630
In those years when you lost Dou Qi,

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,550
you always used to

24
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,360
go to the back hills of Xiao Family alone

25
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,400
and practice very hard.

26
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,070
Xun'er,

27
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,950
were you peeping at me?

28
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,790
Yeah.

29
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,480
I was looking at you secretly nearby.

30
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,800
But with no Dou Qi at all,

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,080
you couldn't feel my existence.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,630
You didn't realize

33
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,190
how fun it was

34
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,030
to see you sulk.

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,800
Yeah.

36
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,030
I almost gave up at that time.

37
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,270
But you overcame the obstacle,

38
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,110
didn't you?

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,360
Nothing can be achieved overnight.

40
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,800
Be it your practice,

41
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,750
or the saving of Mr. Yao,

42
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,000
everything will fall into place

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,880
when the right time comes.

44
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,950
Xun'er,

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,080
thank you.

46
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,360
So much firewood.

47
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,760
After such a long trip,
we should be near the destination.

48
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,600
Let's have a rest here tonight.

49
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,160
We can continue tomorrow morning.

50
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,040
Xiao Yan,

51
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,760
tell me a story.

52
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,830
I don't know stories.

53
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,480
A long time has passed

54
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,830
since our last reunion.

55
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,830
You've made many new friends

56
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,550
and visited places I've never been to.

57
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,480
I want to hear every detail of the story.

58
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,920
That would be a long story.

59
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,230
Excellent. The longer, the better.

60
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,110
It's the best if the story never ends.

61
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,070
Alright.

62
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,000
Let me think.

63
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,000
Then

64
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,720
let me start the story
with Demon Flame Valley.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,840
OK.

66
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Demon Flame Valley

67
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,550
is a desolate place where nothing grows.

68
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,160
When I arrived…

69
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,760
The moment I arrived,

70
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,480
I met the mercenaries Gu Yao once said.

71
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,670
But no single person

72
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,640
could be seen there. Isn't it strange?

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,840
No people?

74
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,790
Anyway, I thought it was strange.

75
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,160
Later…

76
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,480
Later…

77
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,160
How time flies.

78
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,160
We grow up in a blink.

79
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,200
When we were young,

80
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,110
we were forced by your dad
to practice Dou Technique

81
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,200
and do homework.

82
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,640
I was always thinking

83
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,040
why a day was so long

84
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,270
and when I would become an adult.

85
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,880
But I firmly believed

86
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
we could live together like that forever,

87
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,230
as if we were in an endless story,

88
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,880
as if unlimited time

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,720
was available to you and me

90
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,070
for us to enjoy.

91
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,950
How come things have changed in a twinkling?

92
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,440
You're shouldering heavy responsibility.

93
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,600
You need to travel around,

94
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,070
while I come back to Gu Clan.

95
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,670
Since when

96
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,320
do we get so separated

97
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,880
that reunion becomes hard?

98
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,390
Your dad is deceased now.

99
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,480
Go!

100
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,950
Xiao Yan, what's going on?

101
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,550
Their weapons are weird.

102
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,760
Let's just get rid of them.

103
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,110
They don't seem to have Dou Qi.

104
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,390
They can't withstand it.

105
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,920
Xun'er.

106
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,920
Xun'er.

107
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
Xiao Yan.

108
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,480
Here.

109
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,280
Where are we?

110
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,430
I have no idea.

111
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,630
Xun'er,

112
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,280
your wound has been dressed.

113
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,510
So does yours.

114
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,310
Give me your hand.

115
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,640
Your Dou Qi becomes weak.

116
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,280
It seems the arrow is poisonous.

117
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,670
Can you activate your Dou Qi?

118
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,310
No, I can't.

119
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,590
Blocked meridians inhibit my Dou Qi.

120
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,760
Xiao Yan, why are yours still active?

121
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
I've got Heavenly Flames.

122
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,470
The invading poison is burned out.

123
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,400
Could you help me

124
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,910
remove the poison with your flames?

125
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,880
No. Not protected by Dou Qi,

126
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,590
you will be hurt by the flames.

127
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,480
Here you are.

128
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,640
Take the medicine,

129
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,230
and your injury will be OK.

130
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,080
But you can't use Dou Qi within three days.

131
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,200
Too much.

132
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,190
Drink.

133
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,190
Let's drink it.

134
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,350
You took us here for no reason

135
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,880
and made no explanations.

136
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,080
What are you going to do?

137
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,900
(Tang Huo'er, chief of Black Flame Village)
You shouldn't barge into our village.

138
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,110
My sister and I

139
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,710
are medicine merchants
from Central Plains.

140
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,550
We were going to Burning Flame Valley
for business.

141
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,640
But we got lost

142
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,760
and stayed here for a night.

143
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,910
We were then caught by your people.

144
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,280
You're lying.

145
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,670
Believe it or not.

146
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,880
My villagers came here for refuge

147
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,910
when Huntian Emperor stirred up turmoil

148
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,590
in Central Plains a thousand years ago.

149
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,320
We live on blacksmithing activities.

150
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,520
Occasionally, we trade for everyday items
with the Master of Burning Flame Valley.

151
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,320
We never communicate with Central Plains.

152
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,200
As you're merchants from Central Plains,

153
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,910
you should know well

154
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,000
the path to Burning Flame Valley.

155
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,350
How come you trespass

156
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,400
on this deserted land unintentionally?

157
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,590
We mean no harm.

158
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,520
We are ordinary merchants.

159
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,000
Please let us go.

160
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,080
Let you go?

161
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,120
Yeah.

162
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,710
Now, you know the location of this village.

163
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,670
You're likely to bring other outsiders here.

164
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,470
That would destroy our peaceful life.

165
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,000
Stay here with us forever,

166
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,400
or prepare to die now.

167
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,280
Don't you dare hurt my sister.

168
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,000
No matter what it takes,

169
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,000
I must seek revenge in that case.

170
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,710
You have no choice but to stay.

171
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,790
According to our rules,

172
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,910
no work, no food.

173
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,200
Change your clothes.

174
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,590
From now on,

175
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,960
you should learn blacksmithing skills,

176
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,110
and she should learn to mend and make clothes.

177
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,910
You do your job,

178
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,000
and she does hers.

179
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,280
Give them.

180
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,550
Is this meteoric iron?

181
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,670
Yeah, good eye.

182
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,960
The best meteoric iron in Central Plains.

183
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,880
(Master said Heavy Black Ruler is made of it.)

184
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,030
(Could it come from this place?)

185
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,080
(But it's refined only by Heavenly Flames.)

186
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,550
(If that's the case…)

187
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,840
(The furnace fire is indeed unusual.)

188
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,200
Brother, let's drink at my home tonight.

189
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,160
No problem.

190
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,200
Xiao Yan, do you earn these with your work?

191
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,400
Here you are. Have some more.

192
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,590
Why are you so impressive?

193
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,630
By the way, Xun'er,

194
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,000
I noticed the fire they use is unusual

195
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,000
when I was forging irons today.

196
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,430
I guess

197
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
they're afraid

198
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,760
if other people know about the fire,

199
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,280
their lives might be disrupted.

200
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,030
"Black Flame" should be its name.

201
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,400
And Heavenly Flame Triple Xuan Change

202
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,000
must be triggered by the flame.

203
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,040
At present,

204
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,550
I don't know the relationship between them.

205
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,670
But Heavenly Flame Triple Xuan Change

206
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,320
should be in the village.

207
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,680
In the following days,

208
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,150
we can explore the village carefully.

209
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,760
Maybe we can find some clues.

210
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,030
You get me nervous.

211
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,150
This is the first time

212
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,350
I see you in a mess.

213
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,750
Xun'er,

214
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,150
I'm always by your side.

215
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,800
He's here. He's here.

216
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,240
Here they come.

217
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,070
Here, here.

218
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:25,910
This is…

219
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,070
What do you need us for?

220
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,710
In Black Flame Village,

221
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,280
we will throw a ceremony

222
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,430
when there come new members.

223
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,240
- Follow us.
- Let's go.

224
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,310
Where are you taking her?

225
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,520
At such an exciting moment,

226
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
she should be well-combed and dressed.

227
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,070
Look.

228
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,880
She's beautiful.

229
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,040
She looks good in that dress.

230
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,350
Blame Flame erupts!

231
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,070
Count noses now!

232
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,160
Protect them.

233
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,040
- Chief.
- Don't go out.

234
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,670
What's Black Flame?

235
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,070
What's going on here?

236
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,430
This is Black Flame.

237
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,430
Every year, Black Flame erupts from the cave
at the back of the village.

238
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,950
It erupts irregularly.

239
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,190
The fire you use for iron-forging

240
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,000
comes from the cave.

241
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,040
Is it Heavenly Flame?

242
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,640
Who are you on earth?

243
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,950
What are you coming here for?

244
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
- Answer me!
- Chief,

245
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,110
one of our children is missing.

246
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,350
He must have been trapped in the cave

247
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,560
when collecting firewood.

248
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,550
Take me to the cave.

249
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,910
I can save him.

250
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,760
Hurry up.

251
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,140
- Watch out.
- Mom.

252
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,840
What's the flame called?

253
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,350
You have to tell me to save him.

254
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,040
Volcano Rock Flame.

255
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,270
Volcano Rock Flame?

256
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,190
The 17th-ranked flame
on Heavenly Flames Ranking.

257
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,950
It's different from other flames.

258
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,070
You stay here.

259
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,910
I'll get him.

260
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,840
Xiao Yan,

261
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,240
your Dou Qi.

262
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,790
Don't worry.

263
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,160
Little boy, don't cry.

264
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,160
Let me take you out now, alright?

265
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,190
So, it's just a subsidiary flame.

266
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,680
The core is not here.

267
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,000
It's OK.

268
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,840
Everything's over.

269
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,030
You're safe.

270
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,280
The stone's hot. Be careful.

271
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,430
Are you OK?

272
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,950
- Yeah.
-Are you alright?

273
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,110
- I'm OK.
- Get him out of here.

274
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,600
Take the belongings.

275
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,060
OK.

276
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,400
Easy, easy. Let's go.

277
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,430
Chief,

278
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,760
is that stone always there?

279
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,480
Yes.

280
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,280
Let's go have a closer look.

281
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,520
Clan Tattoo of Xiao Clan?

282
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,980
(Heavenly Flame Triple Xuan Change)

283
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,230
Heavenly Flame Triple Xuan Change!

284
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,280
How's he?

285
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,110
He's just in shock,

286
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,710
not hurt by Flame Poison.

287
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,720
When he wakes up,

288
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,880
apply the prescribed medicine to him.

289
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,840
You can leave now.

290
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,310
Here you are.

291
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,310
Thanks.

292
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,190
Sit down, please.

293
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,680
You saved our people.

294
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,710
We owe you big.

295
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,350
Tell us what you want directly.

296
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,880
Chief,

297
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,920
I'm Xiao Yan, a disciple of Mr. Yao,
Master of Starfall Hall in Central Plains.

298
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,350
I'm also a descendant of Xiao Clan.

299
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,950
I'm here

300
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,920
to take back the possession of Xiao Clan.

301
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,640
Xiao Clan?

302
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,430
Are you from Xiao Clan?

303
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,670
This is the evidence.

304
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,400
I knew there are descendants
of the Xiao Clan.

305
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
How do you relate to Xiao Clan?

306
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,560
We were a small clan in Burning Flame Valley

307
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,070
and worked as blacksmiths for generations.

308
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,590
A thousand years ago,
Central Plains plunged into havoc.

309
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,710
We were unable to protect ourselves.

310
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,040
Many of our people were killed
by the Hall of Souls.

311
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,040
It was Mr. Xiao Xuan

312
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,430
and the heroes of the Xiao Clan who saved us

313
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,470
when they passed by.

314
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,880
They left the tinder of Volcano Rock Flame

315
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,190
inside that cave.

316
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,600
From then on,

317
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,830
when the subsidiary flame is dormant,

318
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,310
we have been collecting the tinder
of the subsidiary flame from that cave

319
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,710
to make meteoric iron weapons.

320
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,920
The reason he left Volcano Rock Flame here

321
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,520
was to protect what I was looking for.

322
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,280
It should be returned to its owner.

323
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,150
Thanks.

324
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,000
By the way,

325
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,230
this is the subsidiary Volcano Rock Flame.

326
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
It won't erupt anymore.

327
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,400
You can put it into the furnace
used for forging weapons.

328
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,520
Where there is the tinder,
there is the subsidiary flame.

329
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,110
We are saved by the Xiao people many times.

330
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,920
We can never repay you enough.

331
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
No, don't say that.

332
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,680
You have been here for generations.

333
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,160
You have virtually protected our secrecy.

334
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
I should feel grateful to you.

335
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,430
A farewell is always unavoidable.

336
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,070
Chief,

337
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,640
please rest assured.

338
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,800
We'll keep our mouths shut

339
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,920
after leaving this village.

340
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
We won't tell any people about it.

341
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,880
People of Xiao Clan have moral ethics.

342
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,120
I trust you.

343
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,550
Let's say goodbye here.

344
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,070
Let's go.

345
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,710
Xiao Yan, what's wrong?

346
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,950
I'm wondering in the vast land
of Central Plains,

347
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,040
could people like Tang Huo'er,

348
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,560
who prefer simple lives over Dou Qi,

349
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,310
really be able to live in peace?

350
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,430
Some flowers grow in freedom.

351
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,560
They need to blossom

352
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,230
in a world only known to themselves.

353
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,600
But,

354
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,680
so long as the Hall of Souls exists,

355
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,560
so long as Dou Practitioners covet strength,

356
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,030
potential turmoil

357
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,560
will always hang over Dou Qi Continent.

358
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,640
These relaxed flowers

359
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,350
have to seek refuge in a remote place.

360
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,590
A true Powerhouse

361
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,190
should bring peace back to all.

362
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,800
That's the point of being a Powerhouse.

363
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,270
Let's go.

364
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,680
Did you only find the first Change

365
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,920
of Heavenly Flame Triple Xuan Change
based on the map?

366
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,330
Yes.

367
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,590
This is the only one in Black Flame Village.

368
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:09,000
It's said Xiao Xuan died in Heavenly Tomb.

369
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,000
It's possible

370
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,950
more clues can be found there.

371
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,030
But,

372
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,560
things changed.

373
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,590
Heavenly Tomb became a secret.

374
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,000
Heavenly Tomb?

375
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,400
Gu Clan and Xiao Clan are said
to have a deep connection.

376
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
As the Clan Lady of Gu Clan,

377
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,680
have you ever heard of the second volume?

378
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,830
I was once ordered to guard our altar.

379
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,430
Our people said

380
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,880
the altar

381
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,950
was set to mourn

382
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,760
ancestors of the Xiao Clan who died in fights.

383
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,950
Could this altar

384
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,430
be the Heavenly Tomb you're talking about?

385
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,760
If Mr. Xiao Xuan

386
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,470
did pass away there,

387
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,640
I'm sure I'll find clues

388
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,800
about Heavenly Flame Triple Xuan Change.

389
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,310
Whether the second volume is found or not,

390
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,790
Xiao Yan, before the Pill Meeting is held,

391
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,590
you must achieve the first Change.

392
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,030
OK.

393
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,880
If you have no bloodline of Xiao Clan,

394
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,590
you may hurt your meridians.

395
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,310
I'm lucky.

396
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,400
I will withstand it.

397
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,680
The secret method of Xiao Clan

398
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,230
may trigger all your Dou Qi in meridians.

399
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,830
Let me help to protect your meridians

400
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,710
with the power of Yang Flame Ancient Altar.

401
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,150
Open the scroll.

402
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,330
Expand the Eight Extraordinary Meridians.

403
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,160
Start with the Thoroughfare Vessel
and end with the Yangwei Vessel.

404
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,230
The Clan Tattoo on his forehead

405
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,950
best validates his bloodline.

406
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,910
Now have a try.

407
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,880
Mobilize the flames with
Heavenly Flame Triple Xuan Change,

408
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,190
instead of the Flame Mantra.

409
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,520
Green Lotus Change.

410
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,670
Back.

411
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,830
Another man from Xiao Clan

412
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,040
is about to fight Hall of Souls
with Heavenly Flames.

413
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,040
All the Pill Mantras you need are here.

414
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,550
Si Zhu,

415
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,880
go back and have a rest.

416
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,920
I can handle it myself.

417
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,640
Please help me
take the rest of the mantras here.

418
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,030
OK.

419
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,900
(Xiao Yan)

420
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,740
(Xiao Yan)

421
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,940
(Dou Technique Hall)

422
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,950
Xiao Yan has achieved the first change
of Heavenly Flame Triple Xuan Change.

423
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,710
The Pill Meeting is approaching as well.

424
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,880
During this trip,
you must take in the Heavenly Flames

425
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,830
and keep an eye on Mu Gu.

426
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,190
Qingluan.

427
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,190
All ears.

428
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,560
Keep company with Xiao Yan
and attend the Pill Meeting together.

429
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,760
Yes.

430
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,310
Wind Sage,

431
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,710
I can also be their team member.

432
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,190
Little Fairy Doctor,

433
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,470
this trip must be very dangerous.

434
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,920
It's better to stay at Starfall Hall.

435
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,680
I won't slow you down.

436
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,670
I'm capable.

437
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,910
I agree with her.

438
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,710
In terms of refining pills,

439
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,800
isn't it better to have her around?

440
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,760
Besides, you once said

441
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,560
good friends should sink or swim together.

442
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,950
Isn't she one of your friends?

443
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,760
I vote for her to join us.

444
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:17,150
I had a word when saving you
that I don't save outsiders.

445
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,950
By now,

446
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,760
you've been reborn
in Yang Flame Ancient Altar.

447
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,880
Shouldn't you respond to what I said?

448
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,430
Sister,

449
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,310
bow to your master now.

450
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,230
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

451
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,160
All hail Master…

452
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,230
Skip this red tape.

453
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,350
The reason I accept you

454
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,430
is exactly because of what I said.

455
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,830
Starfall Hall doesn't save outsiders.

456
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Think it through.

457
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,280
We are different from other factions.

458
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,360
I accept you as a disciple,
but you practice by yourself.

459
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,990
What you can achieve is up to you.

460
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,240
Besides other rules, there is one must.

461
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,400
Once you join Starfall Hall,
you must not follow other factions.

462
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,990
I'm willing to join Starfall Hall.

463
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,280
It's already enough for me
to be accepted as your disciple.

464
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,170
Good.

465
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,950
You can go to the Pill Meeting

466
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,390
together with Mu Qingluan

467
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,760
to assist Xiao Yan.

468
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,150
Remember to take care of each other.

469
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,320
