The one with no ancient jade

20
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,600
should be killed.

21
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,390
Dad.

22
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,470
Dad.

23
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,350
Dad, please don't.

24
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,120
The evil is inside it.

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,960
Dad.

26
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,050
Dad.

27
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,200
Kid,

28
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,160
I have to protect the abode.

29
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,190
This is the punishment for me.

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,640
Hurry up.

31
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,800
Hurry. Leave now.

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,230
I can't control myself anymore.

33
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,430
Quick!

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,840
Heavenly Flames

35
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,080
are devoured by Nihility Devouring Flame.

36
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,470
Sky Mansion Alliance,

37
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
tiny as an ant.

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,440
Dad.

39
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,030
Dad.

40
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,510
Dad.

41
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,430
Do you know how long
I've been searching for you?

42
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,470
I thought you had been dead.

43
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,670
I fought with Purifying Lotus Demon Saint.

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,600
At last, I was defeated.

45
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,440
To get rid of him,

46
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,670
I had to leave Demon Core behind.

47
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,000
Dad,

48
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,590
look.

49
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,830
I live up to your expectations.

50
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,600
My bloodline of
the Ancient Dragon of Taixu awoke.

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,270
I'm now the matriarch.

52
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,720
You've grown up.

53
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,670
It looks like

54
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,360
he has obtained God Fledgling Pill.

55
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,000
Devouring Spirit Eliminating Life Formation.

56
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,830
It can suck all creatures into it,

57
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,830
crush them with force,

58
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,950
and absorb their energy.

59
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,440
How brutal.

60
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,200
He's turning the world into his cauldron,

61
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,990
all lives into his raw material,

62
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
spirit of soul into his fire,

63
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,720
and fleshes into his pill.

64
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,640
He can gather Dou Qi in a short time

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,390
and refine the real God Pill.

66
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,110
There's no way

67
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,550
of stopping him anymore.

68
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,070
Mr. Yao?

69
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,950
Is there not anything that could be done?

70
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,000
I've experienced death once.

71
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,270
There's nothing to be afraid of.

72
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,830
At the worst, the world becomes my grave.

73
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,640
A pleasure for me.

74
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,720
When the God Pill is refined,

75
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,880
I, Huntian Emperor, will become the God.

76
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,200
Anyone willing to follow the Hall of Souls

77
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
can share the world with me.

78
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,510
Don't blame me for my ruthlessness

79
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,110
if you are unwilling.

80
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,390
Dou God.

81
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,000
Ancient jade.

82
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,000
Treasure.

83
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,600
Treasure.

84
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,670
Dad.

85
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,560
Mr. Dragon Emperor,

86
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,720
what are you…

87
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,550
What Dragon Emperor.

88
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,720
I'm not Dragon Emperor.

89
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,350
I'm not worth the title, either.

90
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,440
I didn't get Core Qi,

91
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,760
nor did I save Dragon Tribe.

92
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,320
What kind of Dragon Emperor am I?

93
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,320
Dad,

94
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,600
are you confused?

95
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,390
What Core Qi?

96
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,070
Core Qi

97
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,480
is the power supporting the world,

98
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,640
the lifeblood.

99
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,160
Core Qi,

100
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,320
the power supporting the world?

101
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,200
Tuoshe Ancient Emperor was a villain.

102
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,200
Why did he put God Fledgling Pill here

103
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,160
if he didn't want it to be snatched?

104
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,280
That's it!

105
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,560
Ancient Emperor's treasure

106
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,720
is not God Fledgling Pill.

107
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,560
Mr. Dragon Emperor,

108
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,350
where's the Core Qi?

109
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,670
Core Qi…

110
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,550
Core Qi…

111
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,440
Xiao Yan,

112
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,230
before Senior Xiao Xuan died,

113
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,390
he once said

114
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,320
Source of Power
underpinned the Dou Qi Continent.

115
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,640
The reason why there were
no more new Dou Gods

116
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,830
was because of it.

117
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,640
Could the Source of Power he mentioned

118
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
be this Core Qi?

119
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,440
Is there any Core Qi here?

120
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,440
How come I can't feel any.

121
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,320
What Ancient Emperor wanted to protect

122
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,880
is not that easy to be found by others,

123
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,110
even by Huntian Emperor.

124
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,320
This Ancient Emperor's Abode

125
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,040
must hide some secrets.

126
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,880
This is the Bodhisattva Tree.

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,040
I heard they were all over Dou Qi Continent

128
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,200
and shared the same root.

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,320
When Hun Miesheng was sealed here,

130
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
all the trees on the Dou Qi Continent

131
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,720
became withered.

132
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,390
Yeah.

133
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,270
If we want to enter the tree

134
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,440
to check the seal,

135
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,070
we need to trigger the energy of the tree.

136
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,790
Xiao Yan, do you still remember
the Bodhisattva Tree

137
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,200
in Death Soul Mountain Range?

138
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,880
We were separated back then,

139
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,670
but we met each other in the tree.

140
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,440
Is it possible

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,950
that it's also a Bodhisattva Tree?

142
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,920
If there's any hidden secret here,

143
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,230
it can be nothing else but this tree.

144
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,670
Xun'er, gather the power of Eight Clans.

145
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,230
The true Dou God's treasure might be open.

146
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,800
Gu Clan.

147
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,790
- Yan Clan.
- Ling Clan. - Yao Clan.

148
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,970
- Lei Clan.
- Shi Clan. - Hun Clan.

149
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,980
(Ancient Emperor Space)

150
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,470
Isn't it beautiful here?

151
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,760
Are you Tuoshe Ancient Emperor?

152
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,710
You've got the God Fledgling Pill.

153
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,350
Why are you up here then?

154
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,600
Senior,

155
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,280
the Pill was taken away by Huntian Emperor.

156
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,470
You've been uninformed in this abode

157
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,280
that you're the last one

158
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,910
on Dou Qi Continent

159
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,030
reaching the true Dou God level.

160
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,030
There emerges some ruffians
who absorb others' Dou Qi

161
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,470
to improve themselves.

162
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,940
Huntian Emperor, Master of Hall of Souls,

163
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,350
attempts to become a Dou God

164
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,840
by refining God Pill

165
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,200
at the cost of all lives on Dou Qi Continent.

166
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,640
With the power of Eight Clans,

167
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,080
I come here, to stop him.

168
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,280
So,

169
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,790
are you asking for the second pill from me?

170
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,880
Even if there's one, you can't refine it.

171
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,190
Senior,

172
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,440
you broke the key of this abode into eight

173
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,640
protected by Eight Clans

174
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,230
to get them into cooperation

175
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,590
and against the tendency of greed.

176
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,110
I know the treasure in this abode

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,200
is not the Pill at all,

178
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,110
but what you're truly protecting.

179
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,550
Go ahead.

180
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,200
My ancestor once told me

181
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,640
the power on the Dou Qi Continent was weak

182
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,960
due to the lack of one thing.

183
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,880
Your ancestor was indeed extraordinary

184
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
for having come to this realization.

185
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,670
People regard God Fledgling Pill

186
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,670
as the treasure,

187
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,470
but they don't know

188
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,790
the real treasure

189
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,470
is the nearly extinct Core Qi.

190
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
I call it "Core Power".

191
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,230
In ancient times,

192
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,880
Core Power

193
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,640
was born as a magic energy of nature.

194
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,640
Dou Practitioners

195
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,710
must absorb enough Core Power

196
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,640
to break the barrier of becoming Dou Gods.

197
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,280
Dou Qi Continent, at that time,

198
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,000
was in no shortage of Core Power.

199
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,030
It was commonly found,

200
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,710
but it was not renewable.

201
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,590
That's to say,

202
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,520
the more it was consumed,

203
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,880
the less its reserves

204
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,760
in this world.

205
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,710
Dou God

206
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,110
is the goal of everyone
on the Dou Qi Continent

207
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,320
and the supreme existence in this world.

208
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,760
When there was a new Dou God,

209
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,280
there was a lot of consumption of Core Power.

210
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,470
It finally reached its end.

211
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,760
On the Dou Qi Continent,

212
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,470
Core Power has been exhausted.

213
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,510
So,

214
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,840
there are no more Dou Gods.

215
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,150
Core Power

216
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,640
has indeed been depleted

217
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,320
by ancient powerhouses.

218
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,760
But what you're doing now

219
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,840
is the same as what we did.

220
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,760
The desire for power

221
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,840
seems to be sowed

222
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,640
in our hearts since we were born.

223
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,760
After I became a Dou God,

224
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,440
people wanted power more than ever

225
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,080
and started to vie for Core Power.

226
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,080
I knew clearly

227
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,520
that I should be responsible.

228
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,200
So, I hold the hope

229
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,030
to protect the remaining Core Power

230
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,400
and restore the old Dou Qi Continent.

231
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,790
Inside the Bodhisattva Tree

232
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,110
lies the last bit of Core Power,

233
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,280
the real treasure I want to protect.

234
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,430
Senior,

235
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,960
you nurture Core Power

236
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,200
with your own power.

237
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,110
Then, why did you

238
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,960
make God Fledgling Pill?

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,640
The God Fledgling Pill you saw

240
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,470
was not made by me.

241
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,520
It was my strong desire for power.

242
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,230
Over the past years,

243
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,470
it has been integrated with and refined by

244
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,910
the 22 Heavenly Flames in the abode.

245
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,280
God Fledgling Pill may help one person.

246
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,350
Core Power

247
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,230
can help everyone.

248
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,710
You actually once owned

249
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
all the 22 Heavenly Flames.

250
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,520
Why

251
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,590
is the first flame not there?

252
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,710
Do you know the name of the first flame?

253
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,870
Emperor Flame.

254
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,000
It was my original name before.

255
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,760
I don't own the Heavenly Flames.

256
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,760
Rather, I'm shaped by them.

257
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,320
A combination would produce new flames.

258
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,680
As for this fact,

259
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,200
you should be very clear.

260
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,680
Senior,

261
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,910
are you referring to Xiao Yi?

262
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,960
I've answered all your questions.

263
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,150
You can leave now.

264
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,070
Senior,

265
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,400
in order to protect Core Power,

266
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,280
you'd like to sacrifice yourself.

267
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,950
Do you want

268
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,840
to see the disaster sweep
across the Dou Qi Continent?

269
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,080
Huntian Emperor won't give up easily.

270
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,520
What you've been protecting for years

271
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,440
will be in his hands at last.

272
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,670
You're indeed smart,

273
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,910
but you're a human after all.

274
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
Just give up.

275
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,430
Senior,

276
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,030
Xiao Xuan, my ancestor,

277
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,110
sacrificed the power of bloodline of Xiao Clan

278
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,280
to put Huntian Emperor under seal,

279
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,760
bringing centuries of peace to the world.

280
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,150
Nowadays, in Xiao Clan,

281
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
I'm the only one with the power of bloodline.

282
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,480
I'm more than willing to sacrifice everything.

283
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,830
You tried everything you could

284
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,950
to protect Core Power.

285
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,710
I, Xiao Yan,

286
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,000
can do that, too.

287
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,040
Have a look at the consequences

288
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,680
of what you said.

289
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,640
If you accept my power

290
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,760
to destroy Huntian Emperor,

291
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,040
your human body will be burnt out

292
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,590
and turned into dust together with Core Power

293
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,110
so that Core Qi re-fills the world.

294
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,640
Are you still willing to save the world

295
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,430
at the cost of your own life?

296
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,880
Yes, I'm willing to.

297
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,910
Xiao Yan,

298
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,920
Core Power contains a lot of energy.

299
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,070
It can help you reach the God level.

300
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,110
But from now on,

301
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,880
you will live together with it

302
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,310
and share the same future.

303
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,270
I understand.

304
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,430
My last words to you.

305
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,920
Stay true to your heart,

306
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,070
be firm as a rock,

307
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,070
and you can live forever.

308
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,560
Remember my words.

309
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,430
Keep them in your mind.

310
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,400
Huntian Emperor,

311
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,430
in this world,

312
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,880
you're not the only Dou God.

313
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,760
Demon Blood Blade.

314
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,640
Xiao Yan,

315
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,430
don't think that you're my match

316
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,490
just because you're a Dou God.

317
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,790
Xiao Yan.

318
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,000
Devouring Spirit Eliminating Life Formation!

319
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,840
Xiao Yan,

320
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,470
isn't it better to give up earlier?

321
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,950
In the name of Flame Emperor,

322
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
I now declare the release of all flames.

323
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,520
Xiao Yan.

324
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,190
Xiao Yan,

325
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,310
we're of the same kind.

326
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,590
Why bother being with those mediocre people?

327
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,880
We're not the same.

328
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,520
My life is for all the people.

329
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,190
On the contrary,

330
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,350
you're trapped in your greedy lust.

331
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,710
Don't you understand?

332
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,110
I can defeat you

333
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,110
because the power of humans has a limit,

334
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,070
while there's no limit to the core power.

335
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,190
What are you going to do?

336
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,280
I'm going to deprive you of the power

337
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,880
and fill the world with it.

338
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,760
Both of us are Dou Gods.

339
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,350
You can defeat me,

340
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,520
but you can never destroy me.

341
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,790
It's over now.

342
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,830
I, Xiao Yan from Wutan City,

343
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,310
completed the mission.

344
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,310
Where are they?

345
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,120
Xun'er,

346
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
we're sorry,

347
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,190
but Xiao Yan

348
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,710
sacrificed for the whole Dou Qi Continent.

349
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,110
This is his mission.

350
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,280
It's for all of us.

351
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,070
He's the only one able to do it.

352
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,270
Yeah.

353
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
Xiao Yan,

354
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,160
you did it.

355
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,340
(Jia Nan Academy)

356
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,190
Ms. Hu Jia.

357
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,670
Teacher.

358
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,070
Everyone, this way, please.

359
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,480
Everyone,

360
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,310
here, gather around.

361
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,230
Let me make an introduction.

362
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,640
This is your role model,

363
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,470
the core figure of Jia Nan Academy.

364
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,070
You…

365
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,400
I know. I know.

366
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,600
This is Flame Emperor.

367
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,760
Thanks to him,

368
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,560
the Dou Qi Continent is full of Core Qi.

369
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
Focus on practicing,

370
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,800
and everyone can become Flame Emperor.

371
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,590
The teacher is talking. Don't interrupt.

372
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,910
Boys and girls,

373
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,400
when you study at Jia Nan Academy,

374
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,920
your background doesn't matter.

375
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,070
Even if you're from Eight Clans,

376
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,230
we won't show any tolerance.

377
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,150
Ms. Hu Jia,

378
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,230
we've heard the story of Flame Emperor.

379
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,800
It's better to share with us

380
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,790
some fun organizations

381
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,760
that we can join

382
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,600
in the Academy.

383
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,400
Yeah. Tell us. Tell us.

384
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,230
There's only one organization
in Jia Nan Academy.

385
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,760
It's called Yan Alliance.

386
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,190
But, boy,

387
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,400
I don't think you have the talent.

388
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,520
You'd better practice for more years.

389
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,310
But I think this boy

390
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,800
reminds me of Xiao Yan back then.

391
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,840
Hey,

392
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,680
are you interested in joining the Guard?

393
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,400
Say yes. Say yes. Go.

394
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,310
Your Highness,

395
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,680
this batch of newly enrolled students

396
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,070
has arrived at Jia Nan Academy safely.

397
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,470
Tonight,

398
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,430
let's go to the east

399
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,830
and subdue the trouble-making mercenaries.

400
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,070
Your Highness,

401
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,350
Blackhorn Domain is in good condition now.

402
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,760
It's time we go back.

403
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,150
You don't understand.

404
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,040
This is what I owe him.

405
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,670
No.

406
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,280
This is what he owes me.

407
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,310
Fairy Doctor.

408
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,760
Fairy Doctor.

409
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,230
Fairy Doctor.

410
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,190
Please save my child.

411
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,760
It's a Woeful…

412
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,070
It's a Woeful Poison Body!

413
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,280
Stay away from us.

414
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,350
Please.

415
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,800
Please.

416
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,160
Please don't drive us away.

417
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,040
Please save us.

418
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,310
Get away from us.

419
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,920
Pretty please. Please.

420
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,000
Please.

421
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,680
Don't make us leave.

422
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,520
Why are you still here?

423
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,590
Please save my child.

424
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,550
This…

425
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,430
In the past…

426
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,670
You're also a Woeful…

427
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,560
What's your name?

428
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,880
Lan.

429
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,150
Lan,

430
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
it's not a disease.

431
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,000
It's your inborn talent.

432
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,820
(Sky Mansion Alliance)

433
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,670
It's all here.

434
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,970
- Give it to Myriad Sword Hall.
- Senior.

435
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,910
OK.

436
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,720
Master,

437
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,880
where do we place it?

438
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,190
Put it in Dou Technique Hall.

439
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,840
OK.

440
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
Master Yao,

441
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,920
congratulations!

442
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,880
Sorry for what I said.

443
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,590
I should call you Alliance Leader.

444
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,240
Alliance Leader,

445
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,310
is the name on this plaque written by you?

446
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,160
Look at its first letter.

447
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,950
Look at its last letter.

448
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,760
Feel its aura.

449
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,470
The writer must be extraordinary.

450
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,720
Alliance Leader,

451
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,000
you see,

452
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,430
four Halls have been restored now.

453
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,230
If I'm trustworthy in your eyes,

454
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,470
please let my Ice River Valley

455
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,830
host the Four-Hall Grand Meeting this year.

456
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,830
I will make satisfying arrangements for sure.

457
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,120
What do you think?

458
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,800
What do you mean by that?

459
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,280
Only the four Halls can attend the Meeting.

460
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,590
From when is Ice River Valley in?

461
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,640
Has Central Plains declined?

462
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,560
Or, do you respect Alliance Leader only,

463
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,760
but not the other three Halls?

464
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,840
No… You're…

465
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,040
You… What are you talking about?

466
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,640
The other three Halls follow his words,

467
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,760
don't they?

468
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,710
I think there's no conflict
between the four Halls.

469
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,040
The Meeting is just a formality.

470
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,920
Not holding the Meeting this year

471
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,270
makes no difference.

472
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,230
Mr. Yao, you're totally right.

473
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,670
I second that.

474
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,160
OK. It's not held. It makes no difference.

475
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,040
Alliance Leader,

476
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,800
I'm here sending these presents.

477
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
Now that I'm done,

478
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,640
please excuse me now.

479
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,070
Thanks.

480
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,110
This little girl.

481
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,160
She speaks sharper words than Fei Tian.

482
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,590
Put the presents down.

483
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,600
Mr. Yao.

484
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,880
Alliance Leader.

485
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,400
I'm just acting for this post.

486
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,910
How about this?

487
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,760
You call me "Mr. Yao" from now on

488
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,830
just like what Mu Qingluan does.

489
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,910
Mr. Yao.

490
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,520
Good.

491
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,190
Have you finished?

492
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,430
Almost. I'll finish soon.

493
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,710
I'm sleepy. I want to sleep.

494
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,880
What're you looking at?

495
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,230
I won't run away.

496
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,760
I haven't seen you for a long term.

497
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,230
What's wrong with me keeping looking at you?

498
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,230
Yeah, yeah. It's been a year,

499
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,520
but you're still looking.

500
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,280
I feel sorry for Xun'er.

501
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,160
We're reunited now,

502
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,160
but they are apart from each other.

503
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,000
Dad, do you think

504
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,430
Xiao Yan will come back or not?

505
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,070
Dad.

506
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,240
Dad.

507
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,820
Where're you going?

508
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
Xiao Yan,

509
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,550
can you hear me?

510
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,920
It's OK.

511
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,360
I will go to wherever you've been to.

512
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,150
I'll keep searching for you.

513
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,270
Xun'er.

514
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,710
(Stay true to your heart,)

515
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,000
(be firm as a rock,)

516
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,630
