19
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,880
Girl, what are you doing?

20
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,190
My poison broke out.

21
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,030
There's nothing else I can do.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,800
Even if I do my best,

23
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,880
I can only keep this Dou Qi mask

24
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
free of poison for a moment.

25
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,720
Your Highness.

26
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,320
Please

27
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,230
go to the headmaster

28
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,160
for me

29
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,240
and ask him

30
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,960
to seal me here.

31
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,790
Open your mouth.

32
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,600
Little Fairy Doctor.

33
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,350
I got the Bodhisattva Saliva.

34
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,910
You'll be fine.

35
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,040
How come?

36
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,920
It's my destiny

37
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,510
to die of this.

38
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,670
You!

39
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,830
Leave!

40
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,550
Bodhisattva Saliva

41
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,480
must be applied to naked bodies.

42
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,910
You're joking.

43
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm not joking.

44
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,110
Not only does it have to be applied
to naked bodies,

45
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,600
but it also has to be sealed
with the Heaven Flame Seal

46
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,880
in order to make it work.

47
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,510
Believe it or not.

48
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,160
I understand.

49
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,600
Little Fairy Doctor.

50
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,790
Sorry for that.

51
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,830
Heaven Flame Seal.

52
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,950
Heaven is form.

53
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,880
Flame is spirit.

54
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,350
Seal.

55
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,200
Heaven Flame Seal could only
work once,

56
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,110
and at most could keep
Woeful Poison Body

57
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,550
free from poisonous eruption
for three years.

58
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,760
For a complete cure,

59
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,400
you have to go to the Central Plains.

60
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,840
To Starfall Hall.

61
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,950
Flame Sage.

62
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,590
Go with us to the Central Plains.

63
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,280
Little Fairy Doctor needs you.

64
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,840
The one she needs is you.

65
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,110
Only someone like you,
who would do anything for a friend,

66
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,550
could find a way
to undo the Woeful Poison Body.

67
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,470
As for me…

68
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,960
Studying Qi Methods and Techniques
is more my scene.

69
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,200
I'll stay
in the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower

70
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,080
and continue to cultivate
the Fallen Heart Flame.

71
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,790
The Central Plains belongs
to you young people.

72
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,760
The Central Plains is an existence
above the Jia Ma Empire.

73
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,550
The main forces are one tower,
two clans, three valleys and four Halls.

74
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,030
The top of the four Halls,
the Starfall Hall, was created by Yao Chen.

75
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,440
Although Yao Chen has fallen,

76
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,990
there is

77
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,200
another figure in the Starfall Hall.

78
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,520
His real name is Feng Xian,

79
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,790
known as Wind Sage.

80
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,440
His character, strength
and loyalty to Medicine Sage

81
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,280
are unparalleled.

82
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,080
After Medicine Sage fell,

83
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,350
Wind Sage had been
pursuing his whereabouts,

84
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,000
relentlessly hunting Han Feng.

85
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,880
That was why Han Feng
didn't dare to stay in the Central Plains.

86
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,200
If he knew

87
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,150
you were a disciple of Medicine Sage,

88
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,910
he would have treated you generously.

89
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,760
Wind Sage.

90
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,000
Taking the teleportation formation
to the Central Plains would save the most time.

91
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,110
The teleportation formation is hidden
at the end of the Demon Flame Valley.

92
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,520
Follow up.

93
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,670
Follow up.

94
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,440
If you don't follow me,

95
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,030
will you find the teleportation formation
to the Central Plains?

96
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,510
Hu Jia.

97
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,670
Are you sure you know the way?

98
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,590
Of course.

99
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,590
The only people in the whole
of Jia Nan Academy

100
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,350
who used to go there

101
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,000
were me and my grandfather.

102
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
No offense.

103
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,670
When did you go there?

104
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,440
When I was one year old. Why?

105
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,520
Let's get going.

106
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,280
I'm sure

107
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,070
it's that way.

108
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,200
I'll give you one last chance.

109
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,440
Is this the right direction?

110
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,320
Five-snake Poison Brake Seal.

111
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,830
- Five-snake Poison…
- No, don't do this.

112
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,320
- Five-snake…
- Calm down.

113
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,580
- Let me go.
- Your Highness, no…

114
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,470
Your Highness, calm down.

115
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,300
(Teleportation Formation)

116
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,910
According to Flame Sage,

117
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,200
it is the teleportation formation.

118
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,310
Let's go.

119
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,240
Let's get in.

120
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,870
Xiao Yan.

121
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,230
This is my parting gift to you.

122
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,640
Aren't we going
to the Central Plains together?

123
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,960
Why are we parting ways?

124
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,030
Even though both of us are headed
for Central Plains,

125
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,350
we're going in different directions.

126
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,930
I'm going to find my father.

127
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,760
This is the Raining Bell
of Dragon Island.

128
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,710
Whenever you need me,

129
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,710
tap it.

130
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,960
No matter where I am,

131
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,670
I can sense your location

132
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,590
and appear by your side
at any time.

133
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,910
After arriving in the Central Plains,
Xiao Yan only has you by his side.

134
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,550
He has a bad temper

135
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,840
and likes to defend others
against injustice.

136
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,550
Be prepared to clean up his messes.

137
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,840
Okay.

138
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Now we're clear.

139
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,230
Your Highness, are you sure
not to go to the Central Plains with us?

140
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,350
What? You don't want me to go?

141
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,790
I'm here to see you off

142
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,070
and protect you.

143
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,440
I don't have that kind of time
to waste.

144
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,990
The mercenary group has been
trafficking Snake People for a long time.

145
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,320
Han Feng was just an accomplice.

146
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,440
Now it was time to clean up after them.

147
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
With your skill,

148
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,000
it's certainly a piece of cake
to deal with a mercenary group.

149
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,990
By the way,

150
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,440
this is the elixir I made.

151
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,120
That's all I've got.

152
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,080
Take it sparingly.

153
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,670
Are you ending your contract with me?

154
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
No, I'm not.

155
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This is Snake King Mark.

156
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,280
No one can kill

157
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,710
the marked one.

158
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,200
Your life is still mine.

159
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,400
Your Highness,
that won't be necessary.

160
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Ouch!

161
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,760
With the Snake King Mark,

162
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,350
you belong to me.

163
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,750
I am leaving.

164
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,640
Xiao Yan, try your best.

165
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,670
Come back safely
from the Central Plains.

166
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,430
Where's Little Fairy Doctor?

167
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,030
Sugar calabash.

168
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,630
Little Fairy Doctor.

169
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,400
Sugar calabash.

170
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,840
Stop!

171
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,870
Stop!

172
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,240
Don't run!

173
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,550
Stop!

174
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,750
You little brat!

175
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,870
Keep running.

176
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,920
Keep running.

177
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,000
You think you're worthy
of practicing Dou Qi?

178
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,800
Listen carefully.

179
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,110
If I hear you say
you're a Dou Practitioner again,

180
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
I won't let you go.

181
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,870
Beat him up!

182
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,840
You brat.

183
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,800
Stop!

184
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,920
Who is this?

185
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,280
Watch carefully.

186
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,030
We are all Dou Grandmaster.

187
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,470
I don't even need Dou Qi
to beat you up.

188
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,400
Dou Grandmaster, huh?

189
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,350
Bunch of brats!

190
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,400
Brats!

191
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,470
It was my fault.

192
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,720
I was ignorant.

193
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,040
- I was ignorant.
- Leave now!

194
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,800
Go.

195
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,160
Thank you.

196
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,640
What is your name?

197
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,640
Here.

198
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,400
Xiao Yan from Wutan City.

199
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,660
(Auction House Guard, Ying Wei)

200
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,310
Xiao Yan.

201
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,310
You are Xiao Yan?

202
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,000
Who are you?

203
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,590
The Central Plains is huge.

204
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,710
Any plans on where you want to go?

205
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,760
Man.

206
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,190
You're too curious.

207
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,310
Wherever you want to go,

208
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,360
whoever you want to see,

209
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
and whatever you want to get,

210
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,280
take this badge

211
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,790
to the Auction House.

212
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,880
You'll find everything.

213
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,100
(Auction House)

214
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,880
Okay, this is the last lot.

215
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,880
The last bid is 3,000 gold coins.

216
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,400
Anyone else?

217
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,560
If not, congratulations!

218
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,130
- It is mine.
- Congratulations.

219
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,000
This is mine.

220
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,600
Don't touch it.

221
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,070
You won't be able to afford it.

222
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,830
Even a pheasant can be a phoenix now.

223
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,123
(Auction House)
This third-rate bronze tripod is lacquered

224
00:18:18,123 --> 00:18:19,680
(Auction House)
in purple and gold.

225
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,310
Interesting.

226
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,590
Keep it a secret.

227
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,760
I've got a Dou Technique Scroll here.

228
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,190
Please do me a favor.

229
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,360
Di Class.

230
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,830
Good taste.

231
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,070
This is
the Three Thousand Thunder Movement.

232
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,560
A first-rate Dou Technique.

233
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,280
Since you and I are destined
to meet,

234
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,430
the price is negotiable.

235
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,990
Miss, it's been a long time
since you've been here.

236
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,000
You're just in time.

237
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,980
(Disciple from Wind Thunder Hall, Feng Qing'er)
Miss, look.

238
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,000
A dagger forged
by the Burning Flame Valley.

239
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,070
It's inlaid with Demon Core,

240
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,830
and is extremely sharp.

241
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,280
It's awesome to take it out.

242
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,110
I have twelve of them here.

243
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,590
You can pick one you like.

244
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,880
I'll take them all.

245
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,640
Okay.

246
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,480
I'll wrap it for you.

247
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,830
Senior, take it easy.

248
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,800
We have to attend
the Four-Hall Grand Meeting tomorrow.

249
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,230
If Master finds out

250
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,710
we're sneaking out…

251
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,190
Pay for them.

252
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,400
Senior, I really can't take it.

253
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,520
Miss.

254
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,310
But you can still talk.

255
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,470
Let's take a look over there.

256
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,230
Take care, Miss.

257
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,190
Miss.

258
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,710
Do I know you?

259
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,740
(Wind Thunder Hall)

260
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,950
You're here for selling?

261
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:12,820
You…

262
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,110
Nice sword.

263
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Poor Demon Core.

264
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,830
Third Class Magic Beasts

265
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,590
are not wanted
in the Jia Ma Empire.

266
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,520
What a hick of the Jia Ma Empire.

267
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,880
Open your eyes!

268
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,000
This is the Senior Sister
of Wind Thunder Hall.

269
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,640
Who's selling anything to you?

270
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,240
Hold on!

271
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,760
I said I don't want your sword.

272
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,360
You hick.

273
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,040
Where did you get this scroll
of Dou Techniques?

274
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,880
You look

275
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,710
quite poor.

276
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,360
Here's the deal.

277
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,430
One hundred gold coins.

278
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,070
And it is yours.

279
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,000
- You!
- Senior.

280
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,000
You're gonna buy it from this poor guy?

281
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,880
You know nothing.

282
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,520
He's holding a Dou Technique
of Thunder Attribute.

283
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,070
It seems to belong to our hall.

284
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,560
Just 100 gold coins
can keep you negotiating for so long.

285
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,950
You obviously stole it!

286
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,270
Thief!

287
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,080
Here's a thief!

288
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,790
- Catch the thief!
- Catch the thief!

289
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,920
Catch the thief!

290
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,310
Catch the thief!

291
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,550
Catch the thief!

292
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,560
What you're holding
belongs to Wind Thunder Hall.

293
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,920
You're just a thief trying to escape.

294
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,160
If you say it's yours,
does it mean it's yours?

295
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,520
If you call it, will it answer?

296
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,560
You stole it and wanna run?

297
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,400
Miss.

298
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,310
I have made myself clear.

299
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,040
I bought this scroll of Dou Techniques.

300
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,430
Who sold it to you?

301
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Who saw it?

302
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,040
Who can prove it?

303
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,400
I saw it.

304
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,350
He did buy

305
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,880
this scroll of Dou Techniques.

306
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,560
Mu Qingluan.

307
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,400
It's been a long time, Ms. Qing'er.

308
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,600
How have you been?

309
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,830
It's none of your business.

310
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,430
Tomorrow is
the Four-Hall Great Meeting.

311
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
I'm sure

312
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,070
you'll impress us.

313
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,270
Of course.

314
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,590
We are the host tomorrow.

315
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,070
You Starfall Hall can only step aside.

316
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,430
Starfall Hall?

317
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,400
Mu Qingluan.

318
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,160
What's your relationship
with this guy?

319
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,350
- I don't know him.
- I don't know him.

320
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,760
Hold this guy.

321
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,880
Miss Feng Qing'er.

322
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,470
An auction house
is a place to do business.

323
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,710
It has its own rules.

324
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,810
(Chief Auctioneer of Auction House, Ya Fei)
Fair trade, no origin asked.

325
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,070
Since he bought this scroll
of Dou Techniques,

326
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,590
it belongs to him.

327
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,310
No one can stop him
from taking his stuff from here.

328
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,830
Understand?

329
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,950
Senior.

330
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,280
We're sneaking down the mountain.

331
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,000
It's not a good idea
to make a big deal out of it.

332
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,350
Let's wait and see tomorrow.

333
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,800
Senior, thank you
for your kindness just now.

334
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,880
I'm just being honest.

335
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,430
But

336
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,920
we're not from the same hall.

337
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,350
It's not appropriate

338
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,720
for you to call me senior.

339
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,710
Are you a disciple
of the Starfall Hall?

340
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,880
I'm Mu Qingluan,
the first disciple of the Starfall Hall.

341
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,310
Then we are fellow disciples.

342
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,950
I'm from the Jia Ma Empire.
My name is Xiao Yan.

343
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,350
I have a favor to ask of Wind Sage.

344
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,100
Then you've come at a bad time.

345
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,760
Master is not on the mountain.

346
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,190
So when will he be back?

347
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,920
It's hard to say.

348
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,600
Master has a spontaneous personality.

349
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,070
He comes

350
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,360
and goes when he wants.

351
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,930
That means if he never comes back,

352
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,330
I'll never find him?

353
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,620
You can't see him in the mountains.

354
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,940
But maybe somewhere else.

355
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,220
Where is the somewhere?

356
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,100
Four-Hall Grand Meeting.

357
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,060
Four-Hall Grand Meeting?

358
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,220
Well.

359
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,500
I have something important to do.

360
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,220
I am not going to buy your staff.

361
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,500
Maybe I can help you

362
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,420
with that important thing.

363
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,860
We don't even know each other.

364
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,500
Why are you…?

365
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,700
Just call me Ya Fei.

366
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,740
Although you don't know me,

367
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,140
I know you.

368
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,700
You're from the Xiao Family
of Wutan City.

369
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,500
What?

370
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,020
In Jia Ma Empire,

371
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,860
Xiao Family of Wutan City.

372
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,940
Your name is Xiao Yan.

373
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,740
You must have misunderstood.

374
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,940
I'm from the Jia Ma Empire.

375
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,020
But I am not

376
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,540
from the Xiao Family
of Wutan City at all.

377
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,860
My name is Yan Xiao.

378
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,900
Yan of Yan Xiao.

379
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,700
Xiao of Yan Xiao.

380
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,700
Then it seems that we did
have a misunderstanding.

381
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,940
Ya Fei.

382
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,660
Didn't you just say
you could help me?

383
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,820
Since you're not Xiao Yan,

384
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,460
I'm afraid…

385
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,860
Don't be so mean.

386
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,980
I'm going
to the Four-Hall Grand Meeting

387
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,900
to look for the Wind Sage
of Starfall Hall.

388
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,260
And I have a friend
named Little Fairy Doctor.

389
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,620
- Could you…?
- Although you are not Xiao Yan,

390
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,180
you are from Wutan City.

391
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,860
We are kind of related.

392
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,780
Take a rest here.

393
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,220
Consider it my offer as the host.

394
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,500
(This scroll of Dou Technique
is only of Di Class,)

395
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,980
(and it's a body motion Dou Technique.)

396
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,100
(Why does that girl care so much?)

397
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,020
(High-level Di Class. This technique
is divided into three levels.)

398
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,260
(At the primary level, you can move
like lightning and split into different bodies.)

399
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,220
(At the final level, you can condense
the thunder illusionary body.)

400
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,920
(If the original body is still alive,
the illusion body will never be destroyed.)

401
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,980
Condense the thunder illusionary body.

402
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,780
If the original body is still alive,

403
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,100
the illusionary body
will never be destroyed.

404
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,340
(A doppelganger with similar strength
to the original body,)

405
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,020
(and one that won't be destroyed)

406
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,620
(until the original body dies.)

407
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,380
(That is to say, as long as
one cultivates to the highest level,)

408
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,540
(one Dou Emperor)

409
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,700
(directly becomes two.)

410
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,540
That's invincible.

411
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,460
Transform thunder with the body.

412
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,060
Use the heart to control it.

413
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,380
(Master of the Wind Thunder Hall, Fei Tian)

414
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,660
Junior.

415
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,660
Master.

416
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,940
See?

417
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,540
Mu Qingluan came prepared today.

418
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,740
Master.

419
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,220
Just rest assured.

420
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,100
Only you will be the Alliance Leader.

421
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,620
The Starfall Hall
can't even do anything about it.

422
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,340
You're just articulate.

423
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,300
No, I'm not.

424
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,580
I'll tell you one more thing.

425
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,180
Do not confront the tough
with toughness.

426
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,540
By then,

427
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,100
you should…

428
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,540
I got it.

429
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,500
I've never heard of
such a powerful girl

430
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,180
in Wind Thunder Hall before.

431
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,380
Anyone else wants to challenge?

432
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,300
Mu Qingluan from Starfall Hall.

433
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,380
Ms. Feng Qing'er, please.

434
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,580
Qingluan.

435
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,540
Today is a big day
for the four Halls.

436
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,620
Why isn't Feng Xian here?

437
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,700
Even if the Starfall Hall
isn't as powerful as it used to be,

438
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,940
we are old friends.

439
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,180
He can't just
leave old friends behind

440
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,940
for his own sake.

441
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,780
You have to tell him

442
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,300
what I said today.

443
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,620
Thank you for your concern,
Master Fei.

444
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,340
Master.

445
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,180
If you want to catch up
with my master,

446
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,860
why don't you do it in person?

447
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,620
Qingluan.

448
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,860
Is he really coming today?

449
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,860
Don't you want him to come?

450
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,940
Wind Thunder Hall

451
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,940
is the host
of this Four-Hall Grand Meeting.

452
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,700
All of you are guests of honor.

453
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,540
I'm sure all are welcome.

454
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,140
In that case,

455
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,940
I'll thank you for your kindness

456
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,740
on behalf of my master.

457
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,420
Qing'er.

458
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,900
Qingluan said

459
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,860
that Wind Sage is coming
to watch the battle as well.

460
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,140
Present us a good fight.

461
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,460
If you win,

462
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,860
Wind Thunder Hall will be
the head of the four Halls.

463
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,220
Don't worry, Master.

464
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,020
I won't disgrace you.

465
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,780
Qing'er, make it quick.

466
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,260
Watch out.

467
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,540
I can't control it!

468
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,980
Master, help me!

469
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,740
Admit it, it's over.

470
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,560
Senior.

471
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,420
- Senior.
- How are you?

472
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,740
Are you okay?

473
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,780
The Starfall Hall is inferior
to the others.

474
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,900
Can't you afford to lose?

475
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,100
Let's go.

476
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,220
I'm not convinced.

477
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,540
I'll challenge her.

478
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,900
Which hall are you from?

479
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,140
Master, this guy is…

480
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,280
Xiao Yan

481
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,980
from Starfall Hall.

482
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,140
How come I've never heard of you

483
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,700
in the Starfall Hall?

484
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,740
There are many disciples

485
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,220
in the Starfall Hall,

486
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,060
all over the place.

487
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,060
It doesn't matter

488
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,700
if you don't know me.

489
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,020
Qingluan.

490
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,500
Is he really your fellow?

491
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,660
Why all the questions?

492
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,260
Are you afraid

493
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,020
that Qing'er will lose to me?

494
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,500
Master, I'll fight him.

495
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,900
Okay.

496
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,340
Now that you promised,
you have to fight me.

497
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,220
No backing out.

498
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,500
Since you're the one
who challenged me,

499
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,700
we should first delineate

500
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,420
the consequences of losing,

501
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,900
which shall befall you.

502
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,660
What would you want?

503
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,540
Join Wind Thunder Hall

504
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,620
and be

505
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,140
my lackey.

506
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,100
And what if you lose?

507
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,310
I…

508
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,740
I won't make it hard for you.

509
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,260
If you lose, make amends
to my Eldest Brother Mu Qingluan

510
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,140
in front of all of us.

511
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,420
Kowtow three times.

512
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,060
And you should say:

513
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,180
Mu Qingluan, it was my fault.

514
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,300
Mu Qingluan, it was my fault.

515
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,060
Understand?

516
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,740
