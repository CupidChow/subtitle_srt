=Episode 7=

19
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,100
That year, I asked you
to kill Yao Chen with poison.

20
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,570
To join the Hall of Souls,

21
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,330
you did that without hesitation.

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,930
Now, you want to kill him again.

23
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,940
Han Feng,

24
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,820
do you not care

25
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,140
even a little bit about your master?

26
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,370
Since I pledged loyalty to you,

27
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,900
I've cared about no one else.

28
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,940
Besides,

29
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,010
Yao Chen...

30
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,610
He disappointed me again.

31
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,860
He passed on Flame Mantra to Xiao Yan!

32
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,170
I shouldn't have trusted him.

33
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,890
Give me an order

34
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,530
and I will kill Yao Chen again

35
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,500
to tie up loose ends.

36
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,250
What is your plan?

37
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,170
I've figured it out.

38
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,940
Xiao Yan's father

39
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,330
is imprisoned in the Misty Cloud Sect.

40
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,060
He went to Jia Nan Academy

41
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,060
just to save his father.

42
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,090
Chief Yun Shan of the Misty Cloud Sect

43
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,730
has been having closed-door cultivation.

44
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,140
Elder,

45
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,730
if you give him a little help

46
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,250
and do him a favor,

47
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,500
I believe he'll be under our control.

48
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,980
By then,

49
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,220
we can lure Xiao Yan
to the Misty Cloud Sect

50
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,060
and force Yao Chen to show up.

51
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,380
Then you will get

52
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,530
the Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

53
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,020
It's far more powerful

54
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,610
than the Fallen Heart Flame.

55
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,810
Then go for it.

56
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,170
Don't let anything go wrong again.

57
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,020
Otherwise,

58
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,890
you'd be of no use.

59
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,890
Mr. Yao is still very weak.

60
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,170
Flame Poison

61
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,090
has been the most difficult poison.

62
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,170
Because it's stuck in the veins.

63
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,660
Do you know the best antidote for it?

64
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,410
Spiritual Recovery Purple Pill?

65
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,300
(Elders' House)

66
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,380
Headmaster.

67
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,340
Xiao Yan?

68
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,170
How are you recovering?

69
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,940
I'm fine now.

70
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,450
I have to discuss something with you.

71
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,060
The Fallen Heart Flame?

72
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,570
Yes.

73
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,500
I conquered it.

74
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,220
So,

75
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,820
on the day you entered our academy,

76
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,220
you clamored for entry to the ranking

77
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,820
just to get into the Tower

78
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,100
and conquer the flame, huh?

79
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,410
Forgive me, Headmaster.

80
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,010
I did come to this academy

81
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,780
to conquer the Fallen Heart Flame.

82
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,340
I didn't mean

83
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,010
to keep it from you.

84
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,840
Heavenly Flames were born
between heaven and earth

85
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,100
and they were ownerless.

86
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,060
What harm is there when you borrow it?

87
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,850
Thank you, Headmaster.

88
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,820
How's Mr. Yao now?

89
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,100
He's still in the Storage Ring.

90
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,220
He's not dying.

91
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,410
But

92
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,700
he's badly injured and still in a coma.

93
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,450
If you need any pills, let me know.

94
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,730
I've checked it.

95
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,290
Only the Spiritual Recovery Purple Pill
can heal Mr. Yao.

96
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,940
I'm afraid such a high-grade pill

97
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,220
is only available in the Central Plains.

98
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,130
I'm sure Han Feng has some.

99
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,500
Han Feng?

100
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,500
When I fought Han Feng that day,

101
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,130
he also suffered from Flame Poison.

102
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,060
Nearly as badly as Mr. Yao.

103
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,060
So, he needs such pills for recovery.

104
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,260
It makes sense.

105
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
Han Feng's lair
is in the Blackhorn Domain.

106
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,330
If you really want to go there,

107
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,820
I do have a favor to ask.

108
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,780
Go ahead, Headmaster.

109
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,330
When the Tower was unsealed,

110
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,220
Bai Shan was gone.

111
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,450
I guess Han Feng abducted him.

112
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,570
He was misguided
and betrayed our academy.

113
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,890
But he's still one of our disciples.

114
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,410
We should rescue him.

115
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,170
Headmaster,

116
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,570
Bai Shan hated our academy because of me.

117
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,700
I'm somewhat involved.

118
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,540
So, I will take him back.

119
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,130
Why are you following us?

120
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,940
It is my duty to protect Miss Xun'er.

121
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,540
Hope you'll get used to that.

122
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,380
I'm used to that, of course.

123
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,220
Exploring the Hall of Souls
is also my duty.

124
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,450
Hope you'll be aware.

125
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,220
I'm aware.

126
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,890
But on this mission, I call the shots.

127
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,060
You have to listen to me.

128
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,450
I also hope

129
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,130
you can get used to that and be aware.

130
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,450
Miss.

131
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,010
I'm worried

132
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,700
that Xiao Yan isn't sure

133
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,450
about the location of Feng City.

134
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,380
Maybe...

135
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,980
I trust Xiao Yan.

136
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,660
Xun'er,

137
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,570
catch up.

138
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,850
Coming.

139
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,940
What?

140
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,100
Stop when you can't find the way?

141
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,820
Here, Xun'er.

142
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,780
Here.

143
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,260
How long has that fight

144
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,180
been over?

145
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,050
For four days.

146
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,820
Four days and three nights, precisely.

147
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,740
We should wait, then.

148
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,370
Until when?

149
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,730
Until Han Feng finishes making
the Spiritual Recovery Purple Pill.

150
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,290
This pill has a special efficacy

151
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,290
and can't be preserved for a long time.

152
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,340
Han Feng is badly injured.

153
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,290
He has to make it immediately

154
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,940
And he must take it
as soon as it's finished.

155
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,290
It takes four days and nights
to make such a pill.

156
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,480
When it's done,

157
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
there will be strong energy fluctuations.

158
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,340
So, you knew from the beginning

159
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,920
that when we arrive
in the Blackhorn Domain,

160
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,090
we can know where Feng City is

161
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,290
according to energy fluctuations.

162
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,460
There's still some time.

163
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,100
Don't push yourself.

164
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,010
Let's go.

165
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,210
The pill is almost done.

166
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,540
Hurry.

167
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,540
I said,

168
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,810
leave me alone!

169
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,700
Xiao Yan conquered
the Fallen Heart Flame?

170
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,610
Yao Chen got out of the Storage Ring

171
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,500
and he didn't regain his Dou Qi.

172
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,300
They

173
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,260
must be here for my pill.

174
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,580
Sadly,

175
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,730
I haven't fully recovered.

176
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,530
If I forcibly

177
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,410
stop making it,

178
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,210
my old injury will relapse.

179
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,900
Instead of

180
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,290
giving the pill to someone else,

181
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,500
I would rather...

182
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,370
Go.

183
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,850
Go get Bai Shan to me.

184
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,850
The smell of the pill came from ahead.

185
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,810
Let's go.

186
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,300
Bai Shan!

187
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,610
Stay back.

188
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,380
Here's the Spiritual Recovery Purple Pill.

189
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,540
Xiao Yan,

190
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,820
you come over alone.

191
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,180
Wait.

192
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,380
Han Feng set the formation, I assume.

193
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,610
Bai Shan is standing in the center.

194
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,460
This is a trap.

195
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,940
I have to go, anyway.

196
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,090
Later, I'll throw the pill out.

197
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,740
You have to catch it.

198
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,050
Bai Shan,

199
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,200
here I am.

200
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,460
The rest of you, freeze!

201
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,570
Bai Shan,

202
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,820
I know you hate me.

203
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,820
But Xun'er was your friend.

204
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,530
If you still have a conscience,

205
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,130
don't hurt her.

206
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,980
Shut up!

207
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,340
You don't get to lecture me.

208
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,010
Xun'er,

209
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,810
back off.

210
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,970
Listen to him. Don't follow me.

211
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,860
Bai Shan,

212
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,800
go back to the Academy with me.

213
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,770
Elder Su Qian

214
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,210
will give you a fair punishment.

215
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,900
No.

216
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,020
I'm not going back.

217
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,340
I can never go back there.

218
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,290
I know you hate me
for badly injuring you.

219
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,940
But it's not that you can't get back

220
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,090
what you lost.

221
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,850
Mr. Yao is the best alchemist

222
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,900
on Dou Qi Continent.

223
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,610
He can help you regain Dou Qi.

224
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,580
You're going to help me?

225
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,530
You destroyed my Dou Qi

226
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,410
and ruined everything I had!

227
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,580
And now, you stand here,

228
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,140
proudly saying you want to help me.

229
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,290
You make me sick.

230
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,970
So sick!

231
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,220
I know.

232
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,460
Without me,

233
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,610
you would be on the ranking.

234
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,840
You would be the first disciple

235
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,340
to enter Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.

236
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:43,940
But trust me.

237
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,460
I never meant to fight with you for this!

238
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,700
You know what, Xiao Yan?

239
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,500
This is what I hate you most.

240
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,410
You never cared about what you got

241
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,380
at Jia Nan Academy.

242
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,530
You easily got everything

243
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,290
and then abandoned it quickly.

244
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,380
You'll never understand.

245
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,210
What you didn't care about

246
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,140
and what you carelessly abandoned,

247
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,140
they were supposed to be mine!

248
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,850
They should belong to me!

249
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,700
You lost your Dou Qi, so what?

250
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,580
You've been talented since you were born.

251
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,290
For such little frustrations,
you just gave up.

252
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,980
I...

253
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,380
When I was 13,

254
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,970
I lost all my Dou Qi

255
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,410
and became a joke.

256
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,020
But I wasn't convinced.

257
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,700
I didn't give in.

258
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,140
I've come this far

259
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,260
after I was broken
and started all over again.

260
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,780
Bai Shan,

261
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,060
you can also do that.

262
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,370
Bai Shan.

263
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,290
If you're still a proud man,

264
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,170
go back with me.

265
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,210
When you regain your Dou Qi,

266
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,460
we'll have a fair competition.

267
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,540
Bai Shan.

268
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,250
Bai Shan.

269
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,490
Xiao Yan.

270
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,090
Protect our academy.

271
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,490
Bai Shan!

272
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,210
Bai Shan.

273
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,100
Xun'er...

274
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,220
What?

275
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,980
Take me

276
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,300
back to the Academy.

277
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,540
Take me back.

278
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,810
I will.

279
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,130
Let's get back.

280
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,220
Bai Shan!

281
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,610
Headmaster.

282
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,730
Elder Hao.

283
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,290
Bai Shan gave this to us before he died.

284
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,220
For his brother.

285
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,980
Boy,

286
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,700
it was so silly of you.

287
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,980
How could I explain to your brother?

288
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,860
He made some mistakes before.

289
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,220
But in Feng City,

290
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,900
he sacrificed himself to protect us.

291
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,180
He owes nothing to Jia Nan Academy.

292
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,020
Nobody is perfect.

293
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,340
Everyone makes mistakes.

294
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,420
It was brave of him

295
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,140
to fix his mistakes.

296
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,540
You know what?

297
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,340
Bai Shan used to say
he wanted to rank first

298
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,940
and be one of a kind at Jia Nan Academy.

299
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,820
Does the ranking

300
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,980
really matter that much to him?

301
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,580
To many of us,

302
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,100
this is where we grew up.

303
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,340
And this is our honor.

304
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,860
To Bai Shan, it means more.

305
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,140
His brother Bai Cheng ranks third.

306
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,900
Bai Shan always wanted

307
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,100
to overmatch his brother.

308
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,260
Then, when people talked about him,

309
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,020
they would not only call him
Bai Cheng's little brother.

310
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,940
Maybe his brother
only wanted him to be safe.

311
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,740
What did you say?

312
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,460
I said,

313
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,980
Bai Shan's brother

314
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,420
would be proud

315
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,340
of having him.

316
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,260
Has Black Submerged Army
got everything ready

317
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,340
in the Blackhorn Domain?

318
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,580
Since Han Feng escaped,

319
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,140
that domain has been unpopulated.

320
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,100
It's very quiet.

321
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,340
You can stay there

322
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,540
for some days

323
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,500
before you decide what to do.

324
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,860
Thank you for this, Xun'er.

325
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,180
But,

326
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,740
I'm still worried.

327
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,940
About Xiao Yan?

328
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,860
His clan has been in such big trouble.

329
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,460
He must be simmering

330
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,500
to fight Yun Shan.

331
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,060
I fear he may be too impatient

332
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,580
and fall into some traps.

333
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,780
But anyway,

334
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,340
as long as you're by his side,

335
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,300
when he fights someone and thinks of you,

336
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,020
he will know

337
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,500
that he can't die.

338
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,540
I know what you mean.

339
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,580
Don't worry.
I'll always be there for Xiao Yan.

340
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,940
Start your journey without concern.

341
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,460
Xiao Yan has conquered

342
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,740
the Fallen Heart Flame.

343
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,500
The problem of the Xiao Clan is over, too.

344
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,260
What are you going to do?

345
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,580
We don't know
if Xiao Yan's father is still alive.

346
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,660
How can that be over?

347
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,340
Are you saying

348
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,700
you'll go with Xiao Yan
to save his father?

349
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,740
I grew up in his family.

350
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,220
His father treated me as his daughter.

351
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,660
Before I see he's safe,

352
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,140
I will not be relieved.

353
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,980
I wrote back

354
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,940
about what happened here.

355
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,460
The patriarch ordered me

356
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,620
to take you back

357
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,220
within this month.

358
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,580
I can't help with this.

359
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,020
Why did you do that?

360
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,660
Xun'er,

361
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,960
you've been away from our clan
for a dozen years.

362
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,660
Have you thought

363
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,580
about how the patriarch
spent all these years?

364
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,940
I get it.

365
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,980
When the problem
of the Xiao Clan is over,

366
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,820
I will go back with you.

367
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,580
Mr. Yao,

368
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,660
the Spiritual Recovery Purple Pill.

369
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,420
Mr. Yao?

370
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,740
This isn't going to work.

371
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,260
Han Feng,

372
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,860
you have the guts!

373
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,420
Xiao Yan!

374
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,340
Open your eyes and see who I am!

375
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,980
Han Feng,

376
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,820
stop fooling me!

377
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,340
You have to kill your master

378
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,700
in my face.

379
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,460
Yao Chen,

380
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,700
you're destined to be betrayed

381
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,540
by your most trusted disciple.

382
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,140
Mr. Yao.

383
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,460
What's wrong, Mr. Yao?

384
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,820
Bad boy!

385
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,300
Han Feng poisoned the medicine

386
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,260
and made you lose your mind.

387
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,300
But how could you mistake me for him?

388
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,740
Did you keep cursing me or complaining

389
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,660
in your heart?

390
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,500
No, Mr. Yao. Never.

391
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,620
Come on.

392
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,180
Why do you always
assume the worst about people?

393
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,820
Oh, I see.

394
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,780
Because I took your Dou Qi, huh?

395
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,420
You're still vindictive and you hate me.

396
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,280
Why do I have

397
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,060
such a narrow-minded disciple?

398
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,780
Greetings, Master.

399
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,500
I'm your disciple from now on.

400
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,060
All right, then.

401
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,060
Get up. Come on.

402
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,500
Master,

403
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,220
when the Bone Spirit Cold Flame came out,

404
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,820
- I felt a little bit...
- Stop it.

405
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,140
Practice hard

406
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,060
and show me what you can do.

407
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,340
You won't deserve
the Bone Spirit Cold Flame until then.

408
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,900
Han Feng, darn it.

409
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,980
He tried to kill you so many times.

410
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,860
Once I see him again, I won't let him go!

411
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,260
Han Feng is hateful,

412
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,180
but he's a mere minion.

413
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,020
The Hall of Souls

414
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,260
that triggered his greediness

415
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,800
and instigated him to kill his master
is the worst enemy.

416
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,780
The Hall of Souls?

417
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,700
It was an evil organization
raging across the Central Plains.

418
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,340
They did anything to get power.

419
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,740
They horribly sucked Dou Qi
from Dou Practitioners

420
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,100
and it lasted a thousand years.

421
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,140
Fifty years ago,

422
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,540
their new leader Hun Miesheng emerged.

423
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,740
I led my sect to fight them alone
in the Central Plains.

424
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,420
When we were about to win,

425
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,500
Elder Mu Gu of the Hall of Souls
bribed Han Feng

426
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,900
to kill me unexpectedly.

427
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,300
Mu Gu?

428
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,140
Well,

429
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,780
he used to be my junior.

430
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,060
But in the end,

431
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,980
he was seduced
by Hun Miesheng's evil power

432
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,420
and joined the Hall of Souls.

433
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,980
Later, my disciple

434
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,220
worked for them, too.

435
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,260
Compared to wicked techniques,

436
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,340
how they bewitch people

437
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,900
can be the scariest.

438
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,060
Such a high-grade pill
is very rare in Jia Ma Empire.

439
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,820
I'm quite curious.

440
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,740
Where did you get it?

441
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,020
And why did you give it to me

442
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,020
instead of using it personally?

443
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,500
To be honest, Old Chief,

444
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,140
I was commissioned.

445
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,580
My master

446
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,380
asked me

447
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,340
to bring you the pill.

448
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,180
I won't take credit for what I can't do.

449
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,300
If you want something,

450
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,100
just be frank.

451
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,620
Don't worry, Old Chief.

452
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,300
To you,

453
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,180
it will bring no harm but benefit.

454
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,460
I just want to confirm one thing.

455
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,180
The patriarch of the Xiao Clan
in Wutan City,

456
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,540
Xiao Zhan.

457
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,860
Is he here?

458
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,940
What does he have to do with you?

459
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,820
Who are you?

460
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,820
Elder.

461
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,620
Chief Yun.

462
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,620
It's our own business
to deal with Xiao Zhan.

463
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,340
No one else is involved.

464
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,980
And to screw the Xiao Clan,

465
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,860
I don't need assistance.

466
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,660
Chief Yun,

467
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,740
work with me

468
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,020
and I'll help you to be a Dou Ancestor.

469
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,380
What do you say?

470
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,260
In the past dozen years, there hasn't been
a Dou Ancestor in Jia Ma Empire.

471
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,820
I've been having
closed-door cultivation for ten years,

472
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,020
but haven't worked out a solution.

473
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,100
Are you sure you can help me?

474
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,380
Chief Yun,

475
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,460
this is a big gift for you.

476
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,780
What do you say, Chief Yun?

477
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,260
Only we can give you

478
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,660
what you really want.

479
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,940
As long as you work with us,

480
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,100
the Xiao Clan will be nothing.

481
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,500
You can even rule the entire empire.

482
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,260
Give me more

483
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,900
and I will work for you.

484
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,780
(Xiao Zhan, Xiao Yan's father)

485
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,700
Green Lotus Core Flame,

486
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,740
go!

487
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,980
All right.

488
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,060
I'll try the Fallen Heart Flame.

489
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,100
Go!

490
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,540
Fallen Heart Flame,

491
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,540
