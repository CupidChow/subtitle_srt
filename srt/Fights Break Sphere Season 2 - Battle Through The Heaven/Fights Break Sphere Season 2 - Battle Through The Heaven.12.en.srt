=Episode 12=

19
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,470
Xiao Yan.

20
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,800
Why'd it have to be him?

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,640
Where's he?

22
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,270
It's not the deadline yet.

23
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,440
You're running out of time.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,630
He's already in the Demon Flame Valley.

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,680
So what're you waiting for?

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,190
He's got the flame,

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,080
while I get only one shot at this.

28
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,630
If he becomes wary,

29
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,110
I will have missed my chance.

30
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,800
My patience will be thin.

31
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,470
Take this bottle of elixir

32
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,320
and feed it to him.

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,670
His Dou Qi will be suppressed.

34
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,830
By then,

35
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,240
it's your killing time.

36
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,360
If you're interested in his stuff,

37
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,360
I can catch and bring him here.

38
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,910
It would be much easier.

39
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,190
He's my mortal enemy.

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,190
But for my serious injury,

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,880
I should have sent him to death by myself.

42
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,670
It seems like

43
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,190
you don't want him to die.

44
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,080
Why?

45
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,880
Is he your acquaintance?

46
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,520
If I kill him,

47
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,390
will you keep your promise
that you'd remove our poison?

48
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,110
After coming to this valley,

49
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,830
you have been relying on my antidote

50
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,080
to survive till today.

51
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,160
You're crystally clear

52
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,880
my elixir is the only solution

53
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,910
to your poison.

54
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,550
Killing Xiao Yan

55
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,670
is the last thing I do for you.

56
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,550
When it's finished,

57
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,360
remember to give us the antidote.

58
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,360
Have I ever betrayed my words?

59
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,390
But,

60
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,550
you'd better do your best.

61
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,160
If he's not killed,

62
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,240
Xie Shan and you

63
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,910
will have to spend your remaining life

64
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,880
in this secluded place.

65
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,320
It all depends on you.

66
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,160
A deal is a deal.

67
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,750
A desperate man is capable of everything.

68
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,880
Beg me now,

69
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,390
and I'll kindly inform Xiao Yan

70
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,920
of your last words.

71
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,160
What did you do to him?

72
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,910
I killed him.

73
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,560
You!

74
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,630
Stay still.

75
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,670
Otherwise, I might be too careless

76
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,550
to keep your throat bloodless.

77
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,720
Sounds bad, right?

78
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,550
Aren't you curious about

79
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,790
where Xiao Yan is?

80
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,270
You're targeting him.

81
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,950
If you have made it,

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,040
why bother chasing after me?

83
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,110
The only reason you have
is to make him helpless.

84
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,600
By then, you'll succeed

85
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,000
in killing him.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,600
Don't waste my time.

87
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,830
Calm down.

88
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,110
I'm not the only one wanna his life.

89
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,190
Who else?

90
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,270
It doesn't matter.

91
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm afraid he's already died of the poison.

92
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,790
Water.

93
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,950
Water.

94
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,190
Water.

95
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,110
Water.

96
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,950
Why am I here?

97
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,720
This is Demon Flame Valley.

98
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,740
You've been unconscious for a day and a night.

99
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,230
I'm an alchemist traveling to this place.

100
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,670
I took you here after finding you.

101
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,070
You saved me.

102
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,640
Dissolve it in the water and drink it.

103
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,360
It helps fight against the poison
of this valley.

104
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,000
If your Dou Qi recovers after dawn,

105
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,230
you'd better leave as soon as possible.

106
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,950
Thanks.

107
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,270
Have we met before?

108
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,040
No, we haven't.

109
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,600
You saved my life.

110
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,070
Please at least let me know
what you look like.

111
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
My identity and appearance

112
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,070
have nothing to do with you.

113
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,510
We're two strangers running into each other.

114
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,480
I just don't wanna see people dying
before my eyes.

115
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,480
Will you tell me your name
if I take this?

116
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,390
You will.

117
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,190
It's poisonous.

118
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Why're you here?

119
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,950
Without me,

120
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,350
you were dead now!

121
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,830
She's an accomplice of that scorpion lady!

122
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,270
She should have killed me last night
if she wanted to.

123
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
Why wait till now?

124
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,390
You lied to me!

125
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,950
You were not in a faint.

126
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,600
No, I didn't.

127
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,320
I did pass out.

128
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,790
But I remember your aura.

129
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,280
I know you,
even though your face is covered.

130
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,840
You know her?

131
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,040
Little Fairy Doctor,

132
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,590
I didn't expect to meet you again.

133
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,080
In the Magic Beast Mountain Range years ago,

134
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,320
I was badly hurt when taking the beast flame.

135
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,400
I came to the Lush Town

136
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,080
(Lush Town)
(Due to the plague,)

137
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,110
(no one in the town was willing to take me in.)

138
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,150
(I lay down on the ground,)

139
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
(with my blood drained out.)

140
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,790
(Then you came.)

141
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,280
(You saved me.)

142
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,440
I'm not the Little Fairy Doctor,

143
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,960
and neither did I go to the Lush Town.

144
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,400
You tried to kill me last night,

145
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,110
but why did you give up
after seeing my Storage Ring?

146
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,790
It's because you remembered me, isn't it?

147
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,750
She's right.

148
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,640
I'm a friend of Xie Shan.

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,760
I lured you here to kill you.

150
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,360
Get it?

151
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,080
Let me send you on the way to death!

152
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
You can't fool me.

153
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,790
The poisonous gas

154
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,000
is used to save lives.

155
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,030
Saving lives?

156
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,080
She's a Poison Master.

157
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,000
There are few such masters
on the Dou Qi Continent.

158
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,760
Without innate poison bodies,

159
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,910
even the top-notch alchemists
can't develop into Poison Masters.

160
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,800
Why is she able to?

161
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,760
She's got a special body.

162
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,670
Her blood can dissolve various poisons.

163
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,910
It's called Inborn Poison Body, or…

164
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,750
Enough.

165
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,680
She has

166
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,280
a Woeful Poison Body.

167
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,310
Yes.

168
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,350
Woeful Poison Woman, get out.

169
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,280
Woeful Poison Woman, get out.

170
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,590
Out, get out!

171
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,190
Get out!

172
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,160
Hold out.

173
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,790
Your injury has been cured.

174
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,200
Why do you come back?

175
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,110
I heard those people want to hurt you.

176
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,230
I'm worried. Here.

177
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,280
Leave me alone.

178
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,550
You saved my life.

179
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,400
How could I leave you alone?

180
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,440
I have the Woeful Poison Body,

181
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,840
so it's my fate.

182
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,470
You can't save me.

183
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,790
What do you mean by fate?

184
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,600
Every one of us

185
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,150
has a predestined way to live,

186
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,200
and a doomed way of death.

187
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,440
This is fate.

188
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,590
I have the Woeful Poison Body.

189
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,350
I'm fated to be born and die in woe.

190
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,880
I accept how my fate goes.

191
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,920
Who can determine

192
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,800
how one person lives

193
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,070
and how his or her life ends?

194
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,400
Even a bug strived to survive.

195
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,790
Your life is not up to those outside,

196
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,080
but to yourself.

197
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,590
You're practicing
in this Magic Beast Mountain Range.

198
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,880
You must be a Dou Practitioner.

199
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,510
Kind of.

200
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,040
Well,

201
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,440
kill me now and go out.

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,150
They won't hurt you.

203
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,200
I've never killed anybody.

204
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,520
As a Dou Practitioner,

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
you've never killed anybody?

206
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,760
I'm a doctor,

207
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,400
but I have killed others.

208
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,710
Since infant,

209
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,590
I was repelled by all the villagers

210
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,790
because of my Woeful Poison Body.

211
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,590
I was thought to be a demon by all,

212
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,280
except for my mother.

213
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,200
She took me to this Magic Beast Mountain Range

214
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,080
and cared for me every day.

215
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,440
She taught me curing and antidoting skills,

216
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
in the hope of

217
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,470
me becoming a doctor one day

218
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,200
and curing patients in Lush Town.

219
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,790
When I was ten,

220
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,110
the Woeful Poison Body activated.

221
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,520
I witnessed

222
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,760
my mother

223
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,150
being poisoned in front of me.

224
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,710
I asked her to leave,

225
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,480
but she refused.

226
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,400
She kept hugging me

227
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,230
until her body

228
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,320
cooled down

229
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,920
and she died.

230
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,880
I'm wondering

231
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,640
why.

232
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,000
Why am I still alive?

233
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,840
It's not your fault.

234
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,080
The Woeful Poison Body is dormant now.

235
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,470
If you can't keep yourself under control,

236
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,320
your mother would have died for nothing.

237
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,320
How I wish I was never born.

238
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,710
To live such an infamous life

239
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,280
is ridiculous as a joke.

240
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,550
You're right.

241
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,280
Why should you hide?

242
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,710
You did nothing wrong.

243
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,670
You should live upright and aboveboard

244
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,840
like them under the sun.

245
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,030
Once Woeful Poison Body attacks

246
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,150
everyone around will be poisoned,

247
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,990
without exception.

248
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,200
If you leave with me,

249
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,320
they will kill you too.

250
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,350
I don't want you to die.

251
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,110
I just want to show them

252
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,860
that I'm the exception.

253
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,100
Woeful Poison Woman

254
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,710
hurts all the people.

255
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,590
She's out. She's out.

256
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,350
Get bows and arrows prepared.

257
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,470
Is there anyone of you not saved by her?

258
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,470
Is there any one of your families
not saved by her?

259
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,120
If there is,

260
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:55,990
step out

261
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,790
and charge your arrow.

262
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,320
I will take it for her.

263
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,550
Go ahead!

264
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,910
Don't listen to the nonsense

265
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,750
of this outsider!

266
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,030
Woeful Poison Woman must be eradicated!

267
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,710
It's not her fault.

268
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,710
Around the world,

269
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,080
by no means will she be allowed

270
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,230
to stay in a single corner.

271
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,280
She shouldn't even be born.

272
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,750
Loose!

273
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,910
Little Fairy Doctor,
hide behind my back and don't be afraid.

274
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,510
Thank you.

275
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,080
You've done a lot.

276
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,880
I don't need it now.

277
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,480
Little Fairy Doctor.

278
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,600
Don't look at me.

279
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,190
Oh, no.

280
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,230
Woeful Poison Body is breaking out.

281
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,640
Run!

282
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,670
It's too late.

283
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,190
None of you can go anywhere.

284
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,520
Little Fairy Doctor,
keep yourself under control.

285
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,520
No.

286
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,800
Go to hell!

287
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,470
Why are you saving them?

288
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,070
I'm not saving them,

289
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,880
but you.

290
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,760
I hate all the people in this world.

291
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,060
I've done nothing wrong,

292
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,360
but I'm detested and cursed.

293
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,640
I'm just

294
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,930
a bit different from them.

295
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,530
Perhaps they don't see you through,

296
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,400
but I do.

297
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,000
The Little Fairy Doctor I know
is kind and caring.

298
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,950
Should hatred defeat you

299
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,190
and cause you to do this,

300
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,500
you'll be in pain forever.

301
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,660
It's too late.

302
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,540
Too late to stop it.

303
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,660
- If I had met you at an earlier time…
- No.

304
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,660
You can do it.

305
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,980
You can

306
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,740
control the Woeful Poison Body as you wish.

307
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,180
I will leave with you.

308
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,340
Let's leave here forever.

309
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,260
Let's go to a place
where there is no disappointment.

310
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,940
Please trust me, will you?

311
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,900
I have promised

312
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,420
even if everyone betrays you,

313
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,220
I'll be the exception.

314
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,900
Have you ever gone outside the Lush Town?

315
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,180
No.

316
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,460
Let's go down the mountain.

317
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,340
Why?

318
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,340
Leave this place and these people behind.

319
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,300
Try another lifestyle in the outside world.

320
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,660
The outside world?

321
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,460
Aren't you curious about

322
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,500
the outside world other than Lush Town?

323
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,380
Listen,

324
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,300
the Dou Qi Continent is large in territory.

325
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,540
There are endless mountains and rivers.

326
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,060
Some places are freezing cold.

327
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,780
Some are dry without rain for several years.

328
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,100
The sun never goes down there.

329
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,140
Really?

330
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,020
Yeah.

331
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,060
These are just examples I've been to.

332
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,620
There are more places

333
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,940
I've not been to.

334
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,580
The Jia Ma Empire might be tiny like an ant

335
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,180
in the Dou Qi Continent.

336
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,900
It's a pity
that I'm just a low-level alchemist.

337
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,180
And my Dou Qi is at the elementary level.

338
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,960
When I become a Grade III alchemist

339
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,700
several years later,

340
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,020
I'll rid you of the Woeful Poison Body.

341
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,260
Should anyone hurt you,

342
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,860
I'll beat him up for you.

343
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,940
You said you don't remember me.

344
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,580
Then do you remember this?

345
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,900
Where did you go
after leaving the Magic Beast Mountain Range?

346
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,540
Why are you here?

347
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,500
How are you?

348
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,180
None of your business.

349
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,900
- Little Fairy Doctor.
- Just leave.

350
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,020
It will be too late
if the Valley Master comes.

351
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,340
I knew it.

352
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,740
I knew you were forced by someone.

353
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,420
Who is the Valley Master?

354
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,900
Feng City Medicine Emperor.

355
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,020
You're not his match. Leave now.

356
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,860
Han Feng.

357
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,820
Why's he still alive?

358
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,860
What did he do to you?

359
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,980
Han Feng killed my father.

360
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,940
Take me to him.

361
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,500
I must tear him apart.

362
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,900
Don't you understand?

363
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,580
I'm not the Little Fairy Doctor
in the Lush Town anymore.

364
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,460
It's thanks to his elixirs these years that I…

365
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,460
Elixir.

366
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,020
It's the culprit of your poison tattoos.

367
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,620
Trust me. Han Feng is lying.

368
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,020
Stop.

369
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,740
Just go.

370
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,500
Please follow his words.

371
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,860
He's the one sincerely helping you.

372
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,420
He will help your friend as well.

373
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,700
Little Fairy Doctor.

374
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,940
Don't believe in what they say.

375
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,620
Your Woeful Poison Body
and my scorpion poison

376
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,900
can only be removed by the Valley Master.

377
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,380
We're close.

378
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,420
We'll be free when Xiao Yan dies.

379
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,420
Shut up.

380
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,340
I don't like threats.

381
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,060
Little Fairy Doctor,

382
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,020
we don't mean to hurt her.

383
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,220
I just want you to help me find Han Feng.

384
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,620
He's taking advantage of you.

385
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,700
I can take you away

386
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,220
and help you find the antidote.

387
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,980
You believed in me once,

388
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,300
so why don't you trust me again?

389
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,300
Are you willing to help us?

390
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,940
I said

391
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,780
I'm always the exception.

392
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,300
Alright,

393
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,740
prove it to us then.

394
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,300
Let Xie Shan go.

395
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,900
Let her go.

396
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,260
What're you doing this for?

397
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,260
I made an agreement with her that

398
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,460
we would leave Demon Flame Valley

399
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,020
to a place where we are not found

400
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,580
and not despised.

401
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,820
I can take you away.

402
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,620
You can take
the Little Fairy Doctor of Lush Town away,

403
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,260
but not me.

404
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,540
As she said,

405
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,220
let go of Xie Shan.

406
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,580
Xiao Yan,

407
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,660
I would rather

408
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,140
never have met you.

409
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,260
Let her go.

410
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,540
I knew it would happen.

411
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,620
She just didn't want me to see

412
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,620
how the poison affected her.

413
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,340
But I don't understand

414
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,940
why she won't trust me one more time.

415
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,660
It's because

416
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,060
you are different from her.

417
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,540
Han Feng.

418
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,260
That Han Feng again.

419
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,420
Stop staring.

420
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,140
She won't come back
no matter how hard you stare.

421
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,900
Instead of sitting here staring blankly,

422
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,060
it's better to confess honestly.

423
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,700
So I can be prepared in advance

424
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,380
when we encounter some little fairies again

425
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,100
in the future.

426
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,220
It's not her fault.

427
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,660
She's also the victim of Han Feng.

428
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,980
Xiao Yan.

429
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,140
Xiao Yan.

430
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,340
What's wrong? Are you OK?

431
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,960
This poisonous mist has a greater impact
on you than on me.

432
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,500
Even if we find Han Feng now,

433
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,560
we're not in the right condition to fight him.

434
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,500
Don't worry.

435
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,500
I've got this.

436
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,180
You!

437
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,620
It's not the time for joking.

438
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,940
Don't tell me you actually believe that

439
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,980
it can resist the poisonous mist.

440
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,260
I don't trust Han Feng,

441
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,920
but I have faith in Little Fairy Doctor.

442
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,140
Fine.

443
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,140
Go ahead and take it. I won't stop you.

444
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,260
You actually take it?

445
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,780
Xiao Yan, Xiao Yan, Xiao Yan.

446
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,420
Xiao Yan.

447
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,700
Are you OK?

448
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,940
I faked it.

449
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,700
Idiot.

450
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,460
Getting rid of the poisonous mist
is just a matter of time.

451
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,460
How can you trust her like that?

452
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,860
How do you know
it's not another trap set by Han Feng?

453
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,220
I don't know.

454
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,620
Perhaps, it's simply trust.

455
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,740
Even if you're poisoned to death this time,

456
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,900
I will no longer save you.

457
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,020
Bear your words in mind.

458
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,340
Don't… don't…

459
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,700
Stop it.

460
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,740
Get up. Stop your acting. Xiao Yan.

461
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,180
Xiao Yan.

462
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,700
Xiao Yan.

463
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,940
Xiao Yan.

464
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,660
Xiao Yan, don't scare me. Wake up.

465
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,180
Xiao Yan, it's not real, right?

466
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,460
Wake up, Xiao Yan.

467
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,020
Is he really that important to you?

468
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,260
Is he more important than your life?

469
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,900
Stop talking.

470
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,220
You need to have a rest now.

471
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,220
No need to.

472
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,780
How can you save me
if you don't even value your life?

473
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,140
My fate has been determined since birth.

474
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,820
No need to struggle anymore.

475
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,860
I saved you from the mercenaries back then

476
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,580
and brought you to this Demon Flame Valley.

477
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,440
For years,

478
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,260
we've been following the instructions
of the Master

479
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,640
in exchange for the antidote.

480
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,140
I know you have a kind heart.

481
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,780
That's why I took all the tasks

482
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,100
like seizing the Demon Core.

483
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,540
We have never made any mistakes.

484
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,340
Why did everything start to change
when you met Xiao Yan?

485
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,020
Is it because he helped you before?

486
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,580
What about me then?

487
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,380
I saved you not for you

488
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,700
to repay his favor with your life.

489
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,540
If you did it,

490
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,100
how can you repay me?

491
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,420
But for him,

492
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,300
I wouldn't have come
to the Demon Flame Valley alive.

493
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,220
I owe my life to both of you.

494
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,700
Killing my savers

495
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,900
to stay alive

496
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,860
is against my principles as a doctor.

497
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,420
You're not a doctor.

498
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,340
You're the Poison Woman.

499
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,380
You're my younger sister.

500
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,900
Xiao Yan was not born
with a poisonous body.

501
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,500
He won't understand your pain.

502
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,100
Clearly, we are of the same kind.

503
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,100
Sis,

504
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,100
if there's a chance,

505
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,980
I would sacrifice myself for you.

506
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,940
But I can't kill Xiao Yan

507
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,540
as you ask me to.

508
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,100
How come it's active again?

509
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,100
I'm going to ask the Valley Master
for medicine.

510
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,100
Sister.

511
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,460
Xiao Yan.

512
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,620
Xiao Yan.

513
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,340
Xiao Yan.

514
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,100
What's wrong? Why are you still unconscious?

515
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,980
Your Highness, I don't feel well.

516
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,340
What's happening to me?

517
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,700
From what I see, you're dying.

518
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,140
Speak out your last words.

519
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,060
Your Highness,

520
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,460
I must say

521
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,100
your pulse diagnosis is so inaccurate.

522
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,980
Alright, get up if you're not dead.

523
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,300
So inaccurate.

524
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,540
I told you
Little Fairy Doctor won't lie to me.

525
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,860
The elixir is useful.

526
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,060
So what?

527
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,460
You're just lucky.

528
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,980
How many lives do you have

529
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,940
to test all the medicines?

530
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,700
Your Highness,

531
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,260
you should take the medicine as well.

532
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,860
It's time to take action.

533
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,860
The smell here

534
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,500
is exactly the same
as that on Little Fairy Doctor.

535
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,420
Could it be herbs?

536
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,460
I'm afraid not.

537
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,700
Hope it's not what I'm thinking of.

538
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,260
Little Fairy Doctor.

539
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,300
