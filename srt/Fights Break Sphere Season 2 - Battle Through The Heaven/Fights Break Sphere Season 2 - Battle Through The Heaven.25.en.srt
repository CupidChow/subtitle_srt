19
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,580
(Top of the Fallen,
Headquarters of Hall of Souls)

20
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,600
I have opened the door
to the Ancient Relic.

21
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,720
In order to build a new formation,

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,390
I cannot leave.

23
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,950
You.

24
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,110
Go and bring the stuff back.

25
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,030
The long-awaited moment

26
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,670
is almost here.

27
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,220
(Ancient Relic)

28
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,440
Mr. Yao, you woke up!

29
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,720
Could you tell me

30
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,910
what else I can do to save you,

31
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,160
even a little clue?

32
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,160
Wind Sage.

33
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,000
Wind Sage.

34
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,200
Mr. Yao is still unconscious.

35
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,830
Could you tell me

36
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,320
what we can do?

37
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,910
I've been searching for suitable herbs

38
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,040
these past few days.

39
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,880
It's just that the efficacy
of existing medicine is too poor

40
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,110
to help Yao Chen recover his vitality.

41
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,070
There's no other way?

42
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,480
Only evil ones from the Hall of Souls.

43
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,600
Wind Sage.

44
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,950
Could it be

45
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,760
that Mr. Yao can never wake up?

46
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,600
Maybe

47
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,790
there is another way.

48
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,440
But

49
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,950
I'm afraid it's a hopeless hope.

50
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,190
What is that?

51
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
It is rumored that an Ancient Relic

52
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,920
has been opened in the Beast Region.

53
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,920
What is Ancient Relic?

54
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,950
Ancient Relic is a hidden space formed
by the death of an ancient powerhouse.

55
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,110
Inside the space, there are

56
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,190
Dou Techniques that once belonged
to those powerhouses,

57
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,570
and of course, numerous treasures

58
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,160
that have long been extinct.

59
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,600
If we could luckily find a medicinal herb

60
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,950
named Soul Infant Fruit in it,

61
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
it might be able to help Yao Chen
recover his vitality.

62
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,630
Okay.

63
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,910
I will set off immediately
to search for the Soul Infant Fruit.

64
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,760
Although the reappearance
of the Ancient Relic is a good thing,

65
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,880
the power that has been triggered

66
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,440
also deserves our attention.

67
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,600
I'm worried that it is related to the Hall of Souls.

68
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,110
Wind Sage, don't worry.

69
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,350
Now my Magic Poison Spot
has been removed.

70
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,230
Mu Gu of the Hall of Souls
has also been eliminated.

71
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,040
The Hall of Souls cannot do anything
for the time being.

72
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,950
Are you going to an interesting place?

73
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,320
Yes.

74
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,950
You're going after the Soul Infant Fruit?

75
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,720
How do you know?

76
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,720
Why don't you take me with you?

77
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,790
I have a good sense of smell.
I'm sure I can help you find it.

78
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,350
Sure.

79
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,320
Let's go then.

80
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,510
Dad.

81
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,310
Ancient Relic has not appeared
for a long time.

82
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,670
Now it has popped up.

83
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,760
This energy fluctuation is definitely related
to the Hall of Souls.

84
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,270
Please grant me permission
to find it out.

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,480
It's true that Ancient Relic
hasn't appeared for a long time,

86
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,480
but it's not that unusual.

87
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,040
What's more,

88
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,720
Black Submerged Army is seeking out
the remnants of the Hall of Souls,

89
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,440
and has no spare capacity for this.

90
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,830
If anything happens,

91
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,600
we'll look into it.

92
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,560
Right now,

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,160
you need to focus on practicing

94
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,830
to prepare for the bloodline awakening
on the coming-of-age ceremony.

95
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,110
That's the important thing.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,350
The Golden Emperor Burning Flame

97
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,550
will be left to you.

98
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,600
Cultivate hard.

99
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,670
Dad.

100
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,920
The Golden Emperor Burning Flame

101
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,550
is Gu Clan's Heavenly Flame
passed down from generation to generation.

102
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't dare to take it.

103
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,000
You're the heir of the Gu Clan.

104
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,440
So you are the master of it.

105
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,070
Why wouldn't you dare?

106
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,760
Xun'er.

107
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,070
This is only the first step
in cultivation.

108
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,710
To control
the Golden Emperor Burning Flame,

109
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,230
the cultivator should be loveless.

110
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,480
Just stay here and cultivate.

111
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,670
Forget about other clans.

112
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,720
I got it.

113
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,430
What?

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,940
Looks like you've got something else
on your mind.

115
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,400
I actually

116
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,670
felt my father's aura

117
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,790
from the Ancient Relic.

118
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,000
That's a good thing.

119
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,760
Maybe your father is in it.

120
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,390
But what if

121
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,960
he doesn't recognize me?

122
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,880
What if he forgets me?

123
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,350
How could a father

124
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,590
forget his daughter?

125
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,590
If he really forgets,

126
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,400
I'll beat him up for you.

127
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,670
If you dare to hit my father,

128
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,110
I'm not done with you.

129
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,360
That's right.

130
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,550
Remember what you said.

131
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,720
Keep it up.

132
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,720
Let's go.

133
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,870
Just put it here.

134
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,980
(Ancient Relic)

135
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,120
Mr. Fei.

136
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,640
It's getting late.

137
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,790
I'll leave now.

138
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,000
You should go home
and get some rest.

139
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,150
Yes, rest early.

140
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,880
- Rest early.
- Rest early.

141
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,800
Go.

142
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,520
Rest early.

143
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,470
Why are there so many people?

144
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,660
I'll just leave it here.

145
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,710
Why is Fei Tian here?

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,840
Easy.

147
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,590
If they find the Soul Infant Fruit,

148
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,280
we can just go and grab it.

149
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,590
If they find the way,

150
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,080
we'll just follow them.

151
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,720
It makes sense.

152
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,150
Master Fei.

153
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,640
You foxy Wind Thunder Hall.

154
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,940
You foxy Wind Thunder Hall.

155
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,400
You foxy Wind Thunder Hall.

156
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,550
Hush.

157
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,470
Didn't we agree

158
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,590
that we're an alliance?

159
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,150
We covered for you during the day.

160
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,880
What? Now you want to go in
without informing us?

161
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,400
Valley Master, you're just in time.

162
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,350
I just found
this underground entrance

163
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,150
and was about to send someone
to inform you.

164
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,720
Really?

165
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,650
Yes.

166
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,030
I would never believe you.

167
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,150
You must be trying
to leave out Ice River Valley.

168
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,590
You must be trying
to take this treasure all by yourself.

169
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,400
Valley Master, how come?

170
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,030
When did Wind Thunder Hall
ever do such a villainous thing?

171
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,200
Look at your sneaky behavior.

172
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,910
You just want to take it all
for yourself.

173
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,030
I really wanted to check it out first.

174
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,080
Why do you think I'm so nasty?

175
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,000
It's so beautiful here.

176
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,790
The owner of this relic is amazing.

177
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,960
His Dou Qi

178
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,910
can still maintain such a scene
after his death.

179
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,230
This way.
There's a strange fragrance.

180
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,990
Got it.

181
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,760
You have the best sense of smell.

182
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,760
The Soul Infant Fruit
really looks like a baby.

183
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,840
Take a try.

184
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,840
It doesn't work.

185
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,880
I don't believe I can't get it.

186
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,910
You're just a fruit!

187
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,710
I don't want you.

188
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,070
Let's go.

189
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,280
Zi Yan, are you okay?

190
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,440
It's just a fruit.

191
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,550
I'll take it away
and you can have another one.

192
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,550
Why are you doing this?

193
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,550
This fruit should be its child.

194
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,190
Let me try.

195
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,470
We came for the fruit

196
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,000
to save a man.

197
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,910
A good man.

198
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,710
You worked so hard

199
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,590
to raise your kid.

200
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,640
Surely you don't want it

201
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,840
to die in vain in this tomb

202
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,520
without any use, right?

203
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,950
I promise you.

204
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,440
As long as you can give us
the fruit,

205
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,080
I will replant its roots

206
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,280
so that it will spread throughout
the Continent.

207
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,070
Dad.

208
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,550
Zi Yan, I'm sorry

209
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
for making you sad again.

210
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,880
Xiao Yan.

211
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,470
I felt my father's aura.

212
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,920
It's over there.

213
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,030
Is my feeling wrong?

214
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,470
Your senses are never wrong.

215
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,990
The Clan Tattoo
of Ancient Dragon Tribe of Taixu.

216
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,880
My feeling is right.

217
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,840
My father must have set it up.

218
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,750
What's this?

219
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,670
What a powerful pressure!

220
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,280
Dad.

221
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,280
Who are you?

222
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,640
How can you open
the Dragon Emperor Seal?

223
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,280
Senior.

224
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,760
It seems you know what it is.

225
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,110
We might as well have a chat.

226
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,990
This thing may just be a treasure

227
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,030
in your hands.

228
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,800
But to this girl,

229
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,040
it's her only clue to finding her father.

230
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:08,910
Father?

231
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,190
Give it back to me.

232
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,000
Drakan.

233
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,350
You are my clansman?

234
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,190
Your Highness.

235
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,950
I, Hei Qing, deserve to die!

236
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,640
Senior, please get up.

237
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,070
Take your time.

238
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,400
What is

239
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,000
this fruit?

240
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,880
You said that Zi Yan is the Drakan.

241
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,040
What does that mean?

242
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,520
In the Ancient Dragon Tribe of Taixu,

243
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,560
when the Dragon Emperor perishes,

244
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,470
Demon Core will be transformed
into the Dragon Emperor Core Fruit,

245
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,110
and his power will be transformed
into a Beast Spirit Shield to guard it.

246
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,240
Only...

247
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,400
Only those of the closest bloodline

248
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,040
can open it.

249
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,920
So you mean this is

250
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,470
a Core Fruit?

251
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,110
Of whom?

252
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,110
Who perished here?

253
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,070
The Dragon Emperor
of the Ancient Dragon Tribe of Taixu.

254
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,880
Your father.

255
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,640
Your Highness.

256
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,350
Only the honorable bloodline
of Ancient Dragon of Taixu

257
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,110
can absorb
the Dragon Emperor Core Fruit.

258
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,190
This is the best proof
of your identity.

259
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,600
Dad.

260
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,670
Dad.

261
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,000
Dad.

262
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,480
Your Highness.

263
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,760
Come back to Dragon Island with me.

264
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,950
By refining
the Dragon Emperor Core Fruit,

265
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,760
you can break through to become
a true Ancient Dragon of Taixu.

266
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,000
By then, you will be able
to take on the mantle

267
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,830
of the former Dragon Emperor
and succeed the patriarch.

268
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,720
Zi Yan.

269
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,840
Go back.

270
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,900
There are still your families
on Dragon Island.

271
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,830
I will go back.

272
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,350
I also have to fulfill
my father's dying wish

273
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,560
and take care of my people.

274
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,070
The climate inside the relic
is independent of the outside world.

275
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,910
I'm afraid the seal of the relic
has been completely opened.

276
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,520
Come on, let's get out of here.

277
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,280
It's the Hall of Souls coming.

278
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,640
Such a sinister tactic.

279
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,880
The Hall of Souls?

280
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,350
Dragon Island is located
at the edge of the Central Plains.

281
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,870
You probably don't know
that the Hall of Souls has been revived.

282
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,880
There must be treasures

283
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,190
they are seeking in this relic.

284
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,230
Could it be that what
the Hall of Souls is looking for

285
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,630
is what my father
was looking for back then?

286
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,070
No matter what he's looking for,

287
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,000
I can't risk Your Highness.

288
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,350
- He is right.
- I...

289
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,000
Grandpa Hei Qing.

290
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,430
The Hall of Souls is treacherous,
and Dragon Island can't stay safe alone.

291
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,520
I can't just leave it alone.

292
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,070
Your Highness.

293
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,160
You're the noble Drakan.

294
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,430
You can't risk your life.

295
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,680
Please listen to me.

296
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,680
Come back with me.

297
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,520
I have to go.

298
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,400
My gosh.

299
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,560
The owner of this relic

300
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,000
seems to have collected
a lot of good stuff.

301
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,520
All of them are coming in now.

302
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,000
Now you're relieved?

303
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,680
You mean

304
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,950
I'm the one who released the news?

305
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,000
Who else could it be?

306
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,640
These two old men

307
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,190
came so soon.

308
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,640
It seems that the mechanism

309
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,760
should be in the middle
of the stone statue formation.

310
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,880
Not necessarily.

311
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,590
The owner of this relic
even hid the entrance.

312
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,640
He wouldn't put the treasure
in such an obvious place.

313
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,280
Didn't you just push your way in?

314
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,600
Look.

315
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,880
I'll let you go. After you.

316
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,110
I owe you a favor.

317
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,430
After you.

318
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,550
You go first when you're looking for the treasure.

319
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,760
And when there is a danger,
I go first?

320
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,760
What are you doing?

321
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,230
You want to fight me?

322
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,520
What fell?

323
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,840
Something fell!

324
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,360
Could it be a Dou Technique?

325
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,240
Dou Technique?

326
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,520
Really?

327
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,760
Dou Technique of Tian Class.

328
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,040
Dou Technique of Tian Class.

329
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,480
- Look.
- Look up there.

330
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,430
- It's right up there.
- It fell from up there.

331
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,360
There's something.

332
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,560
Is there something here?

333
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,720
The power is there.

334
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,110
All of them are Dou Techniques?

335
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,950
Really?

336
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,280
So many Dou Techniques.

337
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,000
Not only one scroll.

338
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,520
Hundreds and thousands of scrolls.

339
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,680
Dou Technique of Tian Class.

340
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,070
It is really a Dou Technique
of Tian Class.

341
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,800
This is also a Dou Technique
of Tian Class.

342
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,280
We made a fortune this time.

343
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,710
We made a fortune.

344
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,950
I came first.

345
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,640
I came first.

346
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,600
Dou Technique of Tian Class.

347
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,000
I got it first.

348
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,230
There are more.

349
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,110
Don't take it. It's mine.

350
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,000
It's mine.

351
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,070
Zi Yan.

352
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,900
Zi Yan.

353
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,070
Dou Technique of Tian Class.

354
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,760
I'll break your formation.

355
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,920
Let's see how you can
keep bewitching people.

356
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,830
Fire-splitting Wave-gnawing Ruler.

357
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,070
There are more.

358
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,680
All treasures are mine.

359
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,470
I made a fortune.

360
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,070
Mine.

361
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,270
Xiao Yan.

362
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,550
Zi Yan.

363
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,920
How come the Hall of Souls
is getting more and more petty,

364
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,400
doing nothing but bullying a kid?

365
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,800
I take back what I just said.

366
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,280
You can't even beat a kid.

367
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,350
Xiao Yan, it's sucking Dou Qi.

368
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,040
This relic is a trap for the Hall of Souls
to suck Dou Qi.

369
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,150
No.

370
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,290
The Soul Infant Fruit isn't a fake.

371
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,000
The one
who is sucking the Dou Qi

372
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
is the relic owner.

373
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,190
He must have killed my father.

374
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,880
Old man, are you the owner
of this relic?

375
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,950
Little girl.

376
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:19,230
You're quite capable
at such a young age.

377
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,040
You're not interested

378
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,310
in the Dou Techniques in my treasure?

379
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,430
I've long been dead.

380
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,190
This is all an illusion.

381
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,160
You can't kill me.

382
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,190
You can take

383
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,070
all the treasures here.

384
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,310
Do you like the pills?

385
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,880
What's the point of pestering me?

386
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,480
It's finally over.

387
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,560
I am leaving.

388
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,520
Are you okay?

389
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,110
He's the one who's up to no good.

390
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,590
Let me.

391
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,520
Old man.

392
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,320
Since you're dead,

393
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,910
why do you still
set up a formation to tease us?

394
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,360
You mean them?

395
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,800
It wasn't my formation
that got them,

396
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,680
it was their own inside demons.

397
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,440
Nonsense. You are deliberately
making things difficult.

398
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,870
Old man, do you know
about the Hall of Souls?

399
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,030
The Hall of Souls
has been designing for a long time

400
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,270
to use this formation
to reap the benefits.

401
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,200
I'm sure

402
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,110
you don't want to see the result

403
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,990
of the destruction of all beings.

404
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,560
It's not that I don't want to solve it,

405
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,990
but this formation

406
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,990
was set up before I died.

407
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,680
Unless...

408
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,630
Unless my old friend does this,

409
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,150
no one else can make it.

410
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,590
Old friend?

411
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,390
Good! You're all in this together!

412
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,630
Keep going.

413
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,750
Keep fighting!

414
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,320
Let's see who can win.

415
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,230
Interesting.

416
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,230
You are the daughter of that dragon.

417
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,200
What did you do to my father?

418
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,320
He's the most persistent man
in the world.

419
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,800
He couldn't give up his obsession
with treasures

420
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,080
no matter what.

421
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,080
Now that he's let go,

422
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,750
you'd better do the same.

423
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,680
My father didn't covet the treasure.

424
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,910
He did it for me

425
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,320
and our clan.

426
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,560
Heavenly Flame Triple Xuan Change.

427
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,710
Old man.

428
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,680
Is that you?

429
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,640
How are you?

430
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,440
Old man?

431
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,510
Do I look old?

432
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,560
I can't call you a brother.

433
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,110
You're really funny.

434
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,270
I've waited for you for so many years.

435
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,080
I heard the Drakan

436
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,990
call you Xiao Yan.

437
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,520
Yes.

438
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,440
I'm Xiao Yan.

439
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,150
Is it possible that the old friend
you're looking for

440
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,320
is an ancestor of the Xiao clan?

441
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,040
Clever.

442
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,920
Clever.

443
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,360
I was from the Ling Clan
among the Eight Ancient Clans.

444
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,800
When I was young,
I was so ambitious

445
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,080
that I soon broke through
to become a Dou Saint

446
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,080
and became famous
with your ancestor, Xiao Xuan.

447
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,800
So,

448
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,390
you are senior Dou Saint.

449
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,030
Back then,

450
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,600
I regarded myself as gifted.

451
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,270
In the world,

452
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,320
unless that Dou God was alive,
no one could reach me,

453
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,640
until

454
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,630
I met Xiao Xuan

455
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
and lost

456
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,360
to his Heavenly Flame Triple Xuan Change.

457
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
I set a date with Xiao Xuan
for a rematch.

458
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,270
In order to win over him

459
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,680
and pursue greater power,

460
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,200
I was so obsessed

461
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,680
that

462
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,230
I turned

463
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:48,840
my obsession

464
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,840
into a formation

465
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,800
to imprison myself

466
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,680
before I died.

467
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,520
Only

468
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,720
the reappearance
of a descendant of Xiao Xuan

469
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,360
can dissolve it.

470
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,630
Senior, you're here to seek revenge?

471
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,800
Senior Xiao Xuan is Senior Xiao Xuan.

472
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,800
I, Xiao Yan, am who I am.

473
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,270
These are two different things.

474
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,590
Winning or losing

475
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,160
means nothing to me

476
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,840
now.

477
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,920
Xiao Xuan

478
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,270
is a respectable opponent.

479
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,160
I just want to see him again.

480
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,710
I'm afraid that's a bit difficult.

481
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,640
What happened to him?

482
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,400
Senior Xiao Xuan
has long since fallen

483
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,510
