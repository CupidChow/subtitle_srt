(all living beings under the sky)

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,470

(Xiao Yan)

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,190
(he lost all his Dou Qi.)

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,180
(Young Xiao Yan)

41
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,240
(Xiao Yan, Dou Qi Stage Three.)

(Nalan Yanran,)

45
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,080
(Xiao Yan's fiancee,
and Misty Cloud Sect's young chief,)

46
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,520
(publicly annulled their engagement.)

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,630
(To wash away the family's shame,)

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,390
(Xiao Yan made a pact with her)

49
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,550
(for a battle at Misty Cloud Sect
three years later.)

50
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,830
(A mysterious figure)

51
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,470
(appeared from the Storage Ring
Xiao Yan was wearing.)

52
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,190
(He is the number one alchemist)

53
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,020
(on the Dou Qi Continent, Yao Chen.)

54
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,750
(Yao Chen)

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,520
(Xiao Yan traveled around,)

56
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,800
(not only taming)

57
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,030
(the 19th-ranked Heavenly Flame,
Green Lotus Core Flame,)

58
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,240
(but also defeating Nalan Yanran easily
three years later.)

59
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,630
(The only constant)

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,320
(in the world is change.)

61
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,940
(Hall of Misty Cloud Sect)
(Don't underestimate anybody!)

62
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,110
Nalan Yanran,

63
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,390
I, Xiao Yan, am back!

64
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,110
(Now, with greater power, Xiao Yan)

65
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,390
(is targeting his new goal,)

66
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,910
(Jia Nan Academy.)

67
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,140
(Jia Nan Academy)

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,040
Great moving technique.

69
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,720
Halt!

70
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,720
(Hu Jia, student of Jia Nan Academy)
What happened?

71
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,810
Someone's trying to intrude on the tower.

72
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,110
Go and find Wu Hao.

73
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,390
- Alright.
- Okay.

74
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,270
What a bold thief.

75
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,300
(Xiao Xun'er, student of Jia Nan Academy)
Who are you? How dare you intrude on the tower!

76
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,190
Wait, wait.

77
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,320
Xun'er.

78
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,670
I should have come earlier.

79
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,760
Xun... Xun'er, don't cry.

80
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,160
I've come back, haven't I?

81
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,880
Xiao Yan,

82
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,390
you really kept your promise and came back.

83
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,200
It's been two years.

84
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,070
How have you been?

85
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,880
I went to the Magic Beast Mountain Range,

86
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,520
attended the Alchemist's Grand Meeting,

87
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,350
then defeated Nalan Yanran at Misty Cloud Sect.

88
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,550
You fought against the entire sect alone,

89
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,160
and managed to escape from the hands
of a Dou Ancestor strongman in the end,

90
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,550
surprising everyone.

91
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,320
You... you already knew?

92
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,000
Xiao Yan,

93
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,920
I'm truly proud of you.

94
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,070
Xun'er,

95
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,600
is it you over there?

96
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,480
You came stealthily at night.
It's not easy to explain.

97
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,720
I'll go distract them.

98
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,720
Let's meet again tomorrow.

99
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,070
Xun...

100
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,030
Xun'er.

101
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,100
- Where is that thief?
- Where is he?

102
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,070
The thief?

103
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,920
I didn't see him.

104
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,270
I chased him all the way here,

105
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,640
but found nothing.

106
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
He must have been scared off
by the bell just now.

107
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,560
Hu Jia,

108
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,950
let's go back and rest.

109
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,160
I'm so tired.

110
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,150
Let's go.

111
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,000
Come on.

112
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,040
Let's go.

113
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,040
Young man,

114
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,760
be focused.

115
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,950
Let's get down to business.

116
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,790
This Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower
is indeed tricky.

117
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,880
It has strong barriers on all three layers.

118
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,480
Do you know

119
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,670
how long it's been since I last saw Xun'er?

120
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,000
One year and 363 days.

121
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,720
This Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower
must have treasures inside.

122
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,280
It's not a wasted trip.

123
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,790
You're not wasting your time.

124
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,320
I was telling you that

125
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,440
seeing Xun'er again is not easy.

126
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,480
And I promised her

127
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,790
to come back within two years.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,070
Didn't you just come back?

129
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,320
Didn't you already meet?

130
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,880
Mr. Yao, do you still have any emotions?

131
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,390
Do you know why Jia Nan Academy

132
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,880
is called the number one academy

133
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,510
in the Jia Ma Empire and even the world?

134
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,790
Of course,

135
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,180
it's because it has top-notch Dou Practitioners
from the Jia Ma Empire.

136
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,440
The reason it can
cultivate such Dou Practitioners

137
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,270
lies in this tower.

138
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,510
By obtaining the treasures inside,

139
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,580
when you go back to the Xiao Clan,

140
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,790
even the Misty Cloud Sect
won't be able to do anything to you.

141
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,230
With that Xun'er,

142
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,200
are you still using your brain
to consider what I said?

143
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,760
Mr. Yao, you...

144
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,600
Bear with it.

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If you're in a hurry,

146
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,200
find a way to get in yourself.

147
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,310
Mr. Yao!

148
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,270
Wait for me, Mr. Yao.

149
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,480
Mr. Yao!

150
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,790
Mr. Yao!

151
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,440
What's so hard about entering the tower?

152
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,100
(Storage Ring Space)
Winning the Grand Competition should do the trick.

153
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,390
Xun'er.

154
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,390
I've been looking for you everywhere.

155
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,640
What? You have something on your mind?

156
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,850
I'm thinking about the person
who came for the tower.

157
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,350
Who do you think it would be?

158
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,440
I told you before.

159
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,030
When those few stars align,

160
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,760
Xiao Yan will come to Jia Nan Academy.

161
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,080
After two years,

162
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,080
I want him to see

163
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,470
a better Xun'er than before.

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,840
Do you think

165
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,520
it might be Xiao Yan

166
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,710
who tried to intrude on the tower?

167
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,790
Let me ask you,

168
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,960
what exactly is the relationship

169
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,550
between you and Xiao Yan?

170
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,800
In childhood,

171
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,280
I was arranged by my father

172
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,840
to grow up in the Xiao Clan in Wutan City.

173
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,710
Although the Xiao Clan treated me well,

174
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,670
they were being polite and distant.

175
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,550
Only Xiao Yan

176
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,350
never treated me as an outsider,

177
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,710
always making me feel safe and happy.

178
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,790
Later...

179
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,280
What happened later?

180
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,640
Later, he encountered unexpected changes,

181
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
lost his Dou Qi,

182
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,280
and was called a waste.

183
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,400
But I always believed that

184
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,400
Xiao Yan would definitely rise again,

185
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,510
and

186
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,880
he indeed did.

187
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,470
What a moving story.

188
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,440
In fact, Xiao Yan

189
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,840
originally had the qualifications
to enter Jia Nan Academy.

190
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,000
The delayed enrollment

191
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,880
was to fulfill his

192
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,710
three-year agreement with Nalan Yanran.

193
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,200
Now that it's done,

194
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,190
he should

195
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,080
come back.

196
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,760
I, Xiao Yan from Wutan City, want to participate
in the Strong Ranking Grand Competition.

197
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,620
First,

198
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,420
you're not a student of Jia Nan Academy.

199
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,900
Second,

200
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,100
even if you become one,

201
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,660
there are many experts in Jia Nan Academy.

202
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,740
Do you think you can make it to the rankings?

203
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,060
I doubt you can even stay alive.

204
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,140
First, I'm not here to study,

205
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,460
and I don't need to be a student
of Jia Nan Academy.

206
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,740
Second,

207
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,100
bring those experts you talked about.

208
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,900
- But...
- Who dares to talk so arrogantly?

209
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,100
Bai Shan is here.

210
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,620
- Bai Shan.
- Bai Shan.

211
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,540
Talking big might cost you some price.

212
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,140
Bai Shan,

213
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,420
this is Xiao Yan who insists in

214
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,780
participating in the Grand Competition.

215
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,460
Isn't this a provocation?

216
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,780
You are Bai Shan?

217
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,500
Since you know who I am,
get out of here now.

218
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,280
I never heard of this name.

219
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,980
Why don't we have a spar outside?

220
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,580
Xiao Yan, right?

221
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,380
Want to join the Academy?

222
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,820
I'll teach you a lesson first.

223
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,300
Stop it.

224
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,220
Bai Shan,

225
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,860
the Academy strictly prohibits private fights.

226
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,620
What are you doing?

227
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,700
Headmaster, Elders.

228
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,780
This guy, Xiao Yan, lied that he is a student
of Jia Nan Academy,

229
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,260
and arrogantly talked about participating
in the Grand Competition.

230
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,380
He disturbed the Academy's rules.

231
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,420
I was about to teach him a lesson.

232
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,800
(Elder Hao, teacher of Jia Nan Academy)
You are Xiao Yan?

233
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,740
Yes, sir.

234
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,540
I have no other requests.

235
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,140
Just let me participate in
the Grand Competition.

236
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,500
This is simply outrageous.

237
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,620
So many people racked their brains

238
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,180
but couldn't get into the Jia Nan Academy.

239
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,380
And you just see this as a game?

240
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,420
Sir,

241
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,700
it's true that Xiao Yan was late,

242
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,820
but it's because there were family matters.

243
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,260
It was unavoidable.

244
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,220
Moreover,

245
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,260
hasn't Jia Nan Academy always claimed

246
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,180
to be open-minded

247
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,940
and value strength?

248
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,260
Xun'er,

249
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,220
why do you keep defending someone like him?

250
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,700
He's my brother.

251
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,220
Of course I'll defend him.

252
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,000
(Su Qian, headmaster of Jia Nan Academy)
Since he's an exception,

253
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,340
we need a special exam.

254
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,940
Let's

255
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,140
give him three tests.

256
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,580
Three tests?

257
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,860
Alright, no matter what the tests are,

258
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,740
I'll accept them.

259
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,620
Xiao Yan!

260
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,740
Xun'er,

261
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,140
I think he's embarrassing you.

262
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,580
Is that all?

263
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,380
Now, it's my turn.

264
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,260
Ba Ji Collapse.

265
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,860
For the last test,

266
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,100
it's quite simple.

267
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,380
No need for a match.

268
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,020
Throw a punch at me.

269
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,620
I want to see

270
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,780
how much strength is in that fist.

271
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,100
Wait,

272
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,820
if I throw a punch, won't it be offensive

273
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,780
regardless of its force?

274
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,260
Does that mean I lose anyway?

275
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,180
(Elder Hu Qian, teacher of Jia Nan Academy)

276
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,100
You are so young, how much strength
can you have?

277
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,740
Don't worry.

278
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,940
This time,

279
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,620
if you satisfy me with your punch,

280
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,260
I'll give you a fair judgment.

281
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,140
Come on,

282
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,100
punch me.

283
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,860
Ouch, it hurts.

284
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,940
Sir, you...

285
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,060
You are so powerful.

286
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,900
Sir,

287
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,340
are you okay?

288
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,740
Well,

289
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,220
you asked me to do this.

290
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,140
You can't go back on your word.

291
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,060
So, did I pass

292
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,700
the final test?

293
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,060
Can I attend the Grand Competition?

294
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,460
Yes, you can.

295
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,660
Now, I announce that from today onwards,

296
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,260
Xiao Yan is officially a student
of Jia Nan Academy,

297
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,020
qualified to compete with other students

298
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,620
for a spot on the Strong Ranking.

299
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,780
How could he?

300
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,740
Yeah.

301
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,620
Headmaster, Elders,

302
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,660
Xiao Yan

303
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,060
has only passed the additional tests.

304
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,180
Why is he allowed to attend
the Grand Competition?

305
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,980
- That's right.
- He's right.

306
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,320
- Why does he have the right?
- That's unfair.

307
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,100
And according to the rules,

308
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,270
he shouldn't even become

309
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,570
a formal student of our academy.

310
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,220
Blocking everyone else outside

311
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,340
is not what Jia Nan Academy would do.

312
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,940
In this Grand Competition,

313
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,220
if Xiao Yan

314
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,260
defeats the students

315
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,300
we've trained,

316
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,580
what will you say?

317
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,740
Listen carefully.

318
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,700
Competition leads to improvement.

319
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,220
Congratulations, Xiao Yan.

320
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,020
From now on,

321
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,460
like me, you're a student

322
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,140
of Jia Nan Academy.

323
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,060
Oh, by the way,

324
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,660
what should I pay attention to
in the Grand Competition?

325
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,140
I need to be fully prepared.

326
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,660
You got me.

327
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,740
Don't worry about that.

328
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,500
You finally made it into the Academy.

329
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,020
Shouldn't you take a look around first?

330
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,580
Xun'er, you're right.

331
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,260
Jia Nan Academy

332
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,300
is the most famous academy
on the Dou Qi Continent.

333
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,580
I can't come here for nothing.

334
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,900
The top ten students who win
the Strong Ranking Grand Competition

335
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,060
get to enter the Blazing Sky
Qi Refining Tower for refining.

336
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,060
Those who have potential
can swiftly raise their strength.

337
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,100
The competition consists of two rounds,

338
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,220
lasting for ten days.

339
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,780
All Inner Academy students
can participate.

340
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,980
Winners of the first round

341
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,940
will receive rewards
of methods and techniques

342
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,780
and enter the finals after ten days.

343
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,540
Mr. Yao, I can enter
the Strong Ranking Grand Competition.

344
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,460
Now you can tell me

345
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,860
about the treasure
at the bottom of the tower.

346
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,660
Just go in there and see for yourself.

347
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,860
Why don't you go out with me
to take a look?

348
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,300
Me going out?

349
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,100
Do you how much Dou Qi

350
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,820
it will cost me
to leave the Storage Ring?

351
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,580
If I perish by then,

352
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
who's there to take a look?

353
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,300
You won't go out

354
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,580
or tell me about it.

355
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,340
I'm not going to join
the Grand Competition.

356
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,300
For the three-year agreement,

357
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,380
you gave the Misty Cloud Sect
a hard time,

358
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,380
and Yun Shan threatened
to wipe out the entire Xiao Clan.

359
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,740
Are you planning to wait for death
and do nothing?

360
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,580
- You...
- All right.

361
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,740
Let's just hide in the Storage Ring
for the rest of our lives.

362
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,820
How is that?

363
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,420
I've never been a coward.

364
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,020
Although Yun Shan
is stronger than me now,

365
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,060
I'll still go to the Misty Cloud Sect.

366
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,780
Boy.

367
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,860
Your time here is not in vain.

368
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,620
After you get what's at the bottom
of the tower,

369
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,540
you'll have confidence
when you go to Misty Could Sect.

370
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,580
What's at the bottom of the tower?

371
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,180
The Fallen Heart Flame,

372
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,260
ranked fourteenth
on the Heavenly Flames Ranking.

373
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,220
Do you know now

374
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,540
what your mission is
at the Jia Nan Academy?

375
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,860
To subdue the Fallen Heart Flame?

376
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,860
Mr. Yao.

377
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,100
I remember you told me

378
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,140
that the Heavenly Flame
is the rarest power

379
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,340
on the Dou Qi Continent.

380
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,340
It's already a blessing

381
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,980
for ordinary people to have one.

382
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,540
Because of its violent nature,

383
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,300
if not used carefully,

384
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,660
it can lead to disaster.

385
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,180
But I already have
the Green Lotus Core Flame.

386
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,100
Can I still have the Fallen Heart Flame?

387
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,460
Why do you think I taught you
the Flame Mantra?

388
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,260
Does the Flame Mantra allow me
to possess two kinds of flames?

389
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,740
Three?

390
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,500
Legend has it
that since the beginning of time,

391
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,060
there are 23 different Heavenly Flames

392
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,340
across the Dou Qi Continent.

393
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,860
The so-called Flame Mantra

394
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,100
can burn the sky, devour the earth,

395
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,380
and subdue all Heavenly Flames
in the world.

396
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,220
Subdue all Heavenly Flames in the world?

397
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,420
Do you want to become stronger?

398
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,260
The Fallen Heart Flame.

399
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,940
I'll have it.

400
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,060
There are only two people

401
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,320
you need to be wary of in the Academy.

402
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,100
The first one is Hu Jia,

403
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,860
a mid-level Dou Grandmaster.

404
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,420
She excels in using a whip,

405
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,740
(and her agility is unmatched.)

406
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,700
(If her whip gets you,)

407
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,060
(you'll die or be seriously injured.)

408
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,580
The second person is Bai Shan,

409
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,300
a high-level Dou Grandmaster.

410
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,980
(As a prominent figure in the Academy
in recent years,)

411
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,620
(he has more than
just a flashy appearance.)

412
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,700
(His strength is also formidable.)

413
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,740
Are you listening to what I'm saying?

414
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,620
They're strong.

415
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,900
However,

416
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,340
you missed one person.

417
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,140
There's no one else.

418
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,700
She's right in front of me.

419
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,660
How can you forget about yourself?

420
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,860
You have an exceptional talent
in cultivation.

421
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,940
I know it better than anyone.

422
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,820
Now you're doing good
at the Jia Nan Academy,

423
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,980
your strength is surely no less than
that of a high-level Dou Grandmaster.

424
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,550
I think
you're the most outstanding Dou Practitioner

425
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,070
in the Jia Nan Academy.

426
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,620
(Heavenly Flames are destructive)

427
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,860
and rarely seen.

428
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,780
Even if you encounter one,

429
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,580
there's no guarantee
you can successfully subdue it.

430
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,390
Therefore,

431
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,140
choosing this path of Heavenly Flames

432
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,780
is choosing

433
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,220
a more difficult path.

434
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,460
I've always been able to endure hardship.

435
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,140
It's true that you can endure it,

436
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,900
but you're more like a gambler.

437
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,920
You're betting
that you'll encounter a Heavenly Flame

438
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,500
that would help you
evolve your Flame Mantra.

439
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,660
No pain, no gain.

440
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,180
What's more,

441
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,860
after I subdued
the Green Lotus Core Flame,

442
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,500
I felt that my Flame Mantra
had evolved as well.

443
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,060
Don't try to control it,

444
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,420
instead, sense it and follow it.

445
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,740
No,

446
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,820
the Green Lotus Core Flame
is disobedient.

447
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
It's not the Green Lotus Core Flame
that's disobedient.

448
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,260
It's your Dou Qi.

449
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,140
Dou Qi?

450
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,980
You've reached the critical moment
of breaking through to the Dou Spirit.

451
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,980
Really?

452
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,500
Of course.

453
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,980
However, the breakthrough

454
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,540
might happen tomorrow or next month.

455
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,820
But the Strong Ranking Grand Competition
won't wait for me.

456
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,580
Mr. Yao, do you have any other way?

457
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,780
Yes.

458
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,500
Practice hard.

459
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,300
Xun'er.

460
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,180
What's the matter?

461
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,620
I'll take you
to eat something delicious.

462
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,540
Let's go.

463
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,220
You still remember
I loved eating this when I was little.

464
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,220
Of course.

465
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,780
I also know

466
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,660
how you went to the Misty Could Sect

467
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,980
and ended the three-year agreement
with Nalan Yanran.

468
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,660
I just wanted her to know

469
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,860
that she shouldn't have humiliated
the Xiao Clan like that.

470
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,820
Now the feud is over.

471
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,340
I have nothing to do with her anymore.

472
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,730
But

473
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,580
will the Misty Cloud Sect let it go?

474
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,220
If the Misty Cloud Sect won't let it go,

475
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,580
I'll fight them to the end.

476
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,220
Don't be afraid.

477
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,860
If anyone dares to challenge you,

478
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,300
they have to win me first.

479
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,460
No way.

480
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,420
You're a girl, and I'm a boy.

481
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,460
Boys should protect girls.

482
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,460
Though you're a Dou Spirit,

483
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,620
I still want to protect you.

484
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,540
How do you know that?

485
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,100
I sensed your strength as a Dou Spirit

486
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,540
when we first met.

487
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,420
Xun'er!

488
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,580
Xun'er!

489
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,740
Why did it take you so long
to open the door?

490
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,500
You're not hiding someone
in your room, are you?

491
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,460
What are you talking about?

492
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,420
Don't you want to eat? Go ahead.

493
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,420
Why is there only one left?

494
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,980
It's not right.

495
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,100
I smelled something different outside.

496
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,620
How could it be?

497
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,100
It's the same smell, no mistake.

498
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,180
Xiao Yan!

499
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,460
Tell me.

500
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,300
What's your relationship?

501
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,780
- He's my brother.
- She's my sister.

502
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,660
This… This is for me!

503
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,980
- Who do you think will win, Bai or Xiao?
- I think...

504
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,850
- Of course, Bai Shan will win.
- We have to teach him a lesson.

505
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,350
- His Thunderbolt Dou Technique
- Am I right?

506
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,800
can end everything with one strike.

507
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,980
That was before.

508
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,050
Think about

509
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,420
how Xiao Yan passed three tests
and entered the Academy.

510
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,540
You all saw it with your own eyes.

511
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,540
Bai Shan only represents the past.

512
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,660
I think Xiao Yan
has a better chance of winning.

513
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,540
Is that so?

514
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,260
Stop.

515
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,780
Who do you think

516
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,300
will win now?

517
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,540
Bai Shan will win.

518
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,460
Bai Shan will win.

519
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,060
Come here.

520
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,700
Xiao Yan got enrolled in the Academy late

521
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,540
and has become a rising star
in the Jia Nan Academy.

522
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,900
Bai Shan, you've been overshadowed.

523
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,660
Xiao Yan just got enrolled by luck.

524
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,340
Just see how he will lose to me

525
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,780
in the first round
of the Grand Competition.

526
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,620
A genius?

527
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,700
That guy is weird.

528
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,900
He's also a Dou Master like us.

529
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,700
If we want him to lose
in the first round,

530
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,660
I think we should
make full use of the rules

531
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,620
and team up.

532
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,540
Count me out.

533
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,900
Why do you...

534
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,380
Xiao Yan has some strength.

535
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,860
I want to fight him one-on-one

536
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,180
and win him on my own.

537
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,180
- Fine.
- Count me out, too.

538
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,980
- Bai Shan.
- Because this time

539
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,900
I must defeat him myself.

540
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,220
No, no, no.

541
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,740
If we don't team up,
are you sure you can win?

542
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,780
No matter how powerful Xiao Yan is,
he's still a Dou Grandmaster.

543
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,840
As long as we break through
to Dou Spirit,

544
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,180
we're sure to win.

545
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,980
He has a shot.

546
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,660
Is it so funny?

547
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,020
No.

548
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,140
Cultivation can't be done so quickly.

549
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,820
Take your time.

550
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,020
This place is not good.

551
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,020
I'll go to somewhere else.

552
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,820
What to do?

553
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,180
Yeah.

554
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,460
- Well...
- Are you done?

555
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,500
Shan.

556
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,660
There's nothing we can do this time.

557
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,300
You've been murmuring for so long.
Now you're telling me you can't do it?

558
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,540
Shan, the Purple Heart...

559
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,700
The Purple Heart Barrier Breaking Pill
is a forbidden medicine.

560
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,460
I know you well.

561
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,860
All those elixirs, monster cores,
Dou Techniques, and secret skills

562
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,220
that can't be bought in many academies

563
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,100
come from you, right?

564
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,180
Well, why can't you get me

565
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,460
the Purple Heart Barrier Breaking Pill?

566
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,740
Shan, it's clearly written

567
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,300
on the list of forbidden medicines.

568
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,580
Once discovered,

569
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,540
we'll all be expelled.

570
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,700
Are you finished?

571
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,300
Go.

572
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,660
Go.

573
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,340
Don't expect me to help you again.

574
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,380
Why are you still here?

575
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,660
I...

576
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,420
I might have a way.

577
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,020
What can you do?

578
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,460
The Purple Heart Barrier Breaking Pill
is indeed forbidden,

579
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,740
and I dare not touch it.

580
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,860
Shan, if you really want it,

581
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,500
I can find someone outside.

582
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,220
It's not impossible.

583
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,540
It's just

584
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,380
that you have to meet them yourself...

585
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,260
Filled with Dou Qi.

586
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,820
The waning moon
is in the middle of the sky.

587
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,780
Six gold stripes.

588
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,820
The elixir is made.

589
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,060
Filled with Dou Qi.

590
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,660
The waning moon
is in the middle of the sky.

591
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,900
Six gold stripes.

592
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,660
The elixir is made.

593
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,980
Filled with Dou Qi.

594
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,140
One Purple Heart Barrier Breaking Pill,

595
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,500
requested by Bai Shan
of the Jia Nan Academy.

596
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,460
All right.

597
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,300
Don't call my name.

598
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,020
This is the Purple Heart
Barrier Breaking Pill.

599
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,180
Isn't it interesting?

600
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,460
Since Xun'er came here,

601
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,060
she had been with me every day.

602
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,180
But after this guy came...

603
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,480
Of course not.

604
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,390
They all came prepared.

605
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,660
The first round
of Strong Ranking Grand Competition

606
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,460
begins now.

607
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,300
Most of them are low-level Dou Grandmasters.

608
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,140
There are no more than
five high-level Dou Grandmasters.

609
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,060
Probably everyone
wants to avoid the strong ones

610
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,700
and save their strength.

611
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,620
Do you think I'm easy to defeat?

612
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,180
Today, I'll show you what I'm capable of.

613
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,460
Are you alright?

614
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,220
I'm fine.

615
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,540
You're finally willing
to fight in person.

616
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,220
Xiao Yan.

617
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,700
The match today

618
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,540
is only about you and me.

619
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,620
I want to ruin your chance

620
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,900
to enter the tower in front of everyone.

621
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,940
No matter what your purpose is,

622
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,500
today

623
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,860
is the end.

624
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,660
You're talking with your Dou Qi on.
How long can you last?

625
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,660
Jia.

626
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,920
What's wrong with Bai Shan today?

627
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,500
He's consuming his Dou Qi quickly.

628
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,540
Can he hold on?

629
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,980
He's been practicing hard for this day.

630
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,460
Xiao Yan will have to admit defeat.

631
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,580
No, something's wrong.

632
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,000
I'll go check it out.
Take care of yourself.

633
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,940
Xun'er.

634
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,260
We've never had a one-on-one match.

635
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,940
Don't mess around.
You're no match for me.

636
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,780
Let's try.

637
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,060
Don't cry out in pain if you lose.

638
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,340
Do you still want to fight?

639
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,620
Yes!

640
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,460
