=Episode 13=

19
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,230
Looks like

20
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,830
someone's been breeding
these poisons.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,080
It's more than that.

22
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,310
This…

23
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,190
This is Snake People's scale.

24
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Han Feng!

25
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,360
Hold on.

26
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,880
Don't alarm him.

27
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,670
Let's go back first.

28
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,720
We need to settle the score

29
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,520
with Han Feng.

30
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,320
Actually, I came out this time

31
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,160
to investigate the disappearance
of our clansmen of Serpent Kingdom.

32
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,000
I tracked down
a couple of mercenary groups.

33
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,310
All I knew was

34
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,160
that they did sell Snake People,

35
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,470
but were always being looted
by a third party.

36
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,550
Then I heard about you

37
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,910
and thought about investigating it

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,880
while searching for you.

39
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,000
Eventually, I caught up
with you here.

40
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,320
I should have known.

41
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,520
Mutilating my people

42
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,630
is for use in pill refining.

43
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,880
Who else but Han Feng

44
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,670
could be such a cruel
and dirty alchemist?

45
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,790
Using Snake People's Demon Core
to make medicine

46
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,670
can dramatically
restore one's power.

47
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,600
Han Feng was seriously injured
by me

48
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,880
and abandoned by the Hall of Souls,

49
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,510
so he killed Snake People
to heal himself.

50
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,790
Your Highness.

51
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,950
Why didn't you tell me about this?

52
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,600
What's the use of telling you?

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,640
Little Fairy Doctor and Xie Shan
have much to do with it.

54
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,790
You still can't do anything about it.

55
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,060
I shouldn't have let them go

56
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,160
just now.

57
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,390
Your Highness.

58
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,600
Calm down.

59
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,320
Han Feng
is the enemy to us.

60
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,440
Little Fairy Doctor and Xie Shan

61
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,070
are nothing more than
Han Feng's victims,

62
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
the same as those Snake People
who were killed.

63
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,640
We need to figure out

64
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,600
what this is for now.

65
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,070
The antidote that Han Feng
gave Little Fairy Doctor for her Poison Body

66
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,950
should have something to do
with this poisonous insect.

67
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,070
As long as I find evidence

68
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,640
to convince Little Fairy Doctor
to fight against Han Feng with us,

69
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,200
we'll have one more chance
to win.

70
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,880
You and I are more than capable

71
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,720
of dealing with Han Feng.

72
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,230
Why should we do that?

73
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,440
Han Feng killed my father

74
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,390
and hurt my master.

75
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,760
Trust me.

76
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,200
I hate him more than you do.

77
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,670
But I lost my father in the battle

78
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,160
in the Misty Cloud Sect.

79
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,160
So

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,920
I don't want to lose any more friends.

81
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,950
Little Fairy Doctor and Xie Shan

82
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,720
still believe in Han Feng.

83
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,830
A tough duel with him

84
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,110
will only hurt innocent people.

85
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,720
This poisonous insect looks odd.

86
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,760
I think I've seen it

87
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,830
on a poison refiner before.

88
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,420
Oh,

89
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,640
why don't you go to the Storage Ring
and look for it?

90
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,760
Although poison refiners and alchemists
are different,

91
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,920
the essence is refining.

92
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,640
Maybe Mr. Yao's ancient books
will have a record of it.

93
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,200
Greetings to Valley Master.

94
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,950
Is Xiao Yan still alive?

95
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,390
Yes.

96
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,720
He's very cunning.

97
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
But don't worry, Master.

98
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,880
We will solve this as soon as possible.

99
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,510
It's just a matter of time.

100
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,950
Then what are you doing here?

101
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,200
This is the newest Demon Core
of Snake People we just got,

102
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,920
whose quality is better
than any we've ever had.

103
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,920
My sister's in poor condition.

104
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,320
The pills given earlier
have all been consumed.

105
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,550
Please release her
from the Woeful Poison Body.

106
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,790
Xie Shan.

107
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,390
Don't forget

108
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,160
who took you in back then

109
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,350
and who gave you

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,110
the inexhaustible supply of elixirs.

111
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,480
Don't be greedy.

112
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,320
I'll never

113
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,830
forget your favor.

114
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,350
Don't mess me about.

115
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,640
Tell me the truth.

116
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,440
What is the relationship

117
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,440
between the Heavenly Poison Lady
and Xiao Yan?

118
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,440
Master, it's not
that my sister is incompetent.

119
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,000
It was Xiao Yan
who had favored her

120
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,440
and compelled her
to leave with him

121
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,720
with subtle words and evasions.

122
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,880
I see.

123
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
I didn't expect
the Heavenly Poison Lady

124
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,920
to be sentient.

125
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,280
Then, has Xiao Yan

126
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,400
ever been wary of her?

127
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,480
Never.

128
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,550
Master.

129
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,150
This is the last book.

130
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,840
Please help me.

131
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,350
Bodhisattva Saliva.

132
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,230
Bodhisattva Saliva

133
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,640
can curb the Woeful Poison Body.

134
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,590
But where can I find
the ancient Bodhi tree?

135
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,990
Master.

136
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,480
What would you do

137
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,590
if you were me?

138
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,480
You brat.

139
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,400
You're trying to melt the tripod
with this much fire?

140
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,630
Go ahead.

141
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,500
Mr. Yao.

142
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,960
Why don't you just tell me
how to make it?

143
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,200
There are millions of elixirs
in the world.

144
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,880
I can teach you a hundred,

145
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,000
but I can't teach you all of them.

146
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,840
There are no shortcuts,

147
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,150
only continuous experimentation.

148
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,600
Keep refining.

149
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,400
I don't believe I can't make it.

150
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,110
(There are no shortcuts.)

151
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,550
(Then just try.)

152
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,400
Whether it's to make medicine
or poison,

153
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,110
try it first.

154
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,310
How's it going?

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Looks like you failed.

156
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,760
I've refined the poisonous insect.

157
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,070
Really?

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Then why do you look like this?

159
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,230
Poisonous insects are
a hundred times more powerful

160
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,790
than poisonous herbs
in making poisons.

161
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,000
Poison Body relies on taking poison
to strengthen feats.

162
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,510
That means

163
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,800
this stuff

164
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,910
stimulates Woeful Poison Body
to outbreak even more.

165
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,520
It's not an antidote at all,

166
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,640
but a poison.

167
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,400
You mean Han Feng

168
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,000
is stimulating Little Fairy Doctor's
Woeful Poison Body to erupt?

169
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,720
Yes.

170
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,910
He's using Little Fairy Doctor

171
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,000
not only to deal with me,

172
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,440
but also to promote himself.

173
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,400
Han Feng was prepared for this.

174
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,000
He's probably already set a trap
for you to jump into.

175
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,590
Then I'll jump.

176
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,710
I just said you've grown a bit.

177
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,840
Otherwise, I wouldn't be Xiao Yan.

178
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm not only going to jump today,

179
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,640
I'm going to pound the trap
to pieces.

180
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,110
I'll make Han Feng pay in blood.

181
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,320
As people with Poison Body,

182
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,440
no matter how many good deeds we do
and how many people we save,

183
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
we can't change the public's opinions
of us.

184
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,510
Fine.

185
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,440
I'll do that you can't do,

186
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,470
for you.

187
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,030
Woeful Poison Body

188
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,350
is finally going to break out.

189
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,800
Valley Master.

190
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,000
Kill me directly.

191
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,580
Hush.

192
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,000
I'll free you right away.

193
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,790
It really works.

194
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,960
The two of you.

195
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,230
Good to see you!

196
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,750
Little Fairy Doctor.

197
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,640
I knew you'd come.

198
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,870
Listen to me.

199
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,780
The antidote from Han Feng…

200
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,630
Stop it.

201
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,320
I thought about it when I got back.

202
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,870
I believe you.

203
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,520
Aren't you looking for Han Feng?

204
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,150
I'll take you to him now.

205
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,430
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,520
I never got to apologize

207
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,320
for what happened
in the Magic Beast Mountain Range.

208
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,080
I was over that

209
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,710
a long time ago.

210
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,840
If I hadn't told the villagers

211
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,200
that you had poison tattoos,

212
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,230
your identity wouldn't
have been exposed

213
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,790
and they wouldn't
have been after you.

214
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,550
I don't care anymore.

215
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,310
Really?

216
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,430
Xiao Yan.

217
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,760
Yesterday you said you would help me
with Woeful Poison Body.

218
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
You weren't just saying that,
were you?

219
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,550
Have I ever lied to you?

220
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,920
That's good.

221
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,070
By the way,

222
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,280
I told you before

223
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,590
that my master is Dou Qi Continent's

224
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,640
number one alchemist.

225
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,360
Last night,

226
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,080
I found out from inside his Pill Volume

227
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,910
that only Bodhisattva Saliva

228
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,280
can truly curb the eruption
of the Woeful Poison Body.

229
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,550
So…

230
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,000
Xie Shan, you finally exposed yourself.

231
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,190
You knew I wasn't Little Fairy Doctor.

232
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,350
Why don't you make it look real?

233
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,230
Get it through your head.

234
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,520
If I had really told the villagers

235
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,560
about Little Fairy Doctor's identity,

236
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,310
I wouldn't be her friend.

237
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,160
So what if you found out?

238
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,950
We're already here.

239
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,350
I'll see how you can escape.

240
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,550
Xie Shan.

241
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,880
I really don't understand you.

242
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,000
Tell me.

243
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,920
What is it about Han Feng

244
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,430
that makes you so loyal to him?

245
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,000
Our Valley Master is Medicine Emperor,

246
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,110
a supreme alchemist.

247
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,760
Only he can
solve the Woeful Poison Body.

248
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,400
Xie Shan.

249
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,310
You're no match for me.

250
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,800
I'll show you the truth.

251
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,280
How did you get
the same elixir as the Valley Master's?

252
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,830
It's not an elixir at all.

253
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,280
The elixir made
by this poisonous insect

254
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,470
is a hundred times stronger

255
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,560
than the elixir made
by poisonous herbs.

256
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,520
Short-term use may make you feel
the Poison Body is relieved,

257
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,310
but it's actually the culprit
that induces the Poison Body.

258
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,400
Poison Bodies thrive on poison.

259
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
This proves nothing.

260
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,790
You have a Poison Body too.

261
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,000
You should know better than me

262
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,280
what happens when you take poison
for a long time.

263
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,070
Your Valley Master is lying to you.

264
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,680
Nonsense.

265
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,310
Our Valley Master
is the Medicine Emperor.

266
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,070
He must have taken out the part
that triggered the Poison Body outbreak.

267
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,000
Xie Shan.

268
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,350
You're so naive and ridiculous.

269
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,280
Don't! You'll die!

270
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,190
I have to kill you today.

271
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,800
- The Gold Silver Brothers escaped.
- Go after them!

272
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,070
Xiao Yan.

273
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,110
I won't let you go

274
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,120
unless I'm dead.

275
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,360
Xie Shan.

276
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,000
Han Feng killed my father.

277
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,230
I won't let him go.

278
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
But I don't want you involved.

279
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,160
The poison Han Feng used
on Little Fairy Doctor

280
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,920
was to strengthen himself

281
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,880
so he could come against me.

282
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,560
Little Fairy Doctor is now in danger.

283
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,160
If you really care about her,

284
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,590
hurry up and save her.

285
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,640
Or it'll be too late.

286
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,520
What's the panic?

287
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,550
Han Feng.

288
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,640
I finally found you.

289
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,670
Be careful!

290
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,360
Xiao Yan.

291
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,830
Things are different now.

292
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,640
I'm not the Han Feng I was then.

293
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,040
Don't you realize that?

294
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,830
Thanks to this girl,

295
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,710
my wounds have healed.

296
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,950
Her power is like nothing

297
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,470
you can imagine.

298
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,520
The powers of the two of them
have fused into one.

299
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,070
It'll be dangerous to act rashly now.

300
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,950
I couldn't care less.

301
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,520
If he finishes the refining,

302
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,480
he will become stronger

303
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,040
and Little Fairy Doctor will die.

304
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,240
Xiao Yan.

305
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,230
Han Feng.

306
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,600
(Little Fairy Doctor.)

307
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,680
Xiao Yan, come back.

308
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,190
How is it?

309
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,350
How does

310
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,230
the poisonous gas feel?

311
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,430
(Little Fairy Doctor.)

312
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,880
Xiao Yan.

313
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,550
Xiao Yan.

314
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,150
Xiao Yan.

315
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,640
The two of you

316
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,070
are still working so hard
at your age.

317
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,230
If you want to die,
just let me know.

318
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,350
Keep your eyes open

319
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,830
for what your Valley Master
is doing.

320
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,310
Valley Master.

321
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,280
Xiao Yan has been captured.

322
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,280
Little Fairy Doctor was saved.

323
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,280
Thank you, Valley Master,
for saving her life.

324
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,110
You Black Scorpion,
can't you see?

325
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,040
The one refined
is your Little Fairy Doctor.

326
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,560
In a few moments,
she'll be reduced to ashes.

327
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,640
So hopeless.

328
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,680
Don't worry.

329
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,470
She'll soon be one with me

330
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,400
and become immortal.

331
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,840
Han Feng.

332
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,680
You've rebelled against orthodoxy,

333
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,400
defected to the Hall of Souls,

334
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,800
killed my father

335
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,590
and hurt my master.

336
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,230
Now you hurt my friend.

337
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,350
Let's settle old scores

338
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,710
and new ones together.

339
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,150
Wrong.

340
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,190
Don't accuse me in a big way.

341
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,590
The Dou Qi Continent
has always honored the strong.

342
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,790
Power

343
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,480
is the orthodoxy.

344
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,280
I'm in the company of the strong.

345
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,190
How could I have
rebelled against orthodoxy?

346
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,920
Think about it carefully.

347
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,000
Why

348
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,840
are your family

349
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,280
and friends

350
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,520
dying of injuries?

351
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,350
It is all because of you.

352
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,710
It's always been because of you.

353
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,710
Don't listen to him.

354
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,110
Isn't it?

355
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,640
The Xiao Family

356
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,680
is feuding with the Misty Cloud Sect
because of you.

357
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,430
Your father died because of you.

358
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,310
Yao Chen came out because of you too.

359
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,830
Little Fairy Doctor

360
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,590
won't be used by me today

361
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,680
if she is not acquainted with you.

362
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,800
It's all your fault!

363
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,560
Don't listen to him!

364
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,480
Han Feng.

365
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,950
You're just a pawn abandoned

366
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,350
by the Hall of Souls.

367
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,230
Why do you speak out
in front of me?

368
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,880
You've done everything you can

369
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,710
to gain power shamelessly.

370
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,430
In the end, you got nothing.

371
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,880
The only thing you didn't see

372
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,680
was meeting me.

373
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,190
Xiao Yan.

374
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,280
Did you think you could
break my formation so easily?

375
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,800
I'll make you

376
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,190
pay in blood today.

377
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,280
Xiao Yan!

378
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,000
Xie Shan!

379
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,330
Hurry up!

380
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,190
Deal with Xiao Yan.

381
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,350
Little Fairy Doctor's Poison Body
will be removed soon.

382
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,800
Don't believe him!

383
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,520
Sister.

384
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,480
Don't worry!

385
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,710
Your Woeful Poison Body
will soon be relieved.

386
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,950
Xie Shan.

387
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,430
You still don't get it.

388
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,520
Han Feng built this formation

389
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,070
to refine Little Fairy Doctor
to enhance himself.

390
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,310
Little Fairy Doctor will die
if he continues.

391
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,550
Xie Shan.

392
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,560
Xie Shan. Sister, no!

393
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,040
You want me to let him go?

394
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,270
Yes.

395
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,520
If

396
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,640
I let him go,

397
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,470
will you stay with me?

398
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,120
You are lying.

399
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,560
If I let him go, you'll die.

400
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,710
How are you going
to stay by my side?

401
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,760
(Heavenly Flames cannot be used.)

402
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,640
Sister.

403
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,560
Xiao Yan isn't the enemy.

404
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,350
Han Feng is.

405
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,760
Xie Shan.

406
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,910
Do it now.

407
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,590
No.

408
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,590
You'll get yourself killed!

409
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,070
You'll get Little Fairy Doctor killed!

410
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,670
Sister.

411
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,400
Heavenly Poison Prison Cell.

412
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,950
Xiao Yan, go!

413
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,110
I won't leave you alone.

414
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,150
Xiao Yan!

415
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,040
I'm going to show you

416
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
how Little Fairy Doctor died,

417
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,400
just like when your father died.

418
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,310
I'll let you see

419
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
the people you care about

420
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,520
die one by one in front of you.

421
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,520
I can't believe
I really misjudged you.

422
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,000
Don't court death.

423
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,830
Seal of Light.

424
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,950
Sister!

425
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,150
Little Fairy Doctor.

426
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,520
Stay alive.

427
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,400
Sister.

428
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,110
Sister, let's go together.

429
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,760
Let's go together.

430
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,720
No!

431
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,910
Sister!

432
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,950
Xie Shan!

433
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,480
Sister!

434
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,430
Sister!

435
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,790
Sister!

436
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,000
Sister!

437
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,880
Let's go. I'm taking you out.

438
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,070
I'm taking you out.

439
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,950
Sister, let's go.

440
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,070
Little Fairy Doctor.

441
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,640
Take care of yourself

442
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,760
when I'm not around.

443
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,790
Sister!

444
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,480
Sister!

445
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,430
Fire-splitting Wave-gnawing Ruler.

446
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,000
(Father.)

447
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,070
(I've avenged your death.)

448
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,910
Little Fairy Doctor.

449
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,800
You've lost too much Dou Qi.

450
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,920
Get some rest first.

451
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,720
Don't think too much.

452
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,230
Han Feng is dead.

453
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,950
No one can threaten you anymore.

454
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Come back with us.

455
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,350
I can help you find Bodhisattva Saliva

456
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,800
to suppress your Poison Body.

457
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,160
Sister is dead.

458
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,800
I have nowhere else to go.

459
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,950
What to do now?

460
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,800
With her of a Woeful Poison Body,

461
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,760
you decide not to go
to the Central Plains?

462
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,030
We'll go back to the Academy.

463
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,950
I knew it.

464
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,920
Never mind.

465
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,640
Your Highness.

466
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,630
Right now Little Fairy Doctor's
situation is not very stable.

467
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,190
I want to go back to the Academy first
to ask for the elders' help.

468
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,040
Perhaps they know the whereabouts
of the Bodhisattva Saliva.

469
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,840
Secondly,

470
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,870
Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower

471
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,320
can block the poisonous gas
that Little Fairy Doctor can't control.

472
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,360
If we leave her alone,

473
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,760
once her Woeful Poison Body
breaks out,

474
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,040
it will spill over
to many innocent lives.

475
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,190
Does it have anything to do
with me?

476
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,800
No.

477
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,760
You've found out the truth
of the loss of Snake People.

478
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,840
If you want to leave,

479
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,510
I won't stop you.

480
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,520
- You still owe me…
- Elixirs.

481
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,510
I knew it.

482
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,870
If we can find the Bodhisattva Saliva,

483
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,560
will it be a problem
to get the best elixirs?
