19
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,140
Fallen Heart Flame.

20
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,060
Go!

21
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,820
No wonder the Fallen Heart Flame

22
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,500
ranks five places higher

23
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,780
than the Green Lotus Core Flame.

24
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,690
Its power is extraordinary.

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,780
But the Fallen Heart Flame
is not as easy as

26
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,010
the Green Lotus Core Flame to control.

27
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,340
Don't worry.

28
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,820
Xiao Yan, it's only been a few days

29
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,300
since you conquered
the Fallen Heart Flame.

30
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,370
You're doing great.

31
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,100
Heavenly Flames consume Dou Qi.

32
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,450
With more Dou Qi,

33
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,440
the Dou Practitioner can get stronger

34
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,170
and better utilize the power
of Heavenly Flames.

35
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,860
But

36
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,810
I'm a low-level Dou King.

37
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,060
I'm afraid I can't fully unleash
the power of Heavenly Flames.

38
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,580
Yun Shan is a peak-level Dou Emperor.

39
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,580
You and I are both Dou Kings.

40
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,450
Together with these two Heavenly Flames,

41
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,060
we stand a chance.

42
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,530
Mr. Yao.

43
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,660
I'm recovering my Dou Qi

44
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,220
a lot faster than earlier,

45
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,660
but I'm still not proficient enough

46
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,000
in controlling the Fallen Heart Flame.

47
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,660
After absorbing the Fallen Heart Flame,

48
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,330
your Flame Mantra has evolved

49
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,090
to the high-level Xuan Class.

50
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,170
It can reduce your consumption of Dou Qi

51
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,220
when using the Heavenly Flame

52
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,860
and help you mobilize
the Heavenly Flame faster.

53
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,090
Considering the ranking
of the Fallen Heart Flame,

54
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,860
I think you can at least advance
your Flame Mantra to the Di Class.

55
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,140
There should still be room
for improvement.

56
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,730
Mr. Yao.

57
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,780
If I fight Yun Shan one-on-one,

58
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,170
which rank should I reach
to be confident?

59
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,890
You've only become a low-level Dou King,

60
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,020
but Yun Shan
is a peak-level Dou Emperor.

61
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,380
There's a huge gap.

62
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,420
Though you have the support
of Heavenly Flames,

63
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,380
you don't have enough Dou Qi

64
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,940
to fully utilize their power.

65
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,610
You don't stand a chance
of winning a fight alone.

66
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,730
Xiao Xun'er was right.

67
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,580
If you join hands, you might win.

68
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,140
I'll go all out
at the Misty Cloud Sect this time.

69
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,580
I don't want to put Xun'er in danger.

70
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,330
So, you've made up your mind.

71
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,530
Although I'm only a low-level Dou King,

72
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,100
I have Heavenly Flames

73
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,820
and excellent Dou Techniques.

74
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,330
Ba Ji Collapse
is a close combat technique.

75
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,380
Lion and Tiger Shattering Gold
is a sonic technique.

76
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,540
Fire-splitting Wave-gnawing Ruler
fully mastered

77
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,410
can split mountains and break waves.

78
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,410
The Misty Cloud Sect

79
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,130
is the top sect in the Jia Ma Empire.

80
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,260
In addition to Yun Shan,
the peak-level Dou Emperor,

81
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,980
they also have special formations.

82
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,330
You're too weak on your own.

83
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,290
I remember you told me

84
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,850
that my talent lies
in subduing Heavenly Flames.

85
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,890
I have two Heavenly Flames now.

86
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,340
But

87
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,220
I don't have enough Dou Qi,

88
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,730
so I can't fully unleash
the inherent power of them.

89
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,450
What if I mix these two flames together?

90
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,170
I can mix the Green Lotus Core Flame
and the Fallen Heart Flame

91
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,890
and launch a combo attack.

92
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,940
Mixing two Heavenly Flames

93
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,010
will greatly increase
the power of the attack

94
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,170
without being limited by Dou Qi.

95
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,700
Is there such a Dou technique?

96
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,130
No one has ever thought of doing this

97
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,730
throughout the entire Dou Qi Continent.

98
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,060
Well...

99
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,450
Because no one has ever possessed
two Heavenly Flames at the same time.

100
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,220
Then I'll create a new Dou technique

101
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,450
and be the first one to do it.

102
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,170
All right. Let's give it a try.

103
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,410
Don't do it in the Storage Ring.

104
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,570
I've finally taken
the first step successfully.

105
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,620
Mix.

106
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,820
Mix.

107
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,850
Mix.

108
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,780
Mix.

109
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,130
Mix.

110
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,780
Mix.

111
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,100
Mix.

112
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,450
Mix.

113
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,250
Mix.

114
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,650
Mix.

115
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,500
Mix.

116
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,060
Mix.

117
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,260
The Misty Cloud Sect has posted notices
throughout the Jia Ma Empire

118
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,060
that the patriarch of the Xiao Clan
will be executed in ten days.

119
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,850
They're going too far.

120
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,980
They are raising the flag now

121
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,700
to declare to the entire Jia Ma Empire

122
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,450
that they are enemies with the Xiao Clan

123
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,170
and force the major sects

124
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,380
to choose a side.

125
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,730
Use the Flame Mantra.

126
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,570
Terminate the mixing.

127
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,730
Mixing Heavenly Flames

128
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,500
is a challenge
that has never been tried before.

129
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,700
You must be patient.

130
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,380
What that old guy Yun Shan did

131
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,730
is outrageous!

132
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,450
Xiao Yan.

133
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,660
In your condition,

134
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,660
you won't succeed
if you keep practicing.

135
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,170
You'll only put yourself in danger.

136
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,940
Stop for now.

137
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,610
No.

138
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:39,930
No.

139
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,500
I don't have time left.

140
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,340
I won't allow you to continue practicing

141
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,410
before you can control your emotions.

142
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,250
No.

143
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,300
No.

144
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,490
Mr. Yao.

145
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,900
Mr. Yao!

146
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,340
Mr. Yao!

147
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,250
Does it hurt?

148
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,170
Gu Yao is a peak-level Dou Emperor.

149
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,730
If you can defeat Gu Yao
with Heavenly Flames,

150
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,020
you'll stand a chance
of defeating Yun Shan.

151
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,020
Although this is a training exercise,

152
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,140
I won't hold back.

153
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,850
I hope you won't hold back either.

154
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,700
Xiao Yan possesses two Heavenly Flames

155
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,580
which are dangerous.

156
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,340
Please bear with him.

157
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,580
I've prepared some pills.

158
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,170
If anything happens,

159
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,460
I can provide treatment immediately.

160
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,580
Xiao Yan, use Heavenly Flames.

161
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,290
This guy is really fast.

162
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,970
(Is this the strength
of a peak-level Dou Emperor?)

163
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,940
(Do I have to surrender to Yun Shan?)

164
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,500
Xiao Yan, you must stop now.

165
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,700
Xiao Yan, you're too impatient.

166
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,940
Gu Yao, thank you.

167
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,290
Xiao Yan is too impatient.

168
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,850
I'll find a way to calm him down.

169
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,820
What can you do?

170
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,060
I'll practice with him.

171
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,250
No.

172
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,500
It's too dangerous.

173
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,060
It's the only way to calm him down

174
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,980
and help him master the technique.

175
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,450
I trust him.

176
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,770
Xiao Yan will be careful.

177
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,290
Xun'er, why are you here?

178
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,980
Where's Gu Yao?

179
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,460
Gu Yao won't come today.

180
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,660
I'll practice with you.

181
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,130
But...

182
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,170
Except for Gu Yao, I'm the strongest.

183
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,820
I'm not talking about that.

184
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,940
Don't hold back

185
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,380
just because it's me.

186
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,700
Xiao Yan, you must give it your all.

187
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,570
Xiao Yan.

188
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,850
Don't rush. Take your time.

189
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,660
Xun'er.

190
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,700
Xun'er, are you hurt?

191
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,290
You should worry about yourself,
Xiao Yan.

192
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,730
You're too impatient.

193
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,860
(Xiao Yan,)

194
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
(you must stay calm.)

195
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,460
(Your biggest enemy now)

196
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,380
(is yourself.)

197
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,770
(Flame Mantra can only dissolve
the violence of Heavenly Flames,)

198
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,650
(but to get rid of the inner demons
of the owner,)

199
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,060
(I have to do it myself.)

200
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,810
I made it.

201
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,450
I made it.

202
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,650
Two-colored Flame Lotus,

203
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,410
a combination of two Heavenly Flames.

204
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,290
It never happened before.

205
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,170
All right.

206
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,090
The Two-colored Flame Lotus
is powerful indeed,

207
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,610
but compared to a Three-colored Flame Lotus,
its power is limited.

208
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,410
Why don't you take a step forward?

209
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,020
Take a step forward?

210
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,340
Three-colored Flame Lotus?
But I only have two Heavenly Flames.

211
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,700
Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

212
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,140
But that's yours.

213
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,060
It's not the first time
I've lent it to you.

214
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,090
Why are you being polite now?

215
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,850
Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

216
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,610
Out.

217
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,770
How can I simultaneously unleash
three Heavenly Flames?

218
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,650
It seems not as simple
as adding one more.

219
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,840
You're the first young man

220
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,650
to possess three Heavenly Flames.

221
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,500
No one can share with you
any experience about it,

222
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,450
neither can I.

223
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,290
You're on your own now.

224
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,700
Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

225
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,740
Out.

226
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,650
It was close every time.

227
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,890
Switching hands

228
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,740
made no difference.

229
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,060
Is the time difference

230
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,340
unable to be solved?

231
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,010
It's hot.

232
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,060
Swallow it.

233
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:38,770
Well...

234
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,700
It's a Blood Lotus Pill.

235
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,700
It can form a blood clot in the body

236
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,100
to protect the body against the flames.

237
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,340
The Qi Recovering Pill
can quickly restore Dou Qi.

238
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,890
The Foundation Building Liquid
can speed up cultivation.

239
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,860
Using them together,

240
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,890
you can recover losses
in the shortest time.

241
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,090
It's hot.

242
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,170
Calm your mind

243
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,350
and think of yourself
as this pool of water,

244
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,490
then you won't feel anything.

245
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,300
It's hot.

246
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,530
The antidote is the following sentence,

247
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,740
"Calm your mind and forget yourself."

248
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,980
Think about it.

249
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,900
All right.

250
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,820
I'm going to bed.

251
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,890
I've been staying up all night
with you for days.

252
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,980
My body can't take it anymore.

253
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,730
Mr. Yao.

254
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,740
What did you just say?

255
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,700
I said I'm going to bed.

256
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,980
Stop nagging me.

257
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,490
No.

258
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,060
I mean what you said earlier.

259
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,170
Calm your mind and forget yourself.

260
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,130
The previous one.

261
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,610
Blood Lotus Pill.

262
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,330
Yes.

263
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,420
What else?

264
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,060
Qi Recovering Pill?

265
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,090
Foundation Building Liquid?

266
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,580
You mentioned two types of pills.

267
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,700
Why did I only take one?

268
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,940
You idiot.

269
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,940
That's because I fused

270
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,060
the two pills together.

271
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,940
Are you doubting
my skills in making pills?

272
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,090
No.

273
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,700
I'm not doubting you.

274
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,370
What I want to know

275
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,940
is the fusion of the pills
you mentioned.

276
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,010
What's wrong with that?

277
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,890
If I fuse the Green Lotus Core Flame
and the Fallen Heart Flame together

278
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,250
into a new Heavenly Flame

279
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,580
and use it
with the Bone Spirit Cold Flame,

280
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,460
it would be easier to control, right?

281
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,770
You brat.

282
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,290
You're daydreaming again.

283
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,980
Mixing Heavenly Flames
to form a Two-colored Flame Lotus

284
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,990
or a Three-colored Flame Lotus

285
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,220
is about controlling and combining
different Heavenly Flames,

286
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,700
but fusing Heavenly Flames

287
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,740
is a completely different matter.

288
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,700
It's turning
two different Heavenly Flames

289
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,340
into an entirely new one.

290
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,860
It's the same
as fusing two kinds of pills.

291
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,620
It's the same,

292
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,860
but a Heavenly Flame is not a pill.

293
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:03,980
It's the most tyrannical

294
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,130
and violent weapon in the world.

295
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,440
That's what makes it exciting

296
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,460
and challenging.

297
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,580
Boy.

298
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,010
You're something.

299
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,650
I can give you some guidance

300
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,490
in combining Heavenly Flames.

301
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,290
But if you want to fuse Heavenly Flames,

302
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,650
we'll have to explore step by step.

303
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,170
All I can say is,

304
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,250
make good use of the Flame Mantra.

305
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,410
Use the Flame Mantra.

306
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,620
Activate Heavenly Flames.

307
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,090
Flame Mantra.

308
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,130
Now

309
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,100
withdraw the Flame Mantra Dou Qi.

310
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
(Heavenly Flame Space)

311
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,940
Mr. Yao.

312
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,060
Mr. Yao.

313
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,060
You are in the flame.

314
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,010
The flame is your source,

315
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,890
your power,

316
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,220
your destiny,

317
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,980
and your home.

318
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,250
You have to trust it.

319
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,940
Mr. Yao, take a look for me.

320
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,340
Have I made it?

321
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,370
Mr. Yao.

322
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,060
What happened to you?

323
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,100
Mr. Yao, what happened to you?

324
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,300
All right.

325
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,370
Come on.

326
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,010
Do you know how much violent energy

327
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,460
I've blocked for you?

328
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,370
How else could you have fused
the Heavenly Flames into a new one?

329
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,580
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

330
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,540
Mr. Yao.

331
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,060
Please name the new Heavenly Flame.

332
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:17,850
The Heavenly Flame

333
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,890
is as green as a glazed emerald.

334
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,130
I'll name it Glazed.

335
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,250
Glazed.

336
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,370
My first Heavenly Flame
is the Green Lotus Core Flame.

337
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,860
Then let's call it
Glazed Lotus Heart Flame.

338
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,370
Glazed Lotus Heart Flame.

339
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,780
That's a good name.

340
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,290
It's a new Heavenly Flame formed
by the fusion of two Heavenly Flames,

341
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,530
capable of integration and separation,

342
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,620
with flexible transformations.

343
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,490
It can accelerate cultivation

344
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,220
like the Fallen Heart Flame

345
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,890
and also has the power
of volcanic eruption

346
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,100
like the Green Lotus Core Flame.

347
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,490
You're not only the first person
to create a new Dou Technique

348
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,100
in the Jia Ma Empire

349
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,130
but also the first to create
a new Heavenly Flame.

350
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,210
Mr. Yao.

351
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,490
I also came up with a name

352
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,520
for the Three-colored Flame Lotus
combined by the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame

353
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,790
and the Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

354
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,100
In this unjust world,

355
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,620
the Vajra is furious.

356
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,060
I'll make the Misty Cloud Sect pay
for what they did.

357
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,940
The name is

358
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,220
Angry Buddha Lotus Flame

359
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,370
To control the timing
of the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame

360
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,170
and the Bone Spirit Cold Flame

361
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,700
tests your control over Heavenly Flames.

362
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,610
Looks like

363
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,740
you need more practice.

364
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,820
But I don't have much time left.

365
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,740
Xun'er, I've mastered
the new Heavenly Flame.

366
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,250
I can make
a Three-Colored Flame Lotus now.

367
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,890
Are you ready
to go to the Misty Cloud Sect?

368
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,580
It's time.

369
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,170
I'll go with you.

370
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,180
No.

371
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,290
It's risky to go to the Misty Cloud Sect.

372
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,490
I can't put you in danger.

373
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,010
I thought we agreed

374
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,980
that we would overcome
any obstacle together.

375
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,980
No matter how high the mountain is
or wide the sea is,

376
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,620
we'll cross them together.

377
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,540
All right.

378
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,270
Let's go to the Misty Cloud Sect together

379
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,180
to save Father.

380
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,890
I'll bid farewell to the headmaster
and the elders now.

381
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,300
Go ahead.

382
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,300
You can come out.

383
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,100
I know you're here.

384
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,980
You've been waiting all night.

385
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,340
What's the matter?

386
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:19,880
I can't let Xun'er

387
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,650
go to the Misty Cloud Sect with you.

388
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,650
If anything happens to her,

389
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,460
I can't face our patriarch.

390
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,490
I never intended

391
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,980
to take her with me
to the Misty Cloud Sect.

392
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,660
Miss Hu.

393
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,770
I'm here by appointment.

394
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,130
Miss Hu.

395
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,460
What's this?

396
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,620
It's an amulet.

397
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,700
Do you believe in this?

398
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,490
Since it's a gesture from you,

399
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,340
I'll take it.

400
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,210
Thank you.

401
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,850
I have important matters to attend to.

402
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,740
I'll take my leave.

403
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,060
Take care, Miss Hu.

404
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,740
Who would believe in such a thing?

405
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,890
It's just that you guys

406
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,290
are going far away

407
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,890
and leaving me here alone.

408
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,170
Standing at the top
of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower,

409
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,460
I can't see anything,

410
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,290
and Grandpa won't let me go with you.

411
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,010
Miss Hu.

412
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,770
Just leave if you want.

413
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,580
You only talk to me

414
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,580
when you need my help.

415
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,410
But every time I try to talk to you,

416
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,530
you want to leave.

417
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,820
Listen,

418
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,530
I tied this for you with my own hands.

419
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,250
You're not allowed to take it off

420
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,060
until you're old.

421
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,490
Do you hear me?

422
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,370
Hu Jia.

423
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,250
Thank you.

424
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,850
The bell

425
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,420
looks familiar.

426
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,060
Do you recognize it?

427
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,100
When I was little,
you always skipped classes with me,

428
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,860
so the teacher tied two bells

429
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,940
to your hand.

430
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,340
When you tried to skip class again,

431
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,140
the bells rang, and you couldn't escape.

432
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,900
But the teacher
only punished you every time.

433
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,980
I begged him to punish me too,

434
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,900
but he wouldn't.

435
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,740
He also said

436
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,820
that I was a guest,

437
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,700
not a member of the Xiao Clan.

438
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,380
I didn't need to be punished.

439
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,860
I felt upset for a long time
because of that.

440
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,380
Later, Uncle Xiao found out about it

441
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,380
and made me
this pair of bells overnight.

442
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,500
I was so happy when I got them.

443
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,420
Were you happy about being punished?

444
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,060
You don't get it.

445
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,940
Being punished means
that I'm not a guest anymore.

446
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,940
I'm also a member of the Xiao Clan.

447
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,300
Therefore, from that day on,

448
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,020
I decided to change my name
from Gu Xun'er to Xiao Xun'er.

449
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,100
I used this name

450
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,380
when I applied to the Jia Nan Academy.

451
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,820
In fact, I had long considered

452
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,660
Uncle Xiao as my own father.

453
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,000
This time going to the Misty Cloud Sect,

454
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,140
I can bring nothing,

455
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,660
but I have to take
this pair of bells with me.

456
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,340
Xun'er.

457
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,980
You've been traveling with me

458
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,620
day and night these days.

459
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,180
You must be tired.

460
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,060
Before it gets light,

461
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,580
you should get some sleep.

462
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,500
It's okay. I'm not tired.

463
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,460
I'm just worried.

464
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,100
I promised you

465
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,420
that I'll

466
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,180
definitely bring Father back
safe and sound.

467
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,340
Don't worry.

468
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,220
I know.

469
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,340
I know

470
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,300
that you'll keep your word.

471
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,420
I'm just thinking

472
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,900
that we've faced

473
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,660
so many challenges together
since we were little,

474
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,580
but we've never faced

475
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,020
the test of life and death like this time.

476
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,380
Xun'er.

477
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,740
Actually,

478
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,460
you don't have to take this risk.

479
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,060
Xiao Yan.

480
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,780
I may not be able
to stay by your side forever,

481
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,140
but as long as I'm still here,

482
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,300
I'm willing

483
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,940
to take adventure

484
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,380
and face everything with you.

485
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,980
Even if what lies ahead

486
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,820
is death,

487
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,380
I'll still do it without hesitation.

488
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,140
Thank you, Xun'er.

489
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,220
Go to rest.

490
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,540
I'll practice here for a while.

491
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,340
We'll set out early tomorrow morning.
