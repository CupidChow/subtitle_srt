=Episode 28=

19
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,830
Thanks for your permission.

20
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,760
Although I failed today,

21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,270
my request last night is unchanged.

22
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,710
Are you tired?

23
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,750
What's this?

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,640
The intelligence system is exclusive
to Eight Clans.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,830
Green stands for Ling Clan.

26
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,680
Maybe the intelligence has reached Gu Realm.

27
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,950
Ling Clan is attacked.

28
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,240
The patriarch sacrificed.

29
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,550
The Clan Lady is in danger.

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,190
What's going on?

31
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,110
Black Emerged Army found Ling Xi
when gathering info in Ling Clan.

32
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,630
Patriarch Yao, there's something wrong
with her wound.

33
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,470
I stopped the bleeding with Dou Qi.

34
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,720
Have a closer look.

35
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,630
It looks like a cut,

36
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,750
but in fact, something in her blood

37
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,830
is burning her Dou Qi.

38
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,030
It's almost burnt out.

39
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,190
That's why she's fainting now.

40
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,960
It's a skill of the Hall of Souls.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,360
If you have the power of bloodline,

42
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,000
you would be more powerful than Gu Yao.

43
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,190
But you don't. You've been counting on yourself.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,160
You're already powerful enough.

45
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,190
Mr. Yao, I'm not bothered by the result.

46
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,600
I know my own power well.

47
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,240
A fight won't depress me.

48
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Brat, you're more mature.

49
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,630
I'm just wondering

50
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,750
whether the disaster in Ling Clan

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,390
has something to do with the Hall of Souls.

52
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,360
Hun Miesheng came to the Starfall Hall

53
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,410
and snatched the map
of Purifying Lotus Demon Flame.

54
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,030
I'm still concerned about the incident.

55
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,360
Could the two matters be related?

56
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,030
How about we take a look around Light Hall?

57
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,510
Mr. Yao,

58
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,030
before I came here,

59
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,830
I made a copy of the incomplete map.

60
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,070
I'd like to take this chance to give it out

61
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,270
as our gesture

62
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,600
and show that we want to work with Gu Clan

63
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,970
to fight the Hall of Souls

64
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,880
and stop Hun Miesheng from getting the flame.

65
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't be impulsive.

66
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,230
Patriarchs of the seven clans are all here.

67
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,950
We should know their opinions first.

68
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,950
Patriarch Gu,

69
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm Ling Xi, Clan Lady of Ling Clan.

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,070
Black Emerged Army

71
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,640
found you in the transfer formation

72
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,600
that links to Ling Clan.

73
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,550
Where's my mother?

74
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,600
Kid,

75
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,600
your mother sacrificed herself

76
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,200
to protect you.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,390
When we were about to leave for Gu Clan,

78
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,880
a sudden darkness shrouded us.

79
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,390
A Heavenly Flame came from nowhere.

80
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,720
Its center was pitch dark,

81
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,720
while there was light all around it.

82
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,280
My mother said

83
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,270
it was Nihility Devouring Flame.

84
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,510
The one controlling the flame

85
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,920
was a man in black and covered by dark mist.

86
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,230
He claimed to be Hun Miesheng.

87
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,550
He tried to rob our map
of Purifying Lotus Demon Flame.

88
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,550
My mother and the Elders fought desperately.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,320
According to the Black Emerged Army,

90
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,950
Elders of Ling Clan have regained control.

91
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,320
Hun Miesheng causes no more confusion.

92
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,160
Gu Clan only said Hun Miesheng was unsealed

93
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,040
and that Mu Gu of the Hall of Souls was killed.

94
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,920
But, Hun Miesheng

95
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,600
even has Nihility Devouring Flame.

96
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,270
Hall of Souls bounces back

97
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,200
with ferocious momentum.

98
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,640
Compared to what Master Yao said,

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,790
Hun Miesheng grows more powerful rapidly

100
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,760
with better control of Nihility Devouring Flame.

101
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,200
Worse still,
he wants Purifying Lotus Demon Flame.

102
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,920
Starfall Hall was attacked.

103
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,440
His target back then

104
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,160
was also the incomplete map of the flame.

105
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,640
Now, he has gained the whole map

106
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,070
and knows the location of the flame.

107
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,790
I guess

108
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,110
he will use Purifying Lotus Demon Flame

109
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,640
to fully activate Nihility Devouring Flame.

110
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,830
If he succeeds,

111
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,440
he will become the next Huntian Emperor.

112
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,630
After that,

113
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,880
he will manage to reach Dou God level

114
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,830
just like Huntian Emperor did.

115
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,270
By then,

116
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,200
no one will be able to stop the Hall of Souls.

117
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,270
Our top priority

118
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,000
is to join hands to stop Hun Miesheng

119
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,790
and obtain Purifying Lotus Demon Flame.

120
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,200
Xiao Yan should be the best candidate

121
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,070
for obtaining Purifying Lotus Demon Flame.

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,840
Everybody,

123
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,950
have you ever fought Hun Miesheng head-on?

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,510
It's Xiao Yan
who gets Fallen Heart Flame

125
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,600
and Three Thousand Burning Flame,

126
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,230
wipes out Mu Gu,

127
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,920
and foils the plot of Hun Miesheng.

128
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,320
But I've heard

129
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,200
when conquering Three Thousand Burning Flame,

130
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,270
he was almost burned to death.

131
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,480
The one we're going to conquer

132
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,390
is the third-ranked Purifying Lotus Demon Flame.

133
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,830
He has no power of bloodline.

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,600
How could he succeed?

135
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,350
So,

136
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,480
because of the power of bloodline,

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,480
are Central Plains and Xiao Yan excluded?

138
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,110
Master Yao,

139
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,670
it's not that we seven clans are arrogant.

140
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,880
We're protecting Xiao Clan,

141
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,070
and especially Xiao Yan.

142
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,790
Xiao Yan acquires Flame Mantra
and Heavenly Flame Triple Xuan Change.

143
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,350
He was born for Heavenly Flames.

144
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,350
If there's one person

145
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,790
responsible for fighting Hall of Souls,

146
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,670
Xiao Yan must be the predestinated one.

147
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,550
What you seven clans should do

148
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,000
is support these youngsters

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,640
to the largest extent

150
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,350
and work with Central Plains in solidarity.

151
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,790
That's how we can win over the Hall of Souls.

152
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,630
Dad,

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,150
Xiao Yan is able to…

154
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,920
Master Yao,

155
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,000
50 years ago, it was you

156
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,320
who led the Starfall Hall
to fight the Hall of Souls.

157
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,960
Xiao Xuan, the ancestor of Xiao Clan

158
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,840
sacrificed all the power of bloodline

159
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,760
to seal Huntian Emperor.

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,230
What you did and sacrificed

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,280
will always be remembered on Dou Qi Continent.

162
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,350
But it is the time

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,840
for us seven clans to take responsibility

164
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,840
and complete the mission.

165
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,550
No matter how you put it,

166
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,280
you seven clans still hold discrimination

167
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,710
regarding the power of bloodline.

168
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,840
I originally thought,

169
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,520
after the fight with the Hall of Souls
50 years ago

170
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,180
and seeing the growth
of the young generation like Xiao Yan,

171
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,400
you might change your minds

172
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,080
and understand,
to fight the Hall of Souls,

173
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,470
we must cooperate with each other.

174
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,030
It was Gu Clan's Black Emerged Army

175
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,200
that sealed Hun Miesheng 50 years ago.

176
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,190
Mr. Yao.

177
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,000
This is an incomplete map
of Purifying Lotus Demon Flame

178
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,470
I got from the Dou Saint's relic.

179
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,400
Hun Miesheng took away the original one.

180
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,470
I made a new copy from my memory.

181
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,230
I hope it can help Gu Clan.

182
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,080
Xiao Yan, it…

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,960
Mr. Yao is right.

184
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,840
The Hall of Souls is our common enemy.

185
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,110
To fight the Hall of Souls,
we must cooperate with each other.

186
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,280
Uncle Gu, be there the power
of bloodline or not,

187
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,960
I'll keep fighting all the way

188
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,840
until the Hall of Souls is eradicated.

189
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,200
Let's not get excited.

190
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,110
We share the same goal

191
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,030
that the Hall of Souls is to be fended off.

192
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,310
How about this?

193
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,400
Let's have a rest now.

194
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,870
As for this matter,

195
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,960
let's make a long-term plan.

196
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,640
Mr. Yao, don't be angry.

197
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,840
They're not targeting me deliberately.

198
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,840
The power of bloodline is supreme

199
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,790
in their minds.

200
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,070
I understand him.

201
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,990
You…

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,430
They insist on judging people's strength
based on the power of bloodline.

203
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,110
It's understandable.

204
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,400
I won't blame them,

205
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,840
but I will prove to them with my strength

206
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,110
that my Heavenly Flames and Dou Qi

207
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,640
are not inferior to the power of bloodline.

208
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,800
Your way of thinking

209
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,550
is sure the evidence for the fact

210
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,200
that you grow mature.

211
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,440
Good. Now that you're confident,

212
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,080
as your master, I will help you

213
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,400
fight the Hall of Souls in our way.

214
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,080
Ling Clan previously made a copy

215
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,150
of the incomplete map
of Purifying Lotus Demon Flame.

216
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,760
Conquering the flame is top on our agenda,

217
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,640
but to fight the Hall of Souls,

218
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,670
there's another fundamental thing

219
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,710
more worthy of our discussion.

220
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,790
Tuoshe Ancient Emperor Jade?

221
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,870
Yes.

222
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,280
Tuoshe Ancient Emperor Jade

223
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,710
is the relic of Tuoshe Ancient Emperor,

224
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,150
the last Dou God

225
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,840
on Dou Qi Continent.

226
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,910
Before he was deceased,

227
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,110
he broke the jade into eight pieces

228
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,280
protected by Eight Ancient Clans.

229
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,800
It's said

230
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,670
the eight jade pieces

231
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,150
are the keys

232
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,440
to the strongest power left by the Dou God.

233
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,280
Huntian Emperor started the Hall of Souls.

234
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,760
His talent and evil skills of the Hall of Souls

235
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,990
helped him to reach Demi Dou God level.

236
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,280
In order to become a Dou God,

237
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,790
he attacked Eight Clans

238
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
for the ancient jade.

239
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,590
He took away Hun Clan's jade piece

240
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,520
and kept it in the Hall of Souls for centuries.

241
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,640
If Hun Miesheng chooses the same path,

242
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,520
he will definitely

243
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,400
come for our jade pieces someday.

244
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,710
To prevent the recurrence of such a tragedy,

245
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,510
I suggest

246
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,400
that we should keep all the pieces

247
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,760
in the safest place.

248
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,670
As for the safest one,

249
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,800
except for Gu Clan,

250
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,040
there are no other places.

251
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,840
We'll send the pieces to Gu Clan soon.

252
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,640
Thanks for your trust in us.

253
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,760
Besides the jade pieces,

254
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,030
please send a powerhouse as well

255
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,520
so that we can protect them together.

256
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,110
Xiao Clan's part is not here.

257
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,040
Dad,

258
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,150
you've been reading it for so long.

259
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,600
Have a cup of tea.

260
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,240
Dad,

261
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,960
I've got a confusing question for you.

262
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,910
As the Clan Lady, I often take a rest here.

263
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,110
It's sacred in the minds of Gu people.

264
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,280
Every once in a while,

265
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,790
some people would take their children here,

266
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,640
hoping to see a person

267
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,880
with strong power of bloodline among them.

268
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,550
I've seen many people these years

269
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,280
who were so overwhelmed

270
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,110
by their children's zero power of bloodline

271
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,150
that they killed themselves immediately.

272
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,640
So, Dad,

273
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,400
does the power of bloodline

274
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,470
really hold such importance?

275
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,350
But without the power of bloodline,

276
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,350
Xiao Xuan couldn't suppress Huntian Emperor

277
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,200
or save the whole world.

278
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,960
The power of bloodline

279
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,280
is not a sign of social status,

280
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,120
but a guarantee

281
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,910
of reliable strength.

282
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,230
Xiao Yan

283
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,280
wants to conquer Purifying Lotus Demon Flame.

284
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,520
But with no protection
of the power of bloodline,

285
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,590
I'm really afraid

286
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,230
he might suffer the backfire.

287
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,790
Once that happens,

288
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,080
we will lose not only Xiao Yan,

289
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,790
but the chance to
defeat the Hall of Souls.

290
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,150
I'm the patriarch of our clan.

291
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,310
Xun'er,

292
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,600
can you

293
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,960
understand my position?

294
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,310
Yes.

295
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,590
Protecting Xiao Clan's jade

296
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,670
is the first task you take from Gu Clan.

297
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,230
It's time to finish it.

298
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,280
Now you should know

299
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,790
we're not against Xiao Family or Xiao Yan.

300
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,350
It's because we're fighting the Hall of Souls

301
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,000
for the whole Dou Qi Continent.

302
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,840
I understand.

303
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,840
Xun'er.

304
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,950
Xun'er.

305
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,320
This time, Xiao Yan

306
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
asked me for your hand.

307
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,230
He's a good boy.

308
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,670
On ordinary days and in a peaceful world,

309
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,870
I would

310
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,150
grant permission for your marriage.

311
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,070
But now,

312
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,400
I can't nod in approval.

313
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,550
It's time we Gu Clan try our best.

314
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,280
That's exactly why

315
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,080
I can't comply with his request.

316
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,710
I can't let you leave with him, either.

317
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,190
How I wish

318
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,110
you were not the Clan Lady.

319
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:18,910
In that case,

320
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,520
you could live in freedom

321
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,230
and live the life you want to live.

322
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,670
Dad.

323
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,880
But,

324
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,040
you are the Clan Lady

325
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,520
born with divine bloodline.

326
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,160
You have to take heavier responsibilities

327
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,280
and sacrifice yourself
against the Hall of Souls.

328
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I got it.

329
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,880
Xun'er.

330
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,760
Xiao Yan.

331
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,310
Xiao Yan,

332
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,590
please trust me.

333
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,000
At whatever time,

334
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,520
I'm always on your side.

335
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,680
I also hope

336
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,520
you won't blame my father

337
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,470
for disallowing you to conquer the flame

338
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,350
and fight against the Hall of Souls

339
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,680
because of the power of bloodline.

340
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,240
Xun'er, don't worry.

341
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,830
I'm no longer as reckless

342
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,800
as I used to be.

343
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,880
All patriarchs agreed yesterday

344
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,000
that Gu Clan should keep the jade

345
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,940
in case of the Hall of Souls' robbery.

346
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,760
I know the jade of Xiao Clan

347
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,430
was left to you by your father.

348
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,950
I ask you for it

349
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,310
for the reason that

350
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,680
you could have no fears

351
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,000
when you fight the Hall of Souls.

352
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,480
Don't worry.

353
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,160
The jade of Xiao Clan

354
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,950
will be protected by me personally.

355
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,040
The jade

356
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,920
was given to me by my father
before he died.

357
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,950
He asked me to protect the jade,

358
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,430
but actually, what I need to protect

359
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,680
is the honor of Xiao Family and Xiao Clan.

360
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,110
For me,

361
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,800
it's just the last tie

362
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,830
between me and my father.

363
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,280
I've thought it through.

364
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,350
Though I have no power of bloodline,

365
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,800
and the jade is not mine,

366
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,760
you won't give me up.

367
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,430
At the end of the day,

368
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,760
it's not me protecting the jade.

369
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,310
It's you protecting me.

370
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,230
Xiao Yan,

371
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,680
how I wish

372
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,920
we could reunite after this departure.

373
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,590
Our next reunion

374
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,590
should be near Purifying Lotus Demon Flame.

375
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,710
Do you have to go there?

376
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,880
Xun'er,

377
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,040
do you also believe that I can't go there

378
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,280
because I have no power of bloodline?

379
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,270
No.

380
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,830
In my eyes,

381
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,430
you're the strongest.

382
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,280
In the earlier fight with Hun Miesheng,

383
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,350
I could still feel his limitations.

384
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,590
But if he gains Purifying Lotus Demon Flame,

385
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,430
the situation will take a dangerous turn.

386
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,820
Hun Miesheng has the ambition

387
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,430
to become the second Huntian Emperor.

388
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,400
50 years ago,

389
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
it was the Starfall Hall that fought alone.

390
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,880
In the worst case, we do that again.

391
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,190
50 years ago,

392
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,280
the Hall of Souls gained a chance to make use of

393
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,950
due to its lonely fight.

394
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,350
We must call on Central Plains to join hands

395
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,880
and start an alliance.

396
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
An alliance?

397
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,040
Let's establish an alliance of all factions

398
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,400
and defend ourselves.

399
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,680
All factions?

400
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,230
Didn't you see their disdain and hostility

401
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,190
when fought the Subsidiary?

402
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,450
Central Plains has been divided for so long.

403
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,800
Each faction has its own mind.

404
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,110
Cooperation among them is nearly impossible.

405
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,560
They didn't know the strength of Hun Miesheng,

406
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,310
or how powerful we were.

407
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,100
After the fight with the Subsidiary,

408
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,830
they got to know my plan.

409
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,070
They will try their best.

410
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,680
Besides, the whole Central Plains has heard

411
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,160
you defeated Hun Miesheng.

412
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,190
Pill Tower will join the alliance for sure.

413
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,880
By then,

414
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,280
they have to fight the Hall of Souls alone,

415
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,950
or join our alliance.

416
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,470
It's not hard to make a choice.

417
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,070
I don't want to see them anymore.

418
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,830
Treat them by yourselves if you insist.

419
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,670
We must visit and invite them in person.

420
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,470
In person?

421
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,800
Starfall Hall has to show some sincerity

422
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,230
if we want to call for solidarity.

423
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,160
We can't simply sit here and keep waiting.

424
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,600
Yao Chen,

425
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,920
don't tell me you like his idea.

426
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,830
The world is for the younger generation.

427
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,680
I failed 50 years ago.

428
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,470
This time, give these youngsters a chance.

429
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,300
- This way, please.
- Starfall Hall invites us here.

430
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,400
What're they going to do?

431
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,600
I have no idea.

432
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,680
Let's wait and see.

433
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,230
So, we are invited by the Starfall Hall

434
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,830
to the Pill Tower.

435
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,680
Do you want us to pay a direct visit to you?

436
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,480
I'm afraid

437
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,350
you will face a harder dilemma.

438
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,000
If we're not invited by Pill Tower,

439
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,800
we have no reason to stay here.

440
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,400
Masters, listen to me for one second.

441
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,470
Myriad Sword Hall and Shadow Domain Hall

442
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,830
have been in stagnation for years

443
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,920
due to the pressure of Wind Thunder Hall.

444
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,470
Joining the alliance

445
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,350
could be a chance to start anew.

446
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:55,910
Yeah.

447
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,470
Pill Tower and Auction House have agreed.

448
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,310
Shadow Domain Hall and Myriad Sword Hall

449
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,950
are the second members we invited.

450
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,470
If you refuse to join in,

451
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,710
we have to consider Wind Thunder Hall.

452
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,520
We knew Starfall Hall would start an alliance

453
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,560
and cooperate with Pill Tower.

454
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,040
But among we three Halls,

455
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,400
Wind Thunder Hall is dominant.

456
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,710
Ling Clan was blown by Hun Miesheng's attack.

457
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,160
It means Starfall Hall has told the truth.

458
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,040
Hun Miesheng did revive the Hall of Souls.

459
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,920
Though it's Ling Clan that is struck,

460
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,040
Central Plains is by no means safe.

461
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,470
The Hall of Souls might be waiting
for a chance

462
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,040
to land a fatal blow on Central Plains.

463
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,920
The Hall of Souls' return

464
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,110
brings danger to every one of us.

465
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,830
Given the usual style of the Hall of Souls,

466
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,040
once they become strong,

467
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,190
they will certainly destroy all of us.

468
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,640
The newly-rising Starfall Hall

469
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,470
is indeed more powerful than we three Halls.

470
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,240
But,

471
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,950
Wind Thunder Hall and Starfall Hall

472
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,430
have long been in severe conflict.

473
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,720
If…

474
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,070
If we agree to join the alliance,

475
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,680
we will stand against Wind Thunder Hall.

476
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,040
Mr. Yao is a Dou Saint now.

477
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,940
He has repulsed Hun Miesheng.

478
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,710
He's the strongest in Central Plains.

479
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,230
Mr. Yao contributed the most 50 years ago.

480
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,680
The current fight against the Hall of Souls

481
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,950
should be led by Starfall Hall as well.

482
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,230
The alliance,

483
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,880
though with some risks,

484
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,000
has more merits than demerits

485
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,310
for both of us.

486
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,190
In Central Plains,

487
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,590
there are four Halls and one Tower,

488
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,350
not three Halls and one Tower.

489
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,350
Starfall Hall has been neglected by us

490
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,040
for a surprisingly long time.

491
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,680
Starfall Hall regains power

492
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,830
and talks with us sincerely despite the past.

493
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,120
If

494
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,680
we can swim the storms together,

495
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,640
Central Plains

496
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,040
will rise from declination.

497
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,350
So, Myriad Sword Hall and Shadow Domain Hall

498
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,640
have reached a consensus, right?

499
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,190
Good.

500
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,400
Ten days later,

501
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,640
we'll announce its creation in Starfall Hall.

502
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,720
On that day,

503
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,400
we'll be expecting you there.

504
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,160
Shadow Domain Sage and Sword Sage,

505
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,680
two stupid old men!

506
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,680
They used to be at my service,

507
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,160
but now,

508
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,310
they dare to follow Starfall Hall!

509
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,190
Two fence-sitters!

510
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,310
Master, it's time to take the medicine.

511
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,110
You two are smart.

512
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,800
In the past, Feng…

513
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,230
That girl would prepare these for me.

514
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,400
Master,

515
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
in fact, these two medicines

516
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,110
are prepared by Senior Sister.

517
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,920
You can't even tell a whole story.

518
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,800
She made the medicines by herself.

519
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,360
She knew

520
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,110
the weather changed a lot these days.

521
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,230
So, she made the medicines in the kitchen.

522
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,710
It's not that I can't tell the whole story.

523
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,000
Senior Sister specially told us

524
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,950
not to mention her name to Master.

525
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,800
She's afraid Master might become unhappy.

526
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,950
Alright, alright.

527
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,950
Stop your acting.

528
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,480
Let her in.

529
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,790
OK.

530
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,790
Senior sister.

531
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,270
Hurry up.

532
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,150
Come.

533
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,670
Let's go.

534
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,680
Master.

535
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,160
Qing'er,

536
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,350
I have a word for you.

537
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,640
Bear in your mind.

538
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,950
Only when you become powerful

539
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,560
can you not be despised by others

540
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,000
or be given up by others easily.

541
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Starfall Hall performs a good play

542
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,190
by alienating we three Halls.

543
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,830
Those two stupid men

544
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,350
are eager to become its weapons!

545
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,830
Our Hall thrives under your leadership

546
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,640
and plays a critical role in Central Plains.

547
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,640
Such a well-known feat impresses everyone.

548
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,430
The alliance created by Starfall Hall

549
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,310
should have Wind Thunder Hall as a member!

550
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,760
I refuse even if they invite me to join.

551
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,350
Starfall Hall does this

552
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,590
simply to regain its old status

553
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,830
as the head of Central Plains.

554
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,310
None of our disciples is allowed to join it.

555
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,830
Whoever dares to

556
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,640
will be expelled from our faction.

557
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,430
Qing'er, special warning for you.

558
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,880
Master, you can't be reasoned with.

559
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,800
You came back not long ago,

560
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,280
and yet you want to leave.

561
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,800
It must be for that kid, Mu Qingluan.

562
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,560
You're growing up.

563
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,110
Master, it's not for Mu Qingluan,

564
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,470
but for Wind Thunder Hall.

565
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,160
Master Yao and Xiao Yan propose the alliance.

566
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:05,110
Brother Mu said
that Master Yao respects you a lot.

567
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,680
Master Yao said, after his departure,

568
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,400
you led Wind Thunder Hall

569
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,070
to protect Central Plains for 50 years.

570
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,350
Without Wind Thunder Hall,

571
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,350
the alliance would be incomplete.

572
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,800
Did he really say that?

573
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,150
Yes.

574
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,640
There should have been cooperation long ago.

575
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,110
They always say Wind Thunder Hall

576
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,710
is arrogant and pompous.

577
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,350
They don't have any idea

578
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,830
about my kind purpose.

579
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,160
I've been trying

580
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,950
to get Central Plains to work in solidarity.

581
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,760
But, it's just not that easy.

582
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,670
Master,

583
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,680
why don't you take the chance

584
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,520
to have a talk with Master Yao?

585
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,310
Do you mean…

586
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,640
If you take the initiative to visit them,

587
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,760
you will show the generosity of our Hall.

588
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,830
Let me think.

589
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,830
OK, think again.

590
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,040
Golden coins have arrived downstairs.

591
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,520
There was an anonymous bidder at the auction.

592
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,990
He left ten boxes of golden coins.

593
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,350
Mighty Huang Pill.

594
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,800
Core Flame Fungus.

595
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,160
Eight Square Cauldron.

596
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,160
Is there something wrong?

597
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,470
Auction House allows for anonymous bids.

598
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,040
Some guests want the treasure

599
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,230
but hate to reveal their names or faces.

600
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,920
It's just common.

601
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,800
But these goods

602
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,190
are far less valuable than the coins.

603
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,880
There's something here.

604
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,880
No. It…

605
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,710
What do you mean by this?

606
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,560
Miss wants to know

607
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,710
what you mean

608
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,190
by leaving the coins in Auction House.

609
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,520
Well.

610
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,680
How do you know these are mine?

611
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,160
The Dou Qi on these coins.

612
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,470
Across Central Plains,

613
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,110
is there anyone else in Central Plains

614
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,280
exposed to the aura of unthawed ice

615
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,070
except for Master of Ice River Valley?

616
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,760
The coins are here. Please excuse me now.

617
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,030
Wait a second.

618
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,640
Is your Auction House selling stuff or not?

619
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,760
I bought some goods.

620
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,110
How can you reject my transaction?

621
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,030
No way.

622
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,590
You pay us much more than the true value.

623
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,680
It's against the market price.

624
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,430
That's why we cancel the transaction

625
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,760
and return your coins.

626
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,710
No, no. Don't leave.

627
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,640
Hold on. Hold on.

628
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,480
Hey, hold on. Hold on.

629
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,430
What's the hurry?

630
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,830
Let me finish, OK?

631
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,590
I… I know well

632
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,640
about your Auction House.

633
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,350
I know all your rules.

634
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,880
The auctioned goods

635
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,590
are for the highest bidder.

636
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,950
I did follow your rules.

637
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,680
You can't cancel it without reason,

638
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,520
can you?

639
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,590
The last principle of Auction House

640
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,280
is that the final decision rests with us.

641
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,110
The price premium you pay

642
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,590
brings risks to Auction House.

643
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,000
Therefore, we refuse to accept the money.

644
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,920
To tell you the truth,

645
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,640
I've lived to this age,

646
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,400
but it's the first time I've heard

647
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,230
that money can't be accepted.

648
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,670
Well.

649
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,880
If you think the money is in excess,

650
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,350
you can donate it.

651
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,070
What do you think?

652
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,110
Ms. Ya Fei is extremely generous.

653
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,950
She must have many friends, right?

654
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,640
For instance, if you get to know

655
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,280
there are some new alliances

656
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,470
or some… some…

657
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,950
some new organizations,

658
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,800
or some new institutions,

659
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,680
you can just donate the money.

660
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,470
Auction House has no delivery services.

661
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,040
If you want to make some donations,

662
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,640
why don't you do it yourself?

663
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,550
Fine, fine.

664
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,230
You're forcing me to tell the truth.

665
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,190
I just want to contribute a bit

666
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:42,230
to the fight against Hall of Souls.

667
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,800
But certainly, they don't have to know

668
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,160
where the coins come from.

669
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,400
Anyway, I don't care.

670
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,800
You must accept these coins

671
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,800
whether you like it or not.

672
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,470
You have no choice.

673
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,600
Please excuse me.

674
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,680
You… You… You…

675
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,840
Xiao Yan, don't walk back and forth there.

676
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,150
You're blurring my eyesight.

677
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,000
It's the establishment day today.

678
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,600
Mr. Yao, do you think they will come or not?

679
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,470
Just focus on our end.

680
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,840
You'll fight the Hall of Souls if they come.

681
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,080
Will you not fight it if they don't come?

682
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,080
Their coming or not makes no difference.

683
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,800
Another bothered man.

684
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:45,710
I'm sorry.

685
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,630
Qingluan, don't worry. Master Fei will come.

686
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,560
I… I'm not worried.

687
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,950
Sword Sage and Shadow Domain Sage are here,

688
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,430
but they run into Master Fei.

689
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,950
- I'll go check it out.
- Masters, so do I.

690
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,710
See to their comfort.

691
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,600
OK.

692
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,560
