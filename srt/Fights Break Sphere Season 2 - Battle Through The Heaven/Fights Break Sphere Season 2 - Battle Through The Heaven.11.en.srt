19
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,400
Do you understand, senior?

20
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,080
This is the power
of the Hall of Souls.

21
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,910
I can kill you or save you.

22
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,550
I can even make you stay
in this dungeon

23
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,080
for the rest of your life suffering.

24
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,910
If I give you the Bone Spirit Cold Flame,

25
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,940
how can I be sure
that you won't lay your hands on me?

26
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,390
Yao Chen.

27
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,880
You're not so irredeemable.

28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
I really want to show the people
of the Central Plains

29
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,470
how the hero who once fought
against the Hall of Souls

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,240
bargained in front of me.

31
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,310
Tell me.

32
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,880
What are your conditions?

33
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,030
Power.

34
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,000
Didn't you say

35
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,030
that you could gain the power
of the Soul Lock

36
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,160
by feeding the formation left behind
by Hun Miesheng with Heavenly Flames?

37
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,470
I can submit to the Hall of Souls.

38
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,080
But I want to personally offer
the Bone Spirit Cold Flame to the formation

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,390
and see the power with my own eyes.

40
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,800
Yao Chen.

41
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,240
If I want to kill you,

42
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,800
I can do it anytime,

43
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,470
and I don't need to wait until now.

44
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,670
What?

45
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,440
Afraid I'll take your place?

46
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,000
Is this what you're feeding

47
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,080
with Heavenly Flames?

48
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,630
This is the root
of the Hall of Souls' eternal immortality.

49
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,630
This formation is the most powerful
secret skill of the Hall of Souls,

50
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,080
and the Master only teaches it
to his most trusted followers.

51
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,910
Even if the Master dies and falls,

52
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,790
the followers only need
to follow the Master's last orders

53
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,200
to find the Spirit Stone
buried by the Master,

54
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,760
collect the Heavenly Flames
to start the formation to feed the Spirit Stone,

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,950
and then

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
they will reacquire the unending power
of the Hall of Souls.

57
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,480
After being thoroughly tempered,

58
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,390
they would become
the next Masters.

59
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,200
So the reason why the Hall of Souls

60
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,200
cannot be annihilated
for thousands of years

61
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,550
is because of this set of formations?

62
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,670
And you use it
in exchange for evil techniques

63
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,670
to plunder others' Dou Qi
for cultivation?

64
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,440
I am the new and only Master

65
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,600
of the Hall of Souls.

66
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,390
You can't shake my position

67
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,550
even if you offer
the Bone Spirit Cold Flame to it.

68
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,670
No.

69
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm not interested
in your position at all.

70
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,110
Mu Gu.

71
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,000
Have you forgotten the might

72
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,350
of Hun Miesheng's dark power
back then?

73
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,230
He won't give up his position so easily,

74
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,880
just as you are now.

75
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,390
Is this formation
really set up for you to advance?

76
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,880
Beware of being used

77
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,070
and eventually being revolted.

78
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,640
No need for words.

79
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,630
Yao Chen.

80
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,720
If you don't agree today,

81
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,160
you won't be able
to leave here alive.

82
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,670
You can't afford to kill me.

83
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,550
You don't have
the Bone Spirit Cold Flame with you.

84
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,070
Mu Gu.

85
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,390
You're still so naive.

86
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,070
Xiao Yan!

87
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,920
You left the Heavenly Flames
to Xiao Yan!

88
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,760
Do you think
there's nothing I can do

89
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,160
since you left Heavenly Flames
to your disciple?

90
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,440
Yao Chen.

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,160
I'll get him back,

92
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,790
so you can watch him die
with your own eyes.

93
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,120
Father.

94
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,760
What did I tell you

95
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,760
when I sent you to the Xiao Family
back then?

96
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,400
You asked me to use the power
of my bloodline

97
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,110
to guard the ancient jade
of the Xiao Family.

98
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,670
If one day the Xiao Family falls

99
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,110
and is unable
to guard the ancient jade,

100
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,200
bring it back to the Gu Clan.

101
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,150
I'm glad you remembered.

102
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,400
You know the mission

103
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,230
of the Gu Clan on your shoulders.

104
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,880
I have not forgotten.

105
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,310
Kneel down.

106
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,200
Those in front of you are enshrined
memorial tablets

107
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,320
of the ancestors of the Gu Clan.

108
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,200
They're all martyrs
who have died fighting

109
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,350
against the Hall of Souls
in the last hundred years.

110
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,960
I want you to swear in front of them

111
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,910
that you didn't lie to me

112
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,710
about the ancient jade of Xiao Family.

113
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,430
Father.

114
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,790
I did lie to you.

115
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,710
It was true that the ancient jade of
Xiao Family had not been lost,

116
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,110
and it could not have been lost.

117
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,150
Xiao Yan has it.

118
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,550
Xiao Yan?

119
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,080
By what right could he
guard the ancient jade?

120
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,080
Because the ancient jade
was entrusted to him

121
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,880
by Uncle Xiao before he died.

122
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,910
Xiao Yan said he would guard it with his life.

123
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,790
He always keeps his promises.

124
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,910
He will definitely fulfill his promise.

125
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,800
Father.

126
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,470
It seems I was indeed wrong

127
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,960
to send you to the Xiao Family
in the first place.

128
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,710
You simply don't understand

129
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,790
that passion is never enough
for a lot of things.

130
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,790
But, father, you have never told me
what is so special

131
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,000
about the ancient jade of Xiao Family.

132
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,110
Why do you care about it so much?

133
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,590
The ancient jade of Xiao Family

134
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,440
would be the key to fighting
against the Hall of Souls.

135
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Against the Hall of Souls?

136
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,840
So what you care about

137
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,400
is not whether or not
the Xiao Family will topple,

138
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,550
but whether or not
the Hall of Souls will resurface?

139
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,280
Father.

140
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,000
Xiao Yan's master was captured by Mu Gu
of the Hall of Souls.

141
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,030
Xiao Yan is going
to the Central Plains

142
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,790
to destroy the Hall of Souls this time.

143
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,400
If the ancient jade of Xiao Family

144
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,230
can really help Xiao Yan
fight against the Hall of Souls,

145
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,230
shouldn't we let him own the ancient jade?

146
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,520
You have no idea how terrifying
the Hall of Souls is.

147
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,880
We've fought with Mu Gu.

148
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,550
Yes.

149
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,640
He is indeed a Powerhouse
of Dou Ancestor.

150
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,280
But Xiao Yan will surpass him
sooner or later.

151
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,150
What is frightening
is not Mu Gu's strength,

152
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:14,230
but the fact that the Hall of Souls
cannot be exterminated or killed off.

153
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,910
Thousands of years ago,

154
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,320
there were a total of eight clans
on the Dou Qi Continent

155
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,030
that were as powerful
as the Gu Clan,

156
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and one of them was the Soul Clan.

157
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,350
The Soul Clan had
a genius Dou Master.

158
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,440
He fancied himself
as the Huntian Emperor

159
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,350
and created his own set
of evil techniques,

160
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,960
which drew Dou Qi
from killing people.

161
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,640
It was this ambitious Huntian Emperor

162
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,910
who gathered a group
of murderous maniacs

163
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,350
and created the infamous organization
the Hall of Souls.

164
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,110
Huntian Emperor relied on

165
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,200
his cruel methods of plundering Dou Qi

166
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,710
to eventually break through
to a Demi Dou God,

167
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,760
only half a step away
from the peak of power.

168
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,950
Dou God?

169
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,840
But wasn't it said that no one had been able
to break through to a Dou God

170
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,590
in the Dou Qi Continent
for thousands of years?

171
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,550
Breaking through to a Dou God is
the ultimate goal

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,080
of Dou Masters
in the Dou Qi Continent.

173
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,960
Ever since the fall
of the last Dou God,

174
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,640
no one had been able to do so

175
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,880
for a thousand years.

176
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,080
With his arrogance and evilness,
Huntian Emperor advanced

177
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,150
to a Demi Dou God.

178
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,710
For the sake
of the final breakthrough,

179
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,400
he didn't hesitate to make enemies
of the powerful Eight Clans.

180
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,400
Countless powerhouses had fallen
because of Huntian Emperor,

181
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,280
yet still no one could stop him.

182
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,470
At the critical moment,

183
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,600
Xiao Xuan, the ancestor
of the Xiao Clan of the Eight Ancient Clans,

184
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,640
stepped forward

185
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,030
to fight Huntian Emperor desperately.

186
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,800
In that battle,

187
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,440
Xiao Xuan sacrificed himself

188
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,790
to finally seal
the demon Huntian Emperor.

189
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,200
Wait, father.

190
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,880
The Xiao Clan
is one of the Eight Ancient Clans?

191
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,520
I remember Uncle Xiao
said before he died

192
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,150
that the ancestors of the Xiao Family
came from the Central Plains.

193
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,350
Could it be that the Xiao Clan…?

194
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,030
This Xiao Clan

195
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,840
is different from the one of Wutan City
of Jia Ma Empire?

196
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,080
But my jade piece

197
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,030
is reacting to Xiao Yan's ancient jade.

198
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,550
That is Tuoshe Ancient Emperor Jade.

199
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,350
The ancient jade has only fallen
into the Xiao Family's hands.

200
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,840
Fallen?

201
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,430
Well.

202
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,470
Where is the Xiao Clan
of the Ancient Eight Clans now?

203
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,110
The final battle
between Xiao Xuan and Huntian Emperor

204
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,960
exhausted the strength
of the entire Xiao Clan.

205
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,520
Like the Soul Clan
that was victimized by the Hall of Souls,

206
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,400
the Xiao Clan declined.

207
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,670
Since then,

208
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,400
the Dou Qi Continent has been peaceful
for hundreds of years

209
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,760
until Hun Miesheng, the new leader

210
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,840
of the Hall of Souls appeared

211
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,150
more than 50 years ago.

212
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,710
He was using
the same evil techniques

213
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,550
as Huntian Emperor back then.

214
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,080
The Hall of Souls
was once again resurrected.

215
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,190
At that time,

216
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,520
the first person
to confront Hun Miesheng

217
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,790
was Medicine Sage
of the Starfall Hall.

218
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,320
Hun Miesheng seduced Elder Mu Gu,

219
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,590
the junior of Medicine Sage.

220
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,200
He defected to the Hall of Souls

221
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,110
and poisoned Medicine Sage
to death.

222
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,320
It turns out that the murder of Medicine Sage

223
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,350
was a conspiracy of Hun Miesheng
from the very beginning.

224
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,840
Exactly.

225
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,670
After the death of Medicine Sage,

226
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,320
Gu Clan united the elders of the four halls
and one tower in the Central Plains.

227
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,110
In the end, we sealed Hun Miesheng

228
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,440
under the ancient Bodhi tree
in the Central Plains.

229
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,080
We thought the Hall of Souls
had disappeared by this point.

230
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,840
But unexpectedly,

231
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,200
Mu Gu, who had disappeared
when sealing Hun Miesheng back then,

232
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,230
suddenly appeared.

233
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,710
He was still using the same evil technique.

234
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,110
The Hall of Souls was once again revived.

235
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,440
Mu Gu, Hun Miesheng,
Huntian Emperor.

236
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,840
What ties these three together

237
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,880
is the evil technique
of the Hall of Souls.

238
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,440
The chain that takes in Dou Qi.

239
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,080
A hundred-footed insect dies
but never falls down.

240
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,760
Nowadays, the only one
among the Eight Ancient Clans

241
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,150
that still maintains the strength
of a thousand years ago is the Gu Clan.

242
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,080
And only the Gu Clan might be able
to cut this chain off completely.

243
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:07,880
So, father, what you are worried about
is not Mu Gu at Dou Ancestor,

244
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,070
but the evil technique
of the Hall of Souls that he mastered.

245
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,430
With this,

246
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,110
one day, Mu Gu will most likely become

247
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,470
the next Hun Miesheng,

248
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,040
or even Huntian Emperor.

249
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,310
Father, if this is all true,

250
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,560
I have to tell Xiao Yan
about this right away.

251
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,670
He doesn't know

252
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,760
what he's about to face yet.

253
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,920
Xiao Yan had nothing to do
with you anymore.

254
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,760
Father, but…

255
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,600
The Xiao Family

256
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,280
has nothing to do
with you anymore.

257
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,160
Now you are the Clan Lady
of the Gu Clan,

258
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,310
Gu Xun'er.

259
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,160
I'm telling you everything that happened
thousands of years ago today

260
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,920
is so that you can understand

261
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,880
the responsibility
you'll shoulder in the future.

262
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,760
Fighting against the Hall of Souls is
a heavy responsibility

263
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,680
that only you and the Gu Clan
can accomplish.

264
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,000
Father.

265
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,760
In three days, go to the Gu Realm
to guard the Gu Clan Altar.

266
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,160
Take this opportunity to meditate
and train hard.

267
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,950
Don't take a step
outside the Gu Realm.

268
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,800
You guys go over there
and take a look.

269
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,950
Come back in two hours
for rotations.

270
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,150
Yes.

271
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,760
How did you know it was me?

272
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,110
You followed me all the way.

273
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,480
It's so obvious.

274
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,040
You did underestimate me,
Commander of the Black Submerged Army.

275
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,710
I didn't.

276
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,150
I…

277
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,430
I just…

278
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,880
I would like…

279
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,670
I…

280
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,760
Say it.

281
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,760
What happened?

282
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,160
Did the patriarch find out about your hiding
the truth of the ancient jade of Xiao Family?

283
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,520
Come here.

284
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,470
Who hid the truth of ancient jade?

285
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,950
I told my father everything
about the ancient jade.

286
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,430
But my father is now punishing me

287
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
for guarding the Gu Clan Altar.

288
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,830
I'm leaving in three days.

289
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,950
The altar is at the edge
of the Gu Realm.

290
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,040
The patriarch means for you
to have no more ties with the Xiao Family.

291
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,520
My father just told me

292
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,590
a lot of things about the Hall of Souls
that I didn't know before.

293
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,830
It turns out Mu Gu is much tougher
than we thought.

294
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,640
Xiao Yan's attempt to save Medicine Sage
will be very dangerous.

295
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I have to be with him.

296
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,310
I won't let you leave the Gu Realm
without permission.

297
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,680
I know this request will definitely put you
in a difficult position.

298
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,190
But, Gu Yao,

299
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:22,760
I don't know who else to ask for help here
but you.

300
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,720
Okay.

301
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,110
Since you believe me, do one thing now.

302
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,520
Say it.

303
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,470
Listen to the patriarch.

304
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,760
Three days later,

305
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,160
set off to the Gu Clan Altar.

306
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,880
Don't act rashly.

307
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,950
Leave the rest to me.

308
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,950
Put it here.

309
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,550
Tie it tight.

310
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,620
(Demon Flame Valley, Mercenary Camp)

311
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,550
Done here.

312
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:07,950
Take this.

313
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,520
It is so cold.

314
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,600
Exactly.

315
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,920
- Come on. Warm yourself up.
- Here.

316
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,310
My hands are frozen.

317
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,670
Why is it so cold?

318
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,160
(Little Fairy Doctor)

319
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,000
Someone is coming.

320
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,640
Who is that?

321
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,310
Where is the document?

322
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,790
Where are you going?

323
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,840
Demon Flame Valley.

324
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,560
What are you carrying in your arms?

325
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,400
Come with us.

326
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,710
Go.

327
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,000
Boss.

328
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
This woman carries private goods.

329
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,000
Where is the document?

330
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,120
Here.

331
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
(Demon Flame Valley)

332
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,070
You're from Demon Flame Valley?

333
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,720
Leave us alone.

334
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,760
I'll interrogate her.

335
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
- Yes.
- Yes.

336
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,110
Who is in charge
of Demon Flame Valley now?

337
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,040
Naturally the valley master.

338
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,830
Who is the valley master?

339
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,350
This thing in your hand
belongs to him?

340
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,430
Open it.

341
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,350
It is a Grade 7 elixir.

342
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,160
The master said that it could not be opened
before arriving at Demon Flame Valley.

343
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,280
Grade 7 elixir?

344
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,760
Go back and tell him

345
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,190
that it will be treated as a gift
for the mercenary group.

346
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,470
I owe him a favor.

347
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,230
We can get along well
with each other in the future.

348
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,350
Didn't anyone tell you

349
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,230
not to touch

350
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,710
other people's things?

351
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,470
Anyone? A witch!

352
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,880
Guards!

353
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,400
(Xie Shan)
I have dealt with all the people outside.

354
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,800
Who are you?

355
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,350
Who are you really?

356
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,470
You shouldn't have killed them.

357
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,950
Everything is going
according to the master's plan.

358
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,720
The next step is to

359
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,430
wait for the boy from Jia Nan Academy
to fall into the trap.

360
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,140
(Demon Flame Valley)

361
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,230
Demon Flame Valley.

362
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,950
Passing through
the Demon Flame Valley

363
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,910
is the teleportation formation
of the Central Plains.

364
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,500
(September 13.)

365
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,640
(Log updated to last night.)

366
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,350
(Nothing seems out of the ordinary.)

367
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,110
(There are no signs
of struggle anywhere.)

368
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,680
(It seems that these mercenaries)

369
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,400
(are only temporarily out on a mission.)

370
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,260
(No.)

371
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,610
(The sword is the life of a mercenary.)

372
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,880
(If they are out on a mission,)

373
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,070
(they will never leave the sword behind.)

374
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,500
(Emperor Seal Technique)

375
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,400
What?

376
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,990
The energy mobilized
by the Emperor Seal Technique is...

377
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,280
Fallen Heart Flame.

378
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,420
(Heavenly Flames Space)

379
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,270
Who is that?

380
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,190
Who are you?

381
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,110
Silly brat.

382
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,070
You ask me who I am?

383
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,400
Who are you?

384
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,920
Brat, are you still used
to the Fallen Heart Flame?

385
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,480
Your Highness.

386
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,880
Why are you here?

387
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,000
You don't even know you're dying.

388
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,310
Who is it? Come out.

389
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,790
Your Highness.

390
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,700
Didn't you leave already?

391
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,780
Why are you back?

392
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,300
Why should I leave?

393
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,000
We're not done yet.

394
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,780
Did you go to the Central Plains
with my permission?

395
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,900
I was trying to save my master.

396
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,860
So what?

397
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,180
The Central Plains is full of treasures.

398
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,420
Is saving him keeping you
from refining medicine?

399
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,980
So you came to remind me
to refine medicine?

400
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,660
Don't you appreciate it?

401
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,220
If I hadn't come, you'd be dead.

402
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,260
It hurts.

403
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,900
Your Highness.

404
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,860
Over there.

405
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,780
Back to you.

406
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,740
Who are you?

407
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,620
What did you do
to the mercenary group?

408
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,420
The blood is poisonous.

409
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,460
This woman is Poison Body.

410
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,540
Poison Body!

411
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,940
I'll kill her.

412
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,220
Wait.

413
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,060
It turns out to be a biting snake.

414
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,540
Don't run away if you dare.

415
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,780
I will remove your scorpion sting.

416
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,460
She brought us here on purpose.

417
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,300
Beware of traps.

418
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,500
I am not afraid of her.

419
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,500
Your Highness.

420
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,500
I am the target.

421
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,140
You go first. Here is the map.

422
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,460
Follow the route above.

423
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,980
Wait for me in the teleportation formation
to the Central Plains.

424
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,540
Don't need to tell me what to do.

425
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,100
So impulsive.

426
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,300
Come out, I know it's you.

427
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,780
Why should you hide?

428
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,260
You did nothing wrong.

429
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,020
You should live upright and aboveboard

430
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,300
like them under the sun.

431
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,700
Once Woeful Poison Body attacks,

432
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,740
everyone around will be poisoned,

433
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,580
without exception.

434
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,740
If you leave with me,

435
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,860
they will kill you too.

436
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,980
I don't want you to die.

437
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,700
I just want to show them

438
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,060
that I am the exception.

439
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,020
Have you had enough?

440
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,180
I was beaten by you last night,

441
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,220
and I can't just let it go.

442
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,940
The whole valley
is filled with miasma.

443
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,260
Even if you were
a Dou Ancestor before,

444
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,900
after breathing the miasma
for a night,

445
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,540
you won't be able
to reach the level of a mere Dou King.
