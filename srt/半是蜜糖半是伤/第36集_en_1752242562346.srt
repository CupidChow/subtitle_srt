1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,540
little bit of a

3
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,380
little bit of a

4
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,340
little bit of a

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,340
little bit of a

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,340
little bit of a

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,340
little bit of a

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,340
little bit of a

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,340
little bit of a

10
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,940
f

11
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:44,480
Like the

12
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:53,920
leaves that cut the fallen leaves

13
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,500
No.

14
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
Good morning.

15
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,080
Excuse me, what do you need?

16
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
All because of you

17
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,120
Why don't you tell me you're back here?

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,680
Yeah, I did

19
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,640
Yes

20
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,800
I got it

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,440
Thank you

22
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,400
Why do you suddenly think of

23
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,800
opening a flower shop here?

24
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,200
Maybe it represents a kind of

25
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,600
new hope.

26
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,040
Every flower

27
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,480
is a life that blooms again.

28
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,480
Although life is short,

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,760
when it blooms hard,

30
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,320
that kind of beauty

31
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,640
is the most beautiful moment.

32
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,640
I want to pass on this happiness

33
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,960
to everyone.

34
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
What about you?

35
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,400
Have you never been there?

36
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,600
Mr. Li,

37
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,520
are you going configured to work in our gentry office?

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,680
Everyone

39
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,480
is here.

40
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,320
You can rest assured,

41
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,280
Mr. Li.

42
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,640
Shall we go?

43
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:22,960
Sister.

44
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,520
I didn't care about anything

45
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
and wanted to get rid of you and Dad's agreement.

46
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,440
I thought that life

47
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,720
and that way of life

48
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,960
were not what I wanted.

49
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
In the end,

50
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,000
I just didn't have the courage

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,840
to face my true self.

52
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,200
So I lost.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,720
And I lost in a big mess.

54
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,760
If you feel painful,

55
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,720
then choose a way

56
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,280
to live a happy life.

57
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,600
That's the most important thing.

58
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
Do you remember what I said

59
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,000
before I left?

60
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,440
To truly love someone,

61
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,120
you have to give him what he needs.

62
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,840
Instead of thinking that he is a fool

63
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,800
and think he is a fool.

64
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,880
To tell you just how I think of you.

65
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,680
Oh my my my.

66
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,080
Those twinkling eyes.

67
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,320
There's where I start from and then.

68
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,840
Hey.

69
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,920
If I could write a song for you.

70
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,080
So that the world will sing it too.

71
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,960
Maple sand ring.

72
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,320
The canneries too.

73
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,280
Or draw in one symphony.

74
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,720
I don't know.

75
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,320
So baby sing.

76
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,960
Sing this love song I wrote for you.

77
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,320
There's tea in foreign tea.

78
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,720
Stop it.

79
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,400
It hurts.

80
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,920
Yang.

81
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,600
I...

82
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,120
Coming.

83
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,000
What's wrong?

84
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,160
What's wrong with her?

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,520
I...

86
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,920
Come in first.

87
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,480
Come in first.

88
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,040
Come in.

89
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,760
Yijie.

90
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,760
Come in.

91
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,520
What's wrong?

92
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,920
Yijie.

93
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,000
What's wrong?

94
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,200
What's wrong with her?

95
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,680
Be gentle.

96
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,200
I went to check her body yesterday.

97
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,240
Uncle Yu said...

98
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,360
Said what?

99
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,000
What did he say?

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,880
I'm so worried.

101
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,000
Lu Wu finally has a baby.

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,200
I'm so happy.

103
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,480
I want to be a father.

104
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,880
That's great.

105
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,680
I want to be a daughter.

106
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,360
I want to be a father.

107
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,800
I'm going.

108
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,640
Congratulations.

109
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,760
Xiaochuan.

110
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,400
If you're so experienced.

111
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,600
Help me to get some money.

112
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
I have something to tell her.

113
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,480
What's the rush?

114
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,160
Go.

115
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,520
Okay.

116
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
You're so fast.

117
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,000
You too.

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,640
Come on.

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,080
What about our war?

120
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,760
The next war.

121
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll go and clean up.

122
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,840
What's the name of this baby?

123
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,520
Li Shijian?

124
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,640
Or...

125
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,160
Li Kexuan?

126
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,600
Li Xibu Shijian.

127
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,640
Li Xibu Shijian?

128
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,720
Li Xibu Shijian.

129
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,440
Why don't you give it a longer name?

130
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,640
It's called Li Xiaochuan Xu Li.

131
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:47,800
Love's

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,880
I've actually tried to get General.

133
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,320
But I feel that he doesn't want to get married now.

134
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,280
Why?

135
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Have you asked him?

136
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,400
No.

137
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,400
Then why don't you ask him?

138
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,520
How can I ask him?

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,640
I said.

140
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
General, I want to marry you.

141
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,480
It's okay if he agrees.

142
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,440
What if he doesn't want to get married?

143
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,360
At that time, we two

144
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,720
It's going to be awkward.

145
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,400
How to face each other?

146
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Being questioned like this.

147
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,800
It's sure that a good relationship

148
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,080
There will be cracks.

149
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,280
When that time

150
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,400
I went to ask him to force marriage.

151
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,080
No.

152
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,800
I don't want to be his pressure.

153
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,400
Actually for me.

154
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,920
I and General

155
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,240
As long as we can be together

156
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,400
Marry or not

157
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,600
Just get that paper or not.

158
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,120
It doesn't affect our relationship.

159
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,200
Then I ask you.

160
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,080
Then why do you want to get married?

161
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,800
Just according to your logic.

162
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,320
Then the whole world will cancel

163
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,640
The marriage system is fine.

164
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,520
This person is different from person.

165
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
I and General

166
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,160
He doesn't need to get married.

167
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,440
This kind of thing to contract.

168
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,160
Actually, to be honest.

169
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,200
You are a coward.

170
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm a coward.

171
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,640
You are enough for me to go to heaven and earth.

172
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,240
I can do everything.

173
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,120
Then you propose.

174
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,440
I don't.

175
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,000
Then you are still a coward.

176
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,240
Forget it.

177
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,760
You are a scientific weirdo.

178
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Ordinary man.

179
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,760
You can't understand my thoughts.

180
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,960
Brother.

181
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,960
Such a long time.

182
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,360
Even I understand.

183
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,120
Women are the kind of animal

184
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,840
With a bad mouth and a bad heart.

185
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,560
Okay?

186
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,520
You are so smart.

187
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,240
How can you go to this place?

188
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,400
You are so stupid.

189
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,840
What do you mean?

190
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,040
In this aspect, brother.

191
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,680
Your brother and I

192
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,160
Are still people who have been through.

193
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,640
I know this kind of thing.

194
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,520
You can't understand.

195
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,400
So think about it.

196
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,840
At that time, I and Lily.

197
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,160
And Wang Cai.

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,520
We will definitely help you.

199
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,400
Right? Wang Cai.

200
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,920
Go. Go.

201
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,520
Go.

202
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,560
Is it too long

203
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,000
Not to clean up this bad boy?

204
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,000
Propose.

205
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,800
How about it?

206
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,720
Do you feel the power of life?

207
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,000
Sister.

208
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,400
Your pregnancy is not even obvious.

209
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,240
How can I feel it?

210
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,240
Feel it seriously.

211
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,880
How about it?

212
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,360
Is there a kind of

213
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,600
Holy power?

214
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,480
Do you like it?

215
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,000
Give birth to one.

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,720
In this case,

217
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,480
Our two children

218
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,680
Can we kiss the doll?

219
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,480
Don't talk nonsense.

220
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,720
We are not married yet.

221
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,000
And

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,720
Yuan Shuai and Xiao Chuan are cousin.

223
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,440
Our two children are also relatives.

224
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,520
How can we kiss the doll?

225
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,640
That's right.

226
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,400
You said you and Yuan Shuai

227
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,640
Have been together for so long.

228
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,880
When are you two going to get married?

229
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,160
To be honest,

230
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,880
I haven't thought about it yet.

231
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,320
No way.

232
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,840
You have to wait until you are old enough

233
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,960
Wait until Yuan Shuai runs away.

234
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Are you happy?

235
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,760
He won't.

236
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,320
This blind confidence is called self-confidence.

237
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
What are you afraid of?

238
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,080
If he runs away,

239
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,040
I still have you.

240
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,760
Just a bottle.

241
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,240
I'm serious with you.

242
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,560
I'm not kidding you.

243
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,160
I'm not saying I won't get married.

244
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,240
Isn't this...

245
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,200
Isn't this because he didn't propose to me?

246
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,240
Am I going to run over and ask him

247
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,520
When will he propose to me?

248
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,280
Ask him.

249
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,640
Forget it.

250
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,360
Who will run over and ask directly?

251
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,640
Me.

252
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,240
And then?

253
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,680
And then

254
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,600
Woke up the next morning

255
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,920
I found a record on my hand.

256
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,180
It's your part now.

257
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,720
Pass it to me.

258
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,040
This may be also your skill.

259
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,760
Rehearse again.

260
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,520
Get married

261
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,240
Shall I really let me work on asking him?

262
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,240
you'll be always on my good side

263
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,320
Mr. Zhang

264
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,000
Are you okay?

265
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,880
No

266
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,140
Take a rest

267
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,840
I won't tell you

268
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,600
if it doesn't hurt

269
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,740
I can resign

270
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,040
Thank you

271
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,100
I have a message for you

272
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,960
Give it to Mr. Luo

273
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,120
Ok

274
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,880
Take it

275
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,320
Call him

276
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,980
If Mr. Zhang can't do it

277
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,160
he can't be involved

278
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Welcome home.

280
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
Thank you.

281
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Since you're back,

282
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
let's get to work.

283
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
Let's go.

284
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,240
I'll take you to the same place.

285
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,240
There's something you should know.

286
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Huanfei Group plans to acquire the flashback printing

287
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,240
and has already given a price.

288
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
Do you think

289
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,240
we should buy the flashback printing?

290
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
We should.

291
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
The flashback printing is now 18 yuan.

292
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
We should buy it now.

293
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,240
The guarantee is probably 17% increase.

294
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,240
If we buy 3 million shares,

295
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
we can become the main capital.

296
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
The shareholder of Shimao Technology, Ma Nvke,

297
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,240
will become the new chairman of Yangsheng Electric.

298
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
He's a major investor.

299
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
If we buy it now,

300
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,240
the profit of the stock will exceed 442.

301
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
I don't think we should buy it now.

302
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,240
Why?

303
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,240
As far as I know,

304
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,240
the reason why the flashback printing was acquired

305
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
was because the three founders of the company

306
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
had internal power struggles.

307
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
The company's profit dropped for three consecutive years.

308
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
So I suspect this is a fake news

309
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,240
to deliberately raise the price of the flashback printing.

310
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Okay.

311
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
That's all for today's interview.

312
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
The interview results will be announced to you

313
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
through a message.

314
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
How is it?

315
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Is it realistic?

316
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
Yes.

317
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
In two years...

318
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
Wait.

319
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
There's a saying in Maya.

320
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
If you want to go back to a place,

321
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
you can bury the button there.

322
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
What's wrong with this place?

323
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Look.

324
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Anyway, the previous person did this

325
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,240
and stayed in MH.

326
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Susan,

327
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,240
the board...

328
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,240
I say, Susan,

329
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
why do you always hang your phone

330
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
in my office these days?

331
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
What are you laughing at?

332
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
What's the deal with you?

333
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
There's a woman outside.

334
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Boss, don't talk nonsense.

335
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
My wife is a woman.

336
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
How could I cheat?

337
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
Boss,

338
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
I forgot to tell you.

339
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
I got married.

340
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
I'm sorry.

341
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
No wonder.

342
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
You're like the second Chunyi.

343
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
I have to congratulate you.

344
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Congratulations.

345
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Boss,

346
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
you've been buying this diamond ring for a long time.

347
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,240
Have you not proposed to Jiang Jun?

348
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Why are you so hasty?

349
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,240
You're even hasty than my mom.

350
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
No,

351
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
the diamond ring is not preserved.

352
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
But it will be in the

353
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
top of the diamond ring.

354
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,240
You have to take the initiative

355
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
and be decisive in this kind of thing.

356
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
Take our Xinxin for example.

357
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
She always said that she wanted to be

358
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
an independent

359
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
and new generation woman.

360
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
She said that

361
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
she would never get married

362
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
if she couldn't support herself.

363
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,240
But when I proposed to her,

364
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
when I took out my ring,

365
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,240
I said,

366
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,240
will you marry me?

367
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
She didn't say anything.

368
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
She just said yes.

369
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
She was so happy to agree.

370
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Really?

371
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
Yes.

372
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Let me tell you.

373
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
I've tried it.

374
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
It didn't work.

375
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,240
It didn't work.

376
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
She...

377
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
She rejected you?

378
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
I rejected her.

379
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,240
It was a structural,

380
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,240
accidental,

381
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,240
planned,

382
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
and without a reason failure.

383
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
My dear boss,

384
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,240
why are you so down?

385
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,240
A single blow

386
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
can make a three-way fall.

387
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
What Lao Hua said is quite reasonable

388
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
and especially evil.

389
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
This kind of thing,

390
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
you have to do it with one blow.

391
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
You've done it.

392
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
You've never seen anything like this.

393
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
And you can't do it.

394
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
You're just a woman.

395
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,240
You have to do it with one blow.

396
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
You have to settle it.

397
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
Don't hesitate.

398
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
One blow.

399
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
Hello?

400
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Honey, I'm going on a business trip.

401
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,240
Help me pack my luggage.

402
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,240
We'll meet at MH, okay?

403
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
But I have work to do.

404
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
It's okay.

405
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
I've asked the bookkeeper to pick you up.

406
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
It's not far from our house.

407
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
It won't take too long.

408
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
Okay.

409
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
Hurry up.

410
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
I have something to do.

411
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
First plan completed.

412
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,240
Come on.

413
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Check if the light is on.

414
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
It's on.

415
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Okay.

416
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
I'll turn left a little bit.

417
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,240
A little bit to the left?

418
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Yes.

419
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Is it here?

420
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
Yes.

421
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Is this okay?

422
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
Almost.

423
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,240
Okay.

424
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Hurry up.

425
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
The first plan is done.

426
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
There's another one here.

427
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
The second plan is done too?

428
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Let's go.

429
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Let's go.

430
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
We can go now.

431
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,240
Let's go.

432
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,240
Let's go.

433
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
Hello, Chen Na.

434
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
What are you doing, Chen?

435
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,240
You asked me to wait for your file.

436
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
I've done it.

437
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
It's on my desk.

438
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
But I have something to do.

439
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
Ask Chen Yicheng to go to my office.

440
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,240
I'm talking to Chen Yicheng about the project.

441
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,240
Shouldn't you do

442
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
what you have to do now?

443
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Are you a little bit arrogant?

444
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
Send me your address.

445
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Send me the stuff in 30 minutes.

446
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
Okay.

447
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Su Chang.

448
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
I have something to do in the office.

449
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
Can you take me back to the office?

450
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
Then send me home.

451
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Okay.

452
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
Boss, it's up to you.

453
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
I'm sorry.

454
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,240

00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
Come.

564
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
You pick my phone.

565
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Come.

566
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,120
I'm sorry.

567
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,440
Baby.

568
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,440
Today I prepared

569
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,080
a cake for you.

570
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,000
Really?

571
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,840
I can't believe it.

572
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm so hungry.

573
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm full.

574
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,560
No.

575
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,200
Xia Wan.

576
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,760
Why...

577
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,320
Why don't you try it?

578
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,880
I prepared it for you...

579
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,800
The first time.

580
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,240
The first time.

581
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,520
Now it's the second time.

582
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,040
The second time.

583
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,680
You must try it.

584
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,880
Come on.

585
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,160
The first time.

586
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,520
The second time.

587
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,240
The third time.

588
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,080
The fourth time.

589
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,080
The fifth time.

590
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,880
The sixth time.

591
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
The seventh time.

592
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
The third time.

593
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,680
The third time.

594
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,000
You must try it.

595
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,120
Of course.

596
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,960
Xiao Jun.

597
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,960
Help me check

598
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,280
what this word means.

599
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,880
I've been looking for it for a long time.

600
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,600
No.

601
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,480
I've already done it.

602
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,800
Why don't you try it?

603
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,640
No.

604
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,680
No.

605
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,320
No.

606
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,920
When did you

607
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,960
close your eyes?

608
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,440
The third time.

609
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,160
The fourth time.

610
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,200
Gao Cai.

611
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,120
Come here.

612
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,480
Listen.

613
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,520
Your mom

614
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,960
is very smart.

615
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,360
Now,

616
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,880
I want to surprise her.

617
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,520
But I can't.

618
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,280
So we'll just leave it to you.

619
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,200
This time,

620
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,080
I'll count on you.

621
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,200
I'll count on you.

622
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,040
You know that?

623
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,000
OK.

624
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,640
Jiang Jun.

625
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,560
No matter how many times

626
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
in this life,

627
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,600
I'll definitely go.

628
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,640
Come on, Gao Cai.

629
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,520
See?

630
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,760
Take this ring.

631
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,880
Come on, Gao Cai.

632
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,320
Go.

633
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,800
Gao Cai.

634
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,120
Gao Cai.

635
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,640
Gao Cai.

636
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,080
Gao Cai.

637
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,040
You look so beautiful today.

638
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,120
Your state km

639
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,600
Definitely has better two- Often than never

640
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,400
Never because no one cares

641
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,320
Slippery

642
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,600
Always

643
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
You think

644
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,280
What I am

645
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,320
want more

646
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,800
That way

647
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
Your state,

648
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,280
For my mind

649
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,920
No.

650
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,720
I think

651
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,120
I feel that

652
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,800
my life is

653
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,400
very long.

654
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,080
But after being with you,

655
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,600
I feel that

656
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,640
my life is very short.

657
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,360
It's so short that I'm afraid.

658
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,160
I'm afraid that we don't have time

659
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,640
to do everything

660
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,160
we want to do.

661
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,120
If

662
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,040
I have the honor

663
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,040
to be your legal husband

664
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,160
for this lifetime,

665
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,960
then I'm willing

666
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,480
to use the remaining time

667
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,800
to help things

668
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,240
that aren't in your power

669
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,280
to protect you,

670
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,080
雙重你

671
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,160
and love you.

672
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,080
it's to show parents

673
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,600
that something is still going to happen

674
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,520
last night

675
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,800
told their kids

676
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,080
to come eat dinner with them

677
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,520
they said

678
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,480
They're so10 story

679
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,600
now like I'm getting older

680
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,640
I'm really growing up

681
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,840
no one自己 never taught them

682
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,320
they didn't couple

683
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
I realized

684
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:30,760
So I had in mind

685
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,560
I'm a kid

686
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,840
they wererop it

687
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,040
I've grown up

688
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,920
living the dream

689
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
I love you.

690
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
I love you.

691
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
I love you.

692
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
I love you.

693
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
I love you.

694
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,920
Jiang Jun.

695
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
I'm sorry.

696
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
I'm sorry.

697
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
I'm sorry.

698
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
I'm sorry.

699
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
I'm sorry.

700
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
I'm sorry.

701
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
I'm sorry.

702
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
I'm sorry.

703
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
I'm sorry.

704
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,920
I'm sorry.

705
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
I'm sorry.

706
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
I'm sorry.

707
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
I'm sorry.

708
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
I'm sorry.

709
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,920
Can't catch your light

710
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
You fly so high

711
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,920
Leave all the things behind

712
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,920
Hand up story

713
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,920
Leave all the love away

714
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,920
How about I avoid it for a while?

715
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Boss, I wish you a successful proposal.

716
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,920
Sister-in-law, I wish you happiness.

717
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
What's this?

718
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
This?

719
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
This is a lucky charm.

720
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
This is a goddess agreement.

721
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
As long as you sign it,

722
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
you will never run away in your life.

723
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
By the way, there is this.

724
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,920
This is a private company agreement

725
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,920
registered in your name.

726
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
I thought about it.

727
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,920
If you don't plan to work in the investment bank in the future,

728
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,920
I will resign with you as soon as you say a word.

729
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,920
By then, we will build a family

730
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
that belongs to our own small company.

731
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,920
You go out to be the boss.

732
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,920
You go make money and go home to support me.

733
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,920
You want to make me work for you?

734
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,920
All the money I make in the future is mine.

735
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,920
Even your whole person is mine.

736
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,920
All right, all right, all right.

737
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,920
My whole person is yours.

738
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
Come.

739
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Okay.

740
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Thank you.

741
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
Congratulations.

742
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
Congratulations, Mr. Jiang.

743
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
You are here.

744
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
Congratulations.

745
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
Long time no see, Ling.

746
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,920
Long time no see.

747
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
I'm here to deliver flowers.

748
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,920
Thank you.

749
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
Congratulations, Ling.

750
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,920
You did it.

751
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,920
It's so nice to see you happy.

752
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
We are both

753
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
happy, aren't we?

754
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Don't call her Jun Jun.

755
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,920
Call her sister-in-law now.

756
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,920
I won't.

757
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,920
I'll call her.

758
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
Bye.

759
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
Bye.

760
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Ling,

761
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
please

762
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,920
take good care of our Jun Jun.

763
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
Take care of him.

764
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
Or

765
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
even if you are the cousin of Xiao Chuan,

766
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
I will definitely take care of you.

767
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
Don't worry.

768
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,920
You are the one

769
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,920
who treats Xiao Chuan well.

770
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
Don't cry.

771
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,920
Come here.

772
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
It's still half an hour to five thirty.

773
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
We as a company

774
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,920
value the time we spend.

775
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
I've calculated it.

776
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
If we

777
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,920
rush to the Civil Affairs Bureau now,

778
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
we might be able to catch up

779
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,920
with the last batch of civil servants.

780
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
But

781
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,920
my household register is still with my mom.

782
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
I can't go to the Civil Affairs Bureau

783
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
without my mom's permission.

784
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
But

785
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,920
my household register is still with my mom.

786
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
Look.

787
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
What is this?

788
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,920
I, Yuan Shuai,

789
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,920
never fight

790
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,920
a battle without a winner.

791
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Why is my household register with you?

792
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,920
The first time I went to your house,

793
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,920
your mom gave it to me.

794
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Dad.

795
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
You...

796
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,920
What are you waiting for?

797
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Let's go.

798
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
There's one last thing.

799
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
Come on.

800
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Let's go.

801
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
Let's go.

802
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Let's go.

803
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Let's go.

804
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,920
I can't wait to

805
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,920
join in one symphony.

806
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
So baby sing

807
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,920
this little song I wrote for you.

808
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
Though it's I do

809
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,920
pray it's I'm ready to

810
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,920
and it is just the right now for you.

811
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
After this,

812
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,920
we're a real couple.

813
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
What are you laughing at?

814
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
Honey.

815
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
I can't hear you.

816
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
Honey.

817
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,920
Honey.

818
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
Look at you two.

819
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920
You haven't seen each other before.

820
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,920
You're still taking pictures?

821
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,920
You're still taking pictures of your wife.

822
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
Look here.

823
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
One, two, three.

824
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,920
I'm sorry.

825
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
Sorry, bro.

826
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
I'm gonna take a shower.

827
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
Hello.

828
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,320
Sorry, I forgot my wallet.

829
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,920
I'll send you my WeChat number.

830
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,760
Okay.

831
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,640
Okay, send it to me.

832
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,840
Your name is Si Lin?

833
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,320
Si Lin.

834
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,320
Si Lin.

835
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,120
What's wrong?

836
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,680
Nothing.

837
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,720
I just thought of two friends.

838
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,000
One is called Xiao Wen Jun,

839
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,960
the other is called Yuan Shuai.

840
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,360
So I met Si Lin again today.

841
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,720
I'll go now.

842
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,480
Enjoy your meal.

843
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,080
Thank you.

844
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,000
Thank you.

845
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,640
Jia Yuan Jie.

846
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,520
What's up?

847
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,360
I have something to tell you.

848
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,000
Can I not listen?

849
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,560
I haven't said it yet.

850
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,680
You don't want to listen?

851
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,520
Because every time you make this face,

852
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,920
you don't have any good things.

853
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,200
Are you sure you don't want to listen?

854
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,640
I'll listen.

855
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,880
Anyway, no matter what you say,

856
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,320
I, Jia Yuan Jie,

857
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,720
will be your life partner.

858
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,600
Only you.

859
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,480
I've been feeling a little uncomfortable recently.

860
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,000
I don't want to drive anymore.

861
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,440
I want you to find a driver for me.

862
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,720
Lend me to work overtime every day.

863
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,840
That's all?

864
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,240
Yes, that's all.

865
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,960
I thought it was a big deal.

866
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
Don't worry.

867
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,240
I'll definitely find you

868
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,360
a very good driver.

869
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,560
Don't you think

870
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,040
I'm being serious?

871
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,280
You're being dramatic.

872
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,800
I said you're usually

873
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,320
good at driving.

874
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,280
Why are you so stupid today?

875
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,640
You mean

876
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,040
you want me to be your driver

877
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,080
and give you a lift?

878
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,520
I...

879
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,440
I didn't say that.

880
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,000
That's what you mean?

881
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,120
That's what you mean?

882
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,780
Minister exposé?

883
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,260
Please, come and have a seat.

884
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,820
customize the push and pull of mine

885
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:03,680
Take photos

886
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,280
I want to be in the broadcast list...

887
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,060
to see the photos

888
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,140
You're the safest one so I'm your side.

889
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,880
You should hire me.

890
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,680
Really?

891
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,740
I'll keep you posted

892
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,860
I don't have faith in everything I hear

893
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,660
I'll make sure that everything is separated

894
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,100
Don't worry about it.

895
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,180
I understand

896
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,180
How about science and technology?

897
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,180
Hey, can you be serious?

898
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,180
Then science and technology?

899
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
You...

900
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,180
It's not impossible.

901
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,180
But I think

902
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,180
can you stay away from your Western culture?

903
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,180
This is not okay.

904
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,180
Then do you want to listen to my brother's suggestion?

905
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,180
Your brother's suggestion?

906
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,180
What is it?

907
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,180
My brother's suggestion is

908
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,180
our child is called Li Xiaochuan, Xu Li, the sister of love.

909
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,180
I'm with you.

910
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,180
If his handsome son is called

911
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,180
the handsome general's chessboard, then I agree.

912
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,180
Isn't it called Li Mi Hu?

913
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,180
I think you're like a model.

914
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,180
Then do you want to have this mask?

915
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,180
Mask can be a mask.

916
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,180
You have to think about the name of the child.

917
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,180
Think about the good things.

918
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,180
Or Li Ceng Wang?

919
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,180
Or Li Bian Li Dian?

920
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,180
Talk about him.

921
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,180
You're so serious.

922
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,180
It's really hard to get a name.

923
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,180
What's wrong?

924
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,180
What's wrong?

925
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,180
What's wrong?

926
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,180
I'm delusional.

927
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,180
I want to be a father.

928
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,180
I want to be a father.

929
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,180
I want to be a father.

930
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,180
I want to be a father.

931
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:25,180
I'm a dad now!

932
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,180
I'm a dad now!

933
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,180
You're a dad now.

934
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,180
So what should we call you?

935
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,180
What should we call you?

936
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,180
Hmm?

937
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,180
What do you think?

938
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,180
I'm hisroomsend jeweller.

939
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,180
I'm his Class of precocious sports ready.

940
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,180
I'm your father,

941
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,180
and I·ll play kid's minds on you also.

942
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,180
Please.

943
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,180
Let's pack.

944
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,180
Thank you.

945
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,180
Students originally trained like this.

946
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,680
ilde alltså FEMA.

947
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,540
The way I see,

948
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:48,180
it seems the way he gladly disappears is just rushing forward and disappointing us.

949
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,680
Pero,

950
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,560
What are you pushing?

951
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,200
You're so handsome.

952
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,440
What are you pushing? Don't touch me.

953
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,120
Jiang Chuai.

954
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,680
You can tell me lies.

955
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,680
You can make me cry.

956
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,680
You know why.

957
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,680
Never been so brave.

958
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,680
I will run away.

959
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,680
If it's what you want,

960
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,680
what you like,

961
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,680
I don't mind.

962
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,680
I can close my eyes.

963
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,680
I can stay behind.

964
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,680
I waste my time.

965
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,680
Walk into your plan.

966
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,680
Like I never knew you were not mine.

967
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,680
Make you satisfied.

968
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,680
Wear another mask.

969
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,680
You never realize things I do for love.

970
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,680
I think I'm tired.

971
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,680
I think I'm blind.

972
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,680
Don't know how to feel.

973
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Don't know how to heal.

974
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,680
You walk so fast.

975
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,680
Can't catch your light.

976
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,680
You fly so high.

977
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,680
Leave all the things behind.

978
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,680
And our story.

979
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,680
Leave all love nowhere to find.

980
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,680
I think I'm tired.

981
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,680
I think I'm blind.

982
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,680
Don't know how to feel.

983
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,680
Don't know how to heal.

984
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,680
You walk so fast.

985
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,680
Can't catch your light.

986
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,680
You fly so high.

987
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,680
Leave all the things behind.

988
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,680
And our story.

989
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:32,680
Leave all love nowhere to find.
