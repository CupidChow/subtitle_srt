Xiaochuan, Mr. Du and I will all be there.

As a member of West World,

20
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,450
you’ve got to be there, too!

21
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,160
You’re fed up with your job at MH, right?

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,970
You want to change your job so eagerly, right?

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,640
It’s just a weekend activity.

24

Why don’t you go as well?

25
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,760
You can see what Xiaochuan has achieved.

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,560
Then maybe your opinions

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,220
about West World will change.

I’m going to sleep.

You’re so early, Mr. Du.

your task today

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,360
is to keep Mr. Du company.

49
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,520
Xiaochuan and I will go and do something else.

50
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,760
Don’t you need my help?

51
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,400
That’s ok.

52
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,920
Let’s take a look over there.

53
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,200
So beautiful!

54
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,880
These are Moon Jellyfish.

55
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,010
Their bodies are transparent.

56
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,770
But when the light reflects against them,

57
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,370
they become very colorful.

58
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,040
I heard a story

59
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,120
about Moon Jellyfish long ago.

60
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,320
A long time ago,

61
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,829
the Earth had two satellites.

62
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,040
One is called Moon, and the other is called Zhou Star.

63
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,829
These two satellites loved each other.

64
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,280
One day, a meteorite was going to hit the Earth

65
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,000
and then the Moon would go out of orbit.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
To protect the Moon, the Zhou Star

67
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,440
dashed towards the meteorite without hesitation.

68
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,880
After the Zhou Star vanished,

69
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,640
the Moon shed tears.

70
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,400
The tears fell into the sea,

71
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,120
and became Moon Jellyfish over time.

72
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,000
Sometimes, humans do the same.

73
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,080
When you fall in love with someone,

74
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,560
you’ll protect that person at any cost,

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,320
just like the Zhou Star.

76
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,680
That's right.

77
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
So beautiful!

78
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,400
Have you heard about Stygiomedusa gigantea?

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,720
Stygiomedusa gigantea?

80
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
What a weird name!

81
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
They’re called ghosts in the ocean.

82
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,360
They live deep in the sea.

83
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,400
But that dark place with high pressure

84
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,440
is like a paradise

85
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,760
for them.

86
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,720
They like to live in darkness?

87
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,280
Maybe.

88
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,880
They’ve been evolving

89
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,680
over the long course of time.

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,260
Maybe they got used to it long ago.

91
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,280
But I think,

92
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,100
if they ever had a chance to see the sunlight,

93
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,450
they’d no longer want to

94
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,880
live in the dark deep sea,

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,530
and would strive to head toward the sunlight.

96
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,640
If I were them,

97
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,080
I’d do the same.

98
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,280

00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,420

105

109

and I’ll buy you a lollipop.

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,610
How is it?

111
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,720
Ok!

112
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,200
But what favor?

113

Did I hit the right person?

121
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,159
Where’s my lollipop?

122
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,520
Lollipop? Go away!

123
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,450
Didn’t you say you weren’t coming?

124
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
I came to buy fish.

125
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,280
Buy fish from an aquarium?

126
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,740
You have a problem with it?

127
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,200
No.

128
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,980
There’s something I want to correct.

129
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,760
Stygiomedusa gigantea is different from others.

130
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,200
There is a speculation that

131
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,520
they already lost their light sensors

132
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,600
in the process of evolution.

133
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,380
That means,

134
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,410
the dark deep sea

135
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,300
is the only place they can live in.

136
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,120
Just like certain people,

137
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,780
living in darkness suits them very well.

138
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,840
If Stygiomedusa gigantea seeks sunlight,

139
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,080
maybe they’ll develop new life mechanisms

140
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,760
to adapt to the environment.

141
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,560
Living in darkness

142
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,800
doesn't mean they can’t strive to
head toward the sunlight, right?

143
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,320
Seems Mr. Du knows a lot about

144
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,480
this venomous creature.

145
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
I know a little.

146
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,030
Then do you know what jellyfish

147
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,400
are the most venomous?

148
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,909
Chironex fleckeri.

149
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,360
They live in the northern coastal waters

150
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,789
of Australia and New Guinea.

151

Oh, right.

I also want to ask you.

What are the world’s smallest jellyfish?

Irukandji jellyfish.

160
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,680
Their umbrellas are only 1.5 cm in diameter,

161
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,960
and resemble the shape of a cube.

162
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,120
They are mainly found at Great Barrier Reef,

163

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,080
Is everyone here?

176
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,080
They should be here very soon.

177
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,720
After they finish the registration,

178
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,180
they’re going to watch a dolphin show first.

179
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,440
And after that,

180
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,440
they’ll start dating each other

181
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,640
in different areas.

182
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,450
What about the 100% matched users?

183
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,760
They're going to meet each other

184
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,400
in the Beluga Whale Area.

185
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,290
Don't worry.

186
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,100
The Lion’s Mane jellyfish are the largest in the world.

187
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,460
The Immortal jellyfish can rejuvenate.

188
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,880
What the heck do you mean?

189
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,120
Don’t you know what I mean, Mr. Du?

190
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,160
I really don’t...

191
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,760
Guys!

192
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,180
You came to root for Li Xiaochuan,

193
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,400
not to kick up a fuss, right?

194
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,130
Here you are.

195
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,760
Mr. Du.

196
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,200
Thank you.

197
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Come closer to me!

198
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,680
Just give him the water.

199
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't get too close to him.

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,920
You're a girl. Do you know that?

201
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,650
I’m a girl...

202
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,180
Understand? Understand?

203
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,610
Mr. Du doesn’t even want the water.

204
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,520
Hello?

205
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,640
Du,

206
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,940
dad is in the hospital.

207
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,640
Can you come take a look at him?

208
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,840
What happened to dad?

209
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,370
He suddenly passed out at home.

210
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,520
Now he’s receiving the emergency treatment.

211
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,650
Send me the address.

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,260
What happened, Mr. Du?

213
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,320
I have an emergency.

214
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,200
I need to go.

215
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,720
Please tell this to Xiaochuan.

216
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,000
Ok.

217
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
You can leave now.

218
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,040
This way!

219
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,200
I know.

220
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,640
Are you satisfied now?

221
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,280
Yes, I am.

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,520
Dear users of West World,

223
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,570
the dolphin show is about to begin.

224
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,810
Please go to the dolphin show area now.

225
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,480
Let’s go.

226
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,600
What?

227
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,800
Watch the show.

228
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,640
This way!

229
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,680
Is she an idiot?

230
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,680
Thank you very much

231
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,320
for making time to attend

232
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,200
this one-day offline dating activity

233
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,080
of West World.

234
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,440
I wonder if you have found

235
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,640
the person that matches you the best

236
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,840
during the free time just now.

237
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,800
Seems you're very shy.

238
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Now be brave.

239
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,040
West World is a platform for you

240
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,840
to find your only true love.

241
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,740
Next up,

242
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,160
please go to the romantic dating areas

243
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,200
prepared for you based on

244
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
your different degrees of matching

245
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,440
and start your date.

246
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,520
I wish that all of you

247
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,120
can encounter the one meant for you.

248
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,800
Let's take action now.

249
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,040
Move away!

250
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,440
I thought children cannot

251
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,890
sign up for an account of Xiaochuan’s app.

252
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,360
Don’t tell me you've got a match?

253
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,760
How... How is that possible?

254
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,880
I came to help as a friend.

255
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,840
You've got a match?

256
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,180
You’re kidding me?

257
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,440
I haven't even used the app.

258
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,160
I just came to take a look.

259
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,840
-I’ll go to Li then.
-I’ll go to Xiaochuan then.

260
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,880
See you later.

261
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,480
Why are you still here?

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,200
You owe me a lollipop!

263
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,260
Still remembering the lollipop?

264
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,410
I don’t have lollipops.

265
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,450
No money. I only have a heating pad.

266
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,440
What? What?

267
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,360
You’re the user who's got a 100% match,

268
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,960
Juno?

269
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,000
This is making me feel so uncomfortable.

270
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

271
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,300
What about now?

272
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,080
Of course you should go in.

273
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,480
You’re single anyway.

274
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,960
What if Xiaochuan's app

275
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,720
has found the person

276
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,520
meant for you?

277
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
But I don't want to attend a blind date.

278
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,810
What am I going to say to him?

279
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,600
Just go inside first.

280
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,080
You’re the only female user

281
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,000
that’s got a 100% match.

282
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,040
Your data is really important

283
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,960
to Xiaochuan.

284
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,120
Please.

285
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,250
You’re the best.

286
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,040
I won’t go.

287
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,280
Just go.

288
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,560
Go.

289
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,400
Jiang Jun,

290
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,800
I’ll buy that bag you saw last time for you.

291
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,600
That's a deal!

292
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,600
What a gold digger!

293
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,320
So,

294
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,250
you're the one that's got a 100% match?

295
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,880
It's me.

296
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,840
Wait.

297
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,400
You didn’t trust my app, did you?

298
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,740
I was doing this for your sake.

299
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,880
You brat.

300
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,120
Take this.

301
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,960
You can find the parts

302
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,560
where I think you can improve

303
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,040
based on my recent experience using it.

304
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,360
You can refer to them.

305
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,120
By and large,

306
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,800
there’s something good about your app.

307
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,760
Keep it up.

308
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,890
Thank you, Brother.

309
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,520
Keep it up.

310
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,840
By the way,

311
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
I’m not going to attend the activity

312
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,010
for the 100% matched users.

313
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,700
See you.

314
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,400
No!

315
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
You two are the only two users

316
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
that are 100% matched.

317
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,730
You have to go there.

318
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,970
Will you force me if I’m not willing to?

319
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,920
You’ll have to go there this time

320
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,960
even if you want to upload that video.

321
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,420
Just go!

322
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,400
Hello.

323
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,320
Dear Ms. Juno,

324
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,600
you’re going to be late.

325
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,060
It’s not polite to be late.

326
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,560
Hello.

327
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,560
Hello.

328
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,400
Dear Mr. Zeus,

329
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,840
being late will leave her with a bad impression.

330
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,800
Don't be timid.

331
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Don't procrastinate.

332
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,320
Don’t try to run away.

333
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,560
Please follow the rules of the game.

334
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,920
Please follow the rules of the activity.

335
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,380
Don’t leave arbitrarily.

336
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,060
Please put on the blindfold and go in.

337
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,960
Ok. Thank you.

338

[West World One-day Date]

339
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,980
Xiaochuan,

340
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,160
we’ll be able to see the scene

341
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,040
when the two 100% matched users meet

342
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,160
through here, right?

343
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,240
Xiaochuan,

344
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,400
don't be too surprised later

345
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,800
when you see the scene.

Please sit down for a while.

518
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,680
Ok.

519
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,680
Boss! Boss!

520
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,360
Why didn’t you knock on the door? So impolite.

521
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,480
Xinxin is here.

522
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,000
How could you allow this to happen?

523
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,530
No, Boss!

524
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,130
I didn't expect she’d come.

525
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,680
Can...

526
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,680
Can you help me one last time?

527
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,280
One last time. One last time.

528
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,640
Take her to my office then.

529
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
What are you doing?

530
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,300
Drawing the curtains.

531
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,240
Why are you drawing the curtains?

532
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,800
I don’t dare to usher her in.

533
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,200
I think you should go and usher her in.

534
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,840
After all, I’m the ED.

535
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,930
I’m afraid she’d find out the truth

536
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,410
if I went to usher her in.

537
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,560
Come here.

538
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,520
You punk!

539
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,760
Thank you, Boss!

540
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,280
Go to the Accounting Office later

541
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,560
and get 6 months’ salary deducted.

542
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,520
Thank you, Boss!

543
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,840
A year!

544
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,860
Ms. Xinxin.

545
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,520
Yuan?

546
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,320
Hello.

547
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:23,920
Hello.

548
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,640
You want to see Mr. Su, right?

549
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,960
Come, this way.

550
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,400
Ok.

551
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,520
Let me help you.

552
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,360
Ok. Thank you.

553
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,680
No problem. This way.

554
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,760
Yuan, where is Mr. Su?

555
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,840
He’s in the office. Let me take you there.

556
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,660
[Reception Desk]

557
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Oh my! What’s going on?

558
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,700
[New Message]

559
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,660
[Look, Mr. Yuan just came
to welcome a girl personally.]

560
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,120
Oh my!

561
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,520
Mr. Yuan just came to

[They’re passing by the office area now.
What’s going on?]

welcome a girl personally.

564

They’re passing by the office area now.

[How come Mr. Yuan is ushering a girl in?]

566
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,440
Do you know what’s going on?

567

[Oh my!
Mr. Yuan just came to welcome a girl personally.]

568
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,580
Did you see that? Did you see that?

569
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,440
Look! Look!

570
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,770
Right. What’s going on?

571
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,240
How come Mr. Yuan is ushering a girl in?

572
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,720
What a rare scene!

573
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,640
Ms. Xinxin, this way.

574
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,040
Hello.

575
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,120
Hello.

576
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,760
Wait.

577
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,080
Where is Ms. Jiang?

578
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,280
She went to a client’s company.

579
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,680
She’ll be back later.

580
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,760
I see.

581
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,240
I also brought some food for you two.

582
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,100
Thank you, Ms. Xinxin.

583
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,120
This way.

584
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,640
Oh my! Who is this girl?

585
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,280
Mr. Yuan is so polite to her.

586
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,560
There’s only one reason for this.

587
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,040
It must be that Mr. Yuan

588
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,360
landed a key client on his own merits.

589
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
Not necessarily.

590
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,080
She looks so young.

591
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,540
She could be the daughter of a key client.

592
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,360
That makes sense.

593
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,720
Mr. Yuan is so handsome.

594
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,700
He should take advantage of that.

595
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,040
Seems that

596
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,360
Mr. Yuan also needs to make use of
his good appearance.

597
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,000
Cut the gossip.

598
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,170
It’d be bad if Mr. Yuan heard it.

599
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,190
Like we don’t know?

600
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,440
Mr. Su, Ms. Xinxin is here.

601
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,560
Honey.

602
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,840
Let me know in advance if you come again.

603
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,190
I got it.

604
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,520
Again?

605
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,960
No again.

606
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,520
I was wrong, Boss.

607
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,920
Mr. Su, I’ll leave if there’s nothing else.

608
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,200
Yuan...

609
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
Ms. Jiang is here.

610
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,890
Ms. Xinxin is here, too.

611
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,320
The thing I wanted to tell Mr. Su

612
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,200
is actually not very urgent.

613
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,440
I’ll excuse myself then.

614
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,120
Wait!

615
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,080
I’ve also brought lunch for you.

616
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,000
Come eat with us.

617
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,040
And Yuan.

618
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,280
-Ok then.
-Ok.

619
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,280
Thank you.

620
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,160
Yuan, I’m thirsty.

621
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,480
Get me some water.

622
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,600
Ok, Ms. Jiang.

623
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,120
Ms. Jiang,

624
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,000
you and Yuan

625
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,320
are having an office romance.

626
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,240
Is it exciting?

627
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,400
Ms. Jiang, slowly.

628
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
Don’t choke.

629
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,920
Not bad.

630
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,000
You're shy?

631
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,040
Really.

632
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,440
Hurry! Eat up!

633
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,320
Ok.

634
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,280
Yuanyuan,

635
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,440
open it for me.

636
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,600
You call him Yuanyuan?

637
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,920
So sweet.

638
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,000
Of course.

639
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,920
Yuanyuan is very caring.

640
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,080
He’d separate meat and vegetables for me,

641
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,280
and I don’t eat carrots and soybeans.

642
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,320
He separates them for me every time.

643
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,280
Am I right?

644
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,200
So caring.

645
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
How come there are so many soybeans?

646
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,120
And there. There’s one more.

647
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,240
I'm not blind.

648
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,010
Ms. Jiang, enjoy your food.

649
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:10,840
Thank you.

650
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,160
I dropped my chopsticks.

651
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,800
Yuanyuan, pick them up for me.

652
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,400
Ok, Ms. Jiang.

653
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,340
Please, Ms. Jiang.

654
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,040
I don’t want to use chopsticks anymore.

655
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,280
How about…

656
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,240
You feed me?

657
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,640
It’d be my honor to feed you.

658
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,600
By the way, Ms. Jiang,

659
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,600
I heard from Su Chang that

660
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,200
he has a boss

661
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,120
who’s very difficult to handle.

662
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,490
He’s very fierce when he punishes people.

663
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,720
Right!

664
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,680
He’s very fierce,

665
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,200
narcissistic and cocky.

666
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,280
I don’t dare to mess with him either.

667
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,640
So exaggerating?

668
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,560
I heard from Su Chang that

669
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,880
he’s still single

670
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,240
even at his age,

671
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,680
and he was always envious of Su Chang.

672
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,320
He’s so evil-minded.

673
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,000
He must be very ugly-looking.

674
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,040
Maybe he’s even bald.

675
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,280
Besides,

676
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,040
since he has such a high position,

677
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,680
it’s so bizarre that he doesn't

678
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,040
even have one woman around him.

679
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,280
So I guess,

680
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,360
could it be that he...

681
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,440
Honey,

682
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,760
the food is getting cold.

683
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,960
Hurry and have some.

684
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,560
Ms. Jiang,

685
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,400
Su Chang doesn’t really think

686
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
before he speaks sometimes.

687
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,660
He tends to offend people.

688
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,140
Especially when his leader bullies him,

689
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,800
I hope you can

690
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,320
do something to help him.

691
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,040
How is that possible?

692
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,080
Mr. Su is the most likable person

693
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,480
in the company.

694
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,760
His boss and subordinates

695
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,760
all like him very much.

696
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,680
He’ll never get bullied.

697
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,520
Right, Mr. Su?

698
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,600
Right.

699
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,880
And now with your support,

700
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I’m sure

701
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,800
Mr. Su will take his career

702
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,080
to the next level.

703
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,820
It’s getting late.

704
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,800
I need to go to a nail salon with my friend.

705
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,840
You keep chatting.

706
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,680
I should get going.

707
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,210
Bye-bye.

708
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:54,960
Bye-bye.

709
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,280
Oh, Honey.

710
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,560
My friend wants to

711
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,850
eat with us tonight.

712
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,120
Her husband came back.

713
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,720
He always wanted to meet you.

714
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,800
Don't forget this.

715
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,680
I’ll be there if I’m still alive by then.

716
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,200
Nothing...

717
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,130
I’ll see you off.

718
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,880
Mr. Su!

719
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,120
I have something to tell you.

720
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,280
Let Yuanyuan see her off.

721
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,080
Yuanyuan,

722
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,240
go.

723
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,720
Ok, Ms. Jiang.

724
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,080
Ms. Xinxin, please.

725
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,120
This way.

726
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,280
Yuan, you can go back.

727
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,120
Print this and inform everyone.

728
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,560
Ok.

729
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,400
Work hard.

730
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,360
Keep it up.

731
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,320
Ok, Ms. Xinxin.

732
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,680
I’m leaving then.

733
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,320
Ok.

734
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,840
Bye-bye.

735
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,040
Hello.

736
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,760
I’m the VP of MH, Qiao Na.

737
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,720
Which company do you represent?

738
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,850
I’m not a client.

739
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,420
I came to see my boyfriend.

740
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,490
Your boyfriend?

741
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,300
Yuan Shuai?

742
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,240
No! No!

743
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,440
Please don’t misunderstand.

744
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,960
Yuan already has a girlfriend.

745
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,240
I’ve been working with him for many years.

746
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,120
How come I don't know he has a girlfriend?

747
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,200
Can you tell me who she is?

748
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,080
Anyway, try to stay away from them..

749
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
If she knew you find out her secret,,

750
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,500
she’d give me a hard time at work..

751
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,720
I... I don’t know who she is.

752
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,960
That’s just what I’ve heard.

753
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,800
I have something else to do.

754
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,060
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

755
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,460
Love Is Sweet
