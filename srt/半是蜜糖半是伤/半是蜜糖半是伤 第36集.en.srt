6
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,080
Hello, what can I do for you...

7
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,930
Why didn’t you tell me you are back?

8
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,000
I told you.

9
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,720
Right.

10
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,320
I received your flowers.

11
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,720
Thank you.

12
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
Why did you suddenly think of

13
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,610
opening a flower shop here?

14
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,730
Maybe it's because the flowers represent

15
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,440
new hope.

16
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,960
Every flower

17
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,360
is a new life.

18
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,320
Its life cycle is very short,

19
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,720
but when it is trying to bloom,

20
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,900
it looks so beautiful.

21
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,360
And that’s its best moment.

22
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,120
I want to pass on

23
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,920
this happiness to everyone.

24
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,840
What about you?

25
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,860
How are you doing in MH?

26
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,560
Linda,

27
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,320
I suddenly felt ridiculous.

28
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,360
I was desperate

29
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,640
to get rid of you and dad.

30
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,269
I felt that the way of life

31
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,560
and the way of survival

32
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,950
were not what I wanted at all.

33
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
In the end,

34
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,860
I just didn't have the courage

35
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,760
to face who I really was.

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,040
So I lost.

37
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,720
And I lost it all.

38
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,440
If you feel miserable,

39
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,360
choose to live in a way

40
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,040
that makes you happy.

41
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,360
That's all that matters.

42
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,040
Do you remember what I said to you

43
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,800
before I left?

44
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
To truly love someone

45
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,880
is to give him what he needs,

46
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,380
-not what I think
-not what I think

47
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,600
-he needs.
-he needs.

48
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,180
[[The first day after my period leaves.
I don't miss it at all.]

49
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,360
Stop.

50
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,360
I'll get some more sleep.

51
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,960
Don't scratch me. I'm wrong.

52
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,640
Itchy. I…

53
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,800
Coming!

54
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,760
How is…

55
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,180
-She…
-What’s wrong with her?

56
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,440
I… I…

57
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,000
Come in. Come in first.

58
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,720
Come in.

59
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,560
Li.

60
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,760
Come in.

61
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,659
What’s wrong with you?

62
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,880
Li, what’s wrong with you?

63
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,140
What’s wrong with her?

64
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,360
Take it easy.

65
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,040
I went for a check-up yesterday

66
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,120
and the doctor said…

67
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,200
What?

68
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,700
What did the doctor say? I’m worried.

69
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,200
I’m pregnant!

70
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,840
Really?

71
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,370
I'm going to be a father!

72
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,880
That's great! That's great!

73
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,240
I'm going to be a father!

74
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,680
I know. Congratulations to you.

75
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,520
Xiaochuan,

76
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,170
if you're so energetic,

77
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,400
you could walk Wealth for me.

78
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,600
I need to speak to her alone.

79
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,200
What are you still doing? Go.

80
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,440
Ok.

81
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,000
More efficient than me.

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,800
You go as well.

83
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,040
Let’s go.

84
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,640
What about our war?

85
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,460
We'll have it another day.

86
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,720
I'll go.

87
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,520
What shall be my child’s name?

88
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,000
Li World

89
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,000
or

90
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,880
Li Science?

91
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,320
Li West World.

92
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,120
Li West World?

93
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,130
Then you might as well choose a longer name

94
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,600
and call it Li Xiaochuan · Xu Li ·
The Crystallization of Love.

95
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,760
Isn’t this good?

96
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
I’m just too happy.

97
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,960
Look at you.

98
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,680
Yuan Shuai,

99
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,240
well,

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,480
you've been with Jiang Jun for so long.

101
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,560
Have you

102
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,909
ever thought of marrying her?

103
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,679
I actually sounded out Jiang Jun once.

104
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,520
But I have a feeling that

105
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,150
she doesn't really want to get married
right now.

106
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,200
Why is that?

107
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,020
Have you asked her?

108
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,120
No.

109
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,280
Then why didn't you ask her?

110
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,080
How can I ask?

111
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,320
Should I say

112
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,480
I want to marry you, Jiang Jun?

113
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,260
It'll be ok if she says yes.

114
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,470
What if she doesn't want to get married?

115
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,960
Wouldn't that be awkward

116
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,240
for both of us?

117
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,170
How will we face each other?

118
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,920
If I ask her like that,

119
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,400
cracks are sure to appear

120
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,920
in our relationship.

121
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,400
Then should I force her to marry me?

122
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
No.

123
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,720
I don't want to pressure her.

124
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,120
In fact, for me,

125
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,880
I just want to be with Jiang Jun.

126
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,520
Whether we get married or not

127
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,480
is just a matter of getting that piece of paper,

128
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
which will not affect our feelings.

129
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,960
Let me ask you,

130
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,120
why do people need the marriage license?

131
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,360
If your logic works,

132
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,640
wouldn't it be better

133
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,840
if the whole world abolished marriage?

134
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,280
People are different.

135
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,280
Jiang Jun and I

136
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
just don't need

137
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,320
a marriage license to bind us.

138
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,040
To put it bluntly,

139
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,200
you're just a wimp.

140
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,880
I’m a wimp?

141
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,160
I am resourceful

142
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,960
and omnipotent. How come I’m a wimp?

143
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,360
Then ask her to marry you.

144
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,120
No.

145
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,810
So you are a wimp.

146
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,920
Never mind.

147
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,360
You science freak and mortal,

148
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,800
just can't understand my thoughts.

149
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,720
Yuan Shuai.

150
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,600
It's been a long time.

151
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,060
Even I understand that

152
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,440
women are such duplicitous creatures.

153
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,480
Ok?

154
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,960
You're such a smart guy.

155
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,760
How can you be so stupid

156
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,120
in this matter?

157
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,600
What do you mean?

158
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
In this matter,

159
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,720
I’m more experienced.

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,120
I know

161
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,680
this can't be put off.

162
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,160
So think it over.

163
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,560
I'll be there for you, along with Li

164
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
and Wealth.

165
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,320
We’ll help you.

166
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,360
Am I right, Wealth?

167
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,840
Ok. Let’s go.

168
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,120
Isn't it too long

169
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,080
since I taught this boy a lesson?

170
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,040
Proposal?

171
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,600
How’s that?

172
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,520
Do you feel the power of life?

173
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,000
Li, you belly doesn’t show a sign yet.

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,040
How can I feel it?

175
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,360
Be serious and feel it.

176
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,480
How’s that?

177
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,960
Is there

178
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,040
a divine power?

179
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,880
Like it?

180
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,680
Then have a child of your own.

181
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,360
That way,

182
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,940
we can arrange their marriage to each other.

183
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,740
Don't talk nonsense. We're not married yet.

184
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,680
Besides,

185
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,440
Yuan Shuai and Xiaochuan are cousins,

186
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,000
and our children will also be related.

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,240
How can we plan their marriage to each other?

188
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,320
You are right.

189
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,280
You and Yuan Shuai have been together
for so long.

190
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,340
When are you two going to get married?

191
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,520
To be honest,

192
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,440
I haven't thought about it.

193
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,840
Oh, come on.

194
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,320
Do you have to wait until you are old,

195
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,480
and Yuan Shuai ran away,

196
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,680
don’t you?

197
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,560
He won’t.

198
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,400
Blind confidence is called arrogance.

199
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,760
I have nothing to worry.

200
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,480
If he runs away,

201
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,720
I still have you.

202
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,680
How eloquent you are.

203
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,920
I'm telling you this is serious.

204
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,280
I'm not kidding you.

205
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,900
It's not like I won’t get married.

206
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,840
It’s just that

207
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,560
he has not asked me to marry him.

208
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,780
Am I going to ask him

209
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,000
when he's going to propose to me?

210
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,800
Then ask.

211
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,080
Come on. Who would do that?

212
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Me.

213
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,720
And then?

214
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,200
And

215
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,250
when I woke up the next morning,

216
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,760
I found a diamond ring on my finger.

217
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,640
Maybe that's your thing.

218
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,440
Feel it again.

219
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,760
Getting married?

220
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,760
Should I take the initiative and ask him?

221
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,200
Ms. Jiang.

222
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,480
Ms. Jiang is back.

223
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,480
Yes.

224
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,240
It's good to be back.

225
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,860
Sure enough, I still don't want to
leave you behind.

226
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,920
Welcome home.

227
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,880
Thank you.

228
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,480
Now that you are back,

229
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,040
you must set to work at once.

230
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,160
Let’s go.

231
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,600
I'll take you to a place you know.

232
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,200
There’s one thing that you've heard.

233
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,800
Huanfei Group is planning to
buy Shanhui Pictures

234
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,480
and has made an offer.

235
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,280
Do you think MH

236
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,480
should buy the stock of Shanhui now?

237
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
Yes.

238
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,960
Shanhui Pictures is now trading at 18 yuan.

239
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,690
If we buy now…

240
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,210
The most conservative estimation is that

241
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,520
there should be an increase of 17 percent.

242
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,720
If we buy three million shares,

243
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,960
we will become the main capital.

244
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,680
Ma Yuke, the major shareholder
of Shimao Technology,

245
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,840
will become the new chairman of Yangsheng Power.

246
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,170
He is a master investor.

247
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,280
If we buy now,

248
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,680
earnings per share will exceed HK $442.

249
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,800
I don't think we should buy now.

250
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,920
Why is that?

251
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,760
As far as I know,

252
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,960
Shanhui Pictures would be sold

253
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,680
because of a power struggle
among its three founders

254
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,000
that led to three years of falling profits.

255
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,130
So, I suspect this is fake information

256
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,200
intended to boost

257
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,000
Shanhui Pictures' stock price.

258
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,400
Ok.

259
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,120
That's all for today's interview.

260
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,600
The interview result will be sent to you

261
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,640
via a message.

262
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,900
How's that?

263
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,280
Did that make you think of your old times?

264
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,840
Yes. It’s…

265
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
Wait!

266
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,040
The Mayans had a saying that

267
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,520
if you want to go back to a place,

268
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,040
bury a button there.

269
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,290
What is that?

270
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,320
Does it work?

271
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,000
Anyway, the last person who did this

272
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,320
stayed in MH.

273
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,320
Su Chang,

274
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,480
the Board…

275
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,840
Su Chang.

276
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,880
Why are you always holding your mobile phone

277
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,360
and laughing in my office these days?

278
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,760
What are you happy about?

279
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,880
Are you up to something shady?

280
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,600
You got a woman out there?

281
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,290
Boss, will you stop talking nonsense?

282
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,120
I'm so obsessed with my wife.

283
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,360
How could I cheat?

284
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,200
Boss,

285
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,120
I forgot to tell you.

286
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,080
I proposed and succeeded!

287
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,760
No wonder.

288
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,850
That explains why you are so happy.

289
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,349
Well, congratulations.

290
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,480
Congratulations.

291
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,040
But Boss,

292
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,829
it’s been a long time
since you bought the diamond ring.

293
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:16,160
Haven't you proposed to Jiang Jun yet?

294
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,880
Why are you all

295
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,000
so anxious?

296
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,000
You’re more anxious than my mother.

297
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,800
It’s not that.

298
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,960
Diamonds don't have a shelf life,

299
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,040
but they can get dusty.

300
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,860
You have to be proactive and decisive
in this kind of thing!

301
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,120
Take my Xinxin for example.

302
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,370
She always said that she wants to be

303
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,480
an independent woman in the new era,

304
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,000
and that she will never get married

305
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,760
before she has the ability to support herself.

306
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,960
But when I proposed

307
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,320
and took out the ring,

308
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,960
and before I asked her

309
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,280
to marry me,

310
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,040
she nodded her head wildly.

311
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,440
Really?

312
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,960
Really.

313
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,960
I'll tell you what.

314
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
I tried,

315
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
but failed.

316
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,560
Failed.

317
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,680
She… She…

318
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,600
She turned you down?

319
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,120
No.

320
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,920
It’s

321
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,680
a structural,

322
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,200
accidental,

323
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,960
planned,

324
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,080
and causeless failure.

325
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,960
My dear Boss,

326
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,400
you are just unlucky.

327
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,360
You’d better get it done in one vigorous effort.

328
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,280
The old saying makes sense,

329
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,960
and it works especially well.

330
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,640
In this case,

331
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,440
you have to pull out all the stops

332
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,480
and get it done.

333
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,210
What kind of things haven't you experienced?

334
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,280
Is there anything else in the world
you can't handle?

335
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,040
This is only about one woman.

336
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,570
You have to try your best

337
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,320
and get it done.

338
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,480
Don’t hesitate.

339
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
Let’s do it!

340
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,720
Do it!

341
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,900
[Yuan Shuai]

342
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,080
Hello.

343
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,200
Honey,

344
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,840
I'm gonna go on a business trip in a sudden.

345
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,440
Can you go home and help me pack up?

346
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,520
After that

347
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,760
we'll meet in MH.

348
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,840
Okay?

349
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,240
But I still have work to do.

350
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,520
That's ok.

351
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,200
I have asked Su Chang to pick you up.

352
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,560
It's not far from our apartment anyway.

353
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,620
It won't take long.

354
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,080
Ok.

355
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,460
Hurry up. I have work to do.

356
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,880
Step one finished.

358

359
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,320
Yes.

360
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:07,800
Ok.

361
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,440
Look.

362
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,170
A little to the left.

363
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,000
A little to the left?

364
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,400
Yes.

365
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,080
Here?

366
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,920
Yes.

367
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,920
Is this ok?

368
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,120
Ok.

369

Hurry up.

370

371
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,880
There’s one more.

372
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,320
Step two finished.

373
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,890
Let’s go.

374
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,320
Ok.

375
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,240
Let’s go.

376
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
We can go now.

377
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,240
Done.

378
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,520
Hello, Qiao Na.

379
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,000
What are you doing, Jiang Jun?

380
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,060
Do you know I'm waiting for your file?

381
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,520
I have had the file ready.

382
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,480
It's on my desk.

383
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,480
But I'm out of the office on something.

384
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,680
Please ask Chen Yicheng
to pick it up from my office.

385
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Chen Yicheng and I
are out negotiating over a project.

386
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,400
Shouldn't you be doing

387
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,760
your job right now?

388
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,640
Are you a little complacent?

389
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,560
I'll give you an address.

390
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,000
Get it to me in 30 minutes.

391
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,280
Ok.

392
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,440
Su Chang,

393
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,120
I left something in the office.

394
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,400
Could you turn around and go back to the office

395
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,280
and then drive me home?

396
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,160
Ok.

397
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:34,960
Boss,

398
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,600
it’s up to you now.

399
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,880
I'm going to propose.

400
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,360
Honey.

401
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,080
Today, I prepared an after-dinner cake

402
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,480
specially for you.

403
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,600
Are you crazy? A cake at night?

404
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,920
Do you want me to get fat?

405
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,680
I’m full.

406
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,100
-Wash the dishes.
-No.

407
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,960
Why don't you have a try?

408
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,730
I made it specially for you.

409
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,440
The first time,

410
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,400
I failed.

411
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,440
This is the second proposal.

412
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,720
The second time.

413
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,360
I must succeed.

414
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
Come on!

415
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,040
What are you doing?

416
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,850
The second time,

417
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,800
I failed.

418
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,900
This is the third time.

419
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,840
I must succeed.

420
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,920
Come on!

421
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,680
Jiang Jun.

422
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,080
Can you help me find out

423
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,240
what this word means?

424
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,040
I've been looking up for hours,
but I can't find it.

425
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,440
I think I lost my contact lenses.

426
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,900
I'm going to the bathroom.

427
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,400
No.

428
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,120
No.

429
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,930
When did you start to wear contact lenses?

430
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,280
The third time,

431
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,840
I failed.

your mom

436

is very careless.

Now

438
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,520
it’s unlikely

439
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,240
to surprise her.

440

Let’s use the old-fashioned way.

441

This time,

442
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,920
I’m counting on you.

443
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,520
Counting on you. Ok?

we once missed each other for ten years

because of a misunderstanding.

In the ten years,

I could only miss you.

464

It felt like my life was incredibly long.

But with you,
