00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,720
whether he lives in me or he is scared

3
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
Episode 16

4
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,440
Come in.

5
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,400
Mr. Du,

6
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,840
the purchase loan from Brazil

7
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,760
has been approved by Shen Pi.

8
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,880
Did you get it from Director Liu?

9
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,920
Yuan Shuai had talked to Director Liu before.

10
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,040
He asked him to say hello.

11
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,600
The follow-up cooperation is very high.

12
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,800
The materials are submitted

13
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,760
according to their requirements

14
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,680
and will be approved soon.

15
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,800
Did I finish the form you sent me?

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,960
This is...

17
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,680
Zhang Qing,

18
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,240
please be more professional in your work.

19
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,360
Yuan Shuai is a member of Ji Yi now.

20
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,600
I think you should

21
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
know your relationship with him

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,760
and need to avoid it.

23
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,040
This project is a match.

24
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,960
How can you let

25
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,600
the competitors of the company know it?

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,600
No.

27
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,760
We just had a meal

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,840
with Director Liu.

29
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,240
But this is not the first time.

30
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,200
The last time the trend was to let them get married,

31
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
you thought the company

32
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,240
had no one to talk to?

33
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,040
Right,

34
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,400
only the public

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,320
would talk about it.

36
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,280
People who don't know

37
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
will think that the business of an online Mom and click맒

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,440
never experienced the benefit of it.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,720
If you know it,

40
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,200
will you still perceive her?

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,880
That's the other way around.

42
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,800
I taught you a lot of words.

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
and the patient's blood pressure.

44
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,760
After you go back,

45
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,080
you can re-shape

46
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,440
the data of the patient's case.

47
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,120
Give me a photo of the baby on Wednesday.

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,160
Okay.

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,760
And,

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,000
please come to me

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,080
if you have any problems in the future.

52
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,720
After all, the host you are now

53
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,120
is me, not him.

54
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,920
I see.

55
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,560
Luo Mei,

56
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,720
Mr. Jiang was scolded.

57
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,160
Yeah.

58
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,000
It's rare to see Mr. Du get so angry.

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,200
I heard that the secretary

60
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,640
didn't dare to send the documents this afternoon.

61
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,800
He was afraid that he would be re-shaped.

62
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,640
I heard that

63
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,080
Mr. Jiang and Mr. Yuan,

64
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,400
and the client,

65
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,360
had a meal together.

66
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,520
I think it's not a big deal.

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,280
What is he doing?

68
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:20,880
Let me tell you something.

69
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,720
I'm kind of angry.

70
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,720
Mr. Du is not in a good mood today.

71
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,440
He's still talking to Mr. Jiang.

72
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
Be careful not to get fired.

73
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,720
You're right.

74
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,560
Honey,

75
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
I'll wait for you to get off work.

76
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,920
Okay.

77
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,560
Single.

78
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,040
Come in.

79
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,680
Everyone is gone.

80
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,520
You're still here?

81
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,280
I have something to do.

82
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,040
You can go back first.

83
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,160
Okay.

84
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,840
I'll go now.

85
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,520
Go home early.

86
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,440
Bye.

87
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,960
Bye.

88
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,160
Mr. Jiang.

89
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,480
soluufei,

90
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,680
listen carefully.

91
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,080
Please announce it to the reporters.

92
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:51,580
Hello, Secretary Li has рокed in the

93
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
second round by the secretary team.

94
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,440
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
Don't mention it.

96
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,960
Mr. Du knew that you helped me

97
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,840
solve the problem of Mr. Liu.

98
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,920
So he scolded me for a day.

99
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,480
He didn't tell me.

100
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,640
He even told me to

101
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,040
sort out all the information

102
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,000
about the Bingo case.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,440
I wrote a report to him.

104
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,800
I don't want to

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
work overtime this week.

106
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
What did he say?

107
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,160
He said I don't know how to avoid suspicion.

108
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,880
But he was right.

109
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
Who told me to work hard

110
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,560
to keep the company from being divided?

111
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,760
I was wrong to scold embeddedils Crystal.

112
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,240
I bossed it to make fun of tease him on the first day.

113
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,360
Since Mr. Liu said

114
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,760
that they had some problems,

115
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,640
there was a responsibility

116
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,440
to dedicate our time

117
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,400
to how to solve it.

118
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,920
I told my boss

119
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,320
not to give us the price

120
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,200
of졌ing him the way I did.

121
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,160
Our business trees

122
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,920
are melts at the center of crystal.

123
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,320
So to pay back the apology,

124
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,240
it can only be done on the way.

125
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,840
Mr. Du told me

126
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,280
that there's a normal combination

127
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,240
between doing nothing

128
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,160
and spending loads of money.

129
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,240
Beside doing nothing,

130
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,440
Why don't you resign?

131
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,760
Stop it.

132
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,880
I'll support you in the future.

133
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,520
I have a big appetite.

134
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,160
Aren't you afraid that I'll eat all your food?

135
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,240
I'm just kidding.

136
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,720
You'll find out

137
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,040
when you're free

138
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
and want to eat it all.

139
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,640
It's just a joke.

140
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,920
Really?

141
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,880
I know

142
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,520
you're always at work.

143
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,720
Actually,

144
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,120
I've been supporting you.

145
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,760
I just don't want to see you suffer.

146
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,600
I won't suffer if you're here.

147
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,440
Let's call me when we arrive.

148
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,600
Shen Xing's case

149
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,040
is going according to the plan.

150
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,760
Shen Xing,

151
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,360
send me an advance report.

152
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,040
Okay.

153
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,160
Dr. Chen,

154
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,320
give me the assessment report

155
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,200
of Rong Da before work.

156
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,240
Thank you for your hard work tonight.

157
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,160
If there's nothing else, we'll call it a day.

158
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,840
Why do you look so pale?

159
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,880
Are you okay?

160
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,360
Did you offend Mr. Du recently?

161
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,240
Why did he give you so many projects?

162
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,400
I think you can't even finish living in the company.

163
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,960
No.

164
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,600
It's all normal work arrangements.

165
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,920
At this time,

166
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,400
do you want to eat something?

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,880
Go ahead. I'm not hungry.

168
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,920
I have work to do.

169
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay.

170
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,880
I'll go first.

171
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,240
3 meals a day.

172
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:54,960
General.

173
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,240
General.

174
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,720
Dr. Chen.

175
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,040
How is he getting on?

176
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,080
Don't worry.

177
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,120
The initial diagnosis

178
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,680
is a concussion caused by acute pulmonary cancer.

179
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,680
It should be

180
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,680
long-term overwork

181
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
and unregulated.

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
You can stay in the hospital for a few days.

183
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,560
Thank you, doctor.

184
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,400
You're welcome.

185
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,280
Are you satisfied now?

186
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,800
It's an unreasonable project.

187
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,040
You worked so hard

188
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,560
and had an invalid meeting.

189
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,320
Du Lei,

190
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
did you do this because you were jealous?

191
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,600
Why are you so childish?

192
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,720
I know.

193
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,640
You're worried about him being sick.

194
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,720
But a miscalculation like yours

195
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,840
will only make people think

196
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,200
you're the childish one.

197
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,920
I'm sorry, Mr. Du.

198
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,480
It's off-work time now.

199
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,360
Mr. Du has no reason to stay here.

200
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,960
I'm his boyfriend.

201
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,640
I'll stay and take care of him.

202
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,880
I'm his boss.

203
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,200
His family is sick.

204
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,120
It's my job to worry about him.

205
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,680
Xiao Jun.

206
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,280
How are you feeling?

207
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm thirsty.

208
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,080
Here.

209
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,440
Drink slowly.

210
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,840
How are you feeling? Are you feeling better?

211
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,920
I'm sorry, Mr. Du.

212
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,400
I'm late for work.

213
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,000
Don't say that.

214
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,480
You're already possessed by capitalism.

215
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,400
You should be sent to the hospital.

216
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,800
Otherwise,

217
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,920
who will he be possessed by?

218
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,800
It's not your problem.

219
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
I've put too much pressure on you recently.

220
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,360
Have a good rest.

221
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,560
I'll take care of the company now.

222
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,080
When you're recovered,

223
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,120
come back.

224
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,360
You...

225
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,080
You should have a good rest.

226
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,520
You'll feel dizzy after work.

227
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,040
Your body is the foundation of revolution.

228
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,080
Do you know that?

229
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,480
I was busy and didn't pay attention to the time.

230
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,520
I forgot to eat.

231
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,760
Here, have some more.

232
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,240
You should take a rest

233
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,560
and eat on time.

234
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,280
Come on.

235
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,160
I'm fine.

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,120
It's just like taking an anti-blood guys runs.

237
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,040
My arms and legs are healthy.

238
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,120
Don't treat me like an old patient.

239
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,000
What did you say?

240
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,560
Anti-blood?

241
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,960
Ms. Du,

242
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,760
how long have you been ill?

243
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,160
From the morning until now,

244
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,960
I haven't been able to take any doctor.

245
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,360
Big sister, do you know that if you have acute gastritis,

246
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,360
it's very likely that it will cause a concussion due to the water and the environment.

247
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,760
If it's severe, it's very likely that you will die.

248
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,960
If you are allowed to eat and rest on time, you are always on time.

249
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,760
You wash three cups of coffee every day and treat yourself as an iron.

250
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,360
If I wasn't by your side, you would have already fallen.

251
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,960
This is your next weekly diet.

252
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,560
Take a good look at it. If you have any questions, you can ask me.

253
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,760
Yuan Shuai, you are not able to eat well, right?

254
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
If I eat like this for a week, I will get fat.

255
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
It's not effective.

256
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Next, I will prepare for you today's fifth meal.

257
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:27,360
Honeydew and soybean

258
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,480
You're here again.

259
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,120
You came to this hospital because you were mad, right?

260
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,560
Remember.

261
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,480
Chief Wang,

262
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,260
I'm glad I found

263
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,700
the biopsy which can help me live long.

264
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,660
Thank you.

265
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,260
Don't mention it.

266
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,020
Do you do anything videos?

267
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,020
Actually

268
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,620
I have a computer for recommended disease treatment.

269
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,680
No.

270
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,240
Jiang Jun,

271
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,880
you're a patient now.

272
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,680
Any work will affect your rest.

273
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,920
Do you understand?

274
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,400
And,

275
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,000
if you make a mistake,

276
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,520
you'll be punished.

277
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,720
What punishment?

278
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,240
So annoying.

279
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,600
Go to sleep.

280
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,120
I'll be here.

281
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,720
Good night.

282
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,240
Good night.

283
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,520
Good night.

284
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,400
Good night.

285
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,400
Where do you want to sleep?

286
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,160
You...

287
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,160
I know you haven't used the holiday.

288
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,080
So,

289
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,200
I've asked your Mr. Du

290
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,760
to take a seven-day holiday.

291
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,800
These days,

292
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,080
you should stay at home

293
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,680
and rest well.

294
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,640
I know you care about me.

295
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,760
But it's not good

296
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,360
to ask for a leave directly.

297
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,400
Brother.

298
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,840
What's wrong with you?

299
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
Why didn't you tell us

300
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,720
you were sick?

301
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,200
Mr. Yuan, go to work.

302
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,120
We'll take care of him here.

303
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,560
I'll talk to Xiaochun.

304
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,480
You can go to sleep.

305
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,240
I'll go to sleep.

306
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,840
Okay.

307
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,440
Okay.

308
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay.

309
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll go to buy some food

310
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,800
and some chicken

311
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,760
and cook for you tomorrow morning.

312
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,720
I'm relieved to see you.

313
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,800
Good boy.

314
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,800
I'll go to work.

315
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,240
Bye.

316
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,360
Bye.

317
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,320
Take care of him.

318
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,360
Take care of him.

319
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,440
Brother Yuan, eat something.

320
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,600
No.

321
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,160
How do you feel now?

322
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Are you still uncomfortable?

323
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
I'm fine.

324
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,240
I'm fine.

325
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,960
Yuan Shuang insisted

326
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,320
me to rest for a week.

327
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,160
He's right.

328
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,200
You can rest now.

329
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,440
Okay.

How have you been?

337
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,500
OK.

338
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,320
You look pretty.

343
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,160
Take a little longer

344
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,200
to get some facial masks.

345
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,320
You know, you're The Best.

346
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,040
One more thing.

347
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,960
I'm so upset.

348
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,320
Shao Hao.

349
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,200
Sister-in-law, have some watermelon.

350
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,680
Thank you.

351
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,440
What are you talking about?

352
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,880
You don't need to know

353
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,680
the secret of a woman.

354
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,800
What secret? I want to know.

355
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,280
The watermelon is too cold.

356
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
I don't want you to eat it.

357
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,960
I'll get you something else.

358
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,280
Okay.

359
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,080

Sorry?

365
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,780
I'm so annoyed today.

366
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,280
What should the meeting room for?

367
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,400

371

Can't you think a little about it?

383
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,100
Make it 23 minutes,

384
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
then clean it.

385
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,300
Jiaojiao.

386
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,460
Jiaojiao, I've been preparing for the whole night.

387
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,020
Listen,

388
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,060
I have a friend

389
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,820
who's in her safety period.

390
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,380
You're awake.

391
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
You're awake.

392
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,620
Why are you up so early?

393
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,980
Did you not sleep well?

394
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,180
What's wrong?

395
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,140
Doctor.

396
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,780
What's wrong?

397
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,380
I'm hungry.

398
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,180
I'll go buy you something to eat when you're hungry.

399
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,220
What do you want to eat?

400
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,660
Lobster.

401
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,340
Lobster.

402
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,140
Sleep for a while.

403
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,380
Wait for me.

404
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,580
Don't worry.

405
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,900
We've already told the accounting department

406
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,620
about the report of Huayun Group.

407
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,860
We'll still do it

408
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,660
according to your instructions.

409
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,860
I'll handle it at the

410
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,580
Procuratorate of Human Resources.

411
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,340
Thank you so much, Mr. Du.

412
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,140
We've prepared some small gifts

413
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,340
for you.

414
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Okay.

415
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,180
Since you're sincere,

416
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,180
I won't be able to do it.

417
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,180
The account number is the same as before.

418
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,580
I'll wait for you.

419
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,580
Okay.

420
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,580
I'll wait for you.

421
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,580
Okay.

422
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,780
Here.

423
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
I'll get going.

424
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,460
Mr. Du.

425
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
Is there anything?

426
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,660
The information about SKO

427
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,060
is urgent.

428
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,180
When did you come?

429
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,460
I've been standing outside for a while.

430
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,380
You...

431
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,660
If there's an emergency next time,

432
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
knock on the door.

433
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,820
Okay.

434
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,580
Get back to work.

435
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,020
Okay, Mr. Du.

436
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,780
What's up?

437
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,780
How's Zhang Jun?

438
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
He's fine.

439
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,580
He just wants to

440
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,500
pay more attention to the food.

441
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,820
How's it going over there?

442
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:22,320
It's very

443
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
refreshing.

444
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,600
I've been standing here

445
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,820
for so long.

446
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,380
How about you keep the PC on for a bit longer?

447
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,020
Near the monitor.

448
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,020
Then I'll...

449
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,220
You're not home?

450
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,660
I don't.

451
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,780
Why did you do it?

452
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,960
I don't know.

453
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,340
Wen Wei, what's the matter?

454
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
asaki.

455
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,240
W e wel po ecd

456
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,940
What does this mean?

457
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,300
I'll go with you today if I see you again

458
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,020
wait

459
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,340
Come and talk to you

460
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,300
Let's go back first.

461
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,140
Long.

462
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,660
Let's go back together.

463
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,780
I...

464
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,980
I do have some questions.

465
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,940
I should have thought about it earlier.

466
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,820
No.

467
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,980
What are you talking about?

468
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,140
I know it.

469
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,180
Know what?

470
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,820
About your pregnancy.

471
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,980
You shouldn't have played with me.

472
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,020
Yuan Shuai, I...

473
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,900
Okay.

474
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,180
From now on,

475
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,260
we are a family of four.

476
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,740
We are a family of four.

477
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,540
I'm going to be a father.

478
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,700
I'm going to be a father.

479
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,900
I'm going to be a sister.

480
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,180
Tell me.

481
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,460
What should our child be called?

482
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,060
Call him Yuan Cong Ming.

483
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,820
Yuan...

484
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,940
Yuan Shuai.

485
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,540
It's a misunderstanding.

486
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,700
I...

487
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,300
I think I was...

488
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,060
I'll go deal with it.

489
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,700
Just now,

490
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,700
you can't be a sister.

491
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,300
I can't be a father either.

492
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,020
What do you want to say

493
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,740
about this pregnancy incident?

494
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,660
I...

495
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,940
It's just a misunderstanding.

496
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,780
Do you want to hear my opinion?

497
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,980
Jiang Jun.

498
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,300
I'm sure that

499
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,540
you are the one I want to spend the rest of my life with.

500
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,100
So I will respect all your decisions.

501
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,460
From now on,

502
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,220
you can still work in the investment bank.

503
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,140
But consider the overall strength.

504
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,300
I think the fixed profit of Ji Yi

505
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,460
is more suitable for you.

506
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,460
So you can continue

507
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,220
your favorite job.

508
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,660
You won't work so hard like you do now.

509
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,620
As for the baby,

510
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,060
just let it go.

511
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,180
Why are you suddenly thinking so much?

512
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,580
It's not sudden.

513
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,060
I've been thinking for a long time.

514
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,740
Why are you so nice?

515
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,420
When you're ready,

516
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,820
let's build our own family.

517
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,020
It will be very happy.

518
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,780
Okay.

519
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,180
Qing Yin, hello. Are you here to see the diamond ring?

520
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,860
There's an activity recently.

521
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
Yes.

522
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,380
May I ask if you brought it yourself or did you give it to someone?

523
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,580
Which finger?

524
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,380
I'm giving it to my girlfriend.

525
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,780
I don't have a name.

526
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,180
Qing Yin, may I ask what size ring your girlfriend is wearing?

527
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,580
It's probably about the same size as this steel.

528
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,980
Qing, this is not accurate.

529
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,180
I suggest that you tell me your girlfriend's finger size.

530
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,980
I can recommend you a size.

531
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,580
But it's best to take your girlfriend to our offline store

532
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,180
to test it on the spot.

533
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,380
But we have to make an appointment first.

534
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,380
Then we can provide you with a customized diamond ring.

535
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,580
I know. I'll make an appointment first.

536
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,780
Okay, Qing.

537
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,380
You're not going to steal my girlfriend's ring.

538
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,380
Don't you want to steal my girlfriend's ring?

539
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,980
I won't steal your girlfriend's ring.

540
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,580
It's all yours.

541
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,580
Why is the SQ's price going down?

542
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,980
I'm sorry, Mr. Du.

543
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,580
I've already arranged for someone to investigate it.

544
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,580
But right now, there's no concrete news.

545
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,780
That means...

546
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,780
We don't even know where the enemy is right now.

547
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,180
How about this?

548
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,380
I'll explain to the client.

549
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,980
You have to find out the truth about this.

550
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,380
But within three days,

551
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,980
if you can't find the person who leaked the information,

552
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,980
you should know who's responsible for this.

553
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,180
Okay, Mr. Du.

554
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,180
I'll do it right away.

555
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,780
The news has finally reached the first eight pages of the map.

556
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,780
Take a look at this document.

557
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,580
Okay, thank you.

558
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,580
Let's eat.

559
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,580
Try your boyfriend's love bento that he prepared for you.

560
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,580
Eat first.

561
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,980
Do you have anything else?

562
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,780
Put down your things.

563
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
What are you looking at?

564
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,580
If you don't eat, it'll only reduce your work efficiency.

565
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,780
Don't mind me.

566
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,180
This is very important to me.

567
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:54,980
Be good.

568
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,980
We eat while we're still alive.

569
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,580
If you eat too much, it'll only interfere with your digestion.

570
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,780
Okay? Be good.

571
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,780
Just eat one bite.

572
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,780
If you can't find the person who leaked the information,

573
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,580
and there's no result,

574
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,980
I'm afraid the company will blame you.

575
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,780
But we can't tire them out.

576
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,580
I think Mr. Du will do this.

577
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,780
Don't mind me.

578
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,580
I'll do it right away. You eat first.

579
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,180
Okay.

580
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,180
Look at that.

581
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,980
Let me see.

582
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,380
Hurry.

583
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,780
Hurry up.

584
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,180
Hello.

585
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,580
What's this?

586
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,580
This is a hot air balloon with wet wipes.

587
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,580
Didn't babies born with wet wipes often wipe their butt with them?

588
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,980
It's really cold during winter.

589
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,780
You can use this to heat up the wet wipes.

590
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,380
Then you can wipe your baby's butt.

591
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,580
Then the baby won't catch a cold.

592
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,980
Honey, this is interesting. What do you think?

593
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,180
Is it poisonous to heat up the wet wipes?

594
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,780
Don't hit people so hard next time.

595
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,980
It's really poisonous.

596
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,780
You're so mean.

597
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,780
I've seen a data online before.

598
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,780
A lot of children...

599
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,380
Honey, look at this.

600
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,580
Look. Tonight,

601
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,380
we can buy this for the baby. What do you think?

602
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,780
No. This is so ugly.

603
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,380
The baby won't clean this up.

604
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,780
If it falls on the floor,

605
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,580
you won't see it.

606
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,180
If you step on it,

607
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,780
you'll be fine.

608
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,580
Li Xiaochuan,

609
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,780
why don't you stop your business?

610
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,780
Go to the construction site to work.

611
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,180
Mr. Li.

612
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,580
I didn't expect it's really you.

613
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,180
I thought I was mistaken.

614
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,180
Do you remember me?

615
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,780
Xiaocheng from Weirang Technology.

616
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,580
Hello.

617
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,580
This is...

618
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,180
My wife, Xu Li.

619
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,180
Hello.

620
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,180
It's Mrs. Li.

621
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,580
I didn't expect

622
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,980
Mr. Li would like

623
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,180
this kind of girl.

624
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,380
Is there a problem?

625
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,180
No.

626
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,980
I just didn't expect

627
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,180
Mrs. Li is so pure and cute.

628
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,580
If you didn't say it,

629
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,180
I would think it's a high school student.

630
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,380
Excuse me.

631
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,780
My wife wants to dress up.

632
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,980
It's her freedom.

633
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,580
I don't need your evaluation.

634
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,980
Thank you.

635
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,580
Honey.

636
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,180
You said you like the gold wall, right?

637
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,380
Buy it all.

638
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,380
And the wet paper, gold, and furniture.

639
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,380
We'll buy it too.

640
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,380
As long as you like it, I'll buy it for you.

641
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,380
Let's go.

642
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,380
Welcome to Zou Kaiyi's diamond custom shop.

643
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,180
What can I do for you?

644
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,980
Let me see the diamond.

645
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,980
Show me this one.

646
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,580
Sir, you're so smart.

647
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,180
I'm not a smart person.

648
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,180
I'm just a customer.

649
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,980
I'm just a customer.

650
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,580
You're so smart.

651
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,580
This is called Goddess's Dress.

652
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,180
It's a wedding dress and a proposal dress.

653
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,980
Which one do you want?

654
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,180
Proposal dress.

655
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,580
Wait a minute.

656
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
Hello?

657
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,180
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

658
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,580
There's no power in the car.

659
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,180
When you come back, bring two 7-pin batteries.

660
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,980
Okay, okay, okay.

661
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,780
I'm working.

662
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,780
I'll bring it when I come back.

663
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,780
Hello, welcome to Zou Kaiyi's diamond custom shop.

664
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,380
Well...

665
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,380
Why do I hear background music?

666
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,380
No, no, no.

667
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,380
It's background music from PPT.

668
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,580
Are you here to see the diamond?

669
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,980
I'm going to work now.

670
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,580
I won't talk to you anymore. Bye.

671
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,780
Come on.

672
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,780
Here, sir.

673
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,780
Okay.

674
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,580
Why is your father so strange?

675
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,980
He said he was doing something bad behind my back.

676
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,580
Look at your dirty face.

677
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,780
Look at the email.

678
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,880
What is he looking at?

679
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,280
Don't he know it's your parents, right?

680
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,380
See, this is your Wind pinch treatment.

681
00:37:52,380 --> 00:38:04,420
I need aniendone

682
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,620
Maybe there's something wrong with the middle finger.

683
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,100
It's okay.

684
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,420
Mr. Chen.

685
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:09,900
Be careful.

686
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:11,980
Mr. Chen.

687
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,100
Let's talk.

688
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,260
You can tell me lies.

689
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,020
You can make me cry.

690
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,460
You know why.

691
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,780
Never been so brave.

692
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,300
I will run away.

693
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,940
If it's what you want,

694
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,260
what you like,

695
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,220
I don't mind.

696
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,380
I can close my eyes.

697
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,900
I can stay behind.

698
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,580
Waste my time.

699
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,140
I can't let you go.

700
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,780
Waste my time.

701
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,260
Walk into your plan.

702
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,660
Like I never knew you were not mine.

703
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,540
Make you satisfied.

704
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,340
Wear another mask.

705
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:30,100
You never realize things I do for love.

706
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,740
I think I'm tired.

707
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,420
I think I'm blind.

708
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,300
Don't know how to feel.

709
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,220
Don't know how to heal.

710
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,180
You walk so fast.

711
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,820
Can't catch your light.

712
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,300
You fly so high.

713
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,540
Leave all the things behind.

714
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,500
And I'll start a new life of love.

715
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,780
Nowhere to find.

716
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,700
I think I'm tired.

717
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,420
I think I'm blind.

718
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,380
Don't know how to feel.

719
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,380
Don't know how to heal.

720
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,260
You walk so fast.

721
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,940
Can't catch your light.

722
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,540
You fly so high.

723
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,540
Leave all the things behind.

724
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,620
And I'll start a new life of love.

725
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:50,700
Nowhere to find.
