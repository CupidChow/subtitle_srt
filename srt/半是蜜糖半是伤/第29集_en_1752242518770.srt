00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:56,140
Special thanks to鐘ene.

00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,720
image

3
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:56,760
ывайтесь

4
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,560
Take them!

5
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,680
My song

6
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,400
You've been doing great since you started the live stream.

7
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,440
Brother, you're amazing.

8
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,520
Right?

9
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,560
I think it'll be smoother if you change it.

10
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,880
What's wrong?

11
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,480
Give me your phone.

12
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,320
Okay.

13
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,560
Brother, I'll go get ready.

14
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,000
Go.

15
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,240
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,080
Don't look back.

17
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm behind you.

18
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,040
Secretary Bai.

19
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,520
Mr. Du.

20
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,200
What a coincidence.

21
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,960
You're here, too?

22
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,520
Yes.

23
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,560
Then let's go together.

24
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,440
Okay.

25
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,600
Help me get the bottle of wine.

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,800
Thank you.

27
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,760
Mr. Du, do you come here often?

28
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,840
Occasionally.

29
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,120
Bye.

30
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,440
This is the whiskey

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,000
from Gatherland Biennale久年吧?

32
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,280
Are you an expert, bro?

33
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,920
A little bit.

34
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,920
I think I should talk with

35
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,520
secretary Bai some time in the future.

36
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,560
You've become modest.

37
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,880
But for this time,

38
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,800
I still have to thank Mr. Du

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,200
for helping our boss

40
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,080
get rid of his bad temper.

41
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,160
Not at all.

42
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,680
I always see your intentions

43
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,280
Did you?

44
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,120
If I go well,

45
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
Mr. Lin's enemy is my enemy.

46
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,360
I think it's time to say goodbye.

47
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,000
Yuan Shuai has left the country.

48
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,720
In a few days,

49
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,400
the M.A.H. annual shareholders' meeting

50
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,840
will announce his punishment.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,720
He will never want to turn over again.

52
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,640
That's great.

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,960
Hello?

54
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,960
What?

55
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,640
What did you modify?

56
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,760
Okay.

57
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,200
Okay, I got it.

58
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,720
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,600
I suddenly remembered

60
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,120
that I forgot to take a document.

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,520
I guess I have to go back now.

62
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,960
I have to go back to the office too.

63
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,920
Let's go together.

64
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,680
Okay.

65
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,480
Okay.

66
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,600
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,480
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,440
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,320
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,320
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,120
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,200
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,480
Mr. Lin.

74
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,640
I'm following your instructions today.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,680
He didn't do anything unusual.

76
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,520
There's no abnormality in the email and call records.

77
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,200
Okay.

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,240
Then please keep an eye on him.

79
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,640
I want to see if he's really good.

80
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Okay, Mr. Lin.

81
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,400
Mr. Lin.

82
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,440
It's been a long time.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,760
Mr. Jia.

84
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,520
Why are you in such a good mood today?

85
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,720
I have to come to your house to visit.

86
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,120
I asked you to come today

87
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,120
because I have a friend

88
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,520
who wants to meet you.

89
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,920
Yuan.

90
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,240
Yuan Shuai.

91
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,640
Yuan Shuai.

92
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,120
I thought you went abroad.

93
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,800
Why are you here?

94
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,120
Since you know each other,

95
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,280
I won't introduce you to each other.

96
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,880
Mr. Lin.

97
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,800
It's been a long time.

98
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I finally get to meet you today.

99
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,440
I thought you were busy with your magic tricks.

100
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,680
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,480
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,320
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,160
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,120
I didn't know you were so handsome.

105
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,840
After all,

106
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,680
I'm not worth mentioning

107
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,760
compared to you.

108
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't stand there.

109
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,000
Sit down and talk.

110
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,960
I'll leave you alone.

111
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,880
Mr. Jia, go ahead.

112
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,480
Mr. Lin, sit.

113
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,560
Mr. Jia, sit.

114
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,160
It seems that Mr. Yuan is here on purpose.

115
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,320
That's right.

116
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,720
I have some documents.

117
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,160
I believe after Mr. Lin read them,

118
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,400
you'll know why I'm here today.

119
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,320
What's this?

120
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,160
I don't understand.

121
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,200
Mr. Lin is a smart person.

122
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,480
He shouldn't be pretending to be stupid.

123
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,360
Mr. Lin,

124
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,480
which document do you not understand?

125
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,880
It's the one

126
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,280
that I gave Cao Heng's account.

127
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,480
I don't know what it is.

128
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,640
I don't know.

129
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,560
I don't know.

130
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,600
I don't know.

131
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,720
I don't know.

132
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,760
I don't know.

133
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,720
I don't know.

134
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,760
I don't know.

135
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,840
I don't know.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,800
I don't know.

137
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,800
I don't know.

138
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,400
Or

139
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,120
is it the document of your shares company C?

140
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
If you don't understand,

141
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,040
I'll tell you the truth.

142
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,600
Mr. Lin, please listen to me.

143
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,280
Is there anything that I can tell you?

144
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,800
If you tell me something,

145
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,400
Mr. Lin, please remind me.

146
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Five years ago,

147
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,560
you were attracted by the brand's success

148
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,560
and the market's prospects.

149
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,440
You wanted to take over this company.

150
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,720
You sent Cao Heng

151
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,200
to work for you.

152
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,280
But Jiang Yaoming's clear refusal

153
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,600
made your acquisition difficult.

154
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,520
So you bought the factory

155
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,720
and caused the food quality problem

156
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
to appear in the line of rice.

157
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,320
The order was increased.

158
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,880
As the founder,

159
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,120
Jiang Yaoming had to sign the contract

160
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,120
with CG Group for the survival of the employees.

161
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,680
After signing the contract,

162
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,600
you gave Cao Heng a sum of money

163
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,680
and kicked him out of Shanghai.

164
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,320
Mr. Yuan's ability to make up stories

165
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,000
is admirable.

166
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,880
But you just want to

167
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,520
stop me from being guilty

168
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,320
and make me admit it?

169
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,080
Mr. Lin, don't be nervous.

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,880
I know

171
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,440
you didn't do this alone.

172
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,120
You know Lin Taimo.

173
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,880
He gave you the full power

174
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,640
to do everything.

175
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,240
He wanted to find someone

176
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,040
to take the blame for him.

177
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
Legally,

178
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,800
the main and the main plan of this matter

179
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,560
are different.

180
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
It's up to you

181
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,440
how you choose.

182
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
Are you doing this

183
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,160
to take the main responsibility

184
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,040
and make the real murderer free?

185
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,320
Or

186
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,400
you choose to cooperate with us

187
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,400
and take the real responsibility

188
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,160
and make him take the responsibility

189
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,960
he should take.

190
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,760
Mr. Yuan,

191
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,640
you said so much.

192
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,280
You just want me to

193
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,960
support Lin Taimo.

194
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,440
After all,

195
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,240
this is your best way to atone for your sins.

196
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,000
You don't want to

197
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,080
let Du Lei down.

198
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,720
Anyway,

199
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,800
you're at fault.

200
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,560
We're doing this

201
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,000
because we want you

202
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,000
to get over it as soon as possible.

203
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,840
Are we talking about you

204
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,440
and Du Lei?

205
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,240
That's right.

206
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,960
There's one more thing

207
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,760
I'd like to ask Mr. Lin.

208
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,360
Why did Jiang Yaoming die?

209
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,880
I guess it has nothing to do with you.

210
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Why did Jiang Yaoming

211
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,800
suddenly die from heart disease?

212
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,160
What happened in the middle?

213
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,880
Oh!

214
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,480
He only saw you before he died.

215
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,960
Why did he suddenly have high blood pressure?

216
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,920
What made him so emotional and suddenly die?

217
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,000
I believe you know better than anyone.

218
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,360
This is the contract for signing the Jiangnan branch.

219
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,440
Mr. Lin, you really did a great job this time.

220
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,560
We should celebrate our victory.

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,120
Sir, you can't go in.

222
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,600
Sir, sir, sir.

223
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,360
Sir, you can't go in.

224
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,720
Let him go.

225
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,920
You guys can go out.

226
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,760
Okay, Mr. Lin.

227
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,160
Mr. Zhang, come.

228
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,760
You guys sit down and have some tea.

229
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,880
Jiang Liuping!

230
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,800
No.

231
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,480
I trusted you so much.

232
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,920
You guys even joined the community to cheat me.

233
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,280
You guys are just like animals.

234
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,800
Mr. Zhang, we can make money together.

235
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,080
But you're so stubborn.

236
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,000
That's why I used my own means to expand your scale.

237
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,040
Nonsense.

238
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,160
You guys are just trying to trick us.

239
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
That's right.

240
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,960
Mr. Zhang, I understand.

241
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,400
We have signed the contract.

242
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,520
To be honest, Jiangnan branch has nothing to do with you.

243
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,840
You have no right to say these things to me.

244
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,920
I followed you all the way to keep your reputation.

245
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,560
By the way,

246
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,040
you're the founder of Yixian.

247
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,800
You're so persistent

248
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,560
to keep the freshest ingredients and texture.

249
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,280
I can tell you clearly now.

250
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,840
From today on,

251
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,280
Yixian will not only become a vegetarian food,

252
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,840
but also add preservatives to extend the shelf life.

253
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,760
The junk food you hate the most

254
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,200
will appear in front of you from today.

255
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,680
You have to be prepared.

256
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
Mr. Zhang,

257
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
this toilet...

258
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,040
I can't believe it.

259
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
What's that?

260
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,040
It fell.

261
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
What are you doing?

262
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
You...

263
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,040
One, two, three.

264
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
Let's go.

265
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,040
I'll be right there.

266
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Hello, there's a heart patient here.

267
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,040
Please call the ambulance.

268
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
The incident is very serious.

269
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

270
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
This is what happened.

271
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Jiang Yaoming died in front of me.

272
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
But I wanted to save him.

273
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,040
You saw a living person die in front of you.

274
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,040
This is not my intention.

275
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
At that time, I...

276
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Okay, since that's the case,

277
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,040
I hope you can hand over all the benefits

278
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,040
between you and Lin Taimo.

279
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,040
This is also an explanation for Jiang Yaoming.

280
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Since the incident with Jiang Nanfeng

282
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
has already started,

283
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,040
I suggest that the C Group's shares

284
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
should be taken out as soon as possible.

285
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
What?

286
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
Are you worried about what Yuan Shuai

287
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
will do?

288
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Although Yuan Shuai is not

289
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
threatening us now,

290
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
what if he finds the evidence?

291
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,040
The two of us will pay the price.

292
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Don't worry.

293
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,040
He has my people watching him.

294
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,040
And he has a handle on me.

295
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,040
In terms of his intelligence and connections,

296
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
compared to us,

297
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,040
he's just a young man from the woods.

298
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,040
He can't be bothered by a small problem.

299
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Then, don't you suspect

300
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,040
someone is helping him?

301
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,040
Are you talking about Fan Qicheng?

302
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Fan is an old fox.

303
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
He saw his beloved one

304
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
leaving behind the dark pot.

305
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Isn't he still protecting his life?

306
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
Besides, this matter

307
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
has nothing to do with him.

308
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
He wouldn't want to be in such a state

309
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
if he knew about this.

310
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
By the way,

311
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,040
what about the file?

312
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Can you guarantee that it's safe?

313
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
The safest place

314
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
is the most dangerous place.

315
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,040
The safest place?

316
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
Don't worry.

317
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,040
Of course.

318
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
With your words,

319
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
I'm relieved.

320
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Hello.

321
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Lin Taimo told me

322
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,040
the safest place is the most dangerous place.

323
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Lin Taimo told me

324
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,040
the safest place is the most dangerous place.

325
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,040
So, this file

326
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
shouldn't be in his house.

327
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
If such an important file

328
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,040
isn't in his house,

329
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
then it must be

330
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,040
in the place he sees every day.

331
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
There's a safe in his office,

332
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,040
but I don't know the password.

333
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Do you dare to make a bet?

334
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,040
Mr. Du.

335
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
You're home early, Mr. Bai.

336
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Would you like some coffee?

337
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
No, tea.

338
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
By the way,

339
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
is Mr. Bai free recently?

340
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
What's up, Mr. Du?

341
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
I found that you seem to know a lot about wine.

342
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
My friend just got a few bottles of good wine.

343
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Do you have a chance to try it?

344
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
I'm free recently.

345
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
I'll see Mr. Du.

346
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Then it's better to meet today.

347
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,040
Today?

348
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,040
The annual general meeting is tomorrow morning.

349
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Can't we have it tonight?

350
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
You know about tomorrow's meeting.

351
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
It's just that

352
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
several bosses are gathered together

353
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
and talk to each other.

354
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,040
We just need to get the work ready.

355
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Well...

356
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Don't be so stressed.

357
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
It's just a bottle of wine,

358
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
not a bottle of wine.

359
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
How about this?

360
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,040
If something happens tomorrow,

361
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
I'll be there.

362
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Okay.

363
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Since it's hard to win,

364
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
I'm looking forward to seeing Mr. Du for a long time.

365
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Okay, see you tonight.

366
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
See you tonight.

367
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Mr. Du is still busy recently.

368
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
He has time to enjoy himself.

369
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
Seeing your opponent

370
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,040
being beaten so badly,

371
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,040
you didn't even return the favor.

372
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Are you celebrating?

373
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
That's right.

374
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
After all, tomorrow's M.H. annual general meeting

375
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,040
is a summary of other people's share.

376
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
It has nothing to do with Mr. Du.

377
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,040
But I still have to kindly remind you.

378
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Drinking is the easiest thing to do.

379
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Thank you for reminding me.

380
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Thank you.

381
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Mr. Du prepared so much wine for me today.

382
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,040
This bottle

383
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
should be the limited edition of Louis XIII.

384
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,040
This bottle

385
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,040
should be the Madeli

386
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,040
the high-end, adult-grade.

387
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Isn't this a bottle of McAllen's Laili series?

388
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
A 65-year-old whiskey.

389
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
Seeing this bottle of wine here,

390
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Mr. Du's wine collection is really rich.

391
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
The Hang family is indeed the Hang family.

392
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Come on, let's have a good taste today.

393
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Okay.

394
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Zi'ai, fill it up.

395
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Thank you, Mr. Du.

396
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Cheers.

397
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
You're a good drinker.

398
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
Okay, okay.

399
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Waiter,

400
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
he's drunk.

401
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Help me find a hotel to put him down.

402
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Thank you.

403
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,040
Dear shareholders,

404
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,040
leaders, and colleagues,

405
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,040
welcome to the M.H. securities company

406
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
investment bank's annual general meeting.

407
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
Last year, we were able to thank everyone

408
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,040
for their support and trust in M.H. securities.

409
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Of course, we didn't let anyone down.

410
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Our results were very bad.

411
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,040
Without further ado,

412
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,040
let me officially announce

413
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,040
that today's meeting

414
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,040
will officially begin.

415
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
First of all...

416
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

417
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Please wait a moment.

418
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
Dear shareholders, and leaders,

419
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
please allow me to inform a senior executive

420
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
inside the company before the meeting.

421
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Five years ago,

422
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:34,940
he used the job

423
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
to sell his shares.

424
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
Mr. Fan,

425
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,040
sometimes you need to be smart.

426
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,040
Especially in such a serious situation,

427
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,040
you're so cruel and malicious.

428
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,040
I'm afraid you need to take legal responsibility.

429
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
Mr. Lin,

430
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
if I dare to say it,

431
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,040
I won't just sit back and watch.

432
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,040
What about the evidence?

433
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Why don't you show it to everyone?

434
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,040
Please wait a moment.

435
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Mr. Lin,

436
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
I'm sorry.

437
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
I'm sorry.

438
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
I'm sorry.

439
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
I'm sorry.

440
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
I'm sorry.

441
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
I'm sorry.

442
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
I'm sorry.

443
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
I'm sorry.

444
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
I'm sorry.

445
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
I'm sorry.

446
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,040
I'm sorry.

447
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
I'm sorry.

448
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
I'm sorry.

449
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
I'm sorry.

450
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
I'm sorry.

451
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
I'm sorry.

452
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
I'm sorry.

453
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
I'm sorry.

454
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
I'm sorry.

455
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
I'm sorry.

456
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
I'm sorry.

457
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
I'm sorry.

458
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
I'm sorry.

459
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
I'm sorry.

460
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
I'm sorry.

461
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
I'm sorry.

462
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
I'm sorry.

463
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
I'm sorry.

464
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
I'm sorry.

465
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
I'm sorry.

466
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
I'm sorry.

467
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
I'm sorry.

468
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
I'm sorry.

469
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
I'm sorry.

470
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
I'm sorry.

471
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
I'm sorry.

472
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
I'm sorry.

473
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
I'm sorry.

474
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
I'm sorry.

475
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
I'm sorry.

476
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
I'm sorry.

477
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
I'm sorry.

478
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
I'm sorry.

479
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
I'm sorry.

480
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
I'm sorry.

481
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
I'm sorry.

483
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
I'm sorry.

484
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
I'm sorry.

485
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
I'm sorry.

486
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
I'm sorry.

487
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
I'm sorry.

488
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
I'm sorry.

489
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
I'm sorry.

490
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
I'm sorry.

491
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
I'm sorry.

492
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
I'm sorry.

493
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
I'm sorry.

494
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
Where is this?

495
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Oh, no.

496
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
The meeting this morning.

497
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Mr. Fan,

498
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,040
this person was expelled from the company

499
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,040
because of the bribery.

500
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
Could it be

501
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
the so-called evidence?

502
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
Mr. Yuan,

503
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,040
I'll leave it to you.

504
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Mr. Lin,

505
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
what?

506
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
Are you so afraid of me?

507
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,040
I'm a man of my word.

508
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
What's there to be afraid of?

509
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
I'm just worried that

510
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
some people

511
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
will not only bear

512
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
a crime of bribery,

513
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
but also a crime of

514
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
slander.

515
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Good.

516
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Since you're a man of your word,

517
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
I wonder if you

518
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
can answer a few questions.

519
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Of course.

520
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
But I want to ask you, Mr. Lin.

521
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
The General Manager of the Bank of China

522
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
of the Jiyi Procuratorate, Linda,

523
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
was she your subordinate

524
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
five years ago?

525
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
That's right.

526
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
Everyone,

527
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,040
this is the private account

528
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Linda received five years ago

529
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,040
from the General Manager of C Group

530
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,040
of the Jiyi Procuratorate, Cao Heng.

531
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
According to Cao Heng,

532
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Linda instructed her

533
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,040
to buy the factory of

534
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Jiangnan Food and Sushi Factory

535
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
and let her buy

536
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
a batch of ingredients

537
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
with poor quality.

538
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,040
This caused the Jiangnan Food and Sushi Company

539
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,040
to suffer serious losses,

540
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
as well as being

541
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,040
maliciously seized by C Group.

542
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Five years ago, Linda

543
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
had already left my company

544
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
and went to work in Jiyi.

545
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,040
What does this have to do with me?

546
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Don't be anxious, Mr. Lin.

547
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
This document

548
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
is the evidence that C Group

549
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
received five years ago

550
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
from the private account

551
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
to pay off Linda's debt.

552
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
This one?

553
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
This is the evidence that Linda

554
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
has the shares of C Group.

555
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
And the last one

556
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
is the evidence that Linda

557
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
received five years ago.

558
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
It's the evidence that Linda

559
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
has paid off

560
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Mr. Lin's

561
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
private account

562
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
to pay off his debt.

563
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
I wonder

564
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
what Mr. Lin has to say

565
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
to us

566
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
about these documents.

567
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
What?

568
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Have you shown all your evidence?

569
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
I have a question.

570
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Mr. Yuan,

571
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
which of the evidence

572
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
can prove

573
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
that I have something to do with this?

574
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
This is the trade

575
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
between Linda and Mr. Bai.

576
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
It's none of my business.

577
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
Lin Taimo,

578
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
you are indeed

579
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,040
very good at your work.

580
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
That's right.

581
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
These evidence

582
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,040
can't point you directly.

583
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
But if I'm not wrong,

584
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
you should still have

585
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
a share loan agreement

586
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
signed by you and Linda.

587
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
It's not bad, right?

588
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Yuan Shuai,

589
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,040
you committed a crime alone.

590
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
I was so worried about you.

591
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
I was just trying to

592
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
get you out of the company.

593
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
I didn't expect you

594
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
to be here

595
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
to slander me.

596
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,040
Our shareholders' meeting

597
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
doesn't allow you

598
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
to be here

599
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,040
and slander me.

600
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Please leave.

601
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Mr. Lin,

602
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
since you can prove your innocence,

603
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,040
why are you so anxious

604
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
to drive me away?

605
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
Why don't we make a bet

606
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
that we won't leave

607
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
or communicate from now on?

608
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
Ten minutes.

609
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
In ten minutes,

610
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
the person who will be the

611
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
head of the He Gui Securities and Exchange

612
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
will be here.

613
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
According to the company's rules,

614
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Mr. Lin,

615
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,040
your home and office

616
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
must be thoroughly investigated.

617
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Including all your

618
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
insurance cabinets and insurance boxes,

619
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
they must be thoroughly investigated.

620
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,040
I promise you,

621
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,040
if there is no evidence

622
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
found,

623
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
I will give you

624
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,040
and Mr. Lin

625
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
an explanation.

626
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,040
But if the evidence is confirmed,

627
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Mr. Lin,

628
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
you will not escape

629
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,040
the law.

630
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Ten minutes.

631
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
Okay.

632
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
I'll see what you can find

633
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
in my home

634
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
and office

635
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
in ten minutes.

636
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
Yuan Shuai

637
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Yuan Shuai is back.

638
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,040
He is talking to Lin Tan Mo.

639
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,040
Shen Xing,

640
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,040
you must stop the secretary Bai.

641
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
Secretary Bai,

642
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,040
you hit someone and didn't apologize.

643
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
I'm sorry.

644
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,040
What do you mean?

645
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
You said sorry and that's it?

646
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
I'm in a hurry.

647
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
What are you in a hurry for?

648
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Take me to the doctor.

649
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:13,040
You are a

650
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
secretary.

651
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,040
I'm out.

652
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
Hide it.

653
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
What were you doing in there?

654
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Well,

655
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
Mr. Lin asked me to

656
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,040
send him the file.

657
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,040
Give it to me.

658
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,040
I'll go get Mr. Lin.

659
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
General,

660
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
stop.

661
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Give me the file.

662
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
Give it to me.

663
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Let go.

664
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Give me the file.

665
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:09,420
I'm a

666
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,420
I'm a

667
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,420
secretary.

668
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,420
I'm not a secretary.

669
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,420
You are.

670
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,420
Looking at Mr. Lin's expression,

671
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,660
You seem not afraid of the members of the group at all.

672
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,100
I advise you to admit your crime now.

673
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,020
Maybe the result will not be so ugly.

674
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,660
You have time to talk nonsense here.

675
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,580
Why don't you go and investigate

676
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,380
the charges of slander and guilt?

677
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,220
Time's up.

678
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,380
Mr. Fan.

679
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,300
General.

680
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,180
Where are the people of the headquarters?

681
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,620
Are they here to make fun of us,

682
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,860
the shareholders and the leaders?

683
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,300
General.

684
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,620
You are so cruel.

685
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,340
You moved the members of the group.

686
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,580
I'll make fun of everything here.

687
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,940
Why do you come here?

688
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,500
I have this document

689
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,900
is the contract of the shares signed by Lin Tai Mo and Linda.

690
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,500
This document is also proof that Lin Tai Mo

691
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,900
is the iron evidence behind the shares of Group C.

692
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,500
President Lin, do you think this is the end?

693
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,500
Sister.

694
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,500
What he did was more than these.

695
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,500
At that time, the chairman of Jiangnan Food Company, Jiang Yaoming,

696
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,500
had a heart attack in front of us.

697
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,500
He not only stopped me from calling an ambulance,

698
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,500
but also took away the medicine that could save Jiang Yaoming's life.

699
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,500
I watched him

700
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,500
miss the time to rescue him and die in front of us.

701
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,500
You're talking nonsense. Jiang Yaoming was killed by you.

702
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Do you still remember this?

703
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Call the ambulance.

704
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,500
There are only you and Jiang Yaoming's fingerprints on the medicine bottle.

705
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,500
This is proof that the person who took the medicine on purpose

706
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,500
was the one who killed Jiang Yaoming.

707
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,500
This is proof that the person who took the medicine on purpose

708
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,500
was the one who killed Jiang Yaoming.

709
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,500
I have already turned myself in to the police.

710
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,500
If you have anything else, tell the police.

711
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:53,500
Mr. Lin Tamo, you are suspected of corruption and violation of the Procedure Act.

712
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Please go to the Procuratorate for our investigation.

713
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,500
I'm sorry.

714
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
Wait a minute.

715
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,500
You have already gotten what you wanted.

716
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,500
Why didn't you save him?

717
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Because he knew something he shouldn't have known.

718
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Just because of this?

719
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,500
If you were to sit in my position,

720
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,500
you would still make the same choice.

721
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,500
You would still make the same choice.

722
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
I won't.

723
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,500
Jiang Nanfeng is my father's favorite brand.

724
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:15,500
The brand he created is like MH and you.

725
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,500
I used to take you as my role model.

726
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
I used to be a senior in the police.

727
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,500
I wanted to be someone like you.

728
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,500
But now I realize I was wrong.

729
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,500
I will never be like this in my life.

730
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:37,500
My father never let down any customer.

731
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
He never let down this brand.

732
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
My father was always bright and bright.

733
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
And you...

734
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,500
You are a dark, cold place.

735
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,500
You should be the most important.

736
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:58,500
My father will see you in heaven.

737
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Standing in a ring

738
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,500
I need your arms to hold

739
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,500
I pray every night you'll hurry back to me

740
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,500
The winter turns to spring

741
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,500
I'm standing next to you

742
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:37,500
To see the flowers grow

743
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,500
To see the flowers bloom

744
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,500
I will run away

745
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,500
If it's what you want

746
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,500
What you like

747
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
I don't mind

748
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
I can close my eyes

749
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
I can stay behind

750
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Waste my time

751
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
Walk into your plan

752
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,500
Like I never knew you were not mine

753
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Make you satisfied

754
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Wear another mask

755
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:53,500
You never realize things I do for love

756
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,500
I think I'm tired

757
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,500
I think I'm blind

758
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,500
Don't know how to feel

759
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,500
Don't know how to heal

760
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,500
You walk so fast

761
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,500
Can't catch your light

762
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,500
You fly so high

763
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,500
Leave all the things behind

764
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
And our story

765
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:33,500
Leave our love nowhere to find

766
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,500
I think I'm tired

767
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,500
I think I'm blind

768
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,500
Don't know how to feel

769
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:48,500
Don't know how to heal

770
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,500
You walk so fast

771
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,500
Can't catch your light

772
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,500
You fly so high

773
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,500
Leave all the things behind

774
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
And our story

775
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Leave our love nowhere to find
