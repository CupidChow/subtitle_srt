1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,060
Device

2
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,020
Episode 17

3
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,480
Have you seen the news?

4
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,120
It's amazing that there is a lady with a Unchau Gas feature.

5
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,080
Is it true that Tang Xin originally wanted to be on Channel 1?

6
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,860
It's true.

7
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,480
Really?

8
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,060
Look.

9
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,480
There's Tang Xin's way of creating pieces.

10
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,720
This combination of the Zone of Choice and the war it is completely incredible.

11
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,940
We have been talking about it together for so long.

12
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,940
I'm not going to report it until now.

13
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,940
But that condition is not good.

14
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,940
It's going to be a disaster.

15
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,940
It's not good.

16
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,940
Anyway, I don't believe it.

17
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,940
You don't have to see it.

18
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,940
President Wan,

19
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,940
there are a lot of media outside.

20
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,940
We have rejected all the interviews of reporters

21
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940
and tried to control the public opinion.

22
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,940
But the impact of the matter is too big.

23
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,940
Wait.

24
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,940
Why do you refuse?

25
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,940
Why do you refuse?

26
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,940
President Wan is here.

27
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,940
President Wan is here.

28
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,940
We want to see President Wan.

29
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,940
Can you come and meet us?

30
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,940
Can you come and meet us?

31
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,940
We want to see President Wan.

32
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,940
I just want to see President Wan.

33
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,940
Let him say it.

34
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,940
Let him say it.

35
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,940
Really.

36
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,940
We just want to see him.

37
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,940
Just one look at him.

38
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,940
President Wan is here.

39
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,940
President Wan,

40
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,940
is Tang Xin suing you for being a truth-teller?

41
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,940
Can you respond?

42
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,940
President Wan, Tang Xin posted on Weibo

43
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,940
a video of you being a sexual harassment.

44
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,940
Aren't you afraid that she would report it?

45
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,940
The video of you and your sister dating

46
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,940
is now out on Tang Xin.

47
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,940
What do you think about it, President Wan?

48
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,940
Please respond to President Wan.

49
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,940
Dear media friends,

50
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,940
all the accusations against Tang Xin

51
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,940
are all false.

52
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,940
If she really has evidence,

53
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,940
I am willing to confront her face to face.

54
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,940
As for why she did this,

55
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,940
or if someone instigated her to frame me,

56
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,940
Wan Xi will retain her right to sue her.

57
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,940
President Wan, please explain.

58
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,940
President Wan, please explain.

59
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,940
President Wan, please explain.

60
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,940
Okay, okay.

61
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,940
Okay, okay.

62
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,940
What?

63
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,940
A financial investor is seeking a bail?

64
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,940
I've been to the Law Firm recently.

65
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,940
If the accuser is a truth-teller,

66
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,940
he might be a criminal.

67
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,940
I'll forget about the case if I get caught.

68
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,940
CEO is in such a big trouble now.

69
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,940
The management department will not be at ease.

70
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,940
Wan Xin, we are solving the problem.

71
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,940
Don't be nervous.

72
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,940
I got it.

73
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,940
Everyone, please stop.

74
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,940
Don't panic.

75
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,940
I know that

76
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,940
there are some new changes

77
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,940
in the situation of Wan Xin Entertainment.

78
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,940
Please adjust the pace.

79
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,940
I'll assign the tasks to you.

80
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,940
Xiangding, Chen Yicheng,

81
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,940
you still need to be responsible for the previous board pieces.

82
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,940
Don't change it.

83
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,940
Shen Xing, from now on,

84
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,940
you are responsible for

85
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,940
the translation and verification of all overseas documents.

86
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,940
Jiang Jun,

87
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,940
you will meet with President Luo of Wan Xin Entertainment

88
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,940
at 2 p.m. tomorrow afternoon.

89
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,940
He will be responsible for the translation and verification of all overseas documents.

90
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,940
I will meet with President Luo of Wan Xin Entertainment.

91
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,940
He will be the new CEO candidate

92
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,940
to cooperate with the suspension of the investigation.

93
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,940
Please be prepared

94
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,940
for all the colleagues who are in the suspension.

95
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,940
Responsibility and division of work are not variable.

96
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,940
You have already found out that

97
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,940
Wan Xin Entertainment is in trouble, right?

98
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,940
Why didn't you tell me?

99
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,940
Am I an outsider?

100
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,940
I'll go with you

101
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,940
at 2 p.m. tomorrow afternoon.

102
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,940
No need.

103
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,940
Jiang Jun will accompany me.

104
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,940
Jiang Jun,

105
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,940
come here.

106
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,940
Such a big crisis.

107
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,940
Wan Xin will not be able to settle it so easily.

108
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,940
But this secret hideout

109
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,940
is really a good one.

110
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,940
I think President Yuan

111
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,940
must be determined this time.

112
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,940
He has already found Luo Shen.

113
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,940
Wan Xin is in trouble.

114
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,940
It seems that I have to work overtime again.

115
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,940
Enough.

116
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,940
Fortunately, I just mixed up

117
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,940
the information about Wan Xin with Luo Shen.

118
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,940
Don't forget it.

119
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,940
Continue working.

120
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,940
The night before last week,

121
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,940
I was so tired.

122
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,940
You still have to work.

123
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,940
I will.

124
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,940
Please continue.

125
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,940
I think the part about the personnel information

126
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,940
needs to be more detailed.

127
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,940
I think it's better to

128
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,940
have a more detailed analysis.

129
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,940
I think it's better to have a more detailed analysis.

130
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,940
I think it's better to have a more detailed analysis.

131
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,940
I think it's better to have a more detailed analysis.

132
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,940
I think it's better to have a more detailed analysis.

133
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,940
I think it's better to have a more detailed analysis.

134
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,940
This is the material of Wan Xin Entertainment for five years.

135
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,940
Please help me arrange it according to the timeline.

136
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,940
Give it to me before tomorrow noon.

137
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,940
Tomorrow noon?

138
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,940
Is there a problem?

139
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,940
No problem.

140
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,940
Okay, President Qiao.

141
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,940
Jiang Jun.

142
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,940
Why did President Qiao go to the office?

143
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,940
President Qiao asked me to

144
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,940
organize these materials before tomorrow.

145
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,940
I've already read the materials before.

146
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,940
And they are detailed.

147
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,940
Besides,

148
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,940
how can we finish

149
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,940
so many materials in one night?

150
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Here, Jiang Jun.

151
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,940
I'll take this part.

152
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,940
Thank you.

153
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,940
You're welcome.

154
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,940
By the way, Jiang Jun,

155
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,940
I remembered that I have to

156
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,940
have dinner with a client today.

157
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,940
It's okay.

158
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,940
Clients are important.

159
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
Clients are important.

160
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
Some people are really efficient.

161
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,940
They really drag the team down.

162
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,940
I don't want my project bonus

163
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,940
to be wasted by some people.

164
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,940
Let me do it.

165
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,940
Chen Yichen.

166
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,940
Thank you.

167
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,940
I never thought you would help me.

168
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,940
Don't think too much.

169
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,940
You helped me once

170
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,940
on the interview day.

171
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,940
This time, I'll pay you back.

172
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
We're even now.

173
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,940
From now on,

174
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,940
we're rivals.

175
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,940
Can't friendship be the second place?

176
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,940
We'll see.

177
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,940
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,940
Your eyes are uncomfortable.

179
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,940
Your heart is beating fast.

180
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,940
Your eyes...

181
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,940
seem to be a little sore.

182
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,940
I was just thinking that

183
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,940
you can't scratch it.

184
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,940
I'll help you scratch it.

185
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,940
Thank you.

186
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,940
Unwilling to concentrate,

187
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,940
heartbeats are stronger than this.

188
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,940
A smile is like a moment of touch.

189
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,940
This...

190
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,940
I want to meet you anytime.

191
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,940
I can't stop missing you even for a second.

192
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,940
I want to be with you for this moment.

193
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,940
Hello.

194
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,940
Pay the bill.

195
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,940
Wait, I'm coming.

196
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,940
Ten yuan.

197
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,940
Here.

198
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,940
Thank you.

199
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,940
The bill.

200
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,940
The bill.

201
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,940
Did you change the wifi password?

202
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,940
The wifi is not connected.

203
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,940
The password setting is too simple.

204
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,940
It's easy to be broken.

205
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,940
Do you know that?

206
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,940
But it's okay to change it.

207
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,940
Too many people connected before.

208
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,940
The internet speed will affect the work.

209
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,940
So what if it's not connected?

210
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,940
Do you like it or not?

211
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,940
Are you angry?

212
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,940
No.

213
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,940
I'm just a common name for a convenient store girl.

214
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
What right do I have to be angry?

215
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,940
Are you talking about my weight?

216
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,940
But the fastest way to search you,

217
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,940
is this the reason you blocked me?

218
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,940
How do you know?

219
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,940
Are you following me?

220
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,940
You should know the amount of your friends.

221
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,940
Although the things you post are not nutritious,

222
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,940
it's easy to see them occasionally.

223
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,940
Jujia.

224
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,940
You came to my school that day, right?

225
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,940
Although I thank you,

226
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,940
but you suddenly helped me clean the table.

227
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,940
You must have some purpose to help me clean the table.

228
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,940
I...

229
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,940
I'm shy, okay?

230
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,940
I'm sorry for robbing your girlfriend's job.

231
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,940
When did I have a girlfriend?

232
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,940
Stop pretending.

233
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,940
I've already seen it.

234
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,940
What kind of little star?

235
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,940
Little star.

236
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,940
Sweet Little Star is an internal account.

237
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,940
It's designed to chat with users.

238
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,940
It must send messages every day.

239
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,940
Look at you.

240
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,940
You suddenly came to my school to help me clean the table.

241
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,940
You changed the wifi password in the store.

242
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,940
You suspect I have a girlfriend.

243
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,940
You blocked my friends.

244
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,940
You...

245
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:36,940
You must have a crush on me, right?

246
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,940
Yes, you guessed it right.

247
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,940
I have a friend who is also studying AI accounts.

248
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,940
I just want to ask the god to help me to do some internal tests.

249
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,940
Okay.

250
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,940
Sweet Little Star is also in the development stage.

251
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,940
I can test it for you.

252
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,940
Really?

253
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
Yes.

254
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,940
I'll ask him to help you tonight.

255
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,940
Okay.

256
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,940
Wait for me, Xiao Chen.

257
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,940
What kind of friend?

258
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,940
What kind of AI account?

259
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,940
I don't know.

260
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,940
I just want to ask the god to help me to do some internal tests.

261
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,940
I just want to ask the god to help me to do some internal tests.

262
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,940
I just want to ask the god to help me to do some internal tests.

263
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,940
What kind of AI account?

264
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,940
You have a bunch of data.

265
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,940
How can you compare me to a real person?

266
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,940
You have no time to ask me.

267
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,940
Hurry up.

268
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,940
Dear Xiao Chuan, I'm your friend Shirley.

269
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,940
Yay!

270
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,940
Hello, I'm Shirley.

271
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,940
In the future, whether it's happiness or sadness,

272
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
happiness or sadness,

273
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,940
I'll always be by your side.

274
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,940
Too many words.

275
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,940
Need to improve.

276
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,940
I'm sorry.

277
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,940
I'm sorry.

278
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,940
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,940
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,940
I'm sorry.

281
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,940
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,940
I'm sorry.

283
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,940
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,940
I'm sorry.

285
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,940
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,940
I'm sorry.

287
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,940
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,940
I'm sorry.

289
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,940
I'm sorry.

290
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,940
I'm sorry.

291
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,940
I'm sorry.

292
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,940
I'm sorry.

293
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,940
Mr. Mai,

294
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,940
are you drinking and having a drink,

295
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,940
or are you just drinking?

296
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,940
You're making fun of me.

297
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,940
I can't be a woman.

298
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,940
And he can't get any evidence.

299
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,940
Mr. Mai,

300
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,940
you're too confident.

301
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,940
Who are you talking to?

302
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,940
Tang Xin,

303
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:16,940
maybe he has evidence that you don't even know.

304
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,940
I'll go get it.

305
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,940
That general

306
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,940
is actually your pawn.

307
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,940
He told me on purpose

308
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,940
that he would go and meet Tang Xin,

309
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,940
but he didn't do anything

310
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
to get me involved,

311
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,940
but he was trying to persuade Tang Xin

312
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,940
to stand up and sue me.

313
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,940
Isn't that right?

314
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,940
I told you, Tang Xin is too timid.

315
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,940
How could that be?

316
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,940
Why?

317
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,940
I just wanted to help you.

318
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,940
It's not easy to handle this kind of thing.

319
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,940
It's better to let a little character like Tang Xin

320
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,940
come out and make a scene

321
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,940
than to let General personally

322
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,940
come and give you a lesson.

323
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,940
General?

324
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,940
He's very honest.

325
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,940
What can he do?

326
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,940
No, he can't do anything.

327
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,940
He's just

328
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:24,000
a partner to your most

329
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
cowardly opponent.

330
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
How do you know?

331
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I don't know,

332
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
but at least I know him.

333
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So you can only trust me

334
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
in this situation.

335
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,940
Xiang Tian, have you done the work report

336
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,940
and the meeting summary?

337
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,940
I sent it to you last night.

338
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,940
Take a look.

339
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,940
Thank you.

340
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,940
Have you finished the new report?

341
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,940
Look, sister,

342
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,940
I've been busy all night.

343
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,940
There are too many.

344
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,940
I'll hurry up.

345
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,940
I've finished the report.

346
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,940
I'm sorry.

347
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,940
I'm sorry.

348
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,940
Really? So fast?

349
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,940
I'm sure you can't handle

350
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,940
these two new people.

351
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,940
Thank you so much.

352
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,940
It's a miracle

353
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,940
that I can complete this job.

354
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
Take a look.

355
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,940
Tang Xin has withdrawn.

356
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,940
Really?

357
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,940
Girls nowadays are so mad.

358
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,940
They can do anything.

359
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,940
It's impossible.

360
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,940
You've already

361
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,940
joined our company.

362
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,940
What else is impossible?

363
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,940
What are you talking about?

364
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,940
You're too obsessed

365
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,940
with your partner's company.

366
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,940
Jiang Jun,

367
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,940
you don't want to

368
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,940
jump into the memory lane.

369
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,940
So you deliberately

370
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
use Wan Xin's case

371
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,940
as a bait.

372
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,940
What's going on?

373
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,940
I have no connection

374
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
with her at work.

375
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,940
We're just friends.

376
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,940
I definitely didn't

377
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,940
betray any interests of the company.

378
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,940
I just found out

379
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,940
about Tang Xin's withdrawal.

380
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,940
I'll immediately...

381
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,940
It's fine if you say no.

382
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,940
The case has grown to the point

383
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,940
that any information

384
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,940
is kept secret.

385
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,940
I'm not going to let you

386
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,940
know about it.

387
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,940
You don't care at all.

388
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,940
If I were to say,

389
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,940
maybe you're the one

390
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,940
who's been planning

391
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,940
Tang Xin's withdrawal.

392
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,940
I just hope that Wan Xin

393
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,940
and the company's cooperation

394
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,940
will be successful

395
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,940
so that Wan Xin

396
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,940
can turn her head

397
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,940
into memory.

398
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,940
How could I?

399
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,940
You'd better

400
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,940
get Wan Xin's case done.

401
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,940
Otherwise,

402
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,940
it's not just

403
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,940
a simple punishment.

404
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,940
The person you're holding

405
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,940
is already with the person

406
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,940
who's been planning it.

407
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
Do you know that?

408
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,940
I know.

409
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,940
You still have the nerve

410
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,940
to say you know?

411
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,940
Now Tang Xin's withdrawal.

412
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,940
What do we have to do

413
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,940
with the people?

414
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,940
I'm just saying

415
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,940
that you have leadership.

416
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,940
You have leadership.

417
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,940
It seems like

418
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,940
you're just making a joke.

419
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,940
Don't worry, Mr. Fan.

420
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,940
I'm not going to

421
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,940
let you down.

422
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,940
I'm just going to

423
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,940
make sure

424
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,940
that you're not going to

425
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,940
get involved in this.

426
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,940
Don't worry, Mr. Fan.

427
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,940
I'll take care of this.

428
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,940
Hello.

429
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,940
The number you have dialed

430
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,940
is currently unavailable.

431
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,940
Hello.

432
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,940
I'm begging you.

433
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,940
Stop looking for me.

434
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,940
I'm sorry, General.

435
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
He has pictures

436
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,940
of me that are not in the picture.

437
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,940
He forced me

438
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,940
to take those videos online.

439
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,940
I have no choice

440
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,940
but to withdraw from the lawsuit.

441
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,940
Don't get too excited.

442
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,940
Since the situation

443
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,940
has already happened,

444
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,940
what we have to do

445
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,940
is to solve the problem.

446
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,940
If we back down,

447
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,940
it will only make them

448
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,940
more difficult.

449
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,940
Are you home?

450
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,940
I'm here to see you.

451
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,940
Okay.

452
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,940
Okay.

453
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,940
Who are you looking for?

454
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,940
Tang Anxin.

455
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,940
I'm looking for you.

456
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,940
I'm looking for you.

457
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,940
Who are you?

458
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,940
Tang Anxin,

459
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,940
I'm here to help you.

460
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,940
Who are you?

461
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,940
What do you mean by helping me?

462
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,940
It doesn't matter who I am.

463
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,940
What's important is

464
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,940
that I came here today

465
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,940
to give Miss Tang

466
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,940
a clear choice.

467
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,940
What's going on with you now

468
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,940
is a mess.

469
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,940
You should know

470
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,940
that the result you got

471
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,940
is because of your

472
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,940
impulsive behavior.

473
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,940
I can help you

474
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,940
to clear up the public opinion

475
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
and find a new team

476
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,940
to help you with the process.

477
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,940
I think the netizens

478
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,940
will soon

479
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,940
realize that

480
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,940
I'm a third party.

481
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,940
We don't know each other.

482
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,940
Why do you help me?

483
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,940
That's a good question.

484
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,940
I'm not

485
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,940
your real estate agent.

486
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,940
I came to help you

487
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,940
for my own purpose.

488
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,940
After the project is over,

489
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,940
I'll give you

490
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,940
a new contract.

491
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,940
I promise

492
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,940
that the resources of the new company

493
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
will be better than the one of Wanxin.

494
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,940
Since Miss Tang

495
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,940
has already chosen to give up,

496
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,940
I hope you won't

497
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,940
think too much.

498
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,940
Remember to do

499
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,940
something you regret.

500
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,940
I'll be waiting for you.

501
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,940
Tang Xin, it's me.

502
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,940
Tang Xin.

503
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,940
Tang Xin,

504
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,940
what happened?

505
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,940
Why didn't you open the door?

506
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,940
Tang Xin.

507
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,940
Tang Xin.

508
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,940
I don't know why

509
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,940
you didn't want to see me.

510
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,940
But I believe

511
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,940
you can hear me.

512
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,940
I've read all the news

513
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,940
on Weibo.

514
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,940
I know you're under

515
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,940
a lot of pressure.

516
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,940
But trust me,

517
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,940
I really want to help you.

518
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,940
I know you've been

519
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,940
under a lot of pressure.

520
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,940
Any action will be magnified.

521
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,940
Every step you take is very difficult.

522
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
If it weren't for your love,

523
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,940
you wouldn't have been able to do it.

524
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,940
Yes,

525
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,940
it may be useful to run away.

526
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,940
But every time you run away

527
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,940
and compromise,

528
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,940
it's the beginning of

529
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,940
your deep resentment.

530
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
I don't want you to be

531
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,940
locked down by someone else.

532
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,940
Do you understand?

533
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,940
So I want to ask you

534
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,940
to get back your courage

535
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,940
and try to get out of it.

536
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,940
It will really hurt if you

537
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,940
run away.

538
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,940
But if you don't

539
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,940
fight against fate once,

540
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,940
how can you know which one

541
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,940
is the real you?

542
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,940
You can go now.

543
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,940
I won't see you again.

544
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,940
Okay.

545
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,940
I respect your choice.

546
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,940
No matter what,

547
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,940
you have to work hard on your own.

548
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
I will always support you.

549
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,940
It seems that you have made up your mind.

550
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,940
It's a wise choice.

551
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:59,940
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

552
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,940
Okay.

553
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,940
I'm going to speed up the pace.

554
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,940
The show is going to start tomorrow.

555
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,940
Congratulations, Mr. Wan.

556
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,940
But as my mom said,

557
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,940
if the goldfish of Mr. Du

558
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,940
comes to continue to stir up trouble,

559
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,940
I will be nice to him.

560
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,940
You won't feel bad then, will you?

561
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,940
Try it.

562
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,940
Yes, yes, yes.

563
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,940
You are angry now.

564
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,940
Don't forget that

565
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,940
we are on the same boat now.

566
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,940
If I tell you what you said,

567
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,940
you will be punished.

568
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,940
Mr. Wan, don't forget

569
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,940
how many things I have

570
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,940
to make you turn the boat.

571
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,940
Be careful what you say.

572
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,940
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

573
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,940
I don't want you to be

574
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,940
the chains that are tied to you

575
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,940
and turn down.

576
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,940
Do you understand?

577
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,940
So I want you to get back your courage

578
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,940
and try to get out of it.

579
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,940
It will really hurt if you stay.

580
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,940
But if you don't fight against fate once,

581
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,940
how can you know which one

582
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
is the real you?

583
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,940
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

584
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,940
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

585
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,940
I seem to see

586
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,940
an ant on a hot pot.

587
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,940
And it's also an ant with dark circles.

588
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,940
When do you have the mood to joke?

589
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,940
Are you worried about Tang Xin?

590
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,940
I went to her house today,

591
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,940
but she didn't want to see me.

592
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,940
I don't know what happened.

593
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,940
Don't worry.

594
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,940
Since the video from Wan Shan

595
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,940
has been sent,

596
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,940
then it doesn't matter

597
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,940
to Wan Shan anymore.

598
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,940
No matter what kind of evidence

599
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,940
she brings out,

600
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,940
it's no longer a threat

601
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,940
to Wan Shan.

602
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,940
She is safe now.

603
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,940
But Wan Shan

604
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
will not give up on us.

605
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,940
I will take the initiative to find Mr. Fan

606
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,940
to admit my mistake.

607
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,940
I will take the responsibility for this.

608
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,940
Why are you laughing?

609
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,940
It's not easy to hear

610
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,940
the word we in your mouth.

611
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,940
Here.

612
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,940
It's not my style

613
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,940
to let little ants

614
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,940
have a big pot.

615
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,940
Since childhood,

616
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,940
have you ever seen

617
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,940
something that your brother Yuan Yuan

618
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,940
can't handle?

619
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,940
How old are you?

620
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,940
You still call me brother Yuan Yuan?

621
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,940
Then,

622
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,940
have you thought of a way?

623
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,940
How can I give up

624
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,940
in the end?

625
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,940
I'll give you coffee.

626
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,940
It's to prepare you for the battle.

627
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,940
Here, cheers.

628
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,940
Cheers.

629
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,940
Cheers.

630
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,940
Hello, Su Shang.

631
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,940
Boss, Wan Xing

632
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,940
is holding a temporary board meeting

633
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,940
at 9 o'clock this morning.

634
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,940
He asks you to join with Mr. Fan.

635
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,940
Okay, I got it.

636
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,940
Jiang Jun,

637
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,940
I'll send you

638
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,940
a location number later.

639
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,940
You must find this person

640
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,940
before 9 o'clock.

641
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,940
Tell him to fix the phone for me as soon as possible.

642
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,940
Phone?

643
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,940
Yes, it's very important.

644
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
We don't have much time.

645
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,940
We can finish the task on time.

646
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,940
Don't worry.

647
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,940
Okay, I'm leaving.

648
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
I'm leaving.

649
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,940
There must be a high-ranking person

650
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,940
in the convenience store downstairs.

651
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,940
It's quite high.

652
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,940
Hello, welcome.

653
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,940
Lily.

654
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,940
Jun Jun?

655
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,940
You don't work today.

656
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,940
Why are you here?

657
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,940
No, I'm here to find...

658
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,940
You must be here to find me, right?

659
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,940
Tell me.

660
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,940
I'm here to find you.

661
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,940
I'm looking for a high-ranking person.

662
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,940
High-ranking person?

663
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
You mean Yao Ming?

664
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,940
No, no, no.

665
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,940
Hurry up.

666
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,940
Hurry up.

667
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,940
He's fine.

668
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,940
Do you know who he is?

669
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,940
I'll tell you later if I need anything.

670
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,940
I'm not here to play.

671
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,940
I'm here to listen to you.

672
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,940
I'll answer your phone.

673
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,940
Hello?

674
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,940
I'm here.

675
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,940
He's the one you're looking for?

676
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,940
What's going on?

677
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,940
What's going on?

678
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,940
How did you know him?

679
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,940
We just met, okay?

680
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,940
You won't fall for him, will you?

681
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,940
I'm looking at your head.

682
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,940
I have something urgent to talk to him.

683
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,940
Hello, I'm Zhang Jun.

684
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,940
Hello, I'm Li Xiaochun.

685
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,940
I'm here to ask about your phone.

686
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,940
This is your phone, right?

687
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,940
The file has been repaired.

688
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,940
But it's a little difficult.

689
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,940
So it may take a long time.

690
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,940
I'm in a hurry to get the information.

691
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,940
So please hurry up.

692
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,940
Okay.

693
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,940
Yuan Shuai,

694
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,940
it seems that your secret weapon is him.

695
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,940
I'm sorry, everyone.

696
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,940
I've been waiting for you.

697
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
I'm sorry, everyone.

698
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,940
I've been waiting for you.

699
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,940
Recently, because of my personal reasons,

700
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,940
I got into a small storm.

701
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,940
It has caused a certain impact on the company.

702
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,940
I apologize to everyone here.

703
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,940
But fortunately,

704
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,940
the truth has come to light.

705
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,940
The lightest of the light.

706
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,940
But I'm very grateful

707
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,940
that everyone is willing to continue to trust me.

708
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,940
I will also be able to

709
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,940
let the company recover its normal operation

710
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,940
within a month

711
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,940
to a normal state.

712
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,940
The matter has been resolved.

713
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,940
But

714
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,940
the company's interests

715
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,940
have been greatly damaged.

716
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,940
So the person who is responsible

717
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,940
must come out and take responsibility.

718
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,940
I have announced two things

719
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,940
because I have been working in the school.

720
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,940
The first thing is

721
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,940
that Wanxing

722
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,940
will forever stop

723
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,940
working with MH.

724
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,940
I know.

725
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,940
We have been working with MH

726
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,940
for many years.

727
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,940
But this time,

728
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,940
the way MH did

729
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,940
made me very disappointed.

730
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,940
Don't worry about the IPO problem.

731
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,940
I have found another investment bank.

732
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,940
A top investment bank.

733
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,940
The second thing is

734
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,940
that Wanxing Entertainment is now

735
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,940
the vice president of the Ministry of Economy.

736
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,940
Lu Sheng.

737
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,940
The two main characters in the photo

738
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,940
are the former president of MH.

739
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,940
The other is our President Luo.

740
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,940
The two of them are colluding in private

741
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,940
to slander me.

742
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,940
I even know that

743
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,940
one of our directors

744
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,940
has been tempted by the two of them.

745
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
There is even someone

746
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
who is the CEO of the new CEO

747
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,940
of President Luo.

748
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,940
I understand

749
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,940
that you are deceived by the two of them.

750
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,940
I don't want to pursue this matter.

751
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,940
But the two of them,

752
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,940
Yuan Shuai and Lu Sheng,

753
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,940
must be responsible for this matter.

754
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,940
That's right.

755
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:35,940
94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99.

756
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,940
Yeah!

757
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,940
Xiaochun, you are amazing!

758
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,940
Okay.

759
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,940
Basically, the answer

760
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,940
has been sent to your new phone.

761
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,940
But there may be some changes recently.

762
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
It's okay. It's okay.

763
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,940
It's enough to save lives.

764
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,940
Come back and I will give you a reward.

765
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,940
I'm leaving first.

766
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,940
Bye-bye.

767
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,940
Come on! Bye-bye.

768
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,420
Tang Xin's

769
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,940
dormitory.

770
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,940
It clearly pointed out

771
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,940
that Yuan Shuai and Lu Sheng

772
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,940
had an unfair private deal.

773
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,940
He also admitted

774
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,940
that he was slandering me.

775
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,940
I also presented this dormitory

776
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,940
to the media at the same time.

777
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,940
I believe more people

778
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,940
will stand up

779
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,940
to provide more evidence.

780
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,940
I wonder

781
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,940
how you two feel

782
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,940
when you read this dormitory.

783
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,940
The phone is fixed. I'll send it to you right away.

784
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,940
President Wan, thank you for your hard work.

785
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,540
But now I have some information.

786
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:51,140
I've already sent it to your email.

787
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,940
Why don't you sit down and take a look first?

788
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,940
President Wan, I'm sorry.

789
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,940
Everyone, the evidence that President Luo has sent to everyone

790
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,940
is the evidence that Wan Shan has been

791
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,940
falsifying data and creating black screen for the show for years.

792
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,940
This kind of behavior has seriously affected the safety,

793
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,940
health and regular operation of the industry.

794
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,940
I think that compared to the photos that President Wan has taken,

795
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,940
the information in your email is more persuasive

796
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,940
and has legal effect.

797
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,940
You're a liar!

798
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,940
This is a show I created myself.

799
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,940
How could I destroy it myself?

800
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:45,940
The show has its own script and rules.

801
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,940
I've been running it for so many years.

802
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
For what?

803
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,940
Isn't it just for the sake of everyone here?

804
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,940
For the benefit of this company,

805
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,940
isn't everyone here a winner of this benefit?

806
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,940
Once this information is sent out,

807
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,940
whether it's true or false,

808
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,940
it will cause a huge damage to our IPO.

809
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,940
Everyone, you can either wait to take responsibility

810
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,940
or directly declare bankruptcy.

811
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,940
Let's see.

812
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,940
Is President Luo

813
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,940
really doing this for the sake of the business?

814
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,940
Or is he ignoring the interests of all the directors

815
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,940
and ignoring the company's future?

816
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,940
I'm sorry.

817
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,940
I'm sorry.

818
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,940
President Wan,

819
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,940
don't be so upset.

820
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,940
President Luo,

821
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,940
you just said that everything you do

822
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,940
is for the interests of all the directors

823
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,940
and the company.

824
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,940
That's great.

825
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,940
Everyone,

826
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,940
I have a recording on my phone.

827
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,940
Why don't you listen to it first?

828
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,940
After you've finished listening,

829
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,940
please evaluate it yourself.

830
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,940
Tang Xin,

831
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,940
you said you wanted to listen to me.

832
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,940
But it's not too late.

833
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,940
As long as you know how to do things,

834
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,940
and make me happy,

835
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,940
I still have a way to make you happy.

836
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,940
This...

837
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,940
This is your so-called evidence.

838
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,940
Just a few more words of recording.

839
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,940
What do you take us as sensible people?

840
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,940
This is too childish.

841
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,940
If you don't think this recording

842
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,940
is convincing enough,

843
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,940
I have a video.

844
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,940
There's a trainee called Tang Xin

845
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,940
in our company.

846
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,940
She seems to have a lot of bad words to say.

847
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,940
She probably won't believe

848
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,940
the bad words of the kids.

849
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,940
If you have any questions,

850
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,940
please ask me.

851
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,940
Miss Jiang,

852
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,940
you

853
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,940
made Tang Xin

854
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,940
slander me.

855
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,940
You hinted that if I gave you some money,

856
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,940
you could convince Tang Xin to withdraw.

857
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,940
For the sake of everyone,

858
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,940
for the company's interests,

859
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,940
I chose to compromise.

860
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,940
Now you're using this video to frame me.

861
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,940
You're a thief who's good at catching thieves.

862
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,940
You really make me want to see.

863
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,940
You really make me want to see.

864
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,940
How can people be like this?

865
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,940
Since ancient times,

866
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,940
Duan An has been taking care of

867
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,940
human and material evidence.

868
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,940
Even Tang Xin has withdrawn.

869
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,940
Do you still have evidence?

870
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,940
Evidence?

871
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,940
Do you have it?

872
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,940
I'm gonna be happy

873
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,940
and strong enough to love

874
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,940
I'm gonna be someone

875
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,940
I only wanna know

876
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,940
Then you'll be staying

877
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,940
every day of my life

878
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,940
Never been so brave

879
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,940
I will run away

880
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,940
If it's what you want

881
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,940
What you like

882
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,940
I don't mind

883
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,940
I can close my eyes

884
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,940
I can stay behind

885
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,940
waste my time

886
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,940
Walk into your plan

887
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,940
Like I never knew

888
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,940
You were not mine

889
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,940
Make you satisfied

890
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,940
Wear another mask

891
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,940
You never realize

892
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,940
Things I do for love

893
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,940
I think I'm tired

894
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,940
I think I'm blind

895
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,940
Don't know how

896
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,940
to feel

897
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,940
Don't know how

898
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,940
to heal

899
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,940
You walk so fast

900
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,940
Can't catch your light

901
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,940
You fly so high

902
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,940
Leave all the things behind

903
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,940
And our story

904
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,940
Leave all love nowhere

905
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,940
to find

906
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,940
I think I'm tired

907
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,940
I think I'm blind

908
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,940
Don't know how

909
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,940
to feel

910
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,940
Don't know how

911
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,940
to heal

912
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,940
You walk so fast

913
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,940
Can't catch your light

914
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,940
You fly so high

915
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,940
Leave all the things behind

916
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,940
And our story

917
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,940
Leave all love nowhere

918
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,940
to find
