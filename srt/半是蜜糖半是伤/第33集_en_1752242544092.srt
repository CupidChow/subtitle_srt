1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,540
little bit of a

3
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,380
little bit of a

4
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,340
little bit of a

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,340
little bit of a

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,340
little bit of a

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,340
little bit of a

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,340
little bit of a

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,340
little bit of a

10
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,080
yeah

11
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,080
up

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,080
well

13
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:21,920
ah

14
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:23,880
yeah

15
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:52,980
When You Recommend the

16
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,460
Destiny

17
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:55,540
Episode 21

18
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,740
Come here.

19
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,060
He was fired on the day of the scandal.

20
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,300
I had some work to do,

21
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,700
so I stayed for a few more days.

22
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,660
Why didn't you wait for me to come back

23
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,940
and resign?

24
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,580
The matter of SKO

25
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,580
was really handled by me and Xiang Ning.

26
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,420
Someone has to take the responsibility.

27
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,020
Now it's not possible to prove

28
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,540
that you are the one who leaked the news.

29
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,300
There is still room for improvement.

30
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,700
Mr. Du, you're looking for me?

31
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,180
I can't find any clue

32
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,420
about the price leak.

33
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,660
You don't have to explain anything to me.

34
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,220
Do you have nothing to explain to me?

35
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,140
Mr. Du,

36
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,620
about the SKO price leak,

37
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,340
Xiang Ning and I

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,100
have an irreversible responsibility.

39
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,580
But I can guarantee that

40
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,060
the price

41
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,660
was not leaked from us.

42
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,980
Of course I believe you.

43
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,060
But the incident has already happened.

44
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,700
Someone has to take the responsibility.

45
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,540
Indeed.

46
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,980
The person in charge of this matter

47
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,500
is General Shi.

48
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,300
But when the news leaked,

49
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,660
he was on vacation.

50
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,660
So the most likely one

51
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,540
to leak the news

52
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,420
is you.

53
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,500
But we really didn't do it.

54
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,540
And the company

55
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,660
doesn't have any evidence to prove

56
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,580
that the price was leaked from us.

57
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,780
Shen Xing,

58
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,500
how many years have you been in the industry?

59
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,380
Three years.

60
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,460
Three years?

61
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,300
I'm not sure.

62
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,700
You must have seen a lot of

63
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,060
the rules of the industry

64
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,020
that ants are treated with respect.

65
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,300
How about this?

66
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,100
When General comes back,

67
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,180
just throw this pot away.

68
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,300
No.

69
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,060
It has nothing to do

70
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,580
with General.

71
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,020
Okay.

72
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,180
What if I leave now?

73
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,820
I can use my power

74
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,540
to declare to the outside world

75
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:45,940
that you are resigned

76
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,380
because of personal reasons.

77
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,300
If you keep hiding,

78
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,300
I may not be able to help you.

79
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,300
I understand what you mean.

80
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,020
I was wrong.

81
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,340
Someone has to take the responsibility.

82
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,380
Before I left MH,

83
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,980
I really wanted to thank you.

84
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,100
If you hadn't forgiven me,

85
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,180
I wouldn't have stayed in MH.

86
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,780
It seems that

87
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,700
I don't get along with MH.

88
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,980
So,

89
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,740
I have to go to Limu.

90
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,180
The current situation is not good.

91
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,020
You resigned at this critical moment.

92
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,300
You didn't find a good place to go.

93
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,420
It's too risky.

94
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,700
If I don't resign,

95
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,900
I'll be the one to leave.

96
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,020
Don't worry.

97
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,900
I will find

98
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,100
a better place.

99
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,460
Hello.

100
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,620
Okay.

101
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,820
I'll be right there.

102
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,420
I have some things

103
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,020
to deal with at the Ministry of Justice.

104
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,460
I'll go back first.

105
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,860
The whole company's income data has been reported.

106
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:12,980
Mr. Du.

107
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,300
This is the performance

108
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,980
of our company in the second half of the year.

109
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,020
Compared with the growth

110
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,780
of the company in the second half of the year,

111
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,380
under your leadership,

112
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,460
our sales success rate and the sales performance

113
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,660
have far exceeded

114
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,180
the second-place record.

115
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,060
Good.

116
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,100
Keep working hard.

117
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,620
Try to perform better

118
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,820
in the overseas market tomorrow.

119
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,020
Okay, Mr. Du.

120
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,820
Go back to your work.

121
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,460
You came back without a good rest.

122
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,660
Yuan Shuai will say that

123
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,860
I'm on the same side.

124
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,660
Mr. Du.

125
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,260
I know you're busy

126
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,700
and don't have time to answer my phone.

127
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,220
But SK also has to

128
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,100
lower the price

129
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,140
and leak the information.

130
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,420
I believe it wasn't done

131
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,020
by Shen Xing and Xiang Ding.

132
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,940
I hope you can give them

133
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,860
another chance to find out the truth.

134
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,300
I'll do my best.

135
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,340
I'll do my best.

136
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,460
I'll do my best.

137
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,500
I'll do my best.

138
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,620
I'll do my best.

139
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,660
I'll do my best.

140
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,700
I'll do my best.

141
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,820
I'll do my best.

142
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,940
I'll do my best.

143
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,300
This matter

144
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,340
has been taken over

145
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,380
during your vacation.

146
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,140
So it has nothing to do with you.

147
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,660
You should know

148
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,780
how much the company has suffered

149
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,740
because of this.

150
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,100
Moreover,

151
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,780
in this industry,

152
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,100
not everyone has a chance to be a talent.

153
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,900
Whether it's directly or indirectly,

154
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,340
they all have a responsibility

155
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,460
except Shen Xing.

156
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,820
Are you sure?

157
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,660
Is there anything else?

158
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,140
It's okay.

159
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,340
I'll go first.

160
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,700
The matter of SKO

161
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,740
has indeed been taken over

162
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,620
by Xiang Ding and me.

163
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,180
Someone has to take on this responsibility.

164
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,460
This matter

165
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,500
has been taken over

166
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,540
during your vacation.

167
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,140
So it has nothing to do with you.

168
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,340
You should know

169
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,380
how much the company has suffered

170
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,420
because of this.

171
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,860
Moreover,

172
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,540
in this industry,

173
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,700
not everyone has a chance to be a talent.

174
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,180
There's not only one way to live.

175
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,180
Perhaps the only thing I've been insisting on

176
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,100
is not the only choice.

177
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,380
Hello?

178
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,980
Why didn't you answer my call?

179
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,140
I was on my way home.

180
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,020
I didn't see you.

181
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,660
What happened?

182
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,580
Nothing.

183
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,140
You still can't change

184
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,180
your personality

185
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,220
who loves to act tough.

186
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,740
You've always been

187
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,500
a man of your word.

188
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,700
There's no way

189
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,580
you can't just

190
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,940
keep it to yourself.

191
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,300
Have you forgotten

192
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,700
that you have a strong boyfriend

193
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,140
as your backer?

194
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,500
You're the one

195
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,420
who has a strong boyfriend as your backer.

196
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,260
You're not a single man anymore.

197
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,220
Are you trying to be smart?

198
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,340
You're so accurate.

199
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,820
Tell me.

200
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,260
What happened?

201
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,540
When I was on vacation,

202
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,740
Shen Xing and Xiang Ding's project

203
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,700
had a problem.

204
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,220
They already resigned.

205
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,380
I thought

206
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,220
things would be resolved.

207
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,500
I thought something happened to you.

208
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,020
So this is what happened.

209
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,420
Listen to me.

210
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,100
Stop messing around with me.

211
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,420
Stop messing around with me.

212
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,060
Little dumb.

213
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,220
How did you know I was here?

214
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
I'll protect you.

215
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,900
After all,

216
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,100
you're a person who doesn't have me

217
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,100
and doesn't even remember to eat.

218
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,940
Let's go home.

219
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,140
miş

220
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,380
Are you still thinking about the company?

221
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,740
Shen Xing and Xiangding

222
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,060
were fired

223
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,060
재밌

224
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,420
only because of me.

225
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:15,940
Alright.

226
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,340
Stop thinking.

227
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,860
Have a good rest.

228
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,540
Stop thinking.

229
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,260
Look at you.

230
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,300
You must be having a headache.

231
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:31,860
Here.

232
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,500
Recently,

233
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,180
I've learned online

234
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,820
a massage method

235
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,860
for sunstroke.

236
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,780
It's said

237
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,420
it can relieve fatigue.

238
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,140
How do you feel?

239
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,020
Do you feel better?

240
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,700
Much better.

241
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,020
You

242
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,940
just need to rest.

243
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,820
Duan Jun,

244
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,180
I don't object to

245
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,180
you being so busy with work.

246
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,100
I'll be happy for you

247
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,020
if you get a good result.

248
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,140
But if you break down

249
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,300
because of work,

250
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,100
I'll be so sad.

251
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,540
I know.

252
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,740
It's good to have you.

253
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,020
Mo Cai, what are you doing?

254
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,300
What's wrong?

255
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,820
I didn't buy you a dog.

256
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,820
Why are you angry?

257
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,060
I know you'll forget.

258
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,940
I've bought it.

259
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,420
Come down.

260
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,540
Let's go.

261
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,540
Yuan Shuai,

262
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,940
you've been

263
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,260
the fool in the house recently.

264
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,460
Of course.

265
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,900
Miss Jiang,

266
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,180
you just found out.

267
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,620
How about

268
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,780
we get a baby?

269
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,420
No.

270
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,580
I don't like

271
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,380
others invading our private world.

272
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,140
I just like

273
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,020
to be your master and your enemy.

274
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,740
So you can be happy.

275
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,060
I don't feel tired at all.

276
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,380
You're so scheming.

277
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,340
You say that

278
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,460
makes me look like

279
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,900
a heartless lazy woman.

280
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,100
What lazy woman?

281
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,060
I've said it.

282
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,540
You're my queen.

283
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,300
You'll be my

284
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,380
queen forever.

285
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,020
My queen,

286
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,220
now

287
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,340
go to bed.

288
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,500
Okay.

289
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,380
Go.

290
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,700
Yuan Shuai,

291
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,940
after I've done

292
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,660
what's in De Lu's hands,

293
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,900
I'll resign

294
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,540
and be your Mrs. Yuan.

295
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,380
Why are the data

296
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,300
on the two files

297
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,220
different?

298
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,940
You didn't hear a word

299
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,500
of my concern for you.

300
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:16,980
Am I the only one

301
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,740
in this world

302
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,900
who cares about your health?

303
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,500
No.

304
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,060
Many projects

305
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,140
are stuck with me these days.

306
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,620
They can't be implemented.

307
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,060
And I should be responsible

308
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,420
for Xiangding and Shen Xing's resignation.

309
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,420
This matter is

310
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,140
very unfair.

311
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,260
I can't wait any longer.

312
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,300
It's unfair

313
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,300
that MH has its own

314
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,140
investigation system.

315
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,100
Can't you

316
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,060
run the world without you?

317
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,100
Zhang Jun, you're too arrogant.

318
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,340
I'm arrogant?

319
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,660
If you were me today,

320
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,420
would you leave them alone?

321
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,940
I've made up my mind.

322
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,620
As long as I

323
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,420
handle these things,

324
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:02,900
I'll go...

325
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,060
You'll resign?

326
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,420
Zhang Jun,

327
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,740
I won't let you

328
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,460
put the whole person

329
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,780
on the job.

330
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,700
You can resign.

331
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,260
We'll get married after you resign.

332
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,820
I can take care of you

333
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,940
for the rest of my life.

334
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,980
Why should I

335
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,420
need you to take care of me?

336
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,940
I have both hands and feet,

337
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,140
I have education and ability.

338
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,780
I can earn money

339
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,500
and support myself.

340
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,060
I've always done

341
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,340
this for so many years.

342
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,660
That's not what I mean.

343
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,220
I just want to protect you.

344
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,340
Again?

345
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,060
You've always liked

346
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,260
to protect me

347
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,700
and take care of me.

348
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,380
But I'm a grown-up now.

349
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,220
I can resign

350
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,300
or get married.

351
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,980
I can discuss with you.

352
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,300
But I can't be ordered.

353
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,180
Wen Shuai,

354
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,620
I have my own life.

355
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,620
I have my responsibilities

356
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,500
and plans.

357
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,780
I hope you can respect me.

358
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,340
I'm going to work now.

359
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,540
Respect you?

360
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,340
Okay.

361
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,420
From now on,

362
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,740
you can do whatever you want.

363
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:13,940
I won't do anything.

364
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,420
You'd better sleep outside.

365
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,340
If you're sick,

366
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,260
how can you work?

367
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,500
You're so ungrateful.

368
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,740
Mr. Du has a morning meeting today.

369
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,940
It will end at about 12 o'clock.

370
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,800
Good night.

371
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,940
I'm sorry.

372
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,940
I'm sorry.

373
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,940
I'm sorry.

374
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,940
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,940
I'm sorry.

376
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,940
I'm sorry.

377
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,940
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,940
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
I'm sorry.

380
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,940
I'm sorry.

381
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,940
I'm sorry.

382
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,940
I'm sorry.

383
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
I'm sorry.

384
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
I'm sorry.

385
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,940
I'm sorry.

386
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
I'm sorry.

387
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,940
I'm sorry.

388
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,940
I'm sorry.

389
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,940
I'm sorry.

390
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,940
I'm sorry.

391
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,940
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,940
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,940
I'm sorry.

394
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,940
I'm sorry.

395
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,940
I'm sorry.

396
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,940
I'm sorry.

397
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,940
I'm sorry.

398
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,940
I'm sorry.

399
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,940
I'm sorry.

400
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,940
惹眼看完了

401
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,940
Go to do your work

402
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,940
as soon as possible

403
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,940
Hi, Qiaoqiao

404
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,940
Look at these

405
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,940
I picked them by myself

406
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,940
Each one of you

407
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
represents

408
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,740
one

409
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,940
I miss you

410
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,940
Do you like it

411
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,940
Your

412
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
I

413
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,940
miss

414
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,940
you

415
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,940
do I

416
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,540
You seem to be short-lived.

417
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,460
You treat my home as a flower shop every day.

418
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,180
Now you treat my company as a flower shop.

419
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,220
Aren't you annoyed?

420
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,500
I'm not annoyed.

421
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,580
I'm annoyed.

422
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,580
Good night.

423
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,620
What are you doing?

424
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
Sorry to trouble you.

425
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,860
What are you doing?

426
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,820
I won't give up.

427
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,340
I will always wait for you.

428
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,460
You are my only hope.

429
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,740
I will use my only love

430
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,340
to wait for you until the end.

431
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
You are my only hope.

432
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Okay.

433
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,460
It's been so many years.

434
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,860
But it's the first time I see you being shy.

435
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,820
I'm well-maintained.

436
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,820
I'm in good shape.

437
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,220
Stop pretending.

438
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,220
I know it.

439
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,700
I think

440
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,300
you should just obey him.

441
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,420
You've been working so hard for so many years.

442
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,260
If a woman doesn't have the quality of love,

443
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,660
she will cry.

444
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,740
Don't be too spoiled by Yuan Shuai.

445
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,740
Be careful of becoming a fat woman.

446
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,180
By the way,

447
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,220
I've checked the S.K.O. secret case for you.

448
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,820
Only a few people

449
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,100
above the VIP level know their original data.

450
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,660
So, Xiang Li and Shen Xing

451
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,860
must have been wronged.

452
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,860
It's just...

453
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,260
I understand.

454
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,860
I'm going to find him.

455
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,780
I heard that

456
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,100
Manager Shen and Manager Xiang

457
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,980
are having trouble finding a job recently.

458
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,220
After all, it's a big deal to leak secrets in the industry.

459
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,980
Although it's from the bottom,

460
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,540
who dares to use it when there are some mistakes?

461
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,500
They usually look...

462
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,220
You two are too idle.

463
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,260
Mr. Jiang.

464
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,780
Don't let me hear such nonsense again.

465
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,820
Okay, that's it.

466
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,420
Come in.

467
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,740
Mr. Du.

468
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,460
I told you to go back and have a good rest.

469
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,460
Why are you here again?

470
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,620
I want to talk to you about Shen Xing and Xiang Li.

471
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,500
I compared the leaked data last night.

472
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
I found that they didn't do it.

473
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,100
They didn't have any motive to do it.

474
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,860
Sit down.

475
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,340
Since you want to know,

476
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,340
I won't hide it from you.

477
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,620
Actually,

478
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,500
the chairman of S4KL

479
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,420
is a classmate of our senior college.

480
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,620
And they are very close.

481
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,500
So when this happened,

482
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,860
the senior college was very angry.

483
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,940
They thought we were selling S4KL.

484
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,980
They kept giving me pressure.

485
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,020
They asked me to find someone to take responsibility.

486
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,220
I couldn't do anything.

487
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,700
But I'm responsible.

488
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,860
I should take responsibility for what I should do.

489
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,860
How can they sacrifice for me?

490
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,660
Jiang Jun.

491
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,260
I hope you can understand

492
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,180
the reason why you're in a hurry.

493
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,180
Moreover,

494
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,100
you were on leave when the leak was leaked.

495
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,820
It's not about sacrificing for you.

496
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,260
What about them?

497
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,580
The rumor of major loss

498
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,100
has a great impact on their future job.

499
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,380
And we don't know what the truth is.

500
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,340
If we can't find the source of the leak,

501
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,340
it will happen again.

502
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,340
Even the third...

503
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,060
What's wrong with you?

504
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,340
Yesterday, in order to let them accept the new price,

505
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,340
it was a bit too much.

506
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,220
Then,

507
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,740
did they accept it?

508
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,140
Although it's a bit difficult,

509
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,660
they finally accepted it.

510
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,580
Jiang Jun.

511
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,260
I know you're not satisfied with my decision.

512
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,020
But if no one

513
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,380
takes responsibility for it in time,

514
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,620
I can't let them get away with it.

515
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,060
And I tried to delay the time to find out the truth.

516
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,540
But there are too many people in the scene.

517
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,420
I can't confirm it in a short time.

518
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,780
If I insist,

519
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,980
the situation will only get worse.

520
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,580
I'm worried that

521
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,660
I'll be blamed for it

522
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,020
and be kicked out.

523
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,420
Do you want that day to come?

524
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,660
I did this to protect her

525
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,260
and to protect you.

526
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,780
Let's talk about it, okay?

527
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,460
Okay.

528
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,100
You...

529
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,580
Are you in pain?

530
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,580
Do you have medicine? I'll get it for you.

531
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,500
It's in my drawer. Thank you.

532
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,980
The story of the chase

533
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,980
is basically a story about a man who's just trying to be fresh.

534
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,980
The heroine is a fool who doesn't know anything.

535
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,980
When time passes, her freshness will disappear.

536
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,980
The heroine will definitely be easily separated.

537
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,180
The same upstairs.

538
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,980
From a love at first sight to a perfect marriage.

539
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,980
If they're so different, they won't be together for long.

540
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,980
They'll get divorced sooner or later.

541
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,980
You're the one who's getting divorced.

542
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,980
The whole family is getting divorced.

543
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,980
They're so happy.

544
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,980
They're so happy.

545
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,980
They're so happy.

546
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,980
They're so happy.

547
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,980
They're so happy.

548
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,980
They're so happy.

549
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,980
They're so happy.

550
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,980
They're so happy.

551
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,980
They're so happy.

552
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,980
I already said I'm a rock program.

553
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,980
I didn't say it.

554
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,920
I don't have any other person

555
00:25:50,920 --> 00:26:11,120
to say

556
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,980
to modify my job.

557
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,900
nerd

558
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,860
call

559
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,980
Bymmust

560
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,700
Always want to meet you

561
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,960
In one second it can not stop yearning

562
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,060
Want to stop

563
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,500
Waiting you to stop

564
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,980
I'm not going to be a big person.

565
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,980
Come.

566
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,980
What's wrong?

567
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,980
I don't know.

568
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,980
You don't care about me that much.

569
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,980
I know.

570
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,980
I've been drawing in front of you for a few times.

571
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,980
You don't even care about me.

572
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,980
No.

573
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,980
I do.

574
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,980
I'm going to launch a new activity recently.

575
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,980
So I'm busy.

576
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,980
I'm busy.

577
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,980
So I'm busy.

578
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,980
I'll be with you when I'm done.

579
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,980
Okay?

580
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,980
What activity?

581
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,980
Why didn't you tell me?

582
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,980
I'm going to launch a new activity.

583
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,980
It's called 72 hours of love insurance.

584
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,980
Why 72 hours?

585
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,980
Have you ever heard of love?

586
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,980
Is it your extreme theory?

587
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,980
Have you ever seen a movie?

588
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,980
Have you ever seen a movie?

589
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980
The two leading characters in the movie,

590
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,980
Jack and Rose,

591
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,980
the reason why their love story is so touching

592
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,980
is because in these three days,

593
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,980
they have experienced love and death.

594
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,980
They have experienced separation and separation of life and death.

595
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,980
So it's touching.

596
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,980
Think about it.

597
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,980
If these two people

598
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,980
have been safely on the ship,

599
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,980
they haven't experienced that shipwreck,

600
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,980
will they accept

601
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,980
the heavy tests of family, time and class?

602
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,980
Then it won't be touching.

603
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,980
So what I want to say is

604
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,980
love is just a temporary chemical reaction

605
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,980
generated in a specific time or space.

606
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,980
So you mean

607
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,980
our love

608
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,980
has passed 72 hours of insurance, right?

609
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,980
Actually,

610
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,980
you don't love me that much, right?

611
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,980
I mean

612
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,980
love is just a temporary chemical reaction.

613
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,980
In all human relationships,

614
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,980
the stability is relatively low.

615
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,980
It's meaningless to always entangle love and hate.

616
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,980
I just want to prove through this activity

617
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,980
that matchability is really important.

618
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,980
Because you see,

619
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,980
two people are together...

620
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,980
I see.

621
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,980
I'm not so attractive in your eyes.

622
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,980
What's wrong?

623
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,980
I want to be a chef.

624
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
Don't stop me.

625
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,980
I didn't mean that.

626
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,980
I don't listen.

627
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,980
The program is almost ready.

628
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,980
Wait a minute.

629
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,980
Wait a minute.

630
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,980
Lin Xiaochun.

631
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,980
I'm so sad.

632
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,980
I'm really leaving.

633
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,980
I'm leaving.

634
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,980
I'm leaving.

635
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,980
I'm leaving.

636
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,980
It's cold outside.

637
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,980
Remember to wear a jacket when you go out.

638
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,980
I'll go out later.

639
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,980
Remember to bring the key.

640
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,980
Lin Xiaochun, I'm telling you.

641
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,980
I'm really leaving this time.

642
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,980
I'm really leaving.

643
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,980
Ding Li.

644
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,980
Ding Li.

645
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,980
Master, I don't close the door.

646
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,980
Don't drive.

647
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,980
Ding Li.

648
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,980
Ding Li.

649
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,980
My phone.

650
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,980
Master, where are you going?

651
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,980
I'm going to see Ding Li.

652
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,980
Boss, I just confirmed with my iron rod.

653
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,980
I confirmed.

654
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,980
About the leak of Bao's family,

655
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,980
Chairman SKL was very angry.

656
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,980
But for the sake of the classmate in the high school of MH,

657
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,980
he said that as long as the problem was solved,

658
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,980
he didn't ask to fire the relevant person.

659
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,980
Are you sure?

660
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,980
I have to be sure.

661
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,980
He is the new secretary.

662
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,980
Since he said this,

663
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,980
it must be true.

664
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,980
Since there is no requirement to fire people,

665
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,980
why must Du Lei let them go?

666
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,980
There are only two possibilities.

667
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,980
Either he leaked,

668
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,980
or Shen Xing and Xiang Ding touched something.

669
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,980
They must be driven away.

670
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,980
Anyway, this is not so simple.

671
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,980
Do you want to tell General?

672
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
I think about it.

673
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,980
You go to work first.

674
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
Go home early at night.

675
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,980
I have something to tell you.

676
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,980
Why do you interfere in other people's life?

677
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,980
Right?

678
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,980
The clue I found,

679
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,980
you don't ask me, I don't tell you.

680
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,980
I found something about SKL.

681
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,980
Do you want to hear?

682
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,980
Say.

683
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,980
Please.

684
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,980
Say or not to say.

685
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,980
I will not say.

686
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,980
I will not say.

687
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,980
I will not say.

688
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,980
I will not say.

689
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,980
You said.

690
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,980
You said.

691
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,980
I will not say.

692
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,980
I will not say.

693
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,980
I will not say.

694
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,980
I will not say.

695
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,980
I will not say.

696
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,980
I will not say.

697
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,980
I will not say.

698
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,980
I will not say.

699
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,980
I will not say.

700
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,980
I will not say.

701
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,980
I will not say.

702
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,980
Why don't you say?

703
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,980
I will not say.

704
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,980
I will not say.

705
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,980
I want to know.

706
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,980
What's the question?

707
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,980
You said the first thing you will say today.

708
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,320
I came back for you.

709
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,360
Excuse me.

710
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,240
Is this your mobile phone?

711
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,820
Sorry, impossible.

712
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,320
Thank you.

713
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,520
Hello, little guy.

714
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,960
Can you talk to me?

715
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,740
What?

716
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,380
What?

717
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,300
Can I borrow your phone

718
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,180
to make a call?

719
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:40,900
Sister.

720
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,380
Are you talking to me?

721
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,980
You know you're over 10.

722
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,100
Sister?

723
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,060
I...

724
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,420
What?

725
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,940
Well,

726
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,300
little friend,

727
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,180
can you lend your phone

728
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,540
to sister and call her?

729
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,660
No, no, no.

730
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,620
Take it.

731
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,380
Hello?

732
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,340
Hello, Zhenzhen.

733
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,300
It's me.

734
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,420
Did you change your phone?

735
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,300
No.

736
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,420
I borrowed a phone

737
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,700
from a young man next to me.

738
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,980
What's up?

739
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,020
I...

740
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,100
ran away from home.

741
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,340
You...

742
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,380
You're so noisy over there.

743
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,020
Do you hear me?

744
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,260
I mean

745
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,100
I was going to run away from home.

746
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,100
Maybe I'll have to rely on you in the future.

747
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,220
Li Li,

748
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,100
I have an emergency.

749
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,580
If you want to see me,

750
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,540
go to my house first.

751
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,580
I'm hanging up.

752
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,260
I'm hanging up.

753
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,060
I'm hanging up.

754
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,860
I'm hanging up.

755
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,580
I'm hanging up.

756
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,500
Go to your house?

757
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,620
I'll be in trouble.

758
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,220
Here's your phone, bro.

759
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,660
You called me?

760
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,100
Thank you.

761
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,820
I didn't expect you to run away

762
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,100
at your age.

763
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,180
Who said I ran away from home?

764
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,140
I...

765
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,980
I just came out to enjoy the view.

766
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,780
Then you can continue to enjoy the view.

767
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,500
Okay.

768
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,340
I want to ask you.

769
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,220
Why do you keep looking at the sky?

770
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,460
I'm not looking at the sky.

771
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,820
I'm looking at love.

772
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,020
I see.

773
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,940
It's also a love

774
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,220
that 90 degrees look up to.

775
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,300
Okay.

776
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,860
Since we're all from the same path,

777
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,100
let's just get drunk and have a good time.

778
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,980
It's my pleasure.

779
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,020
How about it?

780
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,660
Okay.

781
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,580
Okay.

782
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,660
I didn't expect you to be such a persistent person.

783
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,940
I didn't expect your love story

784
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,460
to be so tough.

785
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,340
You're born with your own light.

786
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,020
We're destined to be the light.

787
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,020
We're so hard.

788
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,820
But you still successfully

789
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,020
caught up with your husband.

790
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,980
Unlike me,

791
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,660
I've been chasing my goddess for two years.

792
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,580
Now you still care about me.

793
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,260
You're my idol.

794
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,980
What idol?

795
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,700
I'm the one who likes you first.

796
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,780
I'm the one who confesses to you.

797
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,620
I'm the one who wants to marry you.

798
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,260
I'm the one who wants to have a baby.

799
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,220
I...

800
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,100
Huo Tian.

801
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,460
It's our wedding anniversary.

802
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,460
He...

803
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,980
He also told me

804
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,020
our love is not a guarantee anymore.

805
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,460
Stop it.

806
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,380
We're in the same boat.

807
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:22,980
Cheers.

808
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,220
Cheers.

809
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,820
Let's go to his love guarantee.

810
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:29,700
Yes.

811
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,820
Let's go to his love guarantee.

812
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,180
Cheers.

813
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:32,900
Cheers.

814
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,860
Cheers.

815
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,620
Do you want to listen to my song

816
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,740
written by my goddess?

817
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,860
Sure.

818
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:35,860
How do you think?

819
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,860
It's so nice.

820
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:43,860
But

821
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,260
I think you can adjust the lyrics.

822
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,700
If you kiss your goddess,

823
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,460
you'll definitely cry.

824
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,340
You like it?

825
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,660
I'll teach you to play the guitar.

826
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,580
You help me write the lyrics.

827
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,580
Okay.

828
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:57,780
Cheers.

829
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:58,820
Cheers.

830
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,700
Let's start, Mr. Wang.

831
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:04,740
Cheers.

832
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,500
Li Li.

833
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,580
I'm back.

834
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:16,980
Li Li.

835
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,180
Li Li.

836
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,740
Li Li.

837
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,780
Do I put it here?

838
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,620
This one.

839
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:56,580
This one.

840
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,300
This hand.

841
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,180
This one.

842
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:58,900
This one.

843
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,180
Yes.

844
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,140
This one.

845
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,020
Like this.

846
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,660
Like this.

847
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,100
Like this.

848
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:06,980
Put it down.

849
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:08,980
My husband is here.

850
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,260
Why did you pull my husband?

851
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,460
Oh no.

852
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,500
I'm so sorry.

853
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,700
Xiao Zhang, listen to me.

854
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,580
It's not like that.

855
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,380
Who?

856
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,700
Why did you touch my wife?

857
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,220
He is...

858
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,060
He is my fan.

859
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,620
Fan?

860
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,900
Did you forget that I helped you with the statistics?

861
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,500
Among the 108 fans,

862
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,900
none of them is male fans at all ages.

863
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,500
He is not my fan.

864
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,380
He...

865
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,100
He is my pursuer.

866
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,340
Yes.

867
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,300
I'm pursuing Li Li passionately.

868
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,620
Listen carefully.

869
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,380
I'm her husband.

870
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,740
This is my wife.

871
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,580
You'd better stay away from her.

872
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,580
Or I'll see you again and again.

873
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,300
Let's go.

874
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,700
Then be nice to her.

875
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:26,980
Did you hear that?

876
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,420
Hurry up.

877
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,980
It's time to tell her.

878
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,820
What's your attitude?

879
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,220
What attitude?

880
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,220
What should a person's attitude be?

881
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,500
I don't need to teach you.

882
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,340
Please tell me what you found.

883
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,540
Okay.

884
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,580
I got the news.

885
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,260
SKL's chairman

886
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,220
didn't ask MH to fire the project manager.

887
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,220
So your conclusion is...

888
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,500
My conclusion is that

889
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,860
Du Lei knew that

890
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,300
there was a better solution,

891
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,540
but he insisted on firing Xiangding and Shen Xing.

892
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,220
There's a reason for that.

893
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:12,980
I suspect that

894
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,500
Xiangding and Shen Xing

895
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,660
knew something that scared Du Lei.

896
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,420
They had to leave.

897
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:19,940
I think

898
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,540
they knew something

899
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,580
that scared Du Lei.

900
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,180
They had to leave.

901
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,140
But Du Lei told me

902
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,540
SKL insisted on taking responsibility.

903
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,220
He did that to protect Shen Xing.

904
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,980
And it seems that

905
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,340
he spent a lot of effort

906
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,780
to make the other person accept the new offer.

907
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,100
What do you mean?

908
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,020
You mean you believe Du Lei

909
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:40,900
but not me?

910
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,060
I don't believe him.

911
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,060
It's because he's really helped me a lot.

912
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,500
He helped you a lot.

913
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,340
Why do you think he helped you?

914
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,700
Because he likes you.

915
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,740
I'm not going to let you go.

916
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,940
I'm not going to let you go.

917
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,140
I'm not going to let you go.

918
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,340
I'm not going to let you go.

919
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,540
I'm not going to let you go.

920
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,900
I'm not going to let you go.

921
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,100
I'm not going to let you go.

922
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,380
I'm not going to let you go.

923
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,580
I'm not going to let you go.

924
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,940
I'm not going to let you go.

925
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,380
I'm not going to let you go.

926
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,740
I'm not going to let you go.

927
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,100
I'm not going to let you go.

928
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,460
I'm not going to let you go.

929
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,740
I'm not going to let you go.

930
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,180
I'm not going to let you go.

931
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,700
I'm not going to let you go.

932
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,380
I'm not going to let you go.

933
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,980
I'm not going to let you go.

934
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,340
I'm not going to let you go.

935
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,540
I'm not going to let you go.

936
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,980
I'm not going to let you go.

937
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,340
I'm not going to let you go.

938
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,700
I'm not going to let you go.

939
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,140
I'm not going to let you go.

940
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,500
I'm not going to let you go.

941
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,940
I'm not going to let you go.

942
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,380
I'm not going to let you go.

943
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,980
I'm not going to let you go.

944
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,580
I'm not going to let you go.

945
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,180
I'm not going to let you go.

946
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,780
I'm not going to let you go.

947
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,380
I'm not going to let you go.

948
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,980
I'm not going to let you go.

949
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,580

I'm not going to let you go.

954
