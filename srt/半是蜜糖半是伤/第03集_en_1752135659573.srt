1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Hi

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hi

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You wear like this to the interview

5
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
None of your business

6
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I remember I introduced you a position worth 300,000 a year

7
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
After all, the people who were sent to the last interview by MH are still the ones that many companies want

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The investment is so cruel

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's not for you

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't say too much

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Be careful, your face will hurt

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why do I have a bad feeling?

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hi

14
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hi, I'm the new person who came to the job interview

15
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hi, this way please

16
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Please sit

17
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Didn't you get eliminated in the last interview?

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hi

19
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The People's Bank has transferred the local government's special bonds into the social financing system

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The local government's special bonds are registered in the loan agency's daily statistics

21
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's all for my report

22
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Do you know what you did best?

23
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Your temperament

24
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Your temperament is the best in the company

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
My temperament?

26
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Don't you know that in MH, a person has a good sleep, a good energy, and a good spirit

27
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It means that he didn't invest his whole body into his job

28
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The blue star PRC financing has no results

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You don't even know where the problem is

30
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The industry is in a decline

31
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The capital is in the guanwang

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The financing has not been able to be settled

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I think you are in a decline

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You are in a decline

35
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The resignation report

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Go back and sign your name and hand it over to my office in the afternoon

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Director Xun, can you give me another chance?

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The chance is for the people in good condition

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sorry, you don't have a chance

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Director Xun, I'm getting married next week

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
How can I say it now?

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You can say that you can get married

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Get out

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Director Xun

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Get out

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
MH is the top investment department in Shanghai

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Since it is at the top of the pyramid

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It has to have a sense of crisis at any time

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So it is the most efficient in MH

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Today, four newbies have passed the 1% interview of MH

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
They are officially admitted

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And officially introduced to you

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Come in

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Come in

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You four will have three months of probation in MH

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
During the probation, I will be the judge

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The whole MH is done by a series of instructions

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The instructions are like your original codes

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Once you enter the high-speed operation, it will be completed

60
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is the office of Fan Xichang

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't come here if you have nothing to do

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is the office of Director Ma

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Director Ma is a man who is very particular about details

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So if you are in his group

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Be careful

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is the print room

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
This is the database

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is my office

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
In front is Director Yuan's office

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Director Yuan, you must have heard of MH

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
As long as he is in the high-speed operation, he will be the man

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't like people wearing the same color as me

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Take care of yourself

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay, the introduction is over

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Any other questions?

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
God of War

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I want to see who will be defeated in the future

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Boss, I heard that

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's the introduction made by Lin Taimo and Director Lin to the general

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Lin Taimo?

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You can go out first

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Since you are here

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You can only see the cruelty of the investment

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And then you can leave

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Someone has a background

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The high-level company rejected the result of the interview

88
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't know

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I just want to know

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What is the reason

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Why did you come here

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't know

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The result of the interview

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I knew it

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't know what kind of interview process

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I think it's better to just leave

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't think it's so good

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
With the will of power

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I saw the fairness of MH

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Such people should not be prepared

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I guess Mozi heard this

102
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He will be angry and vomit blood

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What is the background of the general

104
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The high-level company rejected the result of the interview

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We should unite

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And isolate the general

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Why?

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He is afraid of the will of power

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He saw the fairness

110
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Come

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Here, what you want

113
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Thank you

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Well

115
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Do you have something to tell me

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Sometimes actions

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
More effective than any explanation

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So you don't have to care so much about what they say

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Thank you

120
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But why do you tell me this

121
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I mean

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Others are more willing to believe what they want to believe

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Why do you want to believe me

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't believe you

125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Just more unwilling

126
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
To believe what I mainly believe

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Jiang Jun

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Mr. Yuan asked you to go to his office

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Ok

130
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Anyway

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Thank you for telling me this

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Come in

133
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What do you want from me

134
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't think you have the spirit to sit on the mountain

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I thought you had the spirit to sit on the mountain

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You can stay in MH

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
As long as it's a back-legged employee

138
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I have a way to get him out

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is the information of the drug industry

140
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You write a ban on investigation

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Give it to me as soon as possible

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Don't let me get you

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You can go to the factory

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The drug industry is the most famous company in recent years

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The medical manufacturing industry

146
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think it's the highest company in the IPO

147
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Remember

148
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The employee of the trial period

149
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Once the mistake is made three times

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The trial period is not qualified

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The report is wrong or unfinished

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a mistake

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I will finish this job seriously

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Prove that I came to MH

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Not because I am someone's person

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
To hit your face again

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I will do my best

158
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You have to know that the role of the force is mutual

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
When the face hurts, the hand will hurt too

160
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Why don't you give him another chance

161
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That roadman is getting married

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Divorce is the result of a mistake in work

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Marriage is the beginning of a couple's life

164
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
There is no relationship between the two

165
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I think you are not human

166
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is not something you should care about

167
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What you have to do is win the game

168
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You eliminated me during the interview

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And I appeared again in MH

170
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What do you think about this

171
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You can tell me directly

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You and I are like ants and wheels

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You slowly climb

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I roll forward

175
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Great, I hope you can do it at the beginning of the year

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Write a stop to investigation report as soon as possible

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Don't let me push you

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay, Mr. Wheel

179
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I will do my best

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Miss Ant

181
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I have a feeling

182
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You won't be able to stay for two weeks in MH

183
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Experience it

184
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You still want to kick me out of MH

185
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
My judgment is very accurate

186
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
In this state of yours

187
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,480
I can't even bring you back for a week or two.

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,240
Let's wait and see.

189
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,080
I feel like I'm a thunderbolt.

190
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
I'm in a state of shock.

191
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,120
I can't even stop a stiff half-legged lion.

192
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,880
Do you know how ridiculous you are?

193
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,600
You can't keep your promise.

194
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,400
Sing it to me after two weeks.

195
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,880
Have a dream, Mr. Cheng Lui.

196
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,800
I hope you can wake up early.

197
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,840
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,720
Jing, I have to share a good news with you.

199
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,800
I found a job that I'm very satisfied with.

200
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,240
You're really my little Lily.

201
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Finding a job is so easy.

202
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,600
By the way, how do you feel about your first day at work?

203
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,440
I'm just a pile of data junkies.

204
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,160
I just got here, so I need to be familiar with a lot of project data.

205
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,560
There's something wrong with this data.

206
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,680
Here, here, here, here.

207
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,040
Everything is wrong.

208
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,360
You're going home so soon with this report.

209
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,840
Write a new one and send it to my office.

210
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,080
By the way, come downstairs and buy a cup of food to get rid of the cold.

211
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,120
Me?

212
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,120
Is there anyone else here except you?

213
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,640
I'm a newcomer.

214
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,080
I should be happy to complete the task assigned by the leader.

215
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,080
Our store is a 24-hour convenience store.

216
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,200
So we need three shifts.

217
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Your main job is to collect money.

218
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,440
But the staff is quite busy right now.

219
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,400
So we need to help you with the cleaning sometimes.

220
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,360
Is that okay?

221
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,280
Okay.

222
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,480
I'll teach you how to use the collection system.

223
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,040
If a customer comes,

224
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,480
he buys a box of chocolate.

225
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,880
There's a barcode on it.

226
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
Just scan the barcode.

227
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,720
There will be the price on it.

228
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,000
Then we'll ask the customer.

229
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,640
He can choose to pay with cash or WeChat.

230
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,760
Then we'll pay him.

231
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,000
Sir, the goods are here.

232
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,600
The goods are here. I'll go and record the stock.

233
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,160
Okay.

234
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll get familiar with it first.

235
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,800
Okay.

236
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,160
I'll go first.

237
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,760
It's easy.

238
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,440
The instant noodles are not mixed with the instant noodles.

239
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,280
I'll just use the color and the color of the instant noodles.

240
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,120
Okay.

241
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:39,440
Hello, welcome to...

242
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,440
Hello, welcome to...

243
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Welcome to...

244
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,440
Welcome to...

245
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,440
Welcome to...

246
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
Here's your bill.

247
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
Hello.

248
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Are you done?

249
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,440
You've been saving up for so long.

250
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Can you hurry up?

252
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,440
I'm in a hurry.

254
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
I have a problem with the washing machine.

255
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,440
Wait a minute.

256
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Okay.

257
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Thank you.

258
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Hello.

259
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
Thank you.

260
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
Thank you.

261
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
Thank you.

262
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
Thank you.

263
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,440
Sir, what do you need?

264
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
I'm here to buy a net.

265
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
This net is free.

266
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Thank you.

267
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Thank you.

268
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
Junjun, have you arrived home?

269
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
No.

270
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,440
I might be going home late today.

271
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,440
Because I'm still in the library.

272
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,440
I might even have to stay up all night.

273
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,440
Poor Junjun.

274
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,440
I have to work overtime too.

275
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,440
But I think it's a good time to work overtime.

276
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,440
The sunset today is very beautiful.

277
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,440
Is the convenience store going to be a model station?

278
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,440
I'm here to be a salesperson.

279
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Aren't you going to pursue your dreams?

280
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,440
I think the environment here is very good.

281
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,440
I'll give you a chance to tell the truth.

282
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
Okay.

283
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,440
Actually, I found a handsome guy in this store.

284
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,440
He perfectly fits my male personality.

285
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,440
And he is the long-term customer of this store.

286
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Actually, I want to observe my target in close range.

287
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,440
I want to make my novel more real.

288
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Then I wish our Lily a success.

289
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,440
Thank you, Junjun. I'll do my best.

290
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,440
You too.

291
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Let's go on a bright day!

292
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,440
I'm going to the library.

293
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,440
Even if the road ahead is difficult, you have to be energetic today.

294
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,440
I'm going to the library.

295
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
One latte.

296
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
Okay, please wait a moment.

297
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
What a coincidence.

298
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Mr. Du, why are you here?

299
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
I just made an appointment with a friend.

300
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
But he seems to be late.

301
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
What about you?

302
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
I'm looking for some information.

303
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
Oh, right.

304
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,440
Last time I asked you to help me in the library.

305
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,440
I was able to successfully enter the MH.

306
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
I haven't thanked you yet.

307
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
No, it's just a little favor.

308
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,440
I didn't do anything.

309
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
It's all your fault.

310
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
You just entered the library, so you're so diligent.

311
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,440
I guess your boss must be having a hard time.

312
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
It's not just hard to do.

313
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
He's a devil.

314
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
Such a difficult job.

315
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
Then he must be very good at it.

316
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,440
Miss Ant, I have a feeling that you won't be able to stay in MH for two weeks.

317
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
It seems to be quite high.

318
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,440
Your latte is ready.

319
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
Thank you.

320
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Do you mind if I have a cup of coffee?

321
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
Of course.

322
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Let's go.

323
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
I'm sorry.

324
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
I'm sorry.

326
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
I'm sorry.

327
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,440
I'm sorry.

328
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm sorry.

331
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
I'm sorry.

333
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
I'm sorry.

334
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
I'm sorry.

336
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
I'm sorry.

337
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
I'm sorry.

338
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
I'm sorry.

340
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
I'm sorry.

342
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm sorry.

343
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
I'm sorry.

344
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,440
I'm sorry.

345
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
I'm sorry.

346
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
I'm sorry.

347
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
I'm sorry.

348
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
I'm sorry.

349
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
I'm sorry.

350
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
I'm sorry.

351
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
I'm sorry.

352
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
Look.

353
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,440
In your job interview report,

354
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
you only focus on the internal statistics of the company,

355
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,440
and the introduction of the company's foreign investment.

356
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Including investment amount,

357
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,440
investment ratio,

358
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
investment value,

359
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
and investment profit.

360
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
Most importantly,

361
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
the introduction of the company's investment.

362
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,440
You're so straightforward.

363
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
But Mr. Du,

364
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
how do you know so much about Touhang?

365
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
Which company are you from?

366
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,440
Gao's Uncle?

367
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
I'm Touhang's training teacher.

368
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
It's a pity that you have an appointment.

369
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
Otherwise, I must treat you to dinner.

370
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
I owe you twice. Thank you.

371
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
Hello.

372
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,440
Okay.

373
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
I'll be right out.

374
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,440
Then I won't bother you.

375
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
I'm leaving.

376
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
This time, it's really not a coincidence.

377
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
I hope I have a chance next time.

378
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,440
Then I'll eat with you.

379
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,440
I'll be right out.

380
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
The report just now

381
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
is definitely right.

382
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
What about you?

383
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
Come and pick me up.

384
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
Okay.

385
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
I'll give you a chance in the future.

386
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
I'm leaving first.

387
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
Turn around.

388
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
You look so out of it.

389
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,440
How about

390
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
I go and eat by myself?

391
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
I'm hungry.

392
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
Let's go.

393
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
Did you help him get to Lin Taimo?

394
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
I was still thinking about it.

395
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
So I didn't hear you say it.

396
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Don't forget.

397
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
I taught you how to do it.

398
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
What do you want to do?

399
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
You can't hide it.

400
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
You said it before.

401
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
I'll be right back.

402
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,440
I'm leaving.

403
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
You've already figured out

404
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
how to win the game.

405
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Tian Ji is just about to win.

406
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,440
When I let him slow down,

407
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
it's a game of chance.

408
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,440
I like your current state.

409
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
Let's get the documents

410
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
and sort it out.

411
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
Okay, let's call it a day.

412
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

413
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

414
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
General, please stay.

415
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
I've read the report

416
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
you wrote about

417
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,440
the banning of the drug industry.

418
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,440
I want to ask you

419
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
what the ultimate goal of the investigation is.

420
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
I'm not sure.

421
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
I'm not sure.

422
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
I'm not sure.

423
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
The ultimate goal of the investigation

424
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
is to find the truth,

425
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
not to be a data smuggler.

426
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
Where is the truth?

427
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
General, remember.

428
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,440
The truth is like a wanderer.

429
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
What are you talking about?

430
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
I don't understand.

431
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
The fake looks

432
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
are often

433
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
elegant and elegant.

434
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
They're like princes.

435
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
But what about the truth?

436
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
The truth is often

437
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
in the most dirty,

438
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,440
most unfair,

439
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,440
most unseemly corner.

440
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
It's full of anger and hatred.

441
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,440
No.

442
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
You think there's no truth

443
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
in my report?

444
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
The chairman of the drug industry

445
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
was suspected of transferring company assets.

446
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,440
The person who wanted to expose this

447
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,440
was fired.

448
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
Do you know what to do?

449
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
You mean

450
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
I have to find this person?

451
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
Ask Klan for the drug.

452
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
All the personnel

453
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,440
will find the person who was fired.

454
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,440
Find out the truth.

455
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
And write a new report.

456
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
Okay.

457
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
Let me remind you.

458
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,440
The first mission I gave you

459
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,440
is not to reach the target.

460
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
I've said it before.

461
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
If you don't reach the target three times,

462
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
you'll be fired.

463
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
But I don't care.

464
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
It's useless.

465
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,440
Don't be nervous.

466
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
You have two chances.

467
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
Hello.

468
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
Hello.

469
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,440
I'm the analyst general

470
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,440
of MH's marketing department.

471
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,440
I have an appointment with Mr. Deng today.

472
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
I'm sorry.

473
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,440
Mr. Deng went to play golf with his friends.

474
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
He went to play golf?

475
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,440
Could you tell me the address?

476
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
I made an appointment with you in advance.

477
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
Wait a minute.

478
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,440
The golf course in North East Bay.

479
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
Okay, thank you.

480
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
General's application to the Ministry of Justice

481
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,440
is to send a legal document to the K-1 industry.

482
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
So they submitted a personnel file.

483
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
And then?

484
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
The Ministry of Justice refused his request.

485
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
But

486
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,440
General seemed to think of a new way.

487
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
According to my observation,

488
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,440
General is normal and determined.

489
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
He didn't give up because

490
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
he was oppressed by the power.

491
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,440
Who do you think is powerful?

492
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
I mean,

493
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
is it difficult to give the job to General?

494
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
Be careful.

495
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
Every new person who wants to enter MH

496
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
has to undergo a test.

497
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,440
General

498
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
is not an exception.

499
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
Hello, Mr. Deng.

500
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
Hello.

501
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
Who are you?

502
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
I'm the analyst general of MH.

503
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,440
I have an important thing to visit you.

504
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,440
Is there no one in MH?

505
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,440
Find a little analyst to talk to me.

506
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
What's up?

507
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
What's wrong with your analysts

508
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
and your hobby of being a footballer?

509
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Go back.

510
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
Your stupid method

511
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
has no effect on me.

512
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,440
Mr. Deng

513
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,440
I think that playing football

514
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
is a business that can achieve

515
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
millions of wealth

516
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
instead of stupid methods.

517
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
In golf courts,

518
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
there are tens of thousands of

519
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,440
unmoved balls

520
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,440
that can't be picked up.

521
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
If you return these balls to the factory

522
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,440
and then select different brands

523
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,440
and different quality balls

524
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,440
through the distribution period,

525
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,440
and then repack them at a price of 50%.

526
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
In this business case,

527
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
someone has already done it.

528
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
I don't need you

529
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
to waste my time

530
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
telling me these things here.

531
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
Kelang is a customer of MH.

532
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
You are responsible for spending money.

533
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,440
We are responsible for making money for you.

534
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,440
Since you don't want to talk to me,

535
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
I won't leave until I meet you.

536
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,440
I only have the opportunity

537
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
to take the opportunity

538
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,440
to fulfill my duties.

539
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,440
Okay.

540
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,440
You just said your name is Jiang...

541
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,440
General.

542
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,440
General.

543
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,440
Go ahead.

544
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
What's the matter?

545
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Our company wants to get

546
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,440
all the people in Kelang's business

547
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
to be the best.

548
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
But the person in charge of the contact

549
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,440
is not willing to cooperate.

550
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,440
I know this.

551
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
Our people think

552
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,440
that the people you want

553
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
are of no use

554
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,440
to your investigation.

555
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,440
When I mentioned the people in charge,

556
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
you were conscious

557
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,440
and touched on the risk.

558
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
From a psychological perspective,

559
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,440
I think you are right.

560
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
I think

561
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
from a psychological perspective,

562
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
you are very nervous about this.

563
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,440
It's easy to understand.

564
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,440
You have a lot of imagination.

565
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
Whether the person in charge is valuable

566
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,440
should be decided by us.

567
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
If you don't provide information,

568
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,440
we will suspect that

569
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,440
there is sensitive information.

570
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,440
Why do you think

571
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,440
there is something wrong

572
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
with what you don't understand?

573
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
I think there is something wrong

574
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
with your logic.

575
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,440
If we can't get the person in charge,

576
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
we can't complete the suspension.

577
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
That means the delay in the purchase of the company.

578
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,440
It's normal to delay the purchase.

579
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
It's normal to delay the purchase.

580
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
Delay will produce uncertain factors.

581
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,440
I believe that the board of directors of KELANG

582
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,440
will question your ability to buy.

583
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
And as far as I know,

584
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,440
your ex-wife has 20%

585
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
of the decision-making power of the shares.

586
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
If you delay the purchase,

587
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,440
she may sell the shares.

588
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,440
Then according to the gambling agreement,

589
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
the priority shares in your hands

590
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
will be returned to normal.

591
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
Okay.

592
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,440
Since you want to waste your energy,

593
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,440
I can meet your requirements.

594
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
I will ask someone to hand over

595
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,440
all the personnel files to you.

596
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,440
You can go to my company

597
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
and get the personnel files later.

598
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
By then, you will know

599
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,440
how accurate your requirements are.

600
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
Thank you for your cooperation.

601
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,440
I'll go first.

602
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,440
Wait.

603
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,440
In the field,

604
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,440
you must know the rules of the field

605
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,440
if you want to be a good player.

606
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
General.

607
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
You want to call me General?

608
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,440
Let's get a few more balls.

609
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,440
Mr. Deng has already

610
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
greeted me.

611
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
In front of us

612
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,440
is our personnel file room.

613
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,440
A colleague of yours

614
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
has just arrived.

615
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,440
He is the head of the personnel file room.

616
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
He is the head of the personnel file room.

617
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,440
He is the head of the personnel file room.

618
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
He is the head of the personnel file room.

619
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,440
And he is here.

620
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
He is already in there.

621
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
Is that so?

622
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Then I'll take you there.

623
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,440
Okay.

624
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,440
Here is

625
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,440
our personnel file room.

626
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,440
Who are you?

627
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
I heard that

628
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
you are brave and brave.

629
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,440
I came to give you a place to live.

630
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,440
Okay, then you two

631
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,440
wait here.

632
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,440
The door card is for you.

633
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
If you need anything,

634
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
feel free to look for me at any time.

635
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
Thank you for coming.

636
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
You're welcome.

637
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,440
So many?

638
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
It's a production flag.

639
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
It's normal.

640
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,440
These are the tips of the iceberg.

641
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Where are the others?

642
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
Come on.

643
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,440
Come on.

644
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
Wow.

645
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
What's going on?

646
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
Boss, you're finally here.

647
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,440
I told you I was so scared.

648
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,440
Help me to go to the bathroom.

649
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,440
Go, go, go.

650
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
Go.

651
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,440
Stop.

652
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,440
I just finished the information.

653
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
You scared me.

654
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
This is what you've done?

655
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,440
Payment.

656
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
Don't look at my messy files.

657
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,440
I've got them all in my head.

658
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
These are the three years of social security.

659
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
This is the first year of retirement.

660
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,440
This is the first month of employment.

661
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
What about this?

662
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
This is the two-months-long term.

663
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
Put it here.

664
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
Any results?

665
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,440
The company's records and the retirement plan

666
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
have been checked.

667
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
There's one missing from the retirement plan.

668
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
It must be hidden by the Klan's drug industry.

669
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
I should be able to find this person

670
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
if I find the records.

671
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
You must ask for something.

672
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
You're not off work yet?

673
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,440
I have some work to do.

674
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
I'm going to work soon.

675
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
You work hard.

676
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
It's not as hard as you.

677
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,440
Look at this.

678
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
Oh.

679
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
Yuan Shuai,

680
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,440
you have a lot of wrinkles.

681
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
One inch of bruise and one inch of blood.

682
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
For your good looks,

683
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
you should remember what I told you

684
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
during the interview.

685
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
You're not suitable for the job.

686
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,440
You've been away from me for ten years.

687
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
You're really a good person.

688
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Who's a good person?

689
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,440
Look at my face.

690
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Do I have wrinkles?

691
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,440
What's going on?

692
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,440
The power's off.

693
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
Mr. Teng, the matter is over.

694
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
What?

695
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
Are you still worried

696
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,440
that the two of you will be in danger?

697
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
Don't worry.

698
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
I'll figure something out.

699
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,440
I'll be right back.

700
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
What's going on?

701
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
Someone's appearance

702
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
is a high-end employee.

703
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
I didn't expect that he would do such a bad thing.

704
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,440
This is so ironic.

705
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,440
Boss, what's wrong?

706
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,440
I'm locked up.

707
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,440
Don't worry. I'll find someone.

708
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Go.

709
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,440
Is there anyone outside?

710
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,440
Someone's locked up here.

711
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Hello?

712
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,440
Hello?

713
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,440
Stop calling.

714
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
No one will come even if you call someone.

715
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
I found that you seem to enjoy being here.

716
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Actually, I don't enjoy it much.

717
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
But I saw that some people

718
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,440
were eager to leave.

719
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
But there's no way.

720
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
So I think it's good to stay here.

721
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Let me tell you.

722
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,440
I'm just a little bit of a troublemaker.

723
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
I've been fine all day

724
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
before you came.

725
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
You stopped when you came.

726
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,440
If I'm not wrong,

727
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,440
there should be a spare power plug in this room.

728
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,440
I can't guess.

729
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,440
Think about it.

730
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,440
There are so many important information

731
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
in this room.

732
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
The next room is the financial room

733
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
and the research and development room.

734
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Compared to the two rooms

735
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,440
with higher confidentiality,

736
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,440
the possibility of a spare power plug

737
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
in this room is higher.

738
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
Let's find it.

739
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,440
The room is full of wind and rain.

740
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,440
If I'm with this devil,

741
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,440
I'll be in trouble.

742
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
I found it.

743
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
It's here.

744
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
Come here.

745
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,440
I'll carry you up.

746
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
You carry me.

747
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
I can't hear you.

748
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Miss Jiang,

749
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
I'm sorry.

750
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
I'm sorry.

751
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
I'm sorry.

752
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,440
I'm sorry.

753
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
I'm sorry.

754
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
I'm sorry.

755
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,440
I'm sorry.

756
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
I'm sorry.

757
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
I'm sorry.

758
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,440
I'm sorry.

759
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
Miss Jiang,

760
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
did you come from the feudal society?

761
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
Or

762
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
you want to spend a wonderful night

763
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,440
with me?

764
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Don't be shameless.

765
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
What's wrong?

766
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
Nothing.

767
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
I didn't have lunch.

768
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,440
I'm hungry.

769
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,440
I'll do it.

770
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
I'll wait for you in the car.

771
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
I'm fine.

772
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Don't move.

773
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,440
You still don't know how to tie a knot?

774
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,440
Who said I don't know?

775
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
I've taught you many times.

776
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,440
First, tie a knot.

777
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,440
Two hands cross each other.

778
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
Then, tie a knot in the middle.

779
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,440
That's it.

780
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,440
That's it.

781
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
No.

782
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
I'll teach you again.

783
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
No.

784
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,440
I'll teach you again.

785
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
No.

786
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,440
I'll teach you again.

787
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
No.

788
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
I'll teach you again.

789
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,440
No.

790
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,440
I'll teach you again.

791
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,440
I'll teach you again.

792
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,440
First, tie a knot.

793
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
Then, two hands cross each other.

794
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,440
Then, tie a knot.

795
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
That's it.

796
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,440
Do you understand?

797
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
By the way,

798
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
protecting you is my job.

799
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,440
I have to pay for teaching you.

800
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
But you borrowed my chocolate last time.

801
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
You haven't paid me back yet.

802
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,440
What's chocolate?

803
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
It's a complicated thing to tie a knot.

804
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,440
There's not enough chocolate.

805
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,440
How about this?

806
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,440
You call me Brother Yuanyuan.

807
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,440
I'll take it as your subordinate.

808
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
Yuanyuan, hurry up.

809
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,440
That's more like it.

810
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,440
Let's go.

811
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,440
We're going to be late for class.

812
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
Hurry up.

813
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
Wait for me.

814
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,440
Okay.

815
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
Bye.

816
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
See you.

817
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,440
See you.

818
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,440
I'm trying out forever

819
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,440
Watch me fly so high

820
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,440
Try to understand

821
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,440
Try to say goodbye a thousand times

822
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,440
You can tell me lies

823
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,440
You can make me cry

824
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,440
You know why

825
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,440
Never been so brave

826
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,440
I will run away

827
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,440
If it's what you want

828
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,440
What you like

829
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,440
I don't mind

830
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
I can close my eyes

831
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,440
I can stay behind

832
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,440
Waste my time

833
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,440
Walk into your plan

834
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,440
Like I never knew you were not mine

835
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,440
Make you satisfied

836
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,440
Wear another mask

837
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,440
You never realize

838
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,440
Things I do for love

839
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,440
I think I'm tired

840
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,440
I think I'm blind

841
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,440
Don't know how to feel

842
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,440
Don't know how to heal

843
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,440
You walk so fast

844
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,440
Can't catch your light

845
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,440
You fly so high

846
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,440
Leave all the things behind

847
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,440
And our story

848
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,440
Leave our love nowhere to find

849
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,440
I think I'm tired

850
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,440
I think I'm blind

851
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,440
Don't know how to feel

852
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,440
Don't know how to heal

853
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,440
You walk so fast

854
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,440
Can't catch your light

855
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,440
You fly so high

856
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,440
Leave all the things behind

857
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,440
And our story

858
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:33,440
Leave our love nowhere to find
