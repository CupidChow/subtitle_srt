I'm going to be a good boy.

I'm going to be a good boy.

I'm going to be a good boy.

00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,440
I'm going to be a good boy.

I'm going to be a good boy.

I'm going to be a good boy.

00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,440
I'm going to be a good boy.

10
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,440
I'm going to be a good boy.

00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,440
I'm going to be a good boy.

12
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,440
I'm going to be a good boy.

13
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,440
I'm going to be a good boy.

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,440
I'm going to be a good boy.

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,440

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,440
If it wasn't for her, why did she hide her identity?

31
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,440
I don't know how many business secrets she got from you.

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,440
I'm just reminding you, don't count money for others.

33
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
I'm leaving.

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
Go home.

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
I know.

36
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,440
I'm leaving, you little cheater.

37
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
Are you happy?

38
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
I'm going to bed.

39
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
I'm going to bed.

40
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,440
Mr. Du, I just found out today that you are the first brother of my memory.

41
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
Please help me with the...

42
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,440
Mr. Du, we should try to meet less often.

43
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,440
What should I do?

44
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
I'm going to bed.

45
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm going to bed.

46
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
You drank too much again.

47
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,440
You are a customer.

48
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
What can I do?

49
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Can I not drink?

50
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,440
Did I buy you a tie?

51
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,440
I don't need to buy a tie like this.

52
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
You are so ugly.

53
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Change it.

54
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
This one suits you better.

55
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Do you remember when we were young?

56
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
When you were young, you were afraid of the dark.

57
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
You always ran into my bed.

58
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,440
I was afraid of the dark.

59
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
I was afraid of the dark.

60
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,440
I was afraid of the dark.

61
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,440
You always ran into my bed and asked me to protect you.

62
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,440
We could talk all night.

63
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,440
You listened to me.

64
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,440
You told me everything.

65
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
But now,

66
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,440
our secrets seem to be getting more and more.

67
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
More.

68
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
More.

69
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
I don't like it.

70
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Thank you.

71
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
I'll talk to you later.

72
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
I'll send you home.

73
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Or you'll worry about me.

74
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
I'll go.

75
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
Mr. Du,

76
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,440
thank you for your help.

77
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,440
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding you made with me last night.

78
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
But I believe you can understand.

79
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,440
He was also cautious about the fact that he didn't show his identity to you.

80
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,440
I think you didn't offend me in any way.

81
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
But for the sake of the industry,

82
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
I may not care about the students.

83
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,440
I understand. Good night.

84
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
This is Dad's birthday party the day after tomorrow.

85
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
I'm here to remind you.

86
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
You must prepare a gift that he likes.

87
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Come with me on time.

88
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
Okay. Don't worry.

89
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
Let's go.

90
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Okay.

91
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Are you going to school?

92
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Come on, let's go.

93
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
I'm going to school.

94
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Okay.

95
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,440
The two wheeled ones are later than the four wheels.

96
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
You're going to be late today.

97
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,440
Is he having a hard time with the car?

98
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Wait!

99
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
I don't mind if you get hit by the car.

100
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,440
This is the car fee.

101
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Thank you for your kindness.

102
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,440
Your four wheels are too fast. I'm afraid of spitting.

103
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Please.

104
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Thank you.

105
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Thank you.

106
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
This is the so-called big meal.

107
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,440
It's really a very rich big meal.

108
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Yes.

109
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,440
There's meat, broccoli, tomatoes, and a big meal.

110
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
Let's eat.

111
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Okay.

112
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Since it's a big meal,

113
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
I should feel like I'm eating a big meal.

114
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
I'm going to eat a lot.

115
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
I'm going to eat a lot.

116
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
I'm going to eat a lot.

117
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
I'm going to eat a lot.

118
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
I'm going to eat a lot.

119
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
I'm going to eat a lot.

120
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
I'm going to eat a lot.

121
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
I'm going to eat a lot.

122
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
I'm going to eat a lot.

123
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm going to eat a lot.

124
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
I'm going to eat a lot.

125
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,440
I'm going to eat a lot.

126
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
I'm going to eat a lot.

127
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
I'm going to eat a lot.

128
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Let me give you this.

129
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Well, I...

130
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
It's my's.

131
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Wait a minute, I want a sangria.

132
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
Sangria?

133
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
You don't understand, do you?

134
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
You don't understand, do you?

135
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Thank you.

136
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Here.

137
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
How is it?

138
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
It's pretty good.

139
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
You can eat it again.

140
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
Of course.

141
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
I made this myself.

142
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
For your sake,

143
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,440
I'll share half of my yogurt.

144
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Thank you.

145
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,440
If I ask you to treat me to dinner,

146
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
will you do it?

147
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
No.

148
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Why not?

149
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Because I don't think

150
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,440
what I want you to do is worth two meals.

151
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,440
But...

152
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,440
Then why did you ask me to do it today?

153
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
This is the evaluation of my app.

154
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,440
I need to know the user's feedback

155
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,440
for a rational questionnaire survey.

156
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,440
So you invited me to dinner

157
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,440
just to let me fill in the survey form?

158
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,440
Let's start.

159
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Finally, we can eat.

160
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
This job is a bit demanding.

161
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,440
I remember the day I wrote my thesis in the library.

162
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
You're a good writer.

163
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
I'm satisfied.

164
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,440
You misunderstood me.

165
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,440
I didn't mean to show off.

166
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,440
My tutor, David Luiz,

167
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,440
won the Nobel Prize for Economics.

168
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,440
I'm too embarrassed to report to you.

169
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,440
You're the worst people I've ever seen.

170
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
Why do I see you?

171
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Where are you?

172
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
Are you all hiding?

173
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,440
I don't feel like you exist.

174
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
You're here to steal food,

175
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,440
not to be undercover agents.

176
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Look at your report.

177
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
You're all thugs.

178
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
From now on,

179
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,440
stop talking nonsense and do your job.

180
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,440
Why are there only three of you?

181
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,440
Where's the other one?

182
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Here.

183
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Although Mr. Qiao is in charge of

184
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,440
supervising and training all the newbies,

185
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,440
I'll write a report

186
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
and hand it over to the board

187
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
to be fully employed.

188
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,440
This report can either

189
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
give you a promotion or a promotion.

190
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Do you understand?

191
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Yes.

192
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
Everyone,

193
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
I've already told Mr. Fan

194
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
that I'm going to remove all the newbies

195
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
from this industry

196
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
and start a new team.

197
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Just the four of you.

198
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,440
From now on,

199
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
you'll be in charge of

200
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
the project of Wanxin Entertainment.

201
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
This is a great opportunity

202
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,440
to show your ability.

203
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,440
I hope you can all

204
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,440
see me as a thug

205
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
who's going to be a threat.

206
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
Do you understand?

207
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Yes.

208
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Good.

209
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
After lunch,

210
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
I'll treat everyone to dinner.

211
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Please take a look at the materials.

212
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
We'll meet downstairs in five minutes.

213
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Yes.

214
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Wanxin Entertainment has been

215
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
an important client of M&H for five years.

216
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
In the past three years,

217
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
we wanted to help Wanxin

218
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
with the listing of an online company.

219
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
But the company didn't allow it.

220
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
So we're going to

221
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
do it on our own.

222
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
This is a failure.

223
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
That means the first three years

224
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,440
were in vain.

225
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,440
Their CEO just passed away last week.

226
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
There are two weeks left

227
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
before the deadline.

228
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
It's said that Wanxin is the only company

229
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,440
that can gather the people behind it.

230
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,440
It's a great help

231
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
to us to be the CEO.

232
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Wanxin Entertainment

233
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Mr. Yuan.

234
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Hello.

235
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
We met before.

236
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
But I'm sorry.

237
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Last night,

238
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,440
we had the final of the girl group.

239
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,440
Mr. Wan was busy all night.

240
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
He just came back to the company.

241
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Now he's in the practice room.

242
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
What practice?

243
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
It's okay.

244
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
We'll wait for Mr. Wan.

245
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
They are the team

246
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
that we have built for Wanxin.

247
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
Please take us

248
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
to visit

249
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
Wanxin's staff.

250
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Okay, no problem.

251
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
I'll take you

252
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
to know the situation.

253
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Come on, follow me.

254
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
Let's go.

255
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Come on, everyone.

256
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
This way, please.

257
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
This is our dressing room.

258
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Usually,

259
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
before our artists

260
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
make their debut,

261
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
they will take pictures

262
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
and pictures here.

263
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
This way, please.

264
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
This is our meeting room.

265
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
We will have our meeting

266
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
here later.

267
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
This is the administration department.

268
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
This is the finance department.

269
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
The area in front

270
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
is the marketing department,

271
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
the art and economy department,

272
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,440
and the business department.

273
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
The main departmental office area

274
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
is here.

275
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
Mr. Wan is waiting for us upstairs.

276
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
I'll take you upstairs.

277
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
Okay, this way, please.

278
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
You go first.

279
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
I'll come to you later.

280
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
Okay.

281
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
Mr. Yuan,

282
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
this is our training room.

283
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Usually, artists and trainees

284
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,440
will train here.

285
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Let's go inside and have a look.

286
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
Gather around.

287
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
Let me introduce you.

288
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,440
This is Mr. Yuan Shuai,

289
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
the head of the banking department

290
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
of MH Investment.

291
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
And his team.

292
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
They are here

293
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
to conduct an investigation.

294
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

295
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Hello, everyone.

296
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
Mr. Yuan,

297
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
what do you want to ask the police?

298
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
How is it?

299
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Is everyone tired from the training?

300
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Mr. Yuan,

301
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
this is Mr. Wan.

302
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Hello, Mr. Wan.

303
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Mr. Qiao, nice to meet you.

304
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
I'm sorry.

305
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
I just watched the rehearsal.

306
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
I didn't have time to say hello.

307
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,440
It's okay.

308
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
Is anyone here?

309
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Is anyone here?

310
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,440
Wait.

311
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Help me.

312
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Are you okay?

313
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
I'm fine.

314
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
What happened?

315
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Do you need me to call the police?

316
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
No, thanks.

317
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Security,

318
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,440
help me stop the person behind.

319
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
Who are you?

320
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
How did you get in?

321
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
I'm General of MH Analysis.

322
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
I'm here to conduct an investigation.

323
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
MH Analysis?

324
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
What is this?

325
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Are all private criminals fake now?

326
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
Private criminals?

327
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,440
Kai Chuang,

328
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
take out your phone.

329
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,440
Delete the photos and videos you took.

330
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
I didn't take anything.

331
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
Your phone.

332
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
How about this?

333
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
I'll call my leader

334
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
to prove my identity.

335
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
Don't do this to me.

336
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Come on.

337
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
I'll go with you to the security room.

338
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
You...

339
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
Why did you steal my phone?

340
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Mr. Yuan,

341
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
Mr. Wan fainted because he stayed up too late.

342
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
He just recovered.

343
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,440
He has a competition and training.

344
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
You have to talk to him.

345
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Mr. Wan,

346
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
take care of yourself.

347
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
I didn't know Wan Shan was like this.

348
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
They're much more miserable than me.

349
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Practice hard.

350
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Don't be lazy.

351
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
Yes, Mr. Wan.

352
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
The meeting room is ready.

353
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Come on, I'll take you there.

354
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Mr. Wan, please.

355
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
I'm sorry, Mr. Wan.

356
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,440
What's wrong with you?

357
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
Change your clothes.

358
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Don't catch a cold.

359
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
Go.

360
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
Okay, Mr. Wan.

361
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
I got it.

362
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
I'm sorry.

363
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
The kids are too reckless.

364
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Mr. Yuan, please.

365
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
I'm sorry.

366
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
I'm sorry.

367
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
I'm sorry.

368
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
I'm sorry.

369
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
Oh,

370
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
isn't she from the popular girl group?

371
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
She's an eliminated contestant.

372
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
Where did you go?

373
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,440
What are you doing?

374
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Guess what I'm doing.

375
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
What are you doing?

376
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Is this how you use this trick to seduce Wan Zui?

377
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,440
You think using your dirty tricks can make Wan Zui get in your way?

378
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,440
Didn't you get dumped before the final?

379
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,440
Isn't it the same as us?

380
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
No, we are different from you.

381
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
We rely on our strength.

382
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,440
You rely on your face.

383
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,440
Let's go.

384
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
Let's go.

385
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Director Yuan, can we start?

386
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
Let's start.

387
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,440
During the meeting, in order to prevent any information from leaking,

388
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,440
all the doors are closed.

389
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
Where did he go?

390
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
Where are you?

391
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
Come to the meeting room.

392
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Where is he?

393
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
Where is he?

394
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
Where is he?

395
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
Where is he?

396
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
Where is he?

397
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
Suo Shuan.

398
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
What?

399
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
4K.

400
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
Do you want it?

401
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,440
No, I can't.

402
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
Last two.

403
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
Give me your hand.

404
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
What?

405
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,360
That's great.

406
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,720
I'll ask you a question.

407
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,840
You said

408
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,760
Mr. Wan has set up a lounge in the office.

409
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,600
Does he often work overtime and need to sleep in the office?

410
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,960
That's a secret.

411
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,280
Let me tell you.

412
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,200
Why are you grabbing me?

413
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,720
I haven't finished yet.

414
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,960
What are you afraid of?

415
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,560
That's right.

416
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,960
I'm willing to admit defeat.

417
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,560
Say it.

418
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,920
Last night, we saw a girl

419
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,000
coming out of her office.

420
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,960
It was almost 3 a.m.

421
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,160
Yes.

422
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,600
I was wondering why a girl went out in the middle of the night.

423
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,400
So you mean

424
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,520
Mr. Wan and that girl...

425
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,400
Who is she?

426
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,360
Who is she?

427
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,840
You're having fun?

428
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,960
Drinking and gambling?

429
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,480
You're mistaken.

430
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,840
You're capable.

431
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,720
No, I'm not.

432
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,400
Get up.

433
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,960
You're really capable.

434
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,120
Come with me.

435
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,680
I...

436
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,720
I don't want to play with you.

437
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,600
Who are you?

438
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,000
That's right.

439
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,680
What are you doing?

440
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,120
Who are you?

441
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,040
We're just playing a simple game.

442
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,840
Be sincere and take risks, okay?

443
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,040
Or is she the one who's been playing with us?

444
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,400
Want to leave?

445
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,160
Come on.

446
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,280
All three of you, leave after you finish drinking.

447
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,720
Leave after you finish drinking.

448
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,080
Stand still.

449
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,000
Let's make a roll.

450
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,520
I'm ready.

451
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,200
Come on.

452
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,520
I heard you had plans.

453
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,840
I'm ready.

454
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,960
Don't mess with me.

455
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,960
Mom.

456
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,400
You're strange.

457
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,920
Mom.

458
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,760
I'm sorry.

459
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,960
You're a girl.

460
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,160
You drink with a group of men at night.

461
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,800
This is your attitude.

462
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,160
I'm collecting information.

463
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,240
I'm doing a job interview.

464
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,280
Do you understand?

465
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,840
A job interview.

466
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,640
A job interview?

467
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,080
You're so easy-going.

468
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,400
What do you know?

469
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,800
I'll ask him right away.

470
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,760
I'm just one step away from it.

471
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,880
I'm sorry.

472
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,960
I have to submit the first report tomorrow morning.

473
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,160
I have to check my phone for three hours.

474
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,640
Otherwise, I can't even enter the conference room.

475
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,400
If I don't use my own method to lower the enemy's guard,

476
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,320
how can I get useful information?

477
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,920
Your own method is really...

478
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,920
Shut up!

479
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,560
Shut up! Listen to me!

480
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,280
I was going to break into the enemy's internal force.

481
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,120
But you messed up everything.

482
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,480
What?

483
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,120
It's all your fault.

484
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,560
I saved you just now.

485
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,840
No, I didn't.

486
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,920
Zheng Jun.

487
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,600
Zheng Jun.

488
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,760
Say it again if you can.

489
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,840
Get in the car.

490
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,760
No.

491
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,920
I already called the teacher.

492
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,480
At night,

493
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,880
you're a woman who's drunk

494
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,000
and you're out on the street.

495
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,840
You don't even have a sense of security.

496
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,400
Is this the general I should know again?

497
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,360
I am. I am.

498
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,040
Okay.

499
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,120
Okay.

500
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,800
If you're more important than others,

501
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,000
and report a mistake

502
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,240
than anyone else,

503
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,680
watch yourад炰 before clean up on your own.

504
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,720
You scumbag.

505
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,480
Garbage.

506
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Okay.

507
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
You're awake?

508
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Hungry?

509
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Hungry.

510
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Let me feed you.

511
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
You still have 50 questions to do.

512
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
What's wrong?

513
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,800
You still have 50 questions to do.

514
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
I'm hungry.

515
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
It's too late now.

516
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
I'm going back to work.

517
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,800
When I'm free, I'll finish all the questions.

518
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
You can do it.

519
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Okay.

520
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
I'll send you home.

521
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Send me home?

522
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Is this the trick of finding an excuse to send the hostess home?

523
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Okay.

524
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Just in time.

525
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
In time?

526
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
You were asleep just now.

527
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,800
I couldn't bear to wake you up.

528
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
It's been a while.

529
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
My school is closed.

530
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
I can only stay at the convenience store for a night.

531
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
School?

532
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
You're still a college student?

533
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
I'm a senior.

534
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
You haven't graduated yet?

535
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
You're a younger brother.

536
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Is my sister popular these days?

537
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
I'm not good at drinking.

538
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
I don't know how to practice.

539
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
I'm so stupid.

540
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,800
Zhang Jun, I'm already very polite to you.

541
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
If it were someone else,

542
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
I would have left the team without permission.

543
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
I would have thrown her out of the car.

544
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
I'm talking to you.

545
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Hello?

546
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Hello?

547
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
I'm looking for a girlfriend.

548
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
I'm sorry.

549
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
I'm sorry.

550
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Why I lost the way

551
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,800
of my life

552
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
Tell me

553
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:18,800
How I live without you

554
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
I'm not sleeping.

555
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
Don't look down on me.

556
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
I'm not bullying you.

557
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
I'm not bullying you.

558
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
I'm just hitting you.

559
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,800
How I live without you

560
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,800
Please re-examine the test paper.

561
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Please re-examine the test paper.

562
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Please re-examine the test paper.

563
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
Which one is it?

564
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
What's wrong, brother?

565
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
No.

566
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
When did you do this?

567
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Why didn't you tell me?

568
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
You didn't tell me when you got home.

569
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
What?

570
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Why didn't you tell me?

571
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,800
What do you mean I didn't tell you, Zhang Jun?

572
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
I don't know how many times I told you.

573
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
You can't do it at all.

574
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
You sleep like a pig.

575
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Zhang Jun.

576
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Are you pretending to sleep?

577
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Do you want me to hold you

578
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,800
and carry you from the bottom to the door of your house?

579
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
Who wants to hold you?

580
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
My butt.

581
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Zhang Jun.

582
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
You dare to push your leader?

583
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Be careful I will take revenge.

584
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Okay.

585
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Now the leader takes me home.

586
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,800
The leader should go back to rest.

587
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Good night.

588
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
The test failed. Please re-examine the test paper.

589
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Right hand.

590
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
I know.

591
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
I know.

592
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Good night.

593
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Dad.

594
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
The test failed. Please re-examine the test paper.

595
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
When will I record the paper?

596
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
I will take it.

597
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
He is really a man of steel.

598
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
He doesn't understand my feelings.

599
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
Go.

600
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
My foot is twisted.

601
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
What if my shoe breaks?

602
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Give me your shoe.

603
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
What?

604
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Shoe.

605
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
This one?

606
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
That one.

607
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,800
My shoe.

608
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
You can walk with the high heel.

609
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,800
I can't walk with the high heel.

610
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
I can't walk with the high heel.

611
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
Let's go.

612
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
My...

613
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
I can't walk with the high heel.

614
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
What's wrong?

615
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
Can you walk with the high heel?

616
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Yes.

617
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Really?

618
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Yes.

619
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
I think it's good.

620
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Put me down.

621
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Put me down.

622
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
I'm late.

623
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
Wait for me.

624
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
I'll change my clothes and be right back.

625
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Okay, hurry up.

626
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
I'm coming.

627
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,800
I'm going back.

628
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,800
Okay, thank you. Bye.

629
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Bye.

630
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Hello.

631
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Sir, can I have a bag of jewelry?

632
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Jewelry.

633
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Okay.

634
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
Thank you.

635
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
Sir.

636
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Thank you.

637
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Sir, your slippers...

638
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Your slippers.

639
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,800
I broke your shoes.

640
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
Here you are.

641
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Thank you.

642
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
She's looking for me.

643
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,800
She looks better and better.

644
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
She's so cute.

645
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
Here's the photo.

646
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Although it's a dead version,

647
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
according to the asset list,

648
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
you've classified it according to the work report.

649
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
It's very detailed.

650
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,800
As the data for the charger,

651
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,800
it has a certain value.

652
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

653
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Chen Yicheng.

654
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Doctor,

655
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
you've come up with a very creative idea.

656
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,800
Although the current domestic monitoring system

657
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
is very difficult to implement,

658
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
it's very eye-catching.

659
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,800
Yes.

660
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,800
Mr. Ye.

661
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
Shen Xing.

662
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,800
Such a report is a waste of time for me.

663
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,800
Give me four more hours.

664
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,800
I can definitely add a perfect report.

665
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Four hours?

666
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
You think too highly of yourself.

667
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,800
You're not even 40 hours away from perfection.

668
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Let me say it again.

669
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
There are less than two hours left

670
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,800
until the first IPO announcement is announced.

671
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
During this period,

672
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,800
even if you sacrifice all the brain cells,

673
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
you have to do every report well

674
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
to solve all the problems.

675
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
Is that clear?

676
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
Go out.

677
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

678
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,800
Mr. Yuan, my report...

679
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
Jiang Jun, you stay alone to help.

680
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Shi Di has gone.

681
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Da Maoxian has played too.

682
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Is this what you really mean?

683
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
You're really hopeless.

684
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Come here.

685
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Mr. Yuan, if you have any advice, just say it.

686
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
I can hear you.

687
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,800
I can't say it out loud.

688
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,800
Come here.

689
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
I can hear you.

690
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
You mentioned in the report

691
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
that there are serious problems with the internal record.

692
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,800
What are they?

693
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
I did find some problems.

694
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
But I don't have any solid evidence.

695
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,800
So it's not convenient to report more.

696
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
Hello, Mr. Qiao.

697
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Where's Mr. Qiao?

698
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Mr. Qiao,

699
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
can I delay you for a few minutes?

700
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
I have a data request to ask you.

701
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
I have other things to do.

702
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,800
You can ask Mr. Yuan directly about the K-pop.

703
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
But Mr. Yuan is now

704
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
instructing Jiang Jun alone.

705
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
It's not convenient for me to go in.

706
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
But I'm really in a hurry.

707
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
I'll talk to you later.

708
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
You're just a second-hand news

709
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
that you got from drinking.

710
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
What are you selling?

711
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,800
Don't underestimate second-hand news.

712
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Although it's likely to be processed in a dramatic way,

713
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,800
it's often more objective than the first-hand news.

714
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
It's hard to say.

715
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,800
It's said that there's a secret lounge in Wan Shan.

716
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,800
There must be a problem there.

717
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
But you know about this kind of entertainment company.

718
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,800
It's complicated.

719
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
So it's hard to say.

720
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,800
You mean

721
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
there are some secret restrooms?

722
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,800
And they also said that the entrance and exit are very secret.

723
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,800
It's really hard to find.

724
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,800
But it's actually spread among the trainees.

725
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
Then where is this lounge?

726
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
Don't think I went to the bathroom to play cards.

727
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,800
I've been around the whole Wanxin.

728
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
I remember everything.

729
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
You've already remembered all the positions

730
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,800
of all the departments in Wanxin.

731
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
Why am I so unfortunate?

732
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,800
When you were a kid,

733
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,800
you even said the wrong topic.

734
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
You should have mentioned this to me.

735
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,800
I'm sorry.

736
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,800
I forgot to open the door.

737
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,800
I'm sorry.

738
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,800
I'm sorry.

739
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,800
I'm sorry.

740
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,800
I can't catch your light

741
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,800
You fly so high

742
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,800
Leave all the things behind

743
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
And our story

744
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,800
Leave our love nowhere to find

745
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,800
I think I'm tight

746
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,800
I think I'm blind

747
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,800
Don't know how to feel

748
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,800
Don't know how to heal

749
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,800
You walk so fast

750
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,800
Can't catch your light

751
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,800
You fly so high

752
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,800
Leave all the things behind

753
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,800
And our story

754
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:23,800
Leave our love nowhere to find

755
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,800
I think I'm tight
