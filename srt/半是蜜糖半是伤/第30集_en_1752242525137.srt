00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,840
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,320
The Long Ballad

3
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,200
The life of Jiang Xun is simple because of him

4
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,120
The Long Ballad

5
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,560
Natural nutrition, natural health

6
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,280
A war to create a healthy life of nutrition

7
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,880
Continue to protect the mother of love

8
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,240
The harmony of the harmony

9
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,560
Remind you of the wonderful start

10
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,360
The Long Ballad

11
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,520
Sister

12
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,440
Is it necessary to play hard ball?

13
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,880
You don't have to unity all night

14
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,280
It's not just me

15
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,160
I ultimatum

16
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,320
He needs my horsepower

17
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,960
and rubber

18
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,720
Brother

19
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,880
Things are over

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:28,340
Why do you have

21
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,800
a paprika input

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
to make me like this.

23
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,960
You're right.

24
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,840
I should have gotten this ending.

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,200
Thank you for telling me

26
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,600
not to make it worse.

27
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,080
Now that I've said it,

28
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,800
I feel much better.

29
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,400
Du.

30
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,980
Thank you for letting me stay.

31
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,520
The one I truly love

32
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,580
is the person who I need most.

33
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,460
I don't believe

34
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,240
in my own people wanting for their whole life.

35
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,780
You know

36
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,300
I don't justwooden and apologize.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,400
For so long, my love for you has caused you so much pain.

39
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,600
For the next few days, you can do whatever you want.

40
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,000
Go after what you want to.

41
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,800
When you feel tired, go home.

42
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,600
The Du family will always be your home.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,800
컬러

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,800
value

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
can be told

46
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,100
плохо

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,600
unusual

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,600
Do n't be afraid

49
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,000
I know

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,840
Walked into your plan

51
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,000
Like I never knew you were not mine

52
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,000
Make you satisfied

53
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,840
Wear another mask

54
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,920
You'd never realize the things I do for love

55
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
I think I'm done

56
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,440
I should go

57
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,640
I think I'm blind

58
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,280
Don't know how to feel

59
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,640
Don't know how to hear

60
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,400
You walk so fast

61
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,560
Can't catch your eye

62
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
Take care

63
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,600
You flash away

64
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,920
Leave all the things behind

65
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,720
End of story

66
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,320
Leave our love nowhere

67
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,320
To find

68
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,000
Xiao Xue

69
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,600
Xiao Xue

70
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,960
Listen to me

71
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,000
I have my reasons

72
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,760
Sorry

73
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,680
Please forgive me

74
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,400
You crazy woman

75
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,920
Why did you hit my brother?

76
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,840
Who are you calling crazy?

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,800
You

78
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:19,920
You

79
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,400
Jiang Jun

80
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,640
Leave her alone

81
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,000
Just a kid

82
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,440
Brother

83
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,600
Do you have any evidence?

84
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,640
Jia Yuanqi

85
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,240
Brother

86
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,280
Shut up

87
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,040
What's wrong?

88
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,160
What are you doing?

89
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,720
Hello, I'm Jia Yuanqi

90
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,600
Who is this kid?

91
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,960
I'm leaving

92
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,160
Jiang Jun

93
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,360
Jiang Jun

94
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,840
Jiang Jun

95
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,240
Jiang Jun, I'm back

96
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,480
Junjun

97
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,560
Junjun, open the door

98
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,160
Baby

99
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,880
I bought your favorite chestnuts

100
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,680
Baby

101
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,400
I bought your favorite chestnuts

102
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,920
His birthday

103
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,720
My birthday

104
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
His mother's birthday

105
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh my god

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,280
I can't even enter the house

107
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,160
Baby, open the door

108
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,880
Baby

109
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,000
Baby, open the door

110
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,880
I knew you wouldn't be so cruel

111
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,360
I bought your favorite chestnuts

112
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,200
What do you mean?

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,040
Don't you understand?

114
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,840
Congratulations

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,040
You are expelled from the house

116
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Jiang Jun, you are too much

117
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,920
It's not more than someone

118
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,600
pulling the whole world to act with me

119
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,320
right?

120
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,520
I have my reasons for doing so

121
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,200
I can explain to you

122
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,920
I know

123
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,080
You know you treat me like this

124
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,400
You

125
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
I have reasons for doing this

126
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,280
What reasons do you have?

127
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,400
You don't need to know my reasons

128
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,600
You just need to know

129
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,280
I do this for your own good

130
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,760
Jiang Jun

131
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,480
Jiang Jun

132
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,440
Jiang Jun

133
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,640
You changed the password

134
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,480
and don't let me enter the house

135
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,560
You don't want me to buy chestnuts for you

136
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,520
What do you want?

137
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,080
I am sorry to you

138
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,920
You don't forgive me

139
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,160
You can meet a man

140
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,200
who is better than me

141
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,560
I don't believe you

142
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,600
You are here alone

143
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,640
and you don't call me

144
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,600
I am sorry

145
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,760
You can buy it yourself

146
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,640
It's mine

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,680
Why are you so petty?

148
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,080
We have our own revolution

149
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,360
Don't turn a blind eye to it

150
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,400
What a pity

151
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,960
It's said Lin Tai Mo's case is over

152
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,800
When are you going to leave M&H?

153
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,680
When?

154
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,040
I don't want to leave

155
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,720
What?

156
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,720
You don't want to leave M&H?

157
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,560
Li Tao

158
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,440
I have been thinking about it for a long time

159
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,560
since I left the company

160
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,160
I wanted to find something

161
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Besides, I think M&H is good

162
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,040
I like it

163
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,120
You like M&H?

164
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,360
Or you like people in M&H?

165
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,680
I like them all

166
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,080
What?

167
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,760
You are so nervous

168
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,280
that you are afraid that I will come out?

169
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,360
I am kidding

170
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,720
I will be nervous, Du Lei

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,160
You still don't know the situation

172
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,480
General has already made a choice

173
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,360
The situation will change

174
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,640
if you don't change

175
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,240
You haven't reconciled yet?

176
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,400
None of your business

177
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Thank you for telling me this good news

178
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,360
Drink

179
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,080
You can buy it yourself

180
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,080
I have to think about

181
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,360
what to eat on the weekend

182
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,480
Waiter

183
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,280
Help me open the ice cream shop

184
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,320
to celebrate

185
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,400
You are rich, right?

186
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,040
Okay

187
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,960
Boss, this bottle is also his

188
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,280
Right

189
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,800
Why do you come to the shopping street today?

190
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
My dad solved the problem

191
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
I want to go back to his house these days

192
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,880
and tell my mom about it

193
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,080
I will buy him a dress

194
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,640
Okay

195
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,080
I think this is good

196
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,560
I like it

197
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,880
You bastard

198
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,080
Why is it you?

199
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,280
Brother

200
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,360
I am hungry

201
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,000
Hungry?

202
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
Do you want to go to eat with me?

203
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,160
Okay, what do you want to eat?

204
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,280
Pizza

205
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,240
Pizza

206
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,040
Okay

207
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,320
Boss, which floor is this?

208
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,960
The first floor or the second floor?

209
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,760
Okay, let's go

210
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,280
Is he greedy for my black?

211
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,680
There are many perverts in this year

212
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,480
Hurry up

213
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,520
Why do you love?

214
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,960
Just because of you

215
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,920
I lost someone

216
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,040
I don't love you

217
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,800
I don't know why

218
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,880
Just want to sigh

219
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
You don't know if it's because of Xu Li, right?

220
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,520
You like him

221
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,000
Xiaochun

222
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,400
If you really like Xu Li

223
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,920
You can go after him boldly

224
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,560
Don't care about your poor match

225
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,000
You still talk about me?

226
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,440
What about yourself?

227
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,120
You are back with Jiang Jun?

228
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,520
Lily

229
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,840
It's hard to find a three-legged

230
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,760
Two-legged men are everywhere

231
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,960
So there is nothing to be regretful

232
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,440
I understand the truth

233
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,600
But I'm not sad

234
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
So what you have to do now

235
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,760
Is to forget Li Xiaochun quickly

236
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,960
Start your new life

237
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,680
Did you get back together?

238
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,680
No

239
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,520
He doesn't want you to get back together?

240
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,560
That's not true

241
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,600
I won't forgive him

242
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
I risked my life for him

243
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
I gave so much for him

244
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,480
But he is not moved at all

245
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,440
And he is cold with me

246
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,200
What does he think?

247
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,120
What do you mean?

248
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,040
He acted with me all over the world

249
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,400
And he left me alone in the dark

250
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,240
And he told me it's for my own good

251
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,760
He doesn't trust me at all

252
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,840
Lin Taimo is so dangerous

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
If he chooses to protect me

254
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,160
What will he do?

255
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,080
How can I live in the next half of my life?

256
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,600
died

257
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,760
I heard you just now

258
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,080
So what if I heard that?

259
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,080
I just won't forgive you

260
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,280
합離

261
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,840
Get out

262
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,600
Go

263
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,120
Buy the bill.

264
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,120
201?

265
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,600
Why are you laughing?

266
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,800
She scared you away

267
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,080
and asked you to buy the bill.

268
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,880
Why are you laughing?

269
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,200
Because I confirmed one thing.

270
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,400
What is it?

271
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,040
She still loves me.

272
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,560
She won't forgive you, either.

273
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,880
You don't understand, Xiao Shuai.

274
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,000
When a person likes you

275
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,840
and wants to fight with you,

276
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,000
she doesn't want to fight with you at all.

277
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,480
She just wants to prove that you still love her.

278
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,680
So?

279
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,440
What are you going to do?

280
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,040
One word,

281
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,480
be in love.

282
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,560
Two words,

283
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,640
be in love.

284
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,640
Three words,

285
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,360
be in love.

286
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,600
Be in love.

287
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,920
Coming.

288
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,800
Your breakfast is here.

289
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,360
Please give me a like.

290
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,680
Hello, buy the bill.

291
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,080
Can I use WeChat?

292
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,360
I've already bought the bill.

293
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,120
I'll give you two tickets.

294
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,720
Thank you.

295
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,160
I'm coming.

296
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,400
Thank you.

297
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,120
You're welcome.

298
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,400
You are the only one in my life

299
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
I can't see the end of the world

300
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,600
Coming.

301
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,720
The song I love is close to the river

302
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,160
I'm waiting for you to complete the plot

303
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,880
Thank you.

304
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,040
I love you, it's true

305
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,960
I can't stop thinking of you

306
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,920
Every minute, every second

307
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,760
Baby, I love you, it's true

308
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,920
Because of you, I don't know

309
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,240
I should, everything falling for you

310
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,960
Thank you.

311
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:24,560
I should, everything falling for you

312
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:38,400
I should, everything falling for you

313
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,200
Hey, if I could write a song for you

314
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,520
To tell you just how I think of you

315
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,760
Oh my my my, those twinkling eyes

316
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,560
There's where I start from and then

317
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,280
Hey, if I could write a song for you

318
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,480
Oh my my my, those twinkling eyes

319
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,320
There's where I start from and then

320
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,720
Hey, if I could write a song for you

321
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,840
Oh my my my, those twinkling eyes

322
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,680
There's where I start from and then

323
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,800
Hey, if I could write a song for you

324
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,640
Baby, sing this love song I wrote for you

325
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,080
Da da da da da da da

326
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,320
There's tea in for two

327
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,720
Honey and ice cream now

328
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Don't go for your so sweet love so beautiful

329
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,600
Mr. Li, Mr. Li, the tea party is about to start.

330
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,400
Right away, right away.

331
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,480
Welcome to the Westworld 2.0 press conference.

332
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,360
I am the developer of this software, Li Xiaochuan.

333
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,080
First of all, thank you to all the media friends

334
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,080
and the users behind me for coming to our show.

335
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,840
Today, I mainly want to introduce to you

336
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,880
a new product that Westworld has developed

337
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
after its upgrade.

338
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,800
This is called Westworld 2.0.

339
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,120
This wristband will be linked to Westworld's software.

340
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,960
At the same time, we have added a new mode called growth mode.

341
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,640
The growth mode will collect the chat messages

342
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,120
of the two users

343
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,640
in addition to the original compatibility of the two users.

344
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,120
And when the two people are in contact,

345
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,760
the body, upper body, and lung, etc.

346
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
will be connected to the two users.

347
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,840
After the growth mode,

348
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,440
the body, upper body, and lung, etc.

349
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,800
will be connected to the two users.

350
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
The body, upper body, and lung, etc.

351
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
will be connected to the two users.

352
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
When the two people are in contact,

353
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,040
the wristband will make a normal sound

354
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,720
like a heartbeat.

355
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,720
I call it the heartbeat signal.

356
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,760
So after the Westworld 2.0 upgrade,

357
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,440
even if the two users are in contact with each other,

358
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,480
there is a chance that the two users will grow together.

359
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,440
Thank you.

360
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,600
This wristband sounds so good.

361
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,560
Yes.

362
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,400
Mr. Li,

363
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,520
what is the inspiration behind your first design?

364
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,280
Explain it to me.

365
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,360
If I give you the Nation'sinstrument,

366
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,480
bring it there.

367
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Is it come from what you first saw?

368
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,200
Bring it here.

369
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,400
Use these?

370
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,360
At first,

371
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,020
China's

372
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:16,040
kinglike

373
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,320
ears

374
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,400
I called it raspberry.

375
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,040
I was looking at the design of some flowers.

376
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,040
Because the western world's calculation is 100% accurate

377
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,040
There will be no mistake at all

378
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Why can't I like you?

379
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
You just said it yourself

380
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,040
We are one percent match

381
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,040
One percent is impossible

382
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Sometimes I dream of you

383
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,040
But

384
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
Since he left me

385
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
I just found

386
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Sometimes

387
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,040
I was wrong

388
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,040
I was completely wrong

389
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
So

390
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,040
The release of the western world 2.0

391
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,040
Mainly want to prove one thing

392
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
That we are one percent

393
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Also have a chance to be one percent

394
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Then ask

395
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Did this girl come to the scene today?

396
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
she

397
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Hey, the live broadcast has started for so long

398
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
she

399
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
She is waiting for me

400
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,040
She is waiting for you

401
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Who is she

402
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Hey, where are you going?

403
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Li Xiaochuan

404
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Do you know what you are doing?

405
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
I am sorry

406
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
I am sorry

407
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
From the first time I saw you

408
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,040
I am very very

409
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Like you

410
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
I heard that

411
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,040
People who watch the first snow together

412
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Will be bald

413
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Love can be miracle

414
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,040
Want you in me

415
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Unlock the silence

416
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Healing my wound

417
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
Who

418
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,040
I have something to tell you

419
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,040
I miss everything

420
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
My promise

421
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Wait a moment to say

422
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Li Xiaochuan

423
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
What are you doing

424
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,040
Can you say it now

425
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,040
This is my new year

426
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Western world 2.0 bracelet

427
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Let's test it again

428
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
You want to insult me again, right?

429
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
Of course not

430
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
This bracelet is designed to inspire you

431
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Let's test it again

432
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,040
This time it will definitely not be one percent

433
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Want you in me

434
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,040
Unlock the silence

435
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Healing my wound

436
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Who

437
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,040
I have something to tell you

438
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,040
I miss everything

439
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,040
My promise

440
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Wait a moment to say

441
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
What happened

442
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Wait a moment

443
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,040
This is what you see

444
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Your most trusted software is telling you now

445
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
I don't deserve you

446
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,040
We don't have a chance to be together

447
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,040
Love can be miracle

448
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Want you in me

449
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,040
Please, please

450
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Don't come to me again

451
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
Healing my wound

452
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,040
You're my miracle

453
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,040
You're my miss everything

454
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,040
My promise

455
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,040
Wait a moment to say

456
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
I like you

457
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
I try to understand

458
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,040
Try to say goodbye a thousand times

459
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
You can tell me lies

460
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,040
You can make me cry, you know why

461
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Never been so brave

462
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,040
I won't run away

463
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,040
If it's what you like

464
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
What you want

465
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
What did you say just now

466
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Mountains I will climb

467
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Oceans I will cross with no doubt

468
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,040
I said I like you

469
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Dart into the flame

470
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,040
We live for pain

471
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,040
Burn my heart

472
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,040
Since you left

473
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,040
I've been a bad person

474
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Don't know what to do all day

475
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
It's all your business in your head

476
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,040
I will never let you go again

477
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Not a second

478
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
But we're together

479
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
We are still one percent

480
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
For you

481
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Isn't your software very failed?

482
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
I don't care

483
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
If it's one percent

484
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
It means he still has his problems

485
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
I will fix him

486
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
I will fix him

487
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
Fix to the two of us

488
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Is one hundred percent

489
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
Lily

490
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
Be my girlfriend

491
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,040
I can close my eyes

492
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
I can stay behind

493
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Waste my time

494
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Walked into your plan

495
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Like I never knew you were not mine

496
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Make you satisfied

497
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,040
I can't let you go

498
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
I can't let you go

499
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
I can't let you go

500
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
I can't let you go

501
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Make you satisfied

502
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Wear another mask

503
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
You never realize

504
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
The things I do for love

505
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,040
You walk so fast

506
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,040
Can't catch your way

507
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Xiaochun, look

508
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,040
We're one hundred percent

509
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Leave all the things behind

510
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
End of story

511
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Leave our love nowhere

512
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
To find

513
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Junjun

514
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Mom

515
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Why are you back?

516
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,040
I miss you

517
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
When did you become so good?

518
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,040
Why don't I believe it?

519
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Where is Yuan Yuan?

520
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
He

521
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
Who?

522
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
Why are you here?

523
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
I'm not here to see you

524
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Aunt

525
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
I'm here to see you

526
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Me?

527
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,040
Aunt

528
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
This is

529
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
Uncle's one-line brand

530
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
Brand transfer agreement

531
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,040
I have done the other procedures

532
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
You just need to sign here

533
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Then

534
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
The brand of one-line

535
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
Can be back in your hands

536
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
Aunt

537
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
Uncle

538
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
He watched me grow up

539
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
One-line brand

540
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
It's uncle's life-long effort

541
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
So

542
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
I think I should do this

543
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,040
When your uncle was alive

544
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
He always said

545
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Do one thing

546
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
Have enough passion

547
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Because only enough passion

548
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,040
To be able to treat him wholeheartedly

549
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,040
I don't understand him

550
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
I didn't understand him

551
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,040
I think he is so old

552
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Why is he

553
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
As childish as a child?

554
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
Until the day

555
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
Our company opened

556
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,040
He was in front of all his old friends

557
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Cry happily

558
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
At that moment

559
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
I understand

560
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
How much he loves

561
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
How much he loves

562
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
What he does

563
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
So

564
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,040
I have always supported him

565
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
Work hard outside

566
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Don't let him be distracted

567
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,040
I take care of my family wholeheartedly

568
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,040
Just didn't expect

569
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
That's the last thing

570
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
Yuanyuan

571
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Thank you

572
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Thank you for our family

573
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,040
Do all this

574
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Thank you

575
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
Aunt

576
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,040
Don't say that

577
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
This is what I should do

578
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Mom, don't cry

579
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
I'm going to cry too

580
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,040
Mom doesn't cry

581
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
I don't want to cry

582
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
Nothing

583
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Mom is happy

584
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
I want to take this wedding dress

585
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Go tell your dad

586
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,040
Thank you

587
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
I'll take you to a place

588
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
I'll take you to a place

589
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
I'll take you to a place

590
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
I'll take you to a place

591
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
I'll take you to a place

592
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
I'll take you to a place

593
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
I'll take you to a place

594
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
I'll take you to a place

595
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
I'll take you to a place

596
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
I'll take you to a place

597
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
Why do you take me here?

598
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,040
What is written on the blackboard

599
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,040
The crimes that I bullied you in childhood

600
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,040
You just follow these above

601
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,200
You want me to forgive you?

602
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,040
Alright.

603
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,960
Since you helped my mom

604
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,280
to get back the brand,

605
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,680
I can give you a chance.

606
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,400
Alright.

607
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,800
Come on.

608
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,080
I don't need these things.

609
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,240
I just want you to answer me one question

610
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,360
and I'll be satisfied.

611
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,160
Alright. Ask me.

612
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,520
I'm asking you.

613
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,560
Do you really

614
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,000
know where you're wrong?

615
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,520
I do.

616
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,720
Where?

617
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,280
Jiang Jun.

618
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,720
My biggest mistake

619
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,400
is that I didn't realize

620
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,120
how much you love me.

621
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,840
Just like I can let go of everything

622
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,440
and protect you with all my life,

623
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,480
you can also let go of everything

624
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,960
and protect me.

625
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,120
But I didn't choose to believe you.

626
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,160
I believe

627
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,880
you're willing to take all the risks

628
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,360
with me.

629
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,840
But in the end,

630
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,880
you can always

631
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,840
have someone by your side.

632
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,760
What I hate the most

633
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,240
is that I hid everything

634
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,160
from you

635
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,520
in the name of protecting you.

636
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,400
If,

637
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,680
if I was in danger,

638
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,440
No one will say it even if I'm wrong.

639
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
I'm sorry, General.

640
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,920
You're so mean.

641
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,360
I mean it.

642
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,280
As long as you can forgive me,

643
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,600
I can do anything.

644
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,520
I'm sorry.

645
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,480
You said you would return all the things

646
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,840
that you bullied me when I was a kid.

647
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,680
I've thought about how to punish you.

648
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,440
Come up.

649
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:54,960
General, you...

650
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,640
You don't want to come, do you?

651
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,760
Come up.

652
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,240
Well...

653
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,640
General.

654
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,240
General, you're so childish.

655
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,720
You...

656
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,480
You really hit me in the hand.

657
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,200
Who said I hit you in the hand?

658
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,320
I hit your ass.

659
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,800
Ass?

660
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,120
Okay.

661
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:15,680
You...

662
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,200
Okay.

663
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,640
Are you ashamed?

664
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,960
Why did you hit my ass?

665
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:19,880
Let go.

666
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,720
No, I won't.

667
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:21,880
Let go.

668
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,200
No.

669
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,480
Yuan Shuai.

670
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,040
You only have this one chance.

671
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,960
See if you can accept it.

672
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,400
If you don't, we'll break up.

673
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
General, you're enough.

674
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,200
Come on.

675
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,960
Okay.

676
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,480
You're good at acting.

677
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I didn't hit you.

678
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,920
Okay.

679
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,320
Be gentle.

680
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,120
Okay.

681
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,000
I'll be gentle.

682
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,440
I'll be gentle.

683
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,680
Did I do anything wrong?

684
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,560
When I Electric spooned you,

685
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,680
my vamon realised that

686
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,200
I didn't hit you.

687
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,000
And at that moment,

688
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,560
if you looked up at contains,

689
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,320
there are three colors.

690
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,160
There fourgentler and Dawe,

691
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,200
your abandonment reached its mouth.

692
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,640
You've totaled my heart.

693
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,020
When you bowed at me,

694
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,320
you reached the way point

695
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,160
in pain and怖 surprising with dever,

696
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,960
When we were young, we went to and from school.

697
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,000
We would leave every day.

698
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,800
But I remembered it.

699
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,760
How long are you going to keep me in the cold?

700
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,840
I'll be cold for a few days if you run away.

701
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,360
Okay.

702
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,840
It's okay.

703
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,240
I've been waiting for you for more than ten years.

704
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,840
I don't care if I can't wait for you.

705
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,800
Listen, Jiang Jun.

706
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,960
I'm determined to be with you.

707
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,600
You can only be mine.

708
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,000
Brother Yu Yan.

709
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,760
How long are you going to bully me?

710
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,960
How long are you going to cry?

711
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,360
I'm going to bully you.

712
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,360
How long are you going to cry?

713
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,400
Thank you, Brother Yu Yan.

714
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,000
Let's go.

715
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,120
Brother Yu Yan.

716
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,960
How long are you going to bully me?

717
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,840
Brother Yu Yan will never bully you again.

718
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,160
From now on,

719
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,000
I will only protect you.

720
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,640
What kind of protection?

721
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,960
I'll hug you tightly

722
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,960
and never let go.

723
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,760
I'm tired.

724
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,560
I think I'm blind.

725
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,520
Don't know how to feel.

726
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,480
Don't know how to heal.

727
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,400
You walk so fast.

728
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,080
Can't catch your light.

729
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,600
You fly so high.

730
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,720
Leave all the things behind.

731
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:11,720
And our story leave our love nowhere to find.
