Miss Xinxin?

7
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,479
I just came back from abroad,

8
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,360
and I’m still jet-lagged.

9
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,800
Wait!

10
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,840
So I got up early

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,160
to buy some breakfast.

12
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,280
I also got some for you.

13
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,160
Okay!

14
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
Thank you so much!

15
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,800
It’s such a big house.

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,640
You live here alone?

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,360
Yes... Alone!

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,280
Why is there a flush noise?

19
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,800
Dog!

20
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
I have a dog! It can flush the toilet!

21
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,920
Dog can flush the toilet?

22
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,560
Yes!

23
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,480
Amazing, right? How smart!

24
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,740
It is.

25
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,780
What are you doing this early…

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,280
Assistant Yuan?

27
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,040
How…

28
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,960
How come you are here?

29
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,120
You two…

30
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,400
Yes, you are right.

31
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,040
We are in a relationship.

Honey,

34
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,360
you know what?

35
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,000
I found out something

36
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,980
really unexpected this morning.

37
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,800
What is it?

38
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,000
That Ms. Jiang living next door

39
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,450
and your Assistant Yuan

40
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,490
are actually in a relationship

41
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,160
How did you know?

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,320
I saw them this morning!

43
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,840
In… In person?

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,360
What…

45
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,250
What did you see?

46
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,760
I saw that they are living together.

47
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,800
My sweetheart,

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,440
please stay away from her!

49
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,440
Why?

50
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,760
She… She… She…

51
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,280
She is the daughter of our CEO.

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,800
Her father sent her here.

53
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,240
Otherwise, how could she be a director

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,560
at such a young age?

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,480
So you mean

56
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,800
Assistant Yuan is her secret lover?

57
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,520
I guess you could say that.

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,520
Anyway, try to stay away from them.

59
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,880
If she knew that you found out her secret,

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,680
she’d give me a hard time at work.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,040
Would she?

62
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,760
She looks like a nice person.

63
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,240
You don’t know.

64
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,240
She’s quite weird.

65
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
How?

66
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,560
Just stay clear of them.

67
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,960
Okay! I’ll listen to you!

68
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,269

Were they talking about
Jun and Yuan Shuai?

73
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,640
But the positions aren’t right!

74
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,340
Forget it. It could be a coincidence!

if I stop her so quickly!

100
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,800
Hello, Yuan Shuai! Hurry and hide!

101

If she sees you are there, I’ll be dead!

How come Jiang Jun
has a pair of man’s slippers?

104
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,040
Good that you are back!

105
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,520
I was just wondering,

106
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,250
why do you have man’s slippers?

107
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,090
Because…

108
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,880
I live here all by myself.

109
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,520
When those delivery guys

110
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,440
see a pair of

111
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,360
man’s slippers,

112
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,400
they’ll be intimidated!

113
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,600
You’d do the same thing,

114
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,400
wouldn’t you?

115
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,560
Makes sense!

116

What’s Wealth doing here?

117
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,400
Long time no see!

Don’t you think you should

133
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,600
give me an explanation?

134
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
How can this thing

135
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,000
appear in your apartment?

136
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,540
I… I bought this recently!

137
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,560
I think it

138
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,919
looks nice and it’s elastic!

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,549
So,

140
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,120
I love wearing it after shower!

141
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
It’s 100% cotton.

142
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,200
Look!

143
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,030
Quite convenient

144
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,720
and loose!

145
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,480
Really comfortable.

146
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,809
Don’t you wanna get one?

147
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,360
Loose?

148
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
And comfortable?

149
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,280
You also prefer having a hole here?

150
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,600
What an interesting preference!

151
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,860
It’s breathable, huh?

152
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,560
You think I’d believe it?

153
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,560
Not even I believe it.

154
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,770
Tell the truth,
and you will receive a lighter sentence.

155
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,520
It wasn’t my intention!

156
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,760
One of our associates

157
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,760
bragged to his girlfriend,

158
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
saying he’s the ED

159
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,160
and owns several apartments.

160
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,120
His girlfriend returned from abroad
to visit him.

161
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,320
To cover up his lies,

162
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,500
Yuan Shuai lent his apartment to him.

163
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,800
So you are helping Yuan Shuai

164
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,400
by letting him stay with you?

165
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,560
I didn’t want to.

166
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,120
But he wouldn’t leave!

167
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,440
I can’t drive him out.

168
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,000
After all, it’s his apartment.

169
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,040
He wouldn’t leave?

170
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,160
So

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,460
did anything interesting

172
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,960
happen between you two?

173
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,960
Of course, not!

174
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
No way!

175
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,320
We…

176
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,250
What’s that look about?

177
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,600
What look?

178
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,960
What… What are you talking about?

179
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,560
It’s late! Aren’t you going

180
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,850
to see Li Xiaochuan?

181
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,940
I have a date! It’s all your fault!

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,640
Jiang Jun,

183
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,240
it’s not over!

184
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,450
Thank God, I’m safe for now!

185
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,040
What’s going on?

186
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,900
I get nervous so easily recently
when talking about that jerk!

187
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,760
Mr. Du.

188
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,180
Hold on!

189
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,080
Is it necessary?

190
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,960
It’s a sense of ritual!

191
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
Please put it on!

192
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,040
Okay.

193
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,770
Alright.

194
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,480
Now, come with me.

195
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,680
Steps!

196
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,890
Wait. Here’s a step!

197
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,080
Good!

198
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,960
Another step!

199
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,210
Another one!

200
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,920
Okay. Mr. Du, now you can take off the patch.

201
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,480
Surprise!

202
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,040
How did you know today is…

203
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,320
Today, we are celebrating
the opening of West World!

204
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,000
It’s a surprise party

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
we prepared for you!

206
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,760
That’s right!

207
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,200
Mr. Du,

208
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,000
look.

209
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,520
The working area is over here.

210
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,320
Hope you’ll like the style.

211
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,720
And this area is for tea break.

212
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,680
I’ve observed.

213
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,400
When it’s about 2 or 3 o’clock in the afternoon,

214
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,000
the sun will shine over there.

215
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,360
When you have time,

216
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,280
you can take a break there

217
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,320
and have a cup of coffee.

218
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,560
Quite comfy, isn’t it?

219
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,160
Mr. Du,

220
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,600
we know you are a busy man,

221
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,800
but we hope you can

222
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,650
come visit us

223
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,360
as often as possible.

224
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,640
That’s right!

225
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,440
No worry.

226
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,080
With such outstanding employees
like you two,

227
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,400
Mr. Du will come to visit often for sure!

228
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,360
What “you two”?

229
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,160
You are also

230
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,680
one of us now!

231
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,840
Right, Mr. Du?

232
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,080
Yes.

233
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,200
By the way,

234
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Xiaochuan and I are preparing

235
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,800
an offline dating activity.

236
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,530
Please do come if you have time!

237
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Speaking of that,

238
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,440
I want to organize a camping trip,

239
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,840
which can provide a great opportunity
for our users to bond

240
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,320
and to do some exercise.

241
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,320
But somebody thinks

242
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,900
it’s not romantic enough!

243
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,890
Jun, do you think

244
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,960
people would like a date out in the wild?

245
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,040
You can’t dress up,

246
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,240
and it’s dangerous!

247
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,640
Environment is very important for dating.

248
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,880
It must be a place

249
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,960
that is romantic and filled with love!

250
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,840
Jun, am I right?

251
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,040
I think Xu Li is right!

252
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,440
Thank you, boss!

253
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,040
Now, let’s get the celebration started!

254
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,680
Today

255
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,800
is the opening day of our West World.

256
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,680
West World

257
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,760
will officially open today!

258
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,240
Let’s welcome our investor, Mr. Du,

259
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,290
to make a speech!

260
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,240
Okay.

261
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,120
Then I’ll keep it short.

262
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,520
Over the years I’ve worked
in the investment bank.

263
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,720
I handled a great number of cases.

264
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,880
West World

265
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,700
is actually the smallest case

266
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,480
I’ve ever met so far.

267
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,600
But I believe

268
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,920
that with your hard work

269
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,050
and your abilities,

270
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,800
you will be able to create popular products!

271
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,000
Thank you for your speech, Mr. Du!

272
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,880
Next, let’s welcome

273
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
the founder of West World,

274
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,400
Mr. Li Xiaochuan, to make a speech!

275
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,360
Come on, Xiaochuan.

276
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,220
Say something!

277
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,000
You can do it!

278
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,640
Cheers!

279
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Cheers! Cheers!

280
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Cheers!

281
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,920
It’s such a special day!

282
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,120
Let’s take a picture!

283
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,160
Okay.

284
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,440
Jun, I promise I won’t post the picture
on my Moments!

285
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,040
I’ll keep it! Hurry! Ready?

286
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
Three, two, one!

287
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,400
Mr. Du,

288
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,220
we didn’t prepare anything fancy today.

289
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,370
Hope you won’t mind!

290
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,760
Don’t say that.

291
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,420
Mr. Du invested the money.

292
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,000
We should spend every penny wisely.

293
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,680
You know?

294
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,720
In my opinion,

295
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,320
today is the opening day.

296
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,760
We don’t have to be so tight.

297
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,440
Just order

298
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,460
anything you want. It’s my treat!

299
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,000
Great!

300
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,160
Then I’ll go buy some food now.

301
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,640
There’s a restaurant nearby selling
fried chicken and Sichuan cuisine. Very tasty!

302
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,520
Mr. Du, since it’s your treat,

303
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,080
we’ll thank you in advance!

304
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,610
Go ahead.

305
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,450
Let’s go.

306
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,880
Come with me!

307
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,760
Why… Why would I go with you?

308
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,360
Go buy food!

309
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,880
Come on! Let’s go!

310
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,120
You guys keep talking.

311
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,480
It may take a while for us to come back.

312
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,120
Wait!

313
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,920
Let’s go!

314
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,060
Why isn’t she home yet?

315
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,920
[Jiang Jun]

316
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,760
Where are you?

317
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Working late inefficiently again?

318
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,800
I’m not!

319
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,050
Today is the opening day of West World!

320
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,880
Opening day?

321
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,360
Where’s your office?

322
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,240
I won’t tell you!

323
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,680
Wealth!

324
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,560
We are left out!

325
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,520
Left out! Did you hear me?

326
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,880
Good for you!

327
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,020
Let me help you.

328
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,400
I’m so sorry!

329
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,560
Hurry, clean it up.

330
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,500
Are you laughing at me?

331
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,720
No, I’m not!

332
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,960
Hey,

333
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,589
it didn’t get to you

334
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,829
because of my help.

335
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,240
I don’t laugh easily.

336
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,200
Unless

337
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,980
it’s really funny!

338
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,000
Hello? Who’s speaking?

339
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,920
Hello, Mr. Du.

340
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,069
Miss Linda ordered you a birthday gift

341
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:27,920
and a birthday cake,

342
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,000
but you are not home.

343
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,680
May I know where you are right now?

344
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,610
I’ll have someone send them to you.

345
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,000
How did you know today is…

346
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,200
Don’t bother.

347
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,860
They are at your disposal.

348
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,520
Mr. Du.

349
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,130
Today is your birthday?

350
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,920
Kind of.

351
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,840
Linda was my supervisor at GE.

352
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,800
She’s also a nominal sister to me

353
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,920
in the Du family.

354
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,760
I don’t know your family members anyway.

355
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,800
But I know

356
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,250
today is your birthday.

357
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,160
So

358
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,850
I want to express a sincere wish to you.

359
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,600
Happy birthday, Mr. Du!

360
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,440
Thank you.

361
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,160
Oh, right!

362
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,360
Since we have a cake here,

363
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
after they are back,

364
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,040
let’s celebrate your birthday together.

365
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,520
Together!

366
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,880
Let’s forget it.

367
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,080
I don’t want too many people to know.

368
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,160
I see.

369
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,200
Then we’ll celebrate your birthday

370
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
secretly and quickly.

371
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,980
How’s that?

372
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,320
that's ok

373
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,080

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,200
Thank you,

377
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,860
but it’s a little awkward.

378
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,170
Alright.

379
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,640
Then make a wish!

380
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,840
Make a wish?

381
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,080
Make a wish…

382
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,160
Actually, I can’t think of anything right now.

383
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,200
I’ll save it

384
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,880
for another time.

385
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,440
Sure! Let’s save it!

386
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,240
Go ahead and blow the candles!

387
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,600
Okay.

[West World Go! Go! Go!]

389
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,000
Why don’t the candles go out?

390
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,600
Let me help you.

391
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,720
Finally!

392
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,720
Mr. Du, I don’t think the cake
is eatable anymore!

393
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,120
It’s covered by our spit!

395
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,360
Actually,

396
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,880
I have something to tell you.

397
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,000
Go ahead!

398
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,200
Actually…

399
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,400
Actually…

400
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,210
Is it something urgent?

401
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,880
No.

402
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,280
My friend wants my opinion about his cooking.

403
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,410
Mr. Du, please go on.

404
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,900
[Yuan Shuai]

405
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,200
I forgot.

“When will you be back?

408

Well, Mr. Du.

409
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,760
I’m sorry,

410
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,020
but it is an emergency!

411
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,420
I have to go now.

412
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,960
I’ll celebrate your birthday another time.

413
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,760
See you!

414
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,370
Happy birthday!

415
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
Sorry.

416
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,160
You have to work late because of me.

417
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,520
I tried a few times to ask you to come over
and have a chat,

418
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,980
but you said you were busy.

419
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,240
Why?

420
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,440
What made you come to see me all of a sudden today?

421
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,720
I haven’t slept for days.

422
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,080
I’m tired of taking melatonin, so here I am.

423
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,520
I need someone to talk to.

424
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,460
What happened?

425
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,040
Because of work

426
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,720
or him?

427
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,040
I see.

428
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,840
You’d only come to me

429
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,960
because of him.

430
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,410
He said something that really hurt me.

431
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,400
And I can’t get

432
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,600
a hold of him recently.

433
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,320
I actually envied you when I was little.

434
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,000
It’s true.

435
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
You can act freely

436
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,440
and do whatever you want.

437
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,520
So,

438
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,520
I tried so hard to become you.

439
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,960
But after I did it,

440
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,980
I found that’s not what I want.

441
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,080
We’re born to be different.

442
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,480
Your last name is Du.

443
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,600
But mine isn’t.

444
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,160
I never expected he’d see me that way.

445
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,130
I always thought I was the one he relied on.

446
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,240
But in his eyes,

447
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,760
I’m not different

448
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,080
from those people who want

449
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,850
to control his life.

450
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,400
Have some warm water.

451
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,880
It’ll help you relax.

452
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,040
No need.

453
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,960
You know my habit.

454
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,340
I’m used to using essential oil to relax.

455
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,840
Judging from what you said,

456
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,960
it’s quite obvious

457
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,400
that you are a controlling person.

458
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,000
I admit that I am when it comes to work,

459
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,400
but not to him.

460
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,440
It’s your personality.

461
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,120
It’d exert a subtle influence on your behaviors.

462
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,560
Take the cup of warm water as an example.

463
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,290
It’s the doctor’s suggestion,

464
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,380
yet you still wouldn’t accept it.

465
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,040
Perhaps you think

466
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,280
you controlled yourself

467
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,000
very well in front of him,

468
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,380
but as a matter of fact,

469
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,640
you were still

470
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
subconsciously trying

471
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,440
to control his life.

472
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,000
Actually,

473
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,360
many things would work out better

474
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,040
if you change another way.

475
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,640
Take a good rest.

476
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,050
Try to relax.

477
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,620
[Du Lei]

478
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Change another way?

Doesn’t your wound hurt?

480
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,120
It does.

481
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,170
But I can stand the pain.

482
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,330
Then why are you playing games?

483
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,040
Give it back.

484
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,720
What else can I do?

485
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,340

They look so tasty!

my mouth’s watering!

Yes.

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,760
Why are your hands so cold?

523
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,400
Where’s your coat? I’ll go get it for you.

524
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,600
In the closet.

525
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,800
Wait a sec.

526
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,000
They are so intimate.

527
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,080
It’s not important.

528
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,000
Please go on.

529
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,200
Ms. Jiang!

530
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,860
I’ll get it myself!

531
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,640
Why are they all suits?

532
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,640
-Well.
-Well.

533
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,220
Go have dinner.

534
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,520
The doctor said my wound was healed.

535
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,480
So I’ll go to work tomorrow.

536
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,440
Now, eat.

537
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,560
Try this. This is tasty.

538
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,280
Try it.

539
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,280
Why don’t you eat?

540
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,240
You… You go first.

541
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,880
You go first.

542
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,320
Well…

543
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,180
About what happened earlier,

544
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,960
I didn’t do it on purpose.

545
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Please don’t get me wrong.

546
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,440
I’m full. And…

547
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,840
Since you are recovered,

548
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,720
I’ll sleep

549
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,180
in the bedroom now.

550
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,730
I’m going to bed.

551
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,040
Be careful!

552
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,480
So hot!

553
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,700
Is summer coming already?

554
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,680
I’ve read the due diligence report

555
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,540
of Shengshi Group you submitted.

556
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,120
It’s much better than

557
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,480
you did on Wanxing last time.

558
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,010
Good job!

559
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,440
Keep it up.

560
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,080
Let’s start from Xiang Ding.

561
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,720
Xiang Ding has made the most
progress this time.

562
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,920
He checked all the basic information,

563
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,700
including land, property, trademark, patent…

564
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,240
Jiang Jun!

565
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,920
Jiang Jun!

566
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,340
What are you doing?

567
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,220
What’s wrong with your mouth?

568
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,140
What’s wrong with your mouth?

569
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,960
Mouth? My mouth?

570
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,720
I’m doing the popular

571
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,720
octopus mouth dance!

572
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,360
Octopus mouth dance?

573
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,440
Yes.

574
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,040
You don’t know it?It’s…

575
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,000
It’s like…

576
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,080
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!

577
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,480
It’s a quite popular office dance.

578
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,960
It’s a good exercise for mouth.

579
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,340
If nothing else, I’ll go back to work!

580
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,340
Why are you looking at me this way?

581
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,600
What’s going on?

582
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,280
Sorry! I’m just lost in thought.

583
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,800
How come a man’s lips

584
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,460
are even softer than mine?

585
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,920
What am I thinking about?

586
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,480
Why are you staring at me?

587
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,000
Well…

588
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,620
I… I think you look so pretty today, Ms. Qiao!

589
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,080
You’d better do your job well

590
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,960
instead of playing up to me.

591
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,520
Sure!

592
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,170
Oh my God!

593
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,240
What’s wrong with me?

594
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,040
Do I have lip-phobia now?

595
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,400
Up till now, West World has attracted

596
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,120
8,000 beta test users.

597
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,640
Based on our data,

598
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,760
38 people’s matching degrees reach

599
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,080
over 70%.

600
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,680
In order to get more specific experience data,

601
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,840
we are going to hold an offline activity

602
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,240
with free accommodation service

603
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,320
so that they can meet each other in person.

604
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,600
As for the location,

605
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,760
I still insist on

606
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,080
a camping trip.

607
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,800
But it was vetoed.

608
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,960
So, Xu Li will be fully

609
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,600
in charge of the planning!

610
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,200
The place I found

611
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,960
is pretty, romantic and magical enough!

612
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,320
Many idol dramas

613
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,240
pick this place for love scenes!

614
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,900
[Offline activity venue: The aquarium]

615
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,360
This magical place is the aquarium!

616
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,240
During the activity,

617
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,280
I will respectively put the couples

618
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,240
whose matching degrees are

619
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,240
70%, 80% and 90%

620
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,240
at different spots.

621
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,060
But the thing is that they don’t know each other.

622
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,280
The app is the only way for them

623
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,560
to decide if they want to meet each other in person.

624
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,800
And more  importantly,

625
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,240
I’ve arranged

626
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,120
a splendid location

627
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,440
for our only 100% match

628
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,200
to meet!

629
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,080
They’ll be the focus

630
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,440
of our observation.

631
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,880
If their date is successful,

632
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,200
it’ll be a breakthrough

633
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,800
for West World!

634
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,880
Sounds good!

635
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,440
So, Mr. Du, will you be there on that day?

636
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,170
Actually, on that day I…

637
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,960
If anything’s up,

638
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,400
we can consult you and Jun.

639
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,040
Right?

640
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,000
Okay, I’ll be there!

641
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,080
Come here.

642
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:53,920
Why?

643
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,680
Sit down.

644
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,960
I’ll show you a magic.

645
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,420
Now, watch.

646
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,320
Hold on.

647
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,240
So ugly!

648
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,960
Pig lips!

649
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,240
They are!

650
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,240
You think it’s over?

651
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,530
I also prepared one for you.

652
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,240
No!

653
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,240
Come back!

654
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,000
No!

655
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,840
So ugly!

656
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,880
Yuan Shuai!

657
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,480
Really ugly!

658
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,880
Are you happy now?

659
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,480
Next.

660
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,730
We’ll do something together. It’s called

661
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,800
Super Imitation.

662
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,240
Super Imitation!

663
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,360
Repeat the things I say.

664
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,160
Okay.

665
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,020
Listen carefully.

666
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,280
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

667
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,280
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

668
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.

669
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,520
So fluent?

670
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,960
Let’s change one.

671
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,360
Here it is!

672
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,300
Listen carefully.

673
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,960
Three, two, one!

674
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,280
Little white rabbit,

675
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,040
dressed up in white.

676
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,600
Two long ears stick up high.

677
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,600
It likes radish and cabbage.

678
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,720
It jumps around and It’s so cute.

679
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,280
Little white rabbit,

680
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,800
dressed up in white.

681
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,800
Two long ears stick up high.

682
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,800
It likes radish and cabbage.

683
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,000
It jumps around and It’s so cute.

684
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,520
Better?

685
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,960
What?

686
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
You are fine, now?

687
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,700
Dear West World users,

688
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,720
Hello!

689
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,300
Thank you for your support for our beta test.

690
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,800
We’ll hold our first offline dating activity

691
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,440
at the aquarium this Sunday afternoon
at two o'clock.

692
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,680
Hope to see you then!

693
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
Dating?

694
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,040
I’m not going!

Jun.

696
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,600
The time and the place of our offline activity

697
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,560
have been settled.

698
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,280
The app should have sent you a notice.

699
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,360
Xiaochuan, Mr. Du and I will all be there.

700
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,760
As a member of West World,

701
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,450
you’ve got to be there, too!

702
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,620
Love Is Sweet
