1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,600
The Bond

2
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,320
The families who conflict with each other

3
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,360
will soon find fault

4
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,960
Welcome to And me

5
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,760
Save Chang'nv

6
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,120
Episode 1

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What's wrong?

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's fine now.

9
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's okay.

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What happened?

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Auntie, can you tell me what happened?

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yuan Yuan, do you remember your childhood?

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You loved your uncle's rice noodles.

14
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Of course I remember.

15
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay, stop playing. Eat it while it's hot.

16
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Thank you, uncle. Thank you, dad.

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
In order to stop the food from being buried,

19
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
your uncle joined a few friends

20
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and created a rice noodle brand called One Line.

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
MH has always been financial support.

22
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Later, the business got better and better.

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
In order to expand the store,

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
your uncle used to finance and borrow money.

25
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But since he collaborated with MH,

26
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
things have been strange.

27
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
MH has always wanted to change our production model

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and agree to the acquisition of C Group.

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Your uncle didn't agree.

30
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
When the funds were not being transferred,

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the food security problem suddenly broke out.

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, uncle.

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The company is already handling it.

34
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We will definitely give you a satisfactory answer.

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Right?

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hurry up.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Stop buying new products immediately.

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Remove all our products immediately.

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes.

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Stop collecting.

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You all go out.

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

44
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
In the end,

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
your uncle had to agree to their contract

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
for the survival of the entire factory.

47
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Your uncle never came back

48
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
since he went to Shanghai.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's been so long.

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't be too sad.

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
As for food security,

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
have you ever suspected

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
that someone might have done something?

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Impossible.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I believe your uncle.

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He would never be that kind of person.

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He has high requirements for food and quality.

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He would never do it on one go.

59
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And I've always thought

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
your uncle's death was very strange.

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
MH has high blood pressure.

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But he has been taking medicine and maintaining it well.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If there was no external stimulation,

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
he wouldn't have heart disease.

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Auntie, don't worry.

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I won't let your uncle die in vain.

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Do you still have the agreement?

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes.

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll give it to you.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay.

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This is the contract I bought.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't know if I can use it.

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's great.

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Auntie, I'll take a closer look.

75
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Have a good rest.

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
As for Jiang Jun,

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
you can rest assured.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Whether in the company or outside,

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll take good care of him.

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yuan Yuan,

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
thank you.

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Cao Heng.

83
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,200
Seongwell

84
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,600
The

85
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,360
work done by you

86
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,560
is way more important to me

87
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,200
than what you read.

88
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,400
Won't you go in?

89
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,320
Do you think

90
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,920
I can be your puppet?

91
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,180
The world

92
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:21,760
is a

93
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,000
contrast.

94
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,840
Take death as life,

95
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,640
or a loss.

96
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,640
Besides,

97
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,640
You can't control others' interests or lives.

98
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,080
What's more important is that if you don't fight for yourself,

99
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,860
no one will fight for you.

100
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,980
Do you remember it?

101
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,060
home is not enough.

102
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,920
No matter what you do,

103
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,840
the more you want to become a writer,

104
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,720
the better you'll become for yourself.

105
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,120
You're welcome.

106
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,600
Yuan Yuan, come on.

107
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,200
Why didn't you take these things?

108
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,080
You're too kind, aunt.

109
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,040
Yuan Yuan, let me tell you.

110
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,920
These things are very good for your health.

111
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,360
Look, there are sea cucumber,

112
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,760
deer's gourd, ginseng.

113
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,520
They're all good for your health.

114
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,160
Aunt, you prepared so many things.

115
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,920
I can eat them until the new year.

116
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,200
Yuan Yuan, these are good for your health.

117
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,320
Jun Jun, keep an eye on him.

118
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,360
Don't worry, mom.

119
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,600
We're all adults.

120
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,040
We'll take good care of ourselves.

121
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,440
Jun Jun,

122
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,040
Yuan Yuan told mom.

123
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,760
Mom won't stop you from working at M.I.H.

124
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,440
But remember,

125
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,400
when you encounter any problem,

126
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,320
you must tell Yuan Yuan first.

127
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,040
You can't make the decision on your own.

128
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,120
Remember?

129
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,960
If Yuan Yuan can't solve it,

130
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,520
tell mom.

131
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,720
There's nothing that mom can't solve.

132
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Mom,

133
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,400
I love you.

134
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,520
Mom loves you too.

135
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,480
I love you.

136
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,200
Aunt, don't worry.

137
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,400
I'll take good care of Jun Jun.

138
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,160
Yuan Yuan,

139
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll leave Jun Jun to you.

140
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,080
Mom, I'm leaving.

141
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,080
We have to catch a flight.

142
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,160
Okay, okay.

143
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,040
Don't be late.

144
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,080
Let's go.

145
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,080
Jun Jun, lose weight.

146
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,840
Eat well.

147
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,440
Okay.

148
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,000
We're leaving.

149
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,640
Aunt,

150
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,960
I'll come back to see you later.

151
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,440
Okay.

152
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:41,960
Okay.

153
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,600
Let's go in.

154
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,280
Okay.

155
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:43,960
Let's go.

156
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,200
Be careful on the way.

157
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,120
Jun Jun,

158
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,680
call mom when you arrive.

159
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,360
Okay.

160
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,800
Look.

161
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
So handsome.

162
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,080
He's really handsome.

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,880
But the aunt next to him,

164
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,400
is she his girlfriend?

165
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,840
No.

166
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,320
Let's go.

167
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,840
Qing.

168
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,440
So many people.

169
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,400
What are you doing?

170
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,680
What's wrong?

171
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,040
You're an adult.

172
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
You even eat the vinegar of a little girl.

173
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,880
I just know it.

174
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,040
If you do this,

175
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,480
I don't know how much vinegar you'll eat in the future.

176
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,120
Can you do it?

177
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,240
Then you'll make me cry.

178
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,160
Yuan Yuan,

179
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,080
can you promise me one thing?

180
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,080
Aunt,

181
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,400
please say it.

182
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,680
I hope

183
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,000
no matter what changes

184
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,720
happen between you and Jun Jun,

185
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,560
or what happened between you,

186
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,800
I hope you can be kind to Jun Jun

187
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,360
and don't be the one who makes him cry.

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,640
Tang Jun,

189
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,840
if you really

190
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,000
encounter something that makes you feel bad,

191
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,360
just cry it out.

192
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,960
I'll be there for you

193
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,640
when you faint.

194
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,280
Why are you so mean today?

195
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,560
Because I love you.

196
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,760
I love you too.

197
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,680
I'm not a god.

198
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,880
You are a god.

199
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,880
I'm a god.

200
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,400
Let's go there next time, okay?

201
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,160
Well,

202
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,880
do you need anything?

203
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,280
Hello, I'm from the neighborhood.

204
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:26,960
It's New Year.

205
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
I'm here to give you a gift.

206
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,720
Well,

207
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,200
I just remembered

208
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,520
we have a delivery.

209
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,520
Let's go get it.

210
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,760
It's okay. Give it to me.

211
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Well,

212
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,720
look, he's busy.

213
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,120
He's still giving gifts.

214
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,600
I'm friends with a neighbor.

215
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,600
If you give me this,

216
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,640
I'll give it to him.

217
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,560
How can I do that?

218
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,120
This gift is from Mr. Yuan of 701

219
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,720
and Ms. Jiang of 702.

220
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,320
Mr. Yuan of 701?

221
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,720
Isn't Mr. Su the owner of 701?

222
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,120
It's a misunderstanding.

223
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,760
I'm really friends with them.

224
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Just give it to me.

225
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,040
Speaking of which, Mr. Su,

226
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,480
which unit are you from?

227
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,360
We're from 701.

228
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,440
You... You must be mistaken.

229
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,000
701 and 702

230
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,280
are Mr. Yuan's owners.

231
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,040
He's the top investment manager in Shanghai.

232
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,800
He's the only owner

233
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,520
of one or two households in this neighborhood.

234
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,960
How could I be mistaken?

235
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,320
The top investment manager?

236
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,440
Mr. Yuan?

237
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,640
Yes.

238
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,240
Su Chang!

239
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,400
Okay, I'll send him off.

240
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,360
Baby, don't be mad.

241
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,160
Let me explain.

242
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,880
Let's go inside.

243
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
No, I don't want to hear your explanation.

244
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,680
Let's go inside.

245
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,000
What's wrong?

246
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,240
I'm busy.

247
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,720
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,840
Xing Xing, come here.

249
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,640
Well...

250
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,520
I didn't mean to lie to you.

251
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,840
Su Chang actually

252
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,520
regrets lying to you.

253
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,360
But, you know,

254
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,360
men are so self-respecting.

255
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,200
He's afraid you'll dislike him.

256
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,520
But I've never disliked him.

257
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,240
Why did he lie to me?

258
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,240
I... I understand you.

259
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,400
Actually...

260
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,160
Baby, can you explain it for me?

261
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,760
Do I really know I was wrong?

262
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,520
I don't want to hear it.

263
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,960
Su Xing Qi, stop!

264
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,120
If you keep going, I'll...

265
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,840
If you keep going, I'll...

266
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,360
What will you do?

267
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,880
Su Xing Qi, listen to me.

268
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,680
Don't ask.

269
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,480
I've loved you for ten years.

270
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,840
I'm not married to you.

271
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,880
I know I lied to you.

272
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,480
I regret it, too.

273
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,200
But if you don't forgive me,

274
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,920
the day you left Shanghai

275
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,320
will be my death anniversary.

276
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,880
I know I'm poor.

277
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,560
But I'll try my best.

278
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Please give me another chance.

279
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,720
Xing Xing.

280
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,480
Baby, I believe you.

281
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,440
I'll never leave you again.

282
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,000
Let's go.

283
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,160
Let's go back to our home.

284
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,680
Let's go.

285
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,560
Do you see it?

286
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,200
This trick...

287
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,440
I'm so good at it.

288
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,840
You're good at it.

289
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,680
But I warn you.

290
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,440
Don't try to lie to me.

291
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm not that easy to fool.

292
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,480
I promise

293
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,680
I won't lie to the Queen.

294
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,760
That's more like it.

295
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,760
Mr. Yuan, Miss Xia.

296
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,960
Your Tao Zi is back.

297
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,040
Happy 100th anniversary.

298
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,680
This is a new year gift.

299
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,120
Thank you.

300
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,160
You won't forget to pay the water bill this time?

301
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,720
I won't.

302
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,200
I'll see you out now.

303
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,280
Happy New Year.

304
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,960
I know

305
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,800
why Su Cheng CALLEDieg casualties this time.

306
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,200
Who is he?

307
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,360
He is a Intervideo expert.

308
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,800
But in a word,

309
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,040
you're like a living-at-性 with embezzlement.

310
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,680
Isn't it your house?

311
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,000
No more good-natured talk for you.

312
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,960
I have to live in any no man's land.

313
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,440
You don't have to care.

314
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,440
What if I don't agree?

315
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,400
I'll sell the 701 right away.

316
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,880
I'll see if you're willing to kick me out.

317
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,440
No.

318
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,240
Let's go.

319
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,760
Let's go.

320
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,480
What are you doing?

321
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,000
You just came back from work?

322
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,960
Mr. Luo.

323
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,160
Mr. Luo asked me to help him with some materials.

324
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,520
Maybe he has to go on a business trip.

325
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,000
Mom.

326
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,920
I'm going to be a empty-handed

327
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,560
since the New Year has just started.

328
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,840
Silly girl.

329
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,160
You'll be back soon.

330
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,760
What did you tell my mom

331
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,760
to let my mom agree to let you work at MS?

332
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,840
I'll tell you the secret.

333
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,440
Stop talking nonsense.

334
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,560
I don't want to know.

335
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,520
I'm not going to tell her.

336
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,800
I've already reached my goal.

337
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,920
I'm not going to tell her.

338
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,400
All right.

339
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,560
Go to bed first.

340
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
You're going to attend the New Year's party tomorrow, right?

341
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
You'll be surprised.

342
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,320
I'm coming. Go.

343
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,600
Let's go.

344
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,280
Come on.

345
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,160
Go to bed.

346
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,000
Come on.

347
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,400
Go to bed early.

348
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,760
Your skin is good.

349
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,200
Come on.

350
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,200
Come on.

351
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,160
I love you.

352
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,880
I love you too.

353
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,680
Go to bed.

354
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,520
Go.

355
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,480
I love you too.

356
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,940
Hello, Su Chang.

357
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,000
Boss, I found out

358
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,240
that five years ago,

359
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,560
group C wasn't very big.

360
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,040
Cao Heng was their manager.

361
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,580
But they were charged

362
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,920
for sodium��lopices minus during construction,

363
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,120
I'll send you the address.

364
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,640
Okay.

365
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,840
Don't worry.

366
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,720
I'll find out the truth about this.

367
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,320
Yes.

368
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,720
Okay, don't worry.

369
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,080
Quan Shuai!

370
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,720
odynamic

371
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,200
I'll be waiting for you.

372
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,880
Take care of yourself.

373
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,800
Wait for me. I'll be back soon.

374
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,480
Morning.

375
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,080
Happy New Year.

376
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,880
Happy New Year.

377
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,440
Hello.

378
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,720
Happy New Year, everyone.

379
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
Happy New Year.

380
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,640
Happy New Year.

381
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,200
Your bracelet is pretty.

382
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,160
Of course.

383
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,480
This is their latest style.

384
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,720
I ordered it after a long time.

385
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,640
By the way,

386
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
let me tell you.

387
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,800
Our stock market

388
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,520
surpassed the previous year's sales.

389
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,320
So,

390
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,960
the shareholders are very happy.

391
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,600
I guess

392
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,760
Mr. Fan will

393
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,920
give us a big prize

394
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,920
with a lot of energy.

395
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,240
I'll choose the big cake.

396
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,560
The big cake is good.

397
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,960
It means we have the ability.

398
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,000
Otherwise, no one can eat the big cake.

399
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,440
And,

400
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,120
Yina

401
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,920
has provided us

402
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,800
such a good platform

403
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,040
to show off our talents.

404
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,960
So, we'll show off our talents.

405
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,440
We'll do whatever we need.

406
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,160
I envy you

407
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,280
to have such a good platform

408
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,320
to show off your talents.

409
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,040
Give me your company and bonus.

410
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,200
But I don't think you need it.

411
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,440
My salary and bonus

412
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,080
are the money I spent on

413
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
my career and talents

414
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,760
after helping the company.

415
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,960
Why do I hear you

416
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,920
so like

417
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,800
the reward you got after selling your company?

418
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,600
You're so mean.

419
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,280
I'm not.

420
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,640
Mr. Fan.

421
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,080
Good morning, Mr. Fan.

422
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,360
Morning.

423
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,440
Mr. Lin is here today.

424
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,520
He said he's waiting for you in your office.

425
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,200
Mr. Lin?

426
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,880
Yes.

427
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,760
Which Mr. Lin?

428
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,880
Okay, I know.

429
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,480
Okay.

430
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,520
Hello, everyone.

431
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,200
Hello.

432
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,800
Hello.

433
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,240
Hello.

434
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,040
Good morning, Mr. Lin.

435
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,280
Mr. Lin.

436
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,000
I heard a girl from the reception

437
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,200
say that there's a Mr. Lin

438
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,320
who came to see me this morning.

439
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,520
Who is the first person

440
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,760
to come to work this year?

441
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,720
You don't even know him?

442
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,360
How can you be in the MH meeting?

443
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,160
He's the vice president of the MH group,

444
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,800
Mr. Lin Taimo.

445
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,040
So, he's the legendary Mr. Lin.

446
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,960
Jiang Jun.

447
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,640
You know Mr. Lin, don't you?

448
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,720
I...

449
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,280
Mr. Fan.

450
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,040
Good morning.

451
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,720
Long time no see.

452
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,640
Welcome Mr. Lin

453
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,800
to lead the investment department.

454
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,040
You're really a man of honor.

455
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,680
Are you feeling better?

456
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,440
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Fan.

457
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,600
I'm much better.

458
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,440
During the time I've been in the hospital,

459
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,360
every little thing in the company

460
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,400
is under your control.

461
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,560
I feel really guilty.

462
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,120
So, I think it's time

463
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,880
to get back the burden

464
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
that's left behind.

465
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,680
Thanks to Mr. Lin's trust,

466
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,240
I think Mr. Lin will be able

467
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,000
to lead the investment department

468
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,760
to a higher level.

469
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,680
Here.

470
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,040
Have a cup of coffee to wake you up.

471
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,280
Thank you for your hard work.

472
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,120
Thank you.

473
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,800
Mr. Lin.

474
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,080
You've just recovered.

475
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,280
It's not easy to work too hard

476
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,480
to avoid affecting the health of those who are not from here.

477
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:57,920
Everyone.

478
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,440
I'll delay you for a few minutes.

479
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,360
Really?

480
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,360
First, let's welcome Mr. Lin to come back.

481
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,040
Welcome.

482
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,520
Now,

483
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,240
let's welcome the vice president of MH Securities,

484
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,440
Mr. Lin,

485
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,520
to say a few words for us.

486
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,360
Welcome.

487
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,120
Dear colleagues in the investment department,

488
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,360
I'm Lin Taimo,

489
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,640
happy new year.

490
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,120
I'm very grateful for your hard work last year.

491
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,880
So,

492
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,920
I can get such a good result.

493
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,440
This year,

494
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,840
the global economy is constantly recovering.

495
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,960
Investment banks

496
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,200
can be said to be

497
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,600
the important bulls in the market economy,

498
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,360
participating and affecting

499
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,000
the effective configuration of financial resources.

500
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,880
I hope that everyone can

501
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,080
continue to make great achievements this year.

502
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,840
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

503
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,280
Thank you for your advice.

504
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,680
I believe that under your leadership,

505
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,600
things will get better.

506
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,720
Lastly,

507
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,360
I wish you all a successful year.

508
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,720
Good luck.

509
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,440
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

510
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,160
Thank you.

511
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,240
Mr. Lin, please.

512
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:13,760
Please.

513
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,640
It seems that

514
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,000
my husband, Da Kaoshan, is coming back.

515
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,120
Yes.

516
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,760
He's greeting everyone

517
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,920
in person.

518
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,200
How kind he is!

519
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,560
Mr. Lin.

520
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,360
Mr. Lin.

521
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,360
Mr. Lin.

522
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,920
Long time no see.

523
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,880
I'm here to see you.

524
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,640
I have something to tell you.

525
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,320
What's the matter?

526
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,880
I'm sorry.

527
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,480
I'm sorry.

528
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,040
I'm sorry.

529
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,640
I'm sorry.

530
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,160
I'm sorry.

531
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,720
I'm sorry.

532
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,280
I'm sorry.

533
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,720
I'm sorry.

534
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,320
I'm sorry.

535
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm sorry.

536
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,960
I'm sorry.

537
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,400
Long time no see.

538
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,680
I'm the VP of our investment department,

539
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,360
Ma Xiu Ran.

540
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,920
I was really impressed

541
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,280
by what you said just now.

542
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,960
So I came here to visit you.

543
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,000
Mr. Ma.

544
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,160
I know.

545
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,400
Mr. Ma is a rare and precious talent

546
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,960
in our company.

547
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,480
You know me?

548
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,320
I'm so touched.

549
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,880
I'm very grateful for your coffee.

550
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,760
I've always liked

551
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,040
the brand of their coffee.

552
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,320
Their coffee beans...

553
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:04,960
Mr. Ma.

554
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,200
Can I sit in your office for a while?

555
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,160
It's my honor.

556
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,880
Please.

557
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,840
This way.

558
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,680
Over here.

559
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,480
Ms. Huang.

560
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,000
Excuse me.

561
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,080
Could you be the client?

562
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,840
Who is your client?

563
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,440
I'm a friend of Tao Hong.

564
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,400
Could you please tell me

565
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,200
where she is?

566
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,400
Don't ask me.

567
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,420
I'm still looking for her.

568
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,560
She went away

569
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,600
with a small sum

570
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,880
a man?

571
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,560
Don't get me wrong.

572
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,440
I'm not here to collect debts.

573
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,240
I'm here to pay off my debts.

574
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,960
Pay off your debts?

575
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,560
You owe him money?

576
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,720
How much?

577
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,320
Can you pay off his debt?

578
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,680
I don't think it's too big.

579
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,080
Hello.

580
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,400
I want to see someone.

581
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,600
I'm sorry, sir.

582
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
We don't have a business here.

583
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
I want to see your boss.

584
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,000
Our boss?

585
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,040
Brother Hua hasn't come yet.

586
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,400
Brother Hua?

587
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,640
Isn't your boss named Cao?

588
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,280
Cao Heng.

589
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,600
Are you here to collect debts?

590
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,520
I'm here to pay off his debts.

591
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,400
I met him five years ago.

592
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,360
If it wasn't for his money,

593
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,880
I wouldn't be with him.

594
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,800
But he said he wanted to do business

595
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,520
and make people around him rich.

596
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,480
He borrowed money from others.

597
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
I paid a lot of money.

598
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,920
But he took the money to gamble.

599
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,440
If I had his key

600
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,920
and I could pay him off,

601
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,720
he would have been beaten to death.

602
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,560
Besides,

603
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,560
he went to the casino as soon as he got some money.

604
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,720
I saw he left some money at home.

605
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,280
I don't know where he got it from.

606
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,280
If I hadn't taken it out,

607
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,920
he would have gone there today.

608
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,440
You can't blame him.

609
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,280
Sometimes,

610
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,920
it's hard to escape from gambling.

611
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,480
How about this?

612
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,080
I'll pay him back

613
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,760
if you help me.

614
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,080
I'm curious about it.

615
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,680
Where did he go to gamble?

616
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
He didn't say much.

617
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,560
I'm not sure about that.

618
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,760
But I heard

619
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,440
he opened a casino near a bar.

620
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,240
It should be a basement casino.

621
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,200
Ordinary people can't get in.

622
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,880
Where does he usually go?

623
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,240
I can't tell you that easily.

624
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,960
The casino is in the alley

625
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,120
10 meters from the KTV.

626
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,480
There's an iron staircase.

627
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,280
Go up the stairs.

628
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,640
The casino is on the second floor.

629
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,800
Take this.

630
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,080
Show it to the people at the door.

631
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,560
Say you're a friend of Brother Hua.

632
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,320
They won't make it hard for you.

633
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,280
Thank you.

634
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,560
Mr. Du.

635
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,440
I can see you everywhere.

636
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,280
It's like a soul competition.

637
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
I was just going out

638
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,120
and I was looking at you.

639
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,040
I thought I saw something dirty.

640
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,720
It's you, Mr. Du.

641
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,720
What are you doing here?

642
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,960
Looking for a script.

643
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,320
Why are you looking for it?

644
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,760
General Fang is looking for the truth around him.

645
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,240
Aren't you the same?

646
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,160
I think you're here to hide.

647
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,760
I just said

648
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,440
I'm here to find the truth.

649
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,640
Let's find it.

650
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,120
Let's find it separately.

651
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,040
Why don't we work together?

652
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,680
Since we're both looking for the script,

653
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,720
let's work together.

654
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,840
I'm just one step away.

655
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,680
I just don't know

656
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,000
where the casino is.

657
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,960
Work together?

658
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,000
Are you kidding me?

659
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,120
You're not good enough

660
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,600
to find the location.

661
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,320
Why should I work with you?

662
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,840
You know more about me than I do.

663
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,640
What do you mean?

664
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,280
I was involved

665
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,400
in this case when I was in Ji Yi.

666
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,800
I know a lot about it.

667
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
Besides,

668
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,720
I really want to be the general.

669
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
That's nice.

670
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,280
Why should I believe you?

671
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,880
It doesn't matter if you don't believe me.

672
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,440
But I have to tell you.

673
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,360
If we can

674
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,760
guard the casino today,

675
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,360
we can definitely find it.

676
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,040
Do you dare to bet?

677
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,360
Go ahead.

678
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,560
Are you sure this is the underground casino?

679
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,320
If you don't believe me,

680
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,640
don't follow me.

681
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,960
This is Brother Hua's friend.

682
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,960
Secretary Du.

683
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,760
This is the casino

684
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,120
you mentioned.

685
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,240
It's so small and so broken.

686
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,800
How can I bet?

687
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,680
Yes, Mr. Yuan.

688
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,320
We'll go back

689
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,960
after we finish the business.

690
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,680
You can bet here.

691
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,640
Okay.

692
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,480
Did you get the 1 million

693
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,280
cash I asked you to get?

694
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,720
I've sent someone to get it.

695
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,080
I think this guy is quite responsible.

696
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,720
Give him some hard work.

697
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,520
It's very expensive.

698
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,520
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

699
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,360
Please.

700
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,040
Please.

701
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,680
I'm leaving, Secretary Du.

702
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,280
I'm leaving.

703
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,240
I'm leaving.

704
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,240
I'm leaving.

705
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,200
I'm leaving.

706
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,040
I'm leaving.

707
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,440
Please.

708
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,320
Please.

709
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,280
You gave me back

710
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,760
the 3,000 cash I asked you to get.

711
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,840
You're so petty, Secretary Du.

712
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
I'm just trying to...

713
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,000
If you want to cooperate,

714
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,520
show some sincerity.

715
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,120
Did you hear?

716
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,520
Caitlyn Ma is transferred

717
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,600
to the headquarter.

718
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,200
It's said it will take

719
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,960
three years

720
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,800
until she gets

721
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,480
the executive fee of the headquarter

722
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,840
and we'll leave.

723
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,560
But why don't day day

724
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,040
ask for an account

725
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,520
to help us?

726
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,360
Yes.

727
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,080
Then...

728
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,640
How did you know?

729
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,560
necessary.

730
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,040
These three years

731
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,120
have already passed.

732
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,440
Those historically eggs

733
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,400
the executive service department of the Ministry of Finance.

734
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,000
Executive service department?

735
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,680
Yes.

736
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,760
Isn't the administrative service department

737
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,640
the one in charge of advertising,

738
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,320
culture, and company logistics?

739
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
It's obvious that it's a secret agent.

740
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,160
Is this going to change the weather?

741
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:49,960
Yes.

742
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,720
The secret agent of the Ministry of Finance

743
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,440
seems to be under control.

744
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,040
It's true that the mountain is getting fuller and fuller.

745
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Let me tell you.

746
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,360
The reason why Mr. Lin started to work on Mr. Ma

747
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,040
is because he's trying to challenge Mr. Fan.

748
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,960
Yes.

749
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,440
But some people

750
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,760
must be happy about Mr. Lin's arrival.

751
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,200
Let's go.

752
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,840
Mr. Ma.

753
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,040
You are...

754
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,160
Don't be so modest.

755
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,400
I just lent my office to Mr. Lin.

756
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,880
I was transferred to the headquarters.

757
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,200
I can relax my stress here.

758
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,680
I can put myself at ease.

759
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,200
I see.

760
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,720
Congratulations, Mr. Ma.

761
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,800
Jiang Jun, Mr. Lin is looking for you.

762
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,680
Okay.

763
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,560
You'd better know

764
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,360
what you should say and what you shouldn't.

765
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,240
I'll be back.

766
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,920
I wish Mr. Ma

767
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,200
a good luck in the headquarters

768
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,720
and a good luck in the company.

769
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,680
I'll go now.

770
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,560
Okay.

771
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,080
Come in.

772
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,040
Mr. Lin, you are looking for me?

773
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,240
Jiang Jun.

774
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,640
Come on.

775
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,600
Please sit.

776
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,400
What do you think of my new office?

777
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,400
It's a little small.

778
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,240
But it's the best place

779
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,800
in the MH headquarters.

780
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,600
What do you think of the layout?

781
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,880
It's good.

782
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,840
By the way,

783
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,040
are you used to the new office?

784
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,000
Is it okay to work with your colleagues?

785
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,880
It's great.

786
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,280
Everyone is very nice to me.

787
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,800
I heard that

788
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,840
you did very well.

789
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,960
And you got the qualification

790
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,640
to transfer earlier.

791
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,800
Not bad.

792
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,240
You didn't disappoint me.

793
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,600
I was afraid of losing to your expectation.

794
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,680
So I made a guess

795
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,920
and worked harder.

796
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,720
I'm so relieved.

797
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,560
However,

798
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,480
let me tell you.

799
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,600
Mum and dad

800
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,400
are very good at co הסig awhile.

801
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,320
If your dad

802
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,580
knows you have such a good grade now,

803
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,280
he rats you out.

804
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,200
You know my dad.

805
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,200
We always had a good talk.

806
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,200
But he left a bit suddenly.

807
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,200
I didn't think you and my dad would still be friends.

808
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,200
But I was in college at the time, so I didn't get to see him for the last time.

809
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,200
He was also an M&H client.

810
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,200
For Yixian's brand, we all put in a lot of effort.

811
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
I know it's not easy for dad to start a business.

812
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
He and my mom are both people who don't give up.

813
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,200
So I couldn't help them in the end.

814
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,200
Mr. Lin, so what happened back then?

815
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
Can you tell me?

816
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,200
What did you say?

817
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,200
There was a financial problem in your dad's company.

818
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,200
I was also very active in solving the problem.

819
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
In the end, we found the C Group.

820
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,200
In fact, the conditions they gave were very good.

821
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:31,200
After we thought about it again, we finally signed the contract.

822
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:40,200
After signing the contract, I heard your dad's heart attack.

823
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Maybe it's because he's willing to sacrifice his life.

824
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
It must be very hard to accept.

825
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,200
If I had known this would happen, I wouldn't have...

826
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Mr. Lin, it's not your business.

827
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,200
You just completed a regular acquisition.

828
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:13,200
Jiang Jun, if you have any problems at work, you can always find me.

829
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,200
In fact, based on my relationship with your dad, you called me uncle.

830
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
I won't go too far.

831
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,200
You asked me to enter M.S. I'm really grateful.

832
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,200
I have no other requests.

833
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Okay, if you have any problems, you can always find me.

834
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
Go to work.

835
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
I'll go out first, Mr. Lin.

836
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,200
Boss.

837
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,200
I'm coming.

838
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Go.

839
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Go.

840
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Boss, I'm wrong.

841
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,200
Go.

842
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
Okay.

843
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Hurry up.

844
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
I'm sorry.

845
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,200
I'm sorry.

846
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,200
I'm sorry.

847
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,200
I'm sorry.

848
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
I'm sorry.

849
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,200
I'm sorry.
