1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,540
little bit of a

3
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,380
little bit of a

4
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,340
little bit of a

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,340
little bit of a

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,340
little bit of a

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,340
little bit of a

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,340
little bit of a

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,340
little bit of a

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,880
month

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,880
time

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
you

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,720
o

14
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,820
Okay.

15
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,180
I'll be very careful.

16
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,700
You'll be safe here.

17
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,420
Bye.

18
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,740
Little girl.

19
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,500
Where are you going?

20
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,020
Who are you?

21
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,460
It's none of your business.

22
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,780
Where you are is none of my business.

23
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,660
Give me the phone.

24
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,700
Wait, don't you have money?

25
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,060
How are you all here

26
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,300
Who else

27
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,380
Stop

28
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,300
Stop

29
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,900
stop

30
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,260
And you

31
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,180
Impossible.

32
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,380
You're back.

33
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,260
Let go.

34
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:01,940
You're back.

35
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,620
Let go.

36
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,220
You're back.

37
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,140
Let go.

38
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,860
Let go.

39
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,340
I can't cry.

40
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,820
Thank you for practising with me.

41
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,780
You haven't Murray as yet.

42
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,380
Jiang Jun.

43
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,100
What's wrong?

44
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,260
What's wrong?

45
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,100
Don't look at me.

46
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,260
I can't hold it anymore.

47
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,700
You're so scary. I'm going to cry again.

48
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,100
Does it hurt?

49
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,500
Blue, blue, blue.

50
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,340
Let me see your hand.

51
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,340
That one.

52
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:41,340
Where are you when nights grow cold?

53
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,980
I am missing you.

54
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,900
Could you hold your tears?

55
00:04:48,900 --> 00:05:14,420
And still

56
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,420
I need you to be

57
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,420
Do you feel better?

58
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,420
Much better

59
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,420
I really don't know how to say it

60
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,420
Why you have to leave

61
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,420
Oh please come back my love

62
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,420
Standing in a ring

63
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,420
I need your arms to hold

64
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,420
Let me see

65
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,420
Every night you hurry back to me

66
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,420
When winter turns to rain

67
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,420
It still hurts

68
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,420
Standing next to you

69
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:55,420
To see the flowers

70
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,420
Why do you still look at me like that

71
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,420
So you mean

72
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,420
Wan Shan used her power

73
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,420
To commit sexual assault on Tang Xin

74
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,420
The crime scene is Wan Shan's office

75
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,420
The rest room with the password

76
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,420
Where is the evidence Tang Xin gave you

77
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,420
And the video you took

78
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,420
In my phone

79
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,420
I let Xiao Kun and you take it away

80
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,420
From now on

81
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,420
You should have a good rest at home

82
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,420
I'll ask for leave for you at the company

83
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,420
And

84
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,420
You can't interfere with

85
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,420
Wan Shan and Tang Xin

86
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,420
How can I

87
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,420
Why not

88
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,420
You can't even take care of yourself

89
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,420
And you want to do such a dangerous thing

90
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,420
Who said I can't take care of myself

91
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,420
That little muddlehead, he was hurt too

92
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,420
General, are you really stupid or not

93
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,420
What era is it now

94
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,420
Which muddlehead is still on the street to grab money

95
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,420
That muddlehead is obviously

96
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,420
Wan Shan sent it to you

97
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,420
You and Tang Xin's every move

98
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,420
Should be under Wan Shan's supervision

99
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,420
If you approach Tang Xin again

100
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,420
It will only make yourself more dangerous

101
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,420
No

102
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,420
Then you can't let this go

103
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,420
Ignore it

104
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,420
Then it's not your turn to care

105
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,420
Then I don't need you to care

106
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,420
I'll find the evidence myself

107
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,420
General, it's so late, don't go out

108
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,420
Stay at home

109
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,420
I'll find the handkerchief for you, okay?

110
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,420
Did you hear me

111
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,420
No, I didn't hear you

112
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,420
You

113
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,420
What should I say

114
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Thank you for the slippers you gave me last time

115
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,420
Or western food

116
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,420
Or slippers

117
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,420
But such a big school

118
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,420
Where should I find it?

119
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,420
I remember it seems to be where I saw it before

120
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,420
As long as six people pass

121
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,420
You can find anyone in this world

122
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
Why don't I try it

123
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
Hello, hello, Wenyi

124
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
Do you know Li Xiaochuan?

125
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,420
I know

126
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
He is our school's male god

127
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,420
Male god

128
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,420
That is to say

129
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,420
There are many people who like him

130
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,420
Of course

131
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,420
Not only inside the school

132
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,420
People outside the school also come to inquire about him

133
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,420
For example

134
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,420
Then I want to ask you

135
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,420
Do you know which part of his body he likes to sing?

136
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,420
Know

137
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,420
Know

138
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,420
Really

139
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,420
Can you take me there?

140
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,420
Xiaochuan, the teacher is in an emergency

141
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
Come with me

142
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,420
Hurry up

143
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,420
Hurry up

144
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,420
What is this?

145
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
Oh my god

146
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,420
This is too messy

147
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
I want to make a decision at this moment

148
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,420
Wait for you to say yes

149
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,420
A virtuous family is my competitive advantage

150
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,420
Dear, do you miss me today?

151
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,420
I heard that there is a couple's contract outside tonight

152
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,420
Can I ask you out?

153
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,420
If you don't say anything

154
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,420
I'll take it as a yes

155
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,420
See you

156
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,420
You want to be a little sister?

157
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,420
I

158
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,420
I'm sorry

159
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,420
I'm sorry

160
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,420
I'm sorry

161
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,420
I don't have a name

162
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,420
I don't have a name

163
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,420
I'm sorry

164
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,420
Xu Li

165
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,420
Xu Li

166
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,420
Don't be self-willed

167
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,420
I have a girlfriend

168
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
I tell you, Xu Li

169
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,420
Don't be self-willed

170
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,420
I don't know what your name is

171
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,420
Change the name of the store

172
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,420
What's wrong with the store?

173
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,420
What's the name of the store?

174
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,420
Sweet, Xiaoxinxin, okay

175
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,420
What kind of sweet?

176
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,420
Hello, beautiful

177
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,420
We want to ask you something

178
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,420
Do you know your classmate Xiaochun?

179
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,420
I don't know

180
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,420
We haven't finished

181
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,420
Coming

182
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,420
Coming

183
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
Coming

184
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,420
Coming

185
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,420
Coming

186
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,420
I'm not in a good mood

187
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,420
I'm not in a good mood either

188
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,420
You count first

189
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,420
Then I'll count first

190
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,420
Go in

191
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,420
What?

192
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,420
How can someone do this?

193
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,420
Is it not fun to play with the phone?

194
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
Doesn't he have brothers and sisters?

195
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
Don't his parents love him?

196
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,420
This

197
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
And this Yuan Shuai

198
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,420
How can he leave this matter alone?

199
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,420
And let you get hurt

200
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,420
You go tell him for me now

201
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,420
I despise him, Xu Li

202
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,420
But what about you?

203
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,420
I feel like I'm in love

204
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,420
My white hair Wang Zi has a girlfriend

205
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,420
My story hasn't started yet

206
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,420
What do you mean?

207
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,420
You confessed to him?

208
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,420
No, I didn't

209
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,420
How dare I?

210
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,420
I went to school yesterday

211
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,420
I saw his WeChat account

212
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,420
A girl named Sweet sent him WeChat

213
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,420
And asked him to attend a birthday party

214
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,420
Don't think too much

215
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,420
What if his website is called Sweet?

216
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,420
He might be chasing after your boyfriend

217
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,420
I don't know yet

218
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,420
But he's my assistant

219
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
A convenient store girl

220
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,420
Think about it

221
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,420
If you really like someone

222
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,420
Will you give him such an assistant?

223
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,420
I don't think so

224
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,420
I don't think so

225
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,420
Well

226
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,420
As the saying goes

227
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,420
Why do we have to look for him?

228
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,420
He's not that handsome

229
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,420
And he's not that good

230
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,420
That's okay

231
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,420
Let's change him

232
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,420
Don't be sad

233
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,420
He doesn't know how bad he is

234
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,420
I want to be a good wife

235
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,420
Let's go eat

236
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,420
I'll pay

237
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,420
I'll go change

238
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
Boss, I've checked it

239
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,420
Only these few people in Wan Xing

240
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,420
Are qualified to compete for CEO

241
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,420
Cao Dong has been in Wan Xing for 30 years

242
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,420
He has the longest experience

243
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,420
He's too old

244
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
No matter his energy or physical strength

245
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,420
It's hard to make a fierce competition

246
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,420
Those shareholders won't choose him

247
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,420
Chen Hai is one of the board members of Wan Xing

248
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,420
In terms of experience and current prestige

249
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,420
Except for Wan Shan, he has the biggest winning chance

250
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
I've had contact with him before

251
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420
He's kind of a master of calculation

252
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,420
But he's too easy to see the wind and stone

253
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,420
If there's no absolute victory

254
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,420
He won't make a move

255
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,420
So in general

256
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,420
He's a stranger

257
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,420
The youngest vice president of Wan Xing

258
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,420
He's in charge of the economy

259
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,420
He's a lucky man like Wan Shan

260
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,420
But it's hard to say

261
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,420
He's a talent from Wan Shan

262
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,420
He may not be willing to stand out

263
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,420
As long as he's ambitious

264
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,420
I can be his best candidate

265
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,420
Help me make an appointment with the time and location

266
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,420
I want to meet him

267
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,420
Okay, boss

268
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,420
By the way, boss

269
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,420
This is the phone you asked me to find for you

270
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,420
It's broken

271
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,420
Can it still be used?

272
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,420
Go buy me a new phone

273
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,420
Give it to me before you get off work

274
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,420
Okay

275
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
I'll go to the office

276
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,420
Okay

277
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,420
Bye

278
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
Hello

279
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
Hello

280
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,420
I want you to help me repair a phone's data

281
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,420
It's the one you set yesterday

282
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,420
Okay

283
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,420
I did a little bit of what I did last night

284
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,420
Some little fish and little shrimp

285
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,420
Always like to wander around

286
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
They think it's food

287
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,420
Unconsciously

288
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,420
That's a trap for other people's food

289
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,420
So unintelligent

290
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,420
So ignorant

291
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,420
In this case

292
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,420
Shouldn't you teach them a lesson?

293
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,420
What about the little fish and little shrimp in the eyes of the boss?

294
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,420
Maybe

295
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,420
It will be the goldfish in someone else's pond

296
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,420
This kind of thing

297
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,420
I don't want it to happen again

298
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,420
There is a good saying

299
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,420
The wind is fast in the Goulai Courtyard

300
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,420
The star is under the Huaicheng stage

301
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,420
The star is under the Huaicheng stage

302
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,420
I don't know if Mr. Du has ever heard of it

303
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,420
Mr. Wan has time to give me a good time here

304
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,420
It's better to think about it

305
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,420
Your current situation

306
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,420
Excuse me

307
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,420
I am a master

308
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,420
Sit on me

309
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,420
Disgusting

310
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,420
Disgusting

311
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,420
Sorry, the number you dialed is power off

312
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,420
Sorry, the number you dialed is power off

313
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,420
Sorry

314
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,420
Sorry

315
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,420
Mr. Du

316
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,420
What are you doing here?

317
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,420
Where am I

318
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,420
What does it have to do with you

319
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
I warn you

320
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
Stay away from the general

321
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
Otherwise

322
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,420
Don't blame me for being polite to you

323
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,420
Are you a little bit

324
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,420
I am sorry

325
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,420
I am sorry

326
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
I am too concerned

327
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,420
I am worried that he will leak the company's secrets

328
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,420
Really

329
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,420
Interesting

330
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,420
This is really my first time to see you

331
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,420
Since I was a professor

332
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,420
So nervous

333
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,420
How can I

334
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,420
Be worried about this girl

335
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,420
I warn you not to play with me

336
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,420
I am so worried about her

337
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,420
I am really curious now

338
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,420
And especially looking forward to

339
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,420
When you see

340
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,420
When she is pregnant with another man

341
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,420
What will you react

342
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
You bastard

343
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,420
Yuan Shuai, what are you doing

344
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,420
What am I doing

345
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,420
I don't think she is a play

346
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,420
I am sorry

347
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,420
I am sorry

348
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,420
Mr. Du, are you ok

349
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,420
I am fine

350
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,420
I don't care if she is your rival

351
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,420
But now she is my friend

352
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,420
She is your friend

353
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,420
I tell you, general

354
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,420
This Du Lei

355
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,420
Is not a good person

356
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,420
You'd better stay away from her

357
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,420
Everyone has problems in your eyes

358
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,420
Whether it's me or her

359
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,420
Can't you find problems on your own

360
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,420
I have a problem

361
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,420
You take care of your own Yang Juan first

362
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,420
Just a wild wolf

363
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,420
You are so jealous of others

364
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,420
If something goes wrong in the end

365
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,420
You still need me to help you

366
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,420
You should know it

367
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,420
I have a problem

368
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
I am sorry

369
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,420
I am sorry

370
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,420
You are the only one who knows

371
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,420
I have a problem

372
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,420
Everyone has problems in your eyes

373
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,420
Whether it's me or her

374
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,420
Can't you find problems on your own

375
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,300
I'm sorry.

376
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,340
I'm a bit impulsive.

377
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,900
It's not your fault.

378
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,100
Why are you so modest?

379
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,700
But why is Mr. Lu here today?

380
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,220
The book you asked for was here.

381
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,580
You didn't answer my call.

382
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,220
So I had to send it to you.

383
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,340
Sorry to bother you.

384
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,660
My phone was smashed by a little muddle.

385
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,340
So...

386
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,060
A little muddle?

387
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,540
Then you should have sent it to me.

388
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,420
I'm sorry.

389
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,140
Are you okay?

390
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,100
I'm fine.

391
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,540
I just rubbed my face.

392
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,780
I didn't expect there would be

393
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,140
such a big crowd in this legal society.

394
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,380
That's because someone is behind it.

395
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,780
Did you offend someone

396
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,740
or do you have someone else's interests?

397
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,980
I didn't mean anything else.

398
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,860
I just want to tell you

399
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,140
that sometimes before we do something,

400
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,100
we should be a bit like a barbarian.

401
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,300
Only in this way

402
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,780
can we protect ourselves.

403
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,180
A barbarian?

404
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:53,980
Yes.

405
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,900
It's a senior experience.

406
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,820
Remember.

407
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,540
When you meet a

408
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,300
barbarian holding money,

409
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,700
you should be more barbarian than him.

410
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,300
I'm afraid I can't be more barbarian.

411
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,620
Is there any other way?

412
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,660
If you can't be more barbarian,

413
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,820
then find another person

414
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,020
to hold the money box.

415
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,340
But I'm just a little ant.

416
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,420
I can't move at all.

417
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,860
Indeed.

418
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,540
A little ant

419
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,020
can't move a stone

420
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,580
on the screen.

421
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,180
But if it's a black-tiped moth,

422
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,420
it might be a moth.

423
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,420
That's right.

424
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,140
When theischen so many headed men,

425
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,980
he had him killed also

426
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,220
and saved his life.

427
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,700
Doesn't he make them

428
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,060
not painful?

429
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:04,820
After.

430
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,780
Why are you there?

431
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,340
For the information of the business.

432
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,380
I was a little surprised.

433
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,340
It's okay.

434
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,380
Let me help you.

435
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,540
You're here alone?

436
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,420
You're a big boy.

437
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,820
What's wrong?

438
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,180
Although Wenshan is calm now,

439
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,620
the internal force must be in a mess.

440
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,260
I think it's a good time

441
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,700
to intervene in the area.

442
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,500
I understand.

443
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,620
Don't worry.

444
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,900
The current situation

445
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,100
is still under my control.

446
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,460
It seems that you're not the leader anymore.

447
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,460
You taught me

448
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,300
the way to achieve the goal.

449
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,700
I thought you would help General.

450
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,900
But now it seems

451
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,340
that he is just a pawn for you.

452
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,220
I want to see

453
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,500
what his expression will be

454
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,500
when he knows that you are using him.

455
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,700
Just a pawn?

456
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,580
What's your concern about his expression?

457
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,580
Besides,

458
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,580
he has become

459
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,460
the dagger I want to insert into the other person's heart.

460
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,900
Really?

461
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,580
Then you have to be careful.

462
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,220
Don't let that dagger

463
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,580
stab yourself.

464
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,500
I understand.

465
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,780
I'm leaving.

466
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,220
The plan is successful.

467
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,580
See you tomorrow.

468
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,260
From the beginning,

469
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,980
you have to tell me

470
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,180
where he went and who he met.

471
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,500
Wait for me.

472
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,620
Wait.

473
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,140
General, this way.

474
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,580
Thank you.

475
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,620
I'll wait for the next one.

476
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:26,980
Boss,

477
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,980
you two are cold-hearted again.

478
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,220
Be careful of the instrument.

479
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,380
If you catch up with the instrument, you will be in trouble.

480
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,300
Even if I don't make it to the funeral byט

481
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,460
What a joke.

482
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,940
It's too painful.

483
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,700
President Yuan,

484
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,260
I'm replacing you now with I make an Doc of the Rose varieties

485
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,500
You should immediately accept me

486
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,580
and wait.

487
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,740
I'm notchant by you at all.

488
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,380
You are not working well, right?

489
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,380
Re-reboot all the data.

490
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,380
You have to add me to the office in five minutes.

491
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,380
It's delicious.

492
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,380
Really?

493
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,380
I ordered it for a long time.

494
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,380
I want to taste it.

495
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,380
Boss, I bought macarons for General.

496
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,380
Try it.

497
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,380
You are so fat.

498
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,380
Boss, you don't mind, right?

499
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,380
Yes.

500
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,380
You can eat it.

501
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,380
It's delicious.

502
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,380
Boss, this is general Luo.

503
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,380
General Luo, hello.

504
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,380
Hello, I am Luo Sheng.

505
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,380
General Yuan.

506
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,380
This way, please.

507
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,260
Sorry.

508
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,860
I forgot the time for the dance practice.

509
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,820
Sorry to keep you waiting.

510
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,620
It's okay.

511
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,820
What's wrong with your wrist?

512
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,340
It's okay.

513
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,540
I twisted it.

514
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,500
I fixed it.

515
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,740
Why did you do that?

516
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,540
I started to learn dancing at the age of four.

517
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,340
I can overcome

518
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,380
all kinds of hardships,

519
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,980
because my dream

520
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,780
is to let everyone

521
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,500
see my brilliance

522
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,620
on the stage.

523
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,540
Although I don't have a good background

524
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,060
or good luck,

525
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,100
I'll try my best

526
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,060
to make my professional skills

527
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,180
unchangeable.

528
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,220
But why can only one person

529
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,580
easily control

530
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,940
my efforts for more than ten years?

531
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,180
That's my lifelong dream.

532
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,020
But it's a dirty deal in his eyes.

533
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,580
I think

534
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,980
I should say sorry to you.

535
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,460
Before I could see his face,

536
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,900
I doubted you.

537
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,660
But now I find

538
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,420
you're so despicable.

539
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,460
It's okay.

540
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,060
Thank you for choosing

541
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,500
to believe me again.

542
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,900
Miss Jiang,

543
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,740
what's the matter?

544
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,020
I came to tell you

545
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,140
that you should be careful

546
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,340
when you go out.

547
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,500
Not long after we met,

548
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,260
Wan Shan sent people to follow me.

549
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,860
My phone was smashed.

550
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,380
What about us?

551
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,860
At this time,

552
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,380
the more they try to hide the evil

553
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,820
in the dark,

554
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,100
the more we want to

555
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,540
expose the truth to the sun

556
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,140
and make them hide nowhere.

557
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,220
So you must learn

558
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,060
to protect yourself with legal weapons.

559
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,740
This is a friend

560
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,780
I've known for a long time.

561
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,740
He has a lot of experience

562
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,340
in this kind of case.

563
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,940
I believe he can help you.

564
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,140
I haven't been listed

565
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,500
in the IPO for a few days.

566
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,940
Where can I find

567
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,700
someone who can help me?

568
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,220
Who can help me

569
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,460
to push the giant down the cliff?

570
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,740
General,

571
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,820
even if you don't eat,

572
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,540
drink or sleep this week,

573
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,500
you can't do it.

574
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,020
If you can't report it on time,

575
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,460
the next brother

576
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,060
will definitely punish you more.

577
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,820
Why don't you bow your head?

578
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,540
Didn't you torture him enough when you were a kid?

579
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,340
He's your boss now.

580
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,620
If he wants to torture you,

581
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,500
there are hundreds of ways

582
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,540
that he won't do it again.

583
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,660
I'm so hard.

584
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,260
I can't.

585
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,420
I need to take a shower and wake up.

586
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,140
What's going on?

587
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,900
What's going on?

588
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,340
Brother.

589
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,940
Brother.

590
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,340
Welcome to the Longting Community

591
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,380

Sorry.

598
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,660
The service you chose

599
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,780

What's your number?

603
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,700
Damn community.

604
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,460
Welcome to the Longting Community

605
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,500
property service call.

607
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,620
Hello.

608
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,060
Longting Community Property.

609
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,260
Hello.

610
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,140
I want to ask

611
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,580
if I can charge the water fee now?

612
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,220
Sorry.

613
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:49,940
It's too late now.

614
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,220
The person in charge of the water fee

615
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,100
has already left work.

616
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,780
Would you like to come over tomorrow?

617
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,300
Tomorrow?

618
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,140
No.

619
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,980
I'm in a bit of a hurry now.

620
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,820
Could you please let me know?

621
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,500
I'm really sorry, Miss.

622
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,940
We have already left work.

623
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,220
Okay.

624
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,300
What time will you be at work tomorrow?

625
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,100
I'm sorry, Miss.

626
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,300
We have a rest

627
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,900
on Saturday and Sunday.

628
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,100
Rest?

629
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:14,980
No.

630
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,500
What about the people

631
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,940
in our working group?

632
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,500
Generally speaking,

633
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,380
the people living in our community

634
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,820
will be given

635
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,500
a one-year or two-year water fee.

636
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,620
So...

637
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:26,820
Okay.

638
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,780
I got it.

639
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,900
Thank you.

640
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,100
I'm afraid Niannian will have a lot this year.

641
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,020
The annual fee is great.

642
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,660
There's no water here.

643
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,340
I don't believe it.

644
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,180
There must be water in the refrigerator.

645
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,860
I'm thinking too much.

646
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,060
Water!

647
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,060
A husband can't be too hard on his wife.

648
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,060
I'm just a housewife.

649
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,860
Help me adjust the meeting

650
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,060
for tomorrow afternoon.

651
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,660
I'm going out with Mr. Fan.

652
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,180
I might be back later.

653
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,620
Can you be sure

654
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,740
when you'll be back?

655
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,860
I'm not sure.

656
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,500
Let's set it to 3 o'clock first.

657
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,900
Coming.

658
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,620
Coming.

659
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,780
Jiang Hu, you're so impatient.

660
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,420
You're so impatient.

661
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,380
Give me a bottle of water.

662
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,260
I'm going to use the water

663
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,460
to wash the dishes.

664
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,340
Damn it.

665
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,220
Boss.

666
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,980
You're so annoying.

667
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,940
Why don't you talk?

668
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,540
Are you going to take the fee?

669
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,220
Over there.

670
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,660
Thank you.

671
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,020
Thank you.

672
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,580
It means your relationship is going well.

673
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,620
You're happy to wash.

674
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,380
It means your family is in good condition.

675
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,740
You're happy to wash.

676
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,060
That's it.

677
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,140
If I've been too busy recently,

678
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,980
I'll be a burden.

679
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,020
Jiang Jun.

680
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,220
Jiang Jun.

681
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,060
What's wrong?

682
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,860
What's that sound?

683
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,060
What's wrong?

684
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:34,900
What's wrong?

685
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,460
Look.

686
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,140
The dog ran in.

687
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,580
My glasses are all dirty.

688
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,500
I'll go and get them.

689
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,220
I...

690
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,140
I'm not convenient.

691
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,820
I just washed my clothes.

692
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,700
Hurry up.

693
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,740
Hurry up.

694
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,940
Okay.

695
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,660
Hurry up.

696
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,380
Be good.

697
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,260
Come here.

698
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,700
I told you to come out.

699
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,380
Come out.

700
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,340
Come out.

701
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,020
What's wrong?

702
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,660
What's wrong?

703
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,100
Where are you?

704
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,620
Where are you?

705
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,020
Hurry up.

706
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,820
I'll wash my clothes first.

707
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,540
Hurry up.

708
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,660
I didn't mean to do that.

709
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,860
You did.

710
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,540
I definitely didn't mean to...

711
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,180
Definitely.

712
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,540
You did it on purpose.

713
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:28,740
Okay.

714
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,180
I did it on purpose.

715
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,900
Mo Lan.

716
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,580
Where's the toilet?

717
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,220
Here.

718
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,340
Here.

719
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,060
Here.

720
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,820
Here.

721
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,580
Why are you looking at me?

722
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,180
Do you want me to look at you?

723
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,060
Put it on.

724
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:49,860
No.

725
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,900
It's too tired.

726
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,500
I'm usually the most familiar with it.

727
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,100
If you keep looking at me,

728
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,540
I'll dig out your eyes.

729
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,380
Do you think I'm willing to look at you?

730
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,060
Why are you so narcissistic?

731
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,180
I'm looking at the front.

732
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,180
Why do you think I'm looking at you?

733
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,340
Say it yourself.

734
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,140
This...

735
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,420
Is this my phone?

736
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,780
You really found it?

737
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,460
I can't take a picture of it.

738
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,060
I've already found someone to fix it.

739
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,860
Wan Shan?

740
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,700
Vice President of Wan Xin?

741
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,740
Do you want him to stand out

742
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,940
and replace Wan Shan?

743
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,140
You also think Wan Shan has a problem,

744
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:35,940
right?

745
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,540
Why did you scold me back then?

746
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,780
Because you were too reckless.

747
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,740
When you couldn't find a solution,

748
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,500
you always wanted to spread justice

749
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,580
and put yourself in such a dangerous situation.

750
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,100
If I didn't scold you, who would you scold?

751
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,420
Yes.

752
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,340
I think you're right.

753
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,940
I'm the type of person who should be scolded.

754
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,500
So,

755
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,420
what's the situation now?

756
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,940
Now,

757
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,740
Luo Zheng has agreed to work with me.

758
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,700
But the most important thing

759
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,540
is the data in your phone.

760
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,060
I've already found someone to fix it.

761
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,260
But it's very difficult.

762
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,700
So, the best way is for Tang Xin

763
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,140
to stand out on her own.

764
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,420
Don't worry about Tang Xin.

765
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,380
I just met her today.

766
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,660
She's ready to stand out

767
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,700
and fight against Wan Shan.

768
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:19,700
Do you think

769
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,300
you've been taught enough?

770
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,580
Should I praise you?

771
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,940
I should praise you for your courage

772
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,300
and your courage to go through all the hardships?

773
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,420
Didn't you...

774
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,540
Didn't you think

775
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,460
you were fighting alone before?

776
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,380
I didn't expect you to help me.

777
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,740
From now on,

778
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,700
we're like a team.

779
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,980
I'll definitely

780
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,580
do whatever you want.

781
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,700
Here.

782
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,540
This one is heavier.

783
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,580
Okay.

784
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,580
We're in the same league, right?

785
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,300
Help me blow the net.

786
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,940
Net?

787
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,260
He's also called a net?

788
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,860
So,

789
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,260
my dog can't be called a net?

790
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,740
Does a dog have a special name?

791
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,780
I think net sounds good.

792
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,740
I'm going to call it a net.

793
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,540
What's wrong?

794
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,580
Nothing.

795
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,620
I can't do it.

796
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,580
Why are you nervous?

797
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,100
I'm not nervous.

798
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,380
I'm not nervous.

799
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,820
I'm not nervous.

800
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,180
Go.

801
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,300
Blow it dry.

802
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,140
Yes. I'm going.

803
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,740
You're getting cold.

804
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,300
I'm going to be someone

805
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,020
I only want to know

806
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:44,820
Then you'll be staying every day of my life

807
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,060
I will run away

808
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,380
If it's what you want

809
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,660
What you like

810
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,980
I don't mind

811
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,780
I can close my eyes

812
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,300
I can stay behind

813
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,220
Waste my time

814
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,300
Walk into your plan

815
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:32,100
Like I never knew you were not mine

816
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,340
Make you satisfied

817
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,020
Wear another mask

818
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:45,860
You never realize things I do for love

819
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,460
I think I'm tired

820
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,220
I think I'm blind

821
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,060
Don't know how to feel

822
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,980
Don't know how to heal

823
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,820
You walk so fast

824
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,500
Can't catch your light

825
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,020
You fly so high

826
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,180
Leave all the things behind

827
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,580
And our story

828
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:26,260
Leave all of nowhere to find

829
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,460
I think I'm tired

830
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,220
I think I'm blind

831
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:37,140
Don't know how to feel

832
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,140
Don't know how to heal

833
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,060
You walk so fast

834
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,660
Can't catch your light

835
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,180
You fly so high

836
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,340
Leave all the things behind

837
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,660
And our story

838
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:06,580
Leave all of nowhere to find
