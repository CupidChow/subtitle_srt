1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
Yogurt

2
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,360
Ya Sylvia

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Bye!

4
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:15,440
Adrian's

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't think so.

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why?

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Why?

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Think about it.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's not your birthday.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's Wang Cai's birthday.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Think again.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
0905...

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
0905...

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's the day we meet again.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
0905...

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Where's Jiang Jun?

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He's off today.

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He's off?

19
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're off?

20
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Are you okay?

21
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hello?

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yuan Shuai, something happened!

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Dapeng Capital is buying my company!

24
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay, I got it. I'll be right there.

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Lu Chuan.

26
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I have a file called CX on my computer.

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There are some investors who have an interest in Chen Xing Technology.

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Contact these investors right away.

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If they have any interest in Chen Xing Technology,

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
contact them.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll be right there.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If they have any interest in Chen Xing Technology,

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
ask them to come to the meeting tomorrow.

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay, boss.

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Thank you, sir.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Do you need to pick up my wife?

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you need to pick up my wife?

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Here?

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Are you going to make money for Li Xiao Chuan

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and sell me out?

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How is that possible? I can sell myself out.

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can't bear to sell you out.

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What's going on with Sheng Xia and Lao Lei?

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't know either.

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I didn't ask Li Xiao Chuan

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
if he wanted me to hand over my phone to him.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's here.

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's here.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Is he here?

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay, okay.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Good morning.

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I was afraid you wouldn't be able to find me.

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Mr. Du, why are you here?

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Mr. Du?

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This is the legendary Mr. Du?

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hello, I'm Shi Li.

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Hello.

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you for investing in our family's western world.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Investing?

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Mr. Du helped you with the project evaluation.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
How did you become an investor?

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
After I saw Xiao Chuan's project,

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I thought it was pretty good.

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I happen to have some free time, so I invested.

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
With Mr. Du's great help,

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
your family will be in a big trouble.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Who do you think you are?

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Do me a favor.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Here.

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Give it to the girls.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay.

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Thank you.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Mr. Du.

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Xiao Chuan.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So the party you arranged is...

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There's a really good place

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
to rest on this mountain.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's perfect for camping.

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I brought barbecue and food.

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We can grill meat and have a big fire tonight.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's such a cold day.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Are you sure you want us to barbecue?

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes.

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We do this in other countries.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's fun.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's go.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
camping.

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Wild food.

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
BBQ.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
BBQ.

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Thank you.

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Found it.

98
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Thank you.

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We're here.

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We're finally here.

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We've worked so hard

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
for the last year.

103
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You two can have a rest.

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll go help Xiao Chuan.

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
No, Mr. Du.

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You're our guest today.

107
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll go with Xiao Chuan.

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You and Ju Jun can have a good rest.

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Du.

110
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I think you're a bad guy.

111
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No, I think it's good.

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I stayed at home for a while.

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm a little tired.

114
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I need some fresh air.

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Let's go.

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
One, two, three.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let's go.

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's go.

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Xiao Chuan.

120
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is the sixth time

121
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
you've been on the barbecue.

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Can you do it?

123
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You've been on this kind of activity before.

124
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes.

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But I'm not in charge of the barbecue.

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What are you in charge of?

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm in charge of the tent

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and the mountaineering guide.

129
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's so hard.

130
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Why is it so hard?

131
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's so hard.

132
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You guys can go back to work.

133
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll be back.

134
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay.

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Jun, I think

136
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Mr. Du is a good choice.

137
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You won't mind if I say it, right?

138
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What?

139
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Xiao Chuan is always

140
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
the first man in my heart.

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I just think Mr. Du

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
is like the man in the comics.

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He's gentle, gentle, and considerate.

144
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The point is he can also grill meat.

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
If anyone marries him,

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
it's a blessing in the past life.

147
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm not going to eat it today.

148
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You can't even stop eating.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm going to burn it.

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll go pick firewood.

151
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm going too.

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm going too.

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Xiao Chuan,

154
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
can I

155
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
ask you a question?

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Sure.

157
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Your brother said you've never been in a relationship.

158
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Is that true?

159
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I can tell you.

160
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Because I believe you.

161
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But you can't tell anyone.

162
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I promise. I swear I won't tell anyone.

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
How many times?

164
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Once a year?

165
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What does that mean?

166
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I've been in a relationship once.

167
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Once?

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Once is a loss.

169
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Oh my god.

170
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It looks like

171
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
you've been hurt by love.

172
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What kind of girl

173
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
can make Xiao Chuan so sad?

174
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm so jealous.

175
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Xiao Chuan, I'm sorry.

176
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Did I mention something sad?

177
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I...

178
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I have tissue.

179
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Xiao Chuan,

180
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
it's okay.

181
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Why are you so blind?

183
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yuan Shuai.

184
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Dr. Zhu. Yuan Shuai,

185
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
we just got the news that DeFeng Capital has started

186
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
a debt transfer. This way, we'll get 20% of Chen Xi's shares.

187
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If this goes on,

188
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
we'll be doomed.

189
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Calm down.

190
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
We don't know who's going to win.

191
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
A year ago,

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
you asked me to send a loan to someone else.

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And you even asked me to stick to it.

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I trusted you so much.

195
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So this time, you have to help me.

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Don't worry, Dr. Zhu.

197
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You just focus on your new system development.

198
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Leave the rest to me.

199
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Okay.

200
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This time, please.

201
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This way, please.

202
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Mr. Zhang.

203
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Mr. Zhang.

204
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Sit.

205
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Mr. Zhang.

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Two cups of coffee.

207
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Thank you.

208
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What?

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You're going to ask Mr. Yuan of MH

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
to come and see me personally?

211
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
For you, Mr. Zhang,

212
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
it's a small purchase.

213
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But for Chen Xin,

214
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
it's a life-and-death matter.

215
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm going to come to save her life.

216
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Mr. Yuan,

217
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
did you read too many martial arts novels

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and come to the capital market?

219
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Don't forget,

220
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
you're just a small

221
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
salesman.

222
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Mr. Zhang,

223
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
whether he's a salesman or not,

224
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
we're all working for him.

225
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Chen Xin's debt has expired.

227
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
She can't get the money

228
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
to pay off the debt.

229
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
We're only exchanging shares for the sake of the country.

230
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
There's nothing

231
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
you can say about the rules.

232
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The rules?

233
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Mr. Zhang,

234
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
we have a year's period

235
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
to pay off the debt.

236
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You're going to pay off the debt

237
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and take over the shares.

238
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You're trying to get Chen Xin's control.

239
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's right.

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The board is angry.

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The technical staff was suppressed.

242
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The internet is on fire.

243
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's a disaster.

244
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Well,

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
it's really hard.

246
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Otherwise,

247
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll give you an idea.

248
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll buy off your system

249
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
for a hundred million on behalf of DeFeng Capital.

250
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What kind of joke is that?

251
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
If you agree,

252
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
we'll give up the acquisition of Chen Xin.

253
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm a financing agent,

254
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
not a salesman.

255
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You don't have money to do anything.

256
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Once the same system appears in the market,

257
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
your system value will be down.

258
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
After all, the financial power of the technology giant

259
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
is much stronger than you.

260
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
As expected,

262
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
you're not in the stock market.

263
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Dr. Zhu,

264
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
have you seen it?

265
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Your system is very valuable.

266
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
One hundred million

267
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
is a little bit new to you.

268
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes.

269
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Hello.

270
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There'll be six representatives of the investors

271
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
who'll come to the company every Wednesday 12 noon.

272
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I see.

273
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Alright.

274
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The meeting is over.

275
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What do you mean?

276
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Nothing.

277
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Mr. Zhang,

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
drink the three cups coffee slowly.

279
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,600
You don't have to sleep at night.

280
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,280
He... left.

281
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
I'm sorry.

282
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,360
Yuan Shuai.

283
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,400
Yuan Shuai.

284
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
Why did you leave?

285
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,360
Do you have a way out?

286
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,440
Tell me honestly.

287
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,840
Did you know that

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,560
they would force you to sell the patent?

289
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,960
Actually, they had already found me before.

290
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,560
But I rejected them directly.

291
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
You know that

292
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,160
the sales are not good this year.

293
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,640
I didn't know that I would be in the foreign market.

294
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,320
So I didn't tell you.

295
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,400
Dr. Zhu. Dr. Zhu.

296
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,520
They are just being lazy and making a fortune.

297
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,240
You are just being lazy and losing money.

298
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,160
I know you for a year.

299
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,160
When can you

300
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,360
have the right to be the main person of the company?

301
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,440
I have a job.

302
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,480
Besides,

303
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,520
I asked you to be the manager.

304
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,800
But you rejected it too.

305
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,120
Let's go.

306
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,280
Where are we going?

307
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,200
I will go to your company to train you.

308
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,000
I will teach you how to make chicken soup for a day.

309
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,600
You are touched that I found you a receptionist.

310
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
No way.

311
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,240
We are going to have a speech again.

312
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,920
I don't want it.

313
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,600
You still want to have a speech.

314
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,320
Let's go.

315
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,640
Boss.

316
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,280
You... you know that

317
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,560
I can't speak

318
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,840
as a director.

319
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,040
Drink less coffee.

320
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,120
Thank you.

321
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,040
Actually, the western world...

322
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,000
Actually, I think the western world is good.

323
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,320
But Xiaochun's thinking logic

324
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,840
is not good enough.

325
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,120
You know you are a big shot.

326
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,640
It's just luck.

327
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,680
At least his skills are good.

328
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,320
He might be surprised.

329
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,760
Don't worry, I will help him.

330
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,840
That's good.

331
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,960
Little doggy.

332
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,120
Little doggy.

333
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,640
Why are you here?

334
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,480
Come here.

335
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,960
Little doggy.

336
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,000
Mr. Du, little doggy.

337
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,640
Come here.

338
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,880
You... you don't like dogs?

339
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,760
I liked them when I was a kid.

340
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,480
Go ahead.

341
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,920
Did something happen?

342
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,840
I want to share a little secret with you.

343
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,000
I...

344
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,160
Actually, when I was a kid,

345
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
I had a dog.

346
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,760
At that time, I had no friends

347
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,360
and no family.

348
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,120
Only he was with me.

349
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,000
Until I was twelve years old,

350
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,760
my son, Du Jia, and I

351
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,000
were in the same year.

352
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,400
So they adopted me.

353
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,960
Actually, I was quite happy at first.

354
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,760
So I took him to the Du family.

355
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,480
But they thought he was dirty.

356
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,160
So they threw him out.

357
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,720
When I found him,

358
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,000
he was frozen to death.

359
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,640
It's a pity.

360
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,880
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,560
It reminds you of something unhappy.

362
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,080
No.

363
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,880
After I said it,

364
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,880
I feel relieved.

365
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,680
You have to keep it a secret.

366
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,120
Otherwise, I will kill you.

367
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,960
I know.

368
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,480
I will keep it a secret.

369
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,160
But I think

370
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,960
you should tell your friends

371
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,480
your worries and regrets.

372
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,440
If you tell them,

373
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,040
the pressure will be released.

374
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,080
Then you will feel relieved.

375
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,240
It sounds like

376
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,200
you have worries and regrets too.

377
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,400
No one can have

378
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,200
worries and regrets in life.

379
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,840
No.

380
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,400
No.

381
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,760
I just shared a little secret with you.

382
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,960
To be fair,

383
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,960
should you give me one back?

384
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,680
My biggest regret

385
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,440
is that before my dad passed away,

386
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,160
I didn't have the chance to see him one last time.

387
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,760
When my dad formed

388
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,040
the Thousand Silver Lines,

389
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,600
he was caught forsamaizing,

390
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,640
he was busy with his company's old business,

391
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,480
hardly performing clean because of that.

392
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,200
Later,

393
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,280
he died after an old Moo indeed took place.

394
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,960
I was coming from the school.

395
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,160
What is your dad's company called?

396
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,120
F goal.

397
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,720
What?

398
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
What's wrong?

399
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
I'm sorry, I have to go now.

400
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
I'm sorry, I have to go now.

401
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
I'm sorry, I have to go now.

402
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Hello, the number you dialed is power off.

403
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,720
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is power off.

404
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
Hello, the subscriber you dialed is power off.

405
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
What's wrong with you?

406
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
You haven't seen me for a whole day.

407
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Sister, let's charge the phone.

408
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
I think I have no power left on my phone.

409
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Okay.

410
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
The first time I see you in the West Lake.

411
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Oh, yeah.

412
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
Why is Du Lei here?

413
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Li Xiaochuan.

414
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,720
Mr. Hua, you're so funny.

415
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
I'm not funny.

416
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Hello, brother.

417
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Li Xiaochuan.

418
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,720
I'll give you 30 minutes.

419
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Come to my house right now.

420
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Or I'll make that video public.

421
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Let everyone see.

422
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
A person who wants to engage in marriage software.

423
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
How much his feelings fail.

424
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
He is a person who is more embarrassed.

425
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
Wait, wait.

426
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
That.

427
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
My brother called me back now.

428
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
Now?

429
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Then you just said you were working overtime.

430
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
Although Yuan Shuai is your brother.

431
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,720
But you can't listen to him.

432
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
My brother called me back now.

433
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
But we haven't started eating yet.

434
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
The tent is already set up.

435
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
It's okay.

436
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,720
If you have something to do, go back first.

437
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Next time we are ready to meet you.

438
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
The more time, the more opportunities.

439
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Let's go.

440
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Let's go.

441
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

442
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Yuan Shuai is really.

443
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,720
In fact, he came back to you without saying anything.

444
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,720
No matter what, it's right to come back quickly.

445
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
Is he in any emergency?

446
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,720
No way.

447
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
I'll send you back first.

448
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Wait, wait, wait.

449
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
You are still at home.

450
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
I will go in quickly.

451
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
Go.

452
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Help.

453
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Brother.

454
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
What's so angry?

455
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,720
What's going on with the camping?

456
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
I haven't told you yet.

457
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,720
The western world has found investors.

458
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,720
So this should be our company's first group meeting.

459
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,720
Then why is Du Li there?

460
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Because he is the founder of our western world.

461
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,720
He is the founder of our western world.

462
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
He is the founder of our western world.

463
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Because he is the founder of our western world.

464
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Did Jiang Jun recommend you to know Du Lei?

465
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,720
And I've been observing recently.

466
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
Did he ask you to do it?

467
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
I've been observing recently.

468
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,720
I found that Jiang Jun and Mr. Du have a higher product evaluation than you.

469
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
I have already got my first investment.

470
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,720
So I will be very busy recently.

471
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
Don't be like this.

472
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,720
I will be here when you need me.

473
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Li Xiaochuan.

474
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Have you forgotten that you have a trick with me?

475
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,720
A trick that can prove that your western world is a joke.

476
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,720
You used to like other girls.

477
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,720
You used your love method to calculate.

478
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
You thought that other girls were your match.

479
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,720
But in the end, they got married anyway.

480
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Your first love failed.

481
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,720
You cried for three days and nights at home.

482
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,720
I know. I know.

483
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,720
But where did you fall from? Where did you stand up?

484
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
And that was the old way of calculating.

485
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
Now there won't be this kind of problem.

486
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
I'm so angry.

487
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
I think you are very strange.

488
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Mr. Du invested me.

489
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,720
Why are you so angry?

490
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Are you really angry?

491
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,720
I'm afraid that you will be cheated.

492
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Why am I angry?

493
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
I know why you are angry.

494
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Don't talk nonsense.

495
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
It must be because...

496
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
Don't guess.

497
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,720
You are jealous of Mr. Du and General.

498
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
I'm not.

499
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
They are...

500
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
I'm warning you. Stop talking.

501
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,720
You have a better taste in my project.

502
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
Right?

503
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
How is it?

504
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
It's too late.

505
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
I will prove to you sooner or later that...

506
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,720
the Western World is a top project.

507
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
You brat.

508
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
I will kill you.

509
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,720
My biggest regret is that before my father passed away...

510
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
I didn't have time to see him one last time.

511
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
My father had a thousand-m long line of business.

512
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
He was bought by a bad company.

513
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
He was busy with his company.

514
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
He didn't have a job for days.

515
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,720
Then he died suddenly.

516
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
What's your father's company called?

517
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
Jiangnan Flavor.

518
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,720
Jiangnan Flavor

519
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
Do you want to go in?

520
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,720
This world is a battlefield.

521
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,720
Life or death, it's normal to lose or win.

522
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,720
And it's him who makes him feel guilty.

523
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
He is not you.

524
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
Don't blame yourself.

525
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
I'm going to bed.

526
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Dad, I'm back.

527
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
What's the matter?

528
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,720
If there's nothing else, I'm going back to my room.

529
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
Wait.

530
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
I heard that Du Li resigned.

531
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
Is that true?

532
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
When did he resign?

533
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
With whom?

534
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
I don't know anything.

535
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,720
If it wasn't for the memory client's complaint,

536
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,720
Linda, when are you going to hide it from me?

537
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

538
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,720
He was just impulsive.

539
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Impulsive?

540
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
He was trying to piss me off.

541
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
No, dad.

542
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Don't be angry.

543
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,720
He was hit by a case last time.

544
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
He couldn't hang on to the face.

545
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,720
So he didn't come to the exhibition.

546
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,720
So he resigned.

547
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Linda, you can do it now.

548
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
You can make up a good reason for him.

549
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,720
You two are really close.

550
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
But did he think for you?

551
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,720
He threw a bunch of rotten plates at you.

552
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,720
Can you handle it?

553
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,720
Did he really care about you?

554
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
You're still protecting him here.

555
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,720
He didn't throw rotten plates at me.

556
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Resignation is just a change of character.

557
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
Dad, don't be angry.

558
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
I'll persuade him to come back to you.

559
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
No need.

560
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,720
I'm sorry.

561
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,720
Are you the brother my dad said he would bring back?

562
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
I'm Du Ling.

563
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,720
I'll be your sister from now on.

564
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,720
He took my dog away.

565
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
Will he kill me?

566
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
Will he die?

567
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
I don't know.

568
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,720
I don't know.

569
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
I didn't protect him well.

570
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
If you are strong, you will survive.

571
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
This is what dad told me.

572
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
If you don't want to be bullied,

573
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,720
then grow up quickly.

574
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Make yourself strong.

575
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
This is how you can protect others.

576
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Get up.

577
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
You don't understand yet.

578
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,720
I will teach you gradually.

579
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
I will always be with you.

580
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Really?

581
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Yes.

582
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
I'm sorry.

583
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,720
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

584
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
Hello.

585
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
Mr. Yuan, this...

586
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,720
Is he...

587
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,720
Is he ignoring me?

588
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,720
Is he really angry because of yesterday?

589
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,720
Mr. Yuan, yesterday, you were in such a hurry to ask Xiao Chuan to go back.

590
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Xiao Chuan is bothering you again.

591
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
I heard that you have established a new company.

592
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
How is it?

593
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
Are you happy with the team building?

594
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Indeed, I am jealous that Mr. Du invested in Xiao Chuan.

595
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,720
Why are you laughing?

596
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,720
Nothing.

597
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Here.

598
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
I made a coffee for you.

599
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
It's very delicious.

600
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Thank you.

601
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
Thank you.

602
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Thank you.

603
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Thank you.

604
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
This is a special coffee.

605
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,720
I don't know coffee can be special.

606
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
I don't want to drink it.

607
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Mr. Yuan, did you buy new clothes?

608
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
This is really nice.

609
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,720
It matches your graceful and luxurious temperament.

610
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
It's very natural.

611
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
Stop making fun of me.

612
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
I'm not making fun of you.

613
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,720
I'm just telling the truth.

614
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
Are you bored?

615
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,720
You don't have enough work, right?

616
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,720
Okay.

617
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,720
Then you can put all the relevant information about Cheng Xin Technology on my desk in five minutes.

618
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,720
There are four minutes and fifty seconds left.

619
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,720
I'm done.

620
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,720
And I've been going to the information room every day to read your previous case.

621
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,720
I found that you have much better taste than those people.

622
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,720
No wonder the thousands of people who have surrendered to the bank have become your enemies.

623
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
You are really a real person.

624
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,720
Enough.

625
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
I said that this MH can't tolerate you.

626
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,720
Should I find you a voice training class?

627
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
That's right.

628
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Don't be angry.

629
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,720
It's so beautiful when you smile.

630
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
Really?

631
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,720
You...

632
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,720
Hello?

633
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,720
President Yun.

634
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,720
The project group is having a dinner party tonight.

635
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Mr. Qiao wants me to accompany you.

636
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Oh, I got it.

637
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,560
Are you out of your mind?

638
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,080
Why are you laughing?

639
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,400
Why do you like it?

640
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,860
Somebody just said that I here look good when I laugh.

641
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,420
You are服 Grö enormously?

642
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,760
Yeah, I'm broke!

643
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,520
Give me a shot!

644
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,000
Is that your chance to stop faking?

645
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,440
Chicago.

646
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,640
I'll do somethingbridicand I did it on purpose.

647
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,640
How did it go?

648
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,760
What else was my 35th anniversary exciting?

649
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,920
So I've skipped those 2 post-match mores.

650
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,200
There was a Air India beauty contest.

651
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,520
That's what my friend told me,

652
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,560
by the way,

653
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,320
I was seriously excited about it!

654
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,000
Come on, woman!

655
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Thank you, Mr. Qiao.

656
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Do you remember this restaurant?

657
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Two years ago, we had a deal here.

658
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
We had four deals.

659
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Thank you for being my drinker.

660
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I remember Mr. Ma was there.

661
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You were drunk.

662
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I carried you home.

663
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Mr. Yuan, can we start eating?

664
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Yes, please.

665
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Cheers.

666
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
He's still defending you.

667
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
He's even taking you home.

668
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
He's not my friend!

669
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
He's so rude.

670
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
You think you're a baby?

671
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You're so annoying.

672
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
You're making a mess.

673
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Dear Ms. Juno,

674
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Xiaoxi has recommended you to get a 100% CP.

675
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It will help you get closer.

676
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Is Alian a good player?

677
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Not yet.

678
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
What's the matter?

679
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I have a question for you.

680
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Good.

681
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
What?

682
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
You're having a relationship problem?

683
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
A man is always nice to you.

684
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
When you're touched,

685
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
you realize he's nice to other women.

686
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What do you mean?

687
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Women are the same.

688
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
They seduce men in the first second.

689
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Then they get into a fight with other men.

690
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Have you ever seen this before?

691
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Why are they so hard to get?

692
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
That's too much.

693
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Yes, they're always afraid.

694
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Maybe we have a crush on them.

695
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
A crush on them?

696
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Who?

697
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I don't like them.

698
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'm sorry.

699
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Is this a painting?

700
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I'm gonna be happy and strong enough to love

701
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'm gonna be someone I only wanna know

702
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Then you'll be staying every day of my life

703
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Brother, have you finished painting it?

704
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yes.

705
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Wow.

706
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Are you okay? Did you have a nightmare?

707
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Of course not.

708
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I have good news.

709
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I found the master of the magic room.

710
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Really? Who?

711
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Of course it's me. I made it up.

712
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Oh, right.

713
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Can you talk to him?

714
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
What did he say to you?

715
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
He said, I'm the master of the magic room.

716
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
What about me?

717
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
It's okay. You can come to me when you wake up.

718
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I'm sorry.

719
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I'm sorry.

720
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I can't catch your light

721
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You fly so high

722
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Leave all the things behind

723
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And our story

724
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Leave all love nowhere to find

725
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I think I'm tight

726
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I think I'm blind

727
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Don't know how to feel

728
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Don't know how to heal

729
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You walk so fast

730
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Can't catch your light

731
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
You fly so high

732
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Leave all the things behind

733
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And our story

734
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Leave all love nowhere to find

735
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I think I'm tight
