It’s not that she doesn’t trust you.

00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,660
For all these years,


498
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,500
this place hasn’t changed a bit.


499
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,260
Listen!


500
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,220
You’d better behave well


501
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,780
when you see my mom later.


502
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,260
Just rest assured!


503
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,500
I’ve laid a good foundation when I was little.


504
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,060
You know what?


505
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,340
With my


506
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,340
handsome look


507
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,420
and my charisma,


508
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,860
your mom will like me very much


509
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,460
when she sees me!


510
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,300
Hopefully!


511
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,020
Mom!


512
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,660
Happy New Year!


513
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,460
Happy New Year!


514
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,500
Jun!


515
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,580
You are back!


516
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,260
Let me take a look! Did you lose weight?


517
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,420
No.


518
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,460
Here, let’s go inside.


519
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,460
Mom.


520
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,900
I brought someone home.


521
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,780
Mrs. Jiang.


522
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,060
You are…


523
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,820
Mom.


524
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,020
He’s Yuan Shuai! Don’t you remember?


525
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,100
He’ll stay with us during the holiday.


526
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,860
Mrs. Jiang, I’m Yuan Shuai!


527
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,700
You mean you are Mr. Yuan’s son?


528
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,620
Oh my!


529
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,860
You’ve grown up into a fine young man!


530
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,420
Come on! Come inside!


531
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,820
-Here. Let’s go home!
-Okay.


532
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,860
Somebody just said that my mom


533
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,300
would like him very much.


534
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:18,980
Embarrassed?


535
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,660
It actually shows that your mom is not


536
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,860
a superficial person
who’s only into appearance.


537
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,980
You can’t get both ways!


538
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,980
There’s nothing wrong to be handsome!


539
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,620
Mrs. Jiang,


540
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,740
look.


541
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,260
I bought these especially for you.


542
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,340
Hope…


543
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,220
Hope you’ll like them.


544
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,300
Thank you so much!


545
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,700
I feel so happy already


546
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,900
that you are here to see me.


547
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,420
You didn’t have to spend money


548
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,180
and buy me a gift.


549
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,380
It’s my pleasure!


550
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,020
Thank you, Yuanyuan.


551
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:50,860
You are welcome.


552
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,300
I haven’t seen you


553
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,060
for so many years


554
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,620
since your family moved.


555
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,220
And now,


556
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,540
you’ve become a handsome young man.


557
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,620
Mrs. Jiang,


558
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,900
you haven’t changed at all.


559
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,140
It’s been so many years,


560
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,940
but you are still as beautiful


561
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,300
and elegant as before!


562
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,060
You just look like


563
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,260
Jiang Jun’s elder sister!


564
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,420
You flattered me, Yuanyuan.


565
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,740
I’m old already.


566
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,900
No, you aren’t!


567
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,700
Jun,


568
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,060
how did you guys meet in Shanghai?


569
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,140
Did you say you were with a colleague


570
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,020
when you called?


571
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,100
Colleague?


572
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,900
Mrs. Jiang,


573
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,620
I am the colleague.


574
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,620
Here’s the thing.


575
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,020
One day,


576
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,780
Jiang Jun came to my company for an interview.


577
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,580
That’s how


578
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,500
we became co-workers.


579
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,180
Yes.


580
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,980
He’s actually my boss.


581
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,980
I thought you didn’t know that!


582
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,180
Really?


583
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,460
Yuanyuan, you are already a boss
at such a young age!


584
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
How outstanding!


585
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,980
You are young and capable!


586
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,860
You know what?


587
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,300
When you were little,


588
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,220
I always said to Jun’s father


589
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,740
that Yuanyuan would have


590
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,300
a promising future.


591
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,140
See?


592
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,420
I was right!


593
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,820
Yuanyuan, thank you.


594
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,820
I feel so relieved


595
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,620
that Jun has you in Shanghai.


596
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,380
It’s just that Jun’s father…


597
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,460
Mom! Mom.


598
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,620
Would you please cook something for us?


599
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,420
We haven’t eaten anything since last night.


600
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,100
We are starving!


601
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,660
Sure! Sure!


602
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,060
It’s New Year’s Day today,


603
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,140
and Yuanyuan is here.


604
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,300
I’ll cook a few more dishes.


605
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,020
You two take a rest first.


606
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:32,980
I’ll go to the grocery store.


607
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:33,900
I’ll be back soon.


608
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,380
Mrs. Jiang,


609
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,140
let me go with you.


610
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,220
No need.


611
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,660
Just take a rest at home.


612
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,740
I’ll be right back.


613
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,780
It’s okay! Let’s go!


614
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:42,740
Alright.


615
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,820
Then…

00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,580

we got so many ingredients.

00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,660

-Cuiping, Shujuan.
-Happy New Year!

Who’s this young man?

00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,500
How handsome!


631
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,660
He is!


632
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,100
He’s like a super star!


633
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,380
Isn’t he Jun’s boyfriend?


634
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,900
No.


635

Good! That’s good!


636

Let me introduce.


639
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,020
He’s the son of one of my old neighbors.


640
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:14,980
His name is Yuanyuan.

Yuanyuan!


642
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,180
They are Cuiping and Shujuan.


643
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,620
We play mahjong together.


644

The coat you are wearing is really pretty.


648
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,700
You look quite elegant in it.


649
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,620
And it makes your skin look very fair!


650
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,820
Aunt Cuiping,


651
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,580
your hairstyle


652
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,340
is very popular this year.


653
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,740
It goes very well with your light makeup.


654
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,900

when you are free.


663
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,220
Sure.


664
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,300
My daughter…


665
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,260
I also have a daughter!


666
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,100
Shujuan, Cuiping,


667
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,820
we need to go home and cook.


668
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,740
Let’s chat another time.


669
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,860
Let’s play mahjong then.


670
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,620
Yuanyuan, let’s go.


671
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,500
Okay! Okay!


672
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,420
Let’s play mahjong!


673
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,180
Let’s! It’s a deal!


674
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:05,740
Remember to visit me!


675
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,540
I have to go now.


676
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,380
Bye!


677
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,420
Bye! Bye!


678
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,260
Yuanyuan.


679
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,580
You and Jun are not…


680
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,020
What’s wrong, Mrs. Jiang?


681
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,060
Nothing!


682
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,340
Let’s go.


683
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,340
Okay.


684
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,740
Love Is Sweet
