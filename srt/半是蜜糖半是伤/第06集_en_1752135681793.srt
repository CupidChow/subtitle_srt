00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hey, come here.

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You haven't answered my question yet. Why are you reading my book?

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Of course, it's for the salary your father paid me.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I can imagine that the man would never agree to your pursuit.

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Rather than seeing you crying and laughing after being rejected by him,

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'd rather just put your fantasy in the swing.

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Alright.

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Now, you've received my apology.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
From now on, I won't be soft-hearted at work.

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Who needs soft-heartedness?

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I have a very good teacher who's been working with me.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm not afraid of anything you do.

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
A teacher?

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes, a young and promising teacher who's been born into the industry.

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're born into the industry and you're a master.

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You won't be able to help people like you.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Those who are free to help others are all useless.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Not everyone is as smart as you.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're a very tall and tall person. Can't you just be normal?

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You're not eating?

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not eating.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No, you...

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're wasting food.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wait for me!

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Wait for me!

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
She's angry again.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So annoying.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What's wrong?

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't know.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I think that pot is quite nice.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Buy one.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why do you have to spend money on this free activity?

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Will you participate in this activity for just one pot?

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Of course.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't you think white suits me?

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,560
Do you think white suits me?

39
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,640
Low-key, luxurious,

40
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,560
with a sense of content, and high-class.

41
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,400
I don't think so.

42
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,840
If you like it, I'll buy it for you.

43
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,160
Didn't you ask me

44
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,040
what I was doing in the second half of the Thanksgiving party?

45
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,120
I'm going to the bathroom.

46
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,160
Hello, welcome.

47
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,600
Are you here to attend the memory activity?

48
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,560
Yes.

49
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,480
Here's the thing.

50
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
According to our activity rules,

51
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,920
I might have to verify with you two.

52
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,640
Are you a couple?

53
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,600
No.

54
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,800
Yes.

55
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,560
That's good.

56
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,760
This way, please.

57
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,200
Here's your water.

58
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,080
Take your time.

59
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,000
Thank you.

60
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,200
You were much taller than us back then.

61
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
We weren't that tall back then.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,120
You're not in conflict with the women of the past.

63
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,960
Understand?

64
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,200
Do a pose.

65
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,280
It's so old-fashioned.

66
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,160
What are you doing?

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,520
You're so childish.

68
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,960
You're still trying to take a photo.

69
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,680
I'm not afraid.

70
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
It looks so good.

71
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,080
You're posing so old-fashioned.

72
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,160
I'm not happy to help you.

73
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,840
Here.

74
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,440
It looks so good.

75
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,040
I'm dying.

76
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,280
Here.

77
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,240
You're done?

78
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,000
Sir, I'm sorry.

79
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,360
Your big headband

80
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,080
might not meet our requirements.

81
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,160
Why?

82
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,480
Here's the thing.

83
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,320
We're talking about a couple.

84
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,920
So I hope you can show

85
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,360
the relationship between the two.

86
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,560
But look.

87
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,000
It looks too intimate.

88
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,960
This...

89
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,120
How about this?

90
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,360
Take another group.

91
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,800
Look.

92
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,840
This, this, and this.

93
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,480
These poses are all good.

94
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,320
Forget it. Let's go.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,560
Come here.

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,600
Did you see that?

97
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,600
No, I saw something.

98
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,640
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,520
I'll do it again.

100
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,520
I refuse.

101
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,680
This is your order.

102
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,000
You're in the KPL.

103
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,480
You're scared?

104
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,360
I am.

105
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm scared.

106
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,040
Let's take a photo.

107
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,600
Make a heart.

108
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,520
You're so good-looking.

109
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,480
You know this?

110
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,040
You're too vulgar.

111
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,360
You don't have any tacit understanding.

112
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,560
One more time.

113
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,480
You have some tacit understanding?

114
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,920
You did it on purpose, right?

115
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,400
You did it on purpose, right?

116
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,080
Stop taking photos.

117
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,120
The sweet potato is not sweet.

118
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,760
It means you and this king have no fate.

119
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,400
Let's go.

120
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,480
Come back.

121
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,560
Come back.

122
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,160
Sir.

123
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,720
The maintenance fee and the machine fee,

124
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
total is 23,700 yuan.

125
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,640
Please keep it.

126
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,400
Okay.

127
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,840
Miss, your photo.

128
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,120
Thank you.

129
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,320
You want to take my photo?

130
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,880
I'm the one who's going to participate in this event.

131
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,120
This photo is mine.

132
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
It has nothing to do with you.

133
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,040
This is your gift.

134
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,720
Keep it.

135
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,360
Give it to her.

136
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,080
Take it.

137
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,880
No.

138
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:52,880
Give it to her.

139
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,800
She's going to participate in it.

140
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,160
This pot is useful to you.

141
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,880
Take it.

142
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,920
I...

143
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,160
Thank you.

144
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,360
Thank you.

145
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,000
Miss Jiang.

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,880
I feel your sincerity today.

147
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,200
Let's go home.

148
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,080
This way.

149
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,760
I know.

150
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,240
This way.

151
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,240
Mr. Tian.

152
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,600
I can't finish my words today.

153
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,080
Wang San.

154
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,960
Go away.

155
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,840
Go away.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,440
You...

157
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,480
Don't be so naughty.

158
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,560
Go away.

159
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,320
If you...

160
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,000
If you destroy the photo,

161
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,640
I'll take your claws off.

162
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,800
Understand?

163
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,120
I don't want to take photos.

164
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,560
I don't want to take photos.

165
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,520
Come back.

166
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,080
You failed the exam and didn't get into the first place.

167
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,720
Do you have to be so depressed?

168
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,360
You have such a psychological ability.

169
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,400
I'm telling you.

170
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,960
You'll be attacked by the iron fist of society.

171
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,600
Come on.

172
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,920
I'll count to three.

173
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,960
One, two, three.

174
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,920
One, two, three.

175
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,880
One, two, three.

176
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,000
One, two, three.

177
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,120
One, two, three.

178
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,160
One, two, three.

179
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,240
One, two, three.

180
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
One, two, three.

181
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,440
Smile together.

182
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,720
Three, two, one.

183
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,400
Look at you.

184
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,080
You're smiling like a bitter gourd.

185
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,080
Smile again.

186
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,320
I'm not smiling.

187
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,600
Come back.

188
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,720
Come back.

189
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,120
Come on.

190
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,640
One, two, three.

191
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,000
You...

192
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,440
Delete it.

193
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,680
You can't delete it.

194
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,360
Delete it.

195
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,040
You can't delete it.

196
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,760
Delete it.

197
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,480
You can't delete it.

198
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,360
Delete it.

199
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,840
What are you doing?

200
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
Get out.

201
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
Boss, save me.

202
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,200
Mr. Su.

203
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,600
Mr. Su.

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,800
This glass of wine

205
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,000
is really grateful

206
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,160
for what happened last time.

207
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,240
I'll drink it first.

208
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,200
I'll drink it first.

209
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,880
Come on, Mr. Su.

210
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,640
Come on.

211
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,280
I'll drink it too.

212
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,920
Come on.

213
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,000
How about we drink it

214
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,840
on behalf of the company?

215
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,880
Come on.

216
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,480
Okay, okay.

217
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,280
Come on.

218
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,040
Come on.

219
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,120
Mr. Su.

220
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,240
Wait, wait, wait.

221
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,360
Mr. Yuan.

222
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,200
Mr. Yuan.

223
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,440
Mr. Yuan is back.

224
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,560
Boss, I can't take it anymore.

225
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,480
Wanhua is so kind.

226
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,440
Mr. Yuan,

227
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,200
I'm telling you,

228
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,000
you're really late.

229
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,600
Today,

230
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,560
you have to drink this wine

231
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,120
no matter what.

232
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,400
Yes, drink it.

233
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,520
One glass of wine is not enough.

234
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,120
One glass of wine

235
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,720
shows our friendship.

236
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,280
Right?

237
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,720
Come on.

238
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,360
Drink this.

239
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,360
I'll drink it myself.

240
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:38,880
Okay?

241
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,160
Okay.

242
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,920
Come on, come on.

243
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,920
Drink it.

244
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,600
Come on, come on.

245
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,360
I'll drink it too.

246
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,000
Come on.

247
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,640
Come on.

248
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,760
Mr. Su.

249
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,360
Mr. Yuan.

250
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,080
Come on.

251
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,800
Come on, drink it.

252
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,440
Come on, drink it.

253
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,120
I'll buy it.

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,800
Thank you.

255
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,640
I haven't drunk it all day.

256
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,760
Come on.

257
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,360
Be careful.

258
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,720
Boss,

259
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,960
you're really a drunkard.

260
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,920
You've beaten all the people in Wanhua.

261
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
If you don't come today,

262
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,800
I'll be the one who's beaten.

263
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,920
Boss,

264
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,400
do you have any worries?

265
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,440
I'm happy.

266
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,760
Did you quarrel with that

267
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,040
thousand-year-old iron tree

268
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,880
and that thousand-year-old iron flower?

269
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,440
Come on, come on.

270
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,480
Iron flower is out.

271
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,120
Mving breathless.

272
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,440
She has a teacher.

273
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,080
She told me that

274
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,560
a teacher seems to

275
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,080
make her wish very often.

276
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,840
Teacher!

277
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,280
You're a big shot. Who are you trying to find out?

278
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,480
Zuo You is just a swindler who can't get along with others.

279
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,760
He's not interested.

280
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,840
You don't want me to help you?

281
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,840
No need.

282
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,560
I just want to see

283
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,960
how long this swindler can fool him.

284
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,720
You're not right.

285
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,640
You two are living together,

286
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,080
and you're his boss.

287
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,600
But you're the one who claimed to drive him out of MH.

288
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,600
You're a natural enemy to him.

289
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,680
I want to drive him out

290
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,280
because I think he's not fit for this job.

291
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,400
But

292
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,960
this is also a guess

293
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,560
based on my previous impression of him.

294
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,200
It seems that you've changed your mind.

295
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,360
After these few times with him,

296
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,640
I think

297
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,120
this Ren He Shi

298
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,120
is still changing.

299
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,400
I think it's necessary

300
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,200
to get to know him again.

301
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,440
I was jealous that day.

302
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,080
It seems that jealousy makes you rational.

303
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Not bad.

304
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,640
But don't you think it's a bit late to change now?

305
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,320
That mysterious teacher is giving you warmth and affection every day.

306
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,000
But you drive him out.

307
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,360
Be careful that your iron flower

308
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,040
will fall on someone else's tree one day.

309
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,720
You have too much attitude towards this iron flower.

310
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,280
You should be more like a boss.

311
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,040
You should be more like a boss.

312
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,800
It seems that women are hard to understand.

313
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,400
But it's easy to understand.

314
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,080
There are only two points.

315
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,800
One is that they can't resist cute things.

316
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,960
The other is that they can easily sympathize with men.

317
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,560
I have no resistance to cute things.

318
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,760
I sympathize with men.

319
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,280
Wang Cai, come here.

320
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,200
Come here, Wang Cai.

321
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,920
You need to keep ice for a thousand days.

322
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,520
It's your turn.

323
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
Show your best.

324
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Come on.

325
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,440
Why are you here?

326
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,240
Are you in a relationship?

327
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,160
Come on.

328
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,960
I'll send you to your dad.

329
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,200
It stinks.

330
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,600
Wiring

331
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:37,260
今日は

332
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,280
Once you've finished singing,

333
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,840
come and slice some slices for me if you want.

334
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,120
Am hasn't gotten tired of some singing

335
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,120
of the dancing hatred won't solve it.

336
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,320
This way.

337
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,060
I'm so so sick of you.

338
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,060
I'm fine.

339
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,060
I think I got a cold last night.

340
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,060
Why don't you go to the hospital if you're sick?

341
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,060
It's so high.

342
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,060
I'll take you to the hospital.

343
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,060
I'm not going to the hospital.

344
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,060
I'll just take a break.

345
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,060
Okay, have a good rest.

346
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,060
I'm leaving.

347
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,060
I'm so cold.

348
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,060
Are you sure you don't want me to take you to the hospital?

349
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,060
I want some water.

350
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,060
Thank you.

351
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,060
I'm leaving.

352
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,060
What's wrong with you again?

353
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,060
I'm hungry.

354
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,060
What do you want to eat?

355
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
There's some in the fridge.

356
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,060
Where's your fridge?

357
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,060
You're usually so busy with work.

358
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,060
There's probably nothing in the fridge.

359
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,060
Where's the mirror?

360
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,060
What do you want to eat?

361
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,060
I want to eat something simple.

362
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,060
I want to eat braised pork with meat.

363
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,060
I want to eat sweet and sour pork with chicken.

364
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,060
I want to eat beef with potatoes.

365
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,060
That's about it.

366
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,060
I want to eat three dishes.

367
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,060
I want to eat vegetarian food.

368
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,060
I want to eat a third dish.

369
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,060
Didn't you bring a pot back yesterday?

370
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,060
I want you to make me a...

371
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,060
Braised pork with chicken.

372
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,060
That's about it.

373
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,060
You don't look like a sick person at all.

374
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,060
Since you have such a good appetite, why don't you...

375
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,060
I feel so bad.

376
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,060
It's so cold and hungry in the winter.

377
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,060
No one is taking care of me.

378
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,060
How can you be so pitiful?

379
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,060
It's 39 degrees.

380
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,060
I'm so sorry.

381
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,060
It's been 39 degrees.

382
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
Are you done?

383
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,060
I'm almost done.

384
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,060
I'm hungry.

385
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,060
Drink it.

386
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,060
What are you looking at?

387
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,060
Who eats such greasy food?

388
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,060
It's the first time I've ever been so hungry.

389
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,060
Why don't you order take-out?

390
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,060
Come back.

391
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,060
The patient's limbs are weak and weak.

392
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,060
She needs a stomach.

393
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,060
I...

394
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,060
I'll sign it.

395
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,060
Ah.

396
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,060
Is it hot?

397
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,060
It's a bit bland.

398
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,060
You can't eat anything that's bland.

399
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,060
Ah.

400
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,060
Your sofa is comfortable.

401
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,060
Is it heated?

402
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,060
It's imported from Germany.

403
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,060
I just bought it last week.

404
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,060
Is it comfortable?

405
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,060
It's comfortable.

406
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,060
It's so nice to have money.

407
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,060
Are you free today?

408
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,060
I'll teach you a special method to relieve stress.

409
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,060
I'm afraid not today.

410
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
Can you do it tomorrow?

411
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,060
Okay.

412
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,060
See you tomorrow.

413
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,060
Can't you take care of the patient?

414
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,060
You should focus on the patient.

415
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,060
Do you understand?

416
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,060
Please eat quickly.

417
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,060
I have something to do later.

418
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,060
I'll put the rest of the porridge in the pot to keep warm.

419
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,060
Remember to eat it tonight.

420
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
You eat it yourself.

421
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,060
I'll make you some medicine.

422
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,060
Hey.

423
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
I want to read.

424
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Help me get a book.

425
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,060
You have so much to read.

426
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,060
Which one?

427
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,060
The second row, left book.

428
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,060
This one?

429
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,060
No.

430
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,060
The third row, left book.

431
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,060
This one?

432
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,060
No.

433
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,060
It should be the second row, left book.

434
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,060
No, the second row, right book.

435
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
You said you would die.

436
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
This one?

437
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
The Forest of Norway.

438
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,060
That's it.

439
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,060
I didn't expect Mr. Yuan's busy life

440
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,060
to have other colors than the ancient red.

441
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,060
This book is famous

442
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,060
because it has a lot of charm.

443
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,060
But you can't feel its charm.

444
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,060
After all, only the Buddha in your heart can see and receive the Buddha.

445
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,060
Mr. Yuan is like this, scolding people without having a son.

446
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,060
Yes, only the smart can feel its charm.

447
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,060
You can read it slowly. I'll go first.

448
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,060
I didn't expect you can be so good at

449
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,060
this kind of world famous book.

450
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,060
It seems that you still have the root of the sense of touch culture.

451
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
Be careful of your self-conceit.

452
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,060
It will harm you sooner or later.

453
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,060
Thank you for reminding me, Mr. Yuan.

454
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,060
I will try to open up the new book.

455
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,060
Hey, why can't you start from today?

456
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,060
This is the reason why you can never become that 20%.

457
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,060
Do you understand?

458
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,060
You really think I haven't read this book?

459
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,060
Okay, let me ask you.

460
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,060
On his 20th birthday,

461
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,060
he cried and cried to stay with her.

462
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,060
He didn't cry.

463
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,060
He wanted to love her.

464
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,060
But he couldn't let go of the past.

465
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,060
So he fell into the pain.

466
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,060
They should be each other's future.

467
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,060
He cried all night that night.

468
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,060
What do you mean by that?

469
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,060
It's because Du Bian was comforting him.

470
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Are you doubting my memory?

471
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,060
I'm holding my nephew's body with my left hand.

472
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,060
I'm touching his hair with my right hand.

473
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,060
He's waiting for his nephew to stop crying.

474
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,060
But he kept crying.

475
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,060
I slept with him that night.

476
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,060
I don't know if I did the right thing.

477
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,060
Even if he doesn't know about today,

478
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,060
he probably won't know about it.

479
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,060
But I had to do it.

480
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:50,060
He was so emotional that he wanted to be comforted.

481
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,060
I was...

482
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,060
And then?

483
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,060
It's dawn.

484
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,060
It's not dawn, right?

485
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,060
There should be more content in the place you just went through.

486
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,060
Are you sure you want to continue listening?

487
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,060
Of course I want to listen.

488
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,060
I don't want to talk about half of the story.

489
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,060
What?

490
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,060
You don't recognize the words behind it?

491
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,060
Okay, I'll read it.

492
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,060
You listen.

493
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,060
I turned off the light in my room.

494
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,060
I slowly and gently took off his clothes.

495
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,060
I took them off and hugged him.

496
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,060
It was a gentle rain night.

497
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,060
We were in a warm place.

498
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,060
We didn't feel cold.

499
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,060
I and my nephew were in the dark.

500
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,060
We were touching each other in silence.

501
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,060
I kissed his lips.

502
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,060
I put my lips in the dark.

503
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,060
Stop reading.

504
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,060
What a bad story.

505
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,060
I'm sick.

506
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,060
You go back.

507
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,060
I'm going to rest.

508
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,060
Okay, then.

509
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,060
Take a good rest.

510
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,060
Take care of yourself.

511
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,060
Don't work too hard.

512
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,060
Remember to eat on time.

513
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,060
I'm leaving.

514
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,060
Bye-bye, little cutie.

515
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,060
I'll be back.

516
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,060
Wang Cai.

517
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,060
Wang Cai, come here.

518
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,060
Is she a stupid woman?

519
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,060
To somewhere

520
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,060
Love don't exist

521
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,060
Everyone has their own forest.

522
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,060
You're in my heart

523
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,060
Maybe we never promised.

524
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,060
Steal my soul

525
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,060
But she's always there.

526
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,060
Always

527
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,060
Always

528
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,060
Always

529
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,060
The lost person is lost.

530
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,060
The one who meets will meet again.

531
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,060
Tell me

532
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,060
How we live with

533
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
Today, I finally met

534
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,060
the essence of a woman.

535
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,060
It seems that this is the exit.

536
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,060
Oh my god.

537
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,060
It's really 360 degrees.

538
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,060
And so talented.

539
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,060
The first day I couldn't get out of bed, I missed her.

540
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,060
Hello, welcome.

541
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,060
Why are you here again?

542
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,060
I've already paid you so many sanitary pads.

543
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,060
You look so talented.

544
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,060
You can't talk about Wu Yan Na like this.

545
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,060
Don't worry.

546
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,060
I'll pay for it myself today.

547
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,060
I actually want to trouble you.

548
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,060
Do you know my Wang Cai?

549
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,060
Yes.

550
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,060
His ball is left on your balcony.

551
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,060
I think he's in a hurry today.

552
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,060
If you have time, help me get it.

553
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,060
I can't.

554
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,060
It's okay.

555
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,060
You can ask your general to bring it.

556
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,060
Not even the general.

557
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,060
He's with Mr. Du now.

558
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,060
I don't think he'll come back.

559
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,060
Mr. Du?

560
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,060
Yes.

561
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,060
I have a very good teacher now.

562
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,060
He's doing my homework.

563
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,060
I don't care what you do.

564
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,060
Teacher?

565
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,060
One is also born in the first line.

566
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,060
Young and promising.

567
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,060
A teacher who can prevent many things.

568
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,060
I'm not a teacher.

569
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,060
I think Jun is really lucky.

570
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,060
He just entered the industry.

571
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,060
He met a handsome and elegant

572
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,060
senior to help him.

573
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,060
Handsome and elegant.

574
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,060
Handsome and elegant.

575
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,060
Senior in the industry.

576
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,060
Uncertain.

577
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,060
Handsome and elegant.

578
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,060
It has nothing to do with you.

579
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,060
It's really the position of the person in the first line.

580
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,060
The sun is on him.

581
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,060
The angle is just right.

582
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,060
One more point is a little dazzling.

583
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,060
One less point is a little dim.

584
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,060
The first two lines.

585
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,060
Excuse me.

586
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,060
Do you want to eat this?

587
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,060
I worked here for five hours.

588
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,060
During this period, you gave me three times milk tea and two times food.

589
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,060
Although I have no split,

590
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,060
it will inevitably reduce my work efficiency.

591
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,060
So little.

592
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,060
See you next time.

593
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,060
That...

594
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,060
That...

595
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,060
That...

596
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,060
I want to say thank you for helping me catch

597
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,060
the thief.

598
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,060
And I want to add your WeChat.

599
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,060
I don't know if it's okay.

600
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,060
And

601
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,060
what do you do?

602
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,060
I do this.

603
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,060
I know.

604
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,060
This is an electronic photo album.

605
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,060
I made a photo website.

606
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,060
My ultimate goal is to use big data

607
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,060
to make a one-off photo.

608
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,060
But what you see now

609
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,060
are all some more original things.

610
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,060
So there are a lot of things to adjust.

611
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,060
There are so many single men and women at the moment.

612
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,060
I think this idea is very marketable.

613
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,060
Do you really think so?

614
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,060
Come.

615
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,060
I'll treat you to dinner.

616
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,060
Do me a favor.

617
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,060
Okay.

618
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,060
Pi Xiaochun?

619
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,060
You just said that I should help you.

620
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,060
Let's contact each other on WeChat.

621
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,060
Okay.

622
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,060
I'm sorry.

623
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,060
I'm sorry.

624
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,060
I'm sorry.

625
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,060
I'm sorry.

626
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,060
I thought I found the wrong place.

627
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,060
I didn't expect it to be here.

628
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,060
Thank you.

629
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,060
Are we going to eat here today?

630
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,060
The chef of this restaurant is very good.

631
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,060
He is very good at cooking.

632
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,060
Please enjoy.

633
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,060
Thank you.

634
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,060
I invented this dessert recipe.

635
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,060
Try it.

636
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,060
Really?

637
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,060
It's refreshing and delicious.

638
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,060
It's good that you like it.

639
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,060
Why is this cake so fragrant?

640
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,060
Do you want to know why?

641
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,060
I'll take you to a place after dinner.

642
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,060
You're still mysterious.

643
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,060
What is this place?

644
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,060
It's a fragrance room.

645
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,060
Fragrance can relax people.

646
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,060
I think you must be under a lot of pressure.

647
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,060
So I brought you here to relax.

648
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,060
So many bottles.

649
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,060
It's used to make fragrance.

650
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,060
Can I make fragrance with it?

651
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,060
Of course.

652
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,060
Alcohol can keep the fragrance well.

653
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:35,060
The essence of the wine mixed with the plants and frozen plants

654
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,060
will keep the fragrance.

655
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,060
Give me your hand.

656
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,060
It smells so special.

657
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,060
Fragrance shouldn't be used only to convey the sense of desire.

658
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,060
In this perfume, I mixed my favorite lily,

659
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,060
dried phoenix,

660
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,060
and the most popular Guifu wine.

661
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,060
It smells clear, pure, and kind.

662
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,060
I mixed it according to your first impression.

663
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,060
Okay.

664
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,060
Give it to me.

665
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,060
Someone made this for me.

666
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,060
I'm sorry.

667
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,060
I didn't know you were so good at making it.

668
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,060
Have some water.

669
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,060
It's from the teacher.

670
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,060
Thank you.

671
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,060
Is the case solved?

672
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,060
Thanks to the teacher's guidance, it's solved.

673
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,060
That's good.

674
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
Sit.

675
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,060
You can try it too.

676
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
Just make it.

677
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,060
Maybe there will be an accident.

678
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,060
I'm sorry.

679
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,060
Good.

680
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,060
A dating man is getting better.

681
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,060
Let's go back.

682
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,060
Let's go.

683
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,060
Let's go.

684
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,060
What's wrong, Wang Cai?

685
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,060
Can't walk anymore?

686
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,060
Thank you.

687
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,060
Good for you, General.

688
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
You didn't go back to your dormitory.

689
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,060
You're so jealous.

690
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,060
How is it?

691
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,060
Is the perfume you gave me actually good?

692
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,060
It smells like lily.

693
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,060
Then call it lily.

694
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,060
Lily?

695
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,060
It's very pretty.

696
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,060
Thank you so much for today, Mr. Du.

697
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,060
This perfume class was really great.

698
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,060
I finally experienced a life of a delicate girl.

699
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,060
If you like it,

700
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,060
you can try it in the future.

701
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,060
You can try it in the future.

702
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,060
After all, perfume can relieve one's mood.

703
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,060
It's really very relaxing.

704
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,060
You really know how to be quiet.

705
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,060
Actually, relaxing is good for racing.

706
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,060
Racing?

707
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,060
This is not like your style.

708
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,060
You can't only look at one side.

709
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,060
Especially, you have to experience it alone.

710
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,060
I like the relaxing method

711
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,060
that takes time and makes you feel comfortable.

712
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,060
I guess you don't like it either.

713
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,060
Okay, as you like.

714
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,060
See you tomorrow.

715
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,060
Thank you.

716
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,060
By the way, Mr. Du,

717
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,060
I hope you like Li Qingqing's perfume.

718
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,060
I have to help her get her makeup done again.

719
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,060
Is this the mysterious teacher you mentioned?

720
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,060
Do you know each other?

721
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,060
No.

722
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,060
But

723
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,060
I still have a friend.

724
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,060
I'm not sure if she's my friend.

725
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,060
I still have to thank you for teaching my employees.

726
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,060
You're welcome.

727
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,060
I'm so happy for you.

728
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,060
Thank you.

729
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,060
Tian Jun, thank you for your gift.

730
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,060
I like it.

731
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,060
When did you learn to use such a despicable method

732
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,060
to make your first choice?

733
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,060
What do you mean?

734
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,060
I don't understand.

735
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,060
I'm poor at work.

736
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,060
I just want to rely on the newbies

737
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,060
who are competing with me.

738
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,060
Do you think you can win back the favor?

739
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,060
You're too naive.

740
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,060
Han Shuan, don't say that.

741
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,060
It's okay.

742
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,060
Mr. Han, there might be some misunderstanding.

743
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,060
I'm warning you.

744
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,060
Don't make any bad decisions.

745
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,060
Otherwise,

746
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,060
I'll make you look even worse.

747
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,060
What do you mean?

748
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,060
I'm sorry.

749
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,060
I'm sorry.

750
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,060
I'm sorry.

751
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,060
I'm sorry.

752
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,060
I'm sorry.

753
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,060
I'm sorry.
